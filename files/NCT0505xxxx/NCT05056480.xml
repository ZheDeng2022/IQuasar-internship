  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study team will conduct a mixed methods evaluation of the implementation of an&#xD;
      evidence-based clinical program -- the Pediatric Complex Care Integration (PCCI) program -&#xD;
      for improvement of care integration for children and youth with special healthcare needs&#xD;
      (CYSHCN) and children with medical complexity (CMC). The PCCI program is not a discrete&#xD;
      intervention itself; rather it is a health system-initiated program that will be implemented&#xD;
      as a new standard of care for eligible patients with the intention of improving quality of&#xD;
      care, implemented by clinical teams within Duke Health.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in care fragmentation, as measured by the Pediatric Integrated Care Survey (PICS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PICS is a 20-item survey that gathers parents perspectives on the degree of care integration received by their child using a 6-level Likert scale (1=never; 6=always).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in child health-related quality of life (HR-QOL), as measured by the PROMIS (7+2) Parent Proxy Global Health Survey</measure>

    <description>The PROMIS (7+2) Pediatric Global Health Survey is a 9-item parent-reported survey that gathers parent perspectives on their child's overall HR-QOL. Four of the 9 survey items use a 5-level Likert scale with 1=poor and 5=excellent; three of the 9 survey items use a 5-level Likert scale with 1=never and 5=always; and three of the 9 survey items use a 5-level Likert scale with 1=never and 5=almost always.</description>

    <description>The PROMIS Global Health Survey is a 10-item parent-reported survey that gathers parent perspectives on their own overall HR-QOL. Six of the 9 survey items use a 5-level Likert scale with 1=poor and 5=excellent; one of the 9 survey items uses a 5-level Likert scale with 1=not at all and 5=completely; one of the 9 survey items uses a 5-level Likert scale with 1=never and 5=always; one of the 9 survey items uses a 5-level Likert scale with 1=none and 5=very severe; and one of the 9 survey items uses a 0-10 scale (0=no pain; 10=worst pain imaginable).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in well-being, as measured by the Well-Being Index (WBI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Well-Being Index is a 9-time clinical provider/staff-reported measure that gathers staff perceptions of their overall well-being at work. Seven of the 9 survey items use a dichotomous response (Yes/No) and two remaining items use 7-level Likert scale (1=very strongly disagree; 7=very strongly agree).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in caregiver self-management, as measured by the Parent-Patient Activation Measure (P-PAM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Parent-Patient Activation Measure (P-PAM) is a 13-item parent-reported survey that uses a 4-level Likert scale (1=disagree strongly; 4=agree strongly).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in perceptions of barriers to care, as measured by the Barriers to Care Questionnaire (BCQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 19-item Barriers to Care Questionnaire (BCQ) gathers parent perspectives on barriers encountered when trying to get health care for their child. The BCQ uses a 5-level Likert scale (0=never; 4=almost always).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in perceptions of cultural distance, as measured by the Cultural Distance Scale (CDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 4-item Cultural Distance Scale (CDS) is a parent-reported survey that uses a 6-level Likert scale (1=very similar; 6=very different).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in caregiver self-efficacy, as measured by the New Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale (NGSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 8-item New Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale is a parent-reported survey uses a 5-level Likert scale (1=strongly disagree; 5=strongly agree).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in perceptions of shared decision-making, as measured by the a sub-scale from the Interpersonal Processes of Care survey</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This 4-item sub-scale from the Interpersonal Processes of Care survey focuses on perceptions of shared-decision making. Parents respond to questions on a 5-level Likert scale (1=never; 5=always).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility, as measured by clinical staff survey</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
