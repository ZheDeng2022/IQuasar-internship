      This clinical trial studies the effect of four different intervention components &quot;tools&quot; on&#xD;
      body weight, nutrition, and physical activity in colorectal cancer survivors. Studies&#xD;
      indicate that people with colorectal cancer whose nutrition and physical activity habits are&#xD;
      consistent with the American Cancer Society's Nutrition and Physical Activity Guidelines may&#xD;
      have longer disease-free survival. The four different intervention components may help&#xD;
      patients with colon or rectal cancer adopt recommended health behaviors after they have&#xD;
      completed treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effect of four candidate intervention components (text messaging, digital&#xD;
      health tool kit, health coaching, or support person training), and combinations of the four&#xD;
      intervention components, on change in colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors' American Cancer&#xD;
      Society (ACS) guideline score after 48 weeks of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effect of four candidate intervention components (text messaging, digital&#xD;
      health tool kit, health coaching, or support person training), and combinations of the four&#xD;
      intervention components, on CRC survivors' American Cancer Society (ACS) guideline score&#xD;
      after 24 weeks of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the effect of four candidate intervention components, and combinations of&#xD;
      the four intervention components, on CRC survivors' intake of fruits and vegetables, whole&#xD;
      grains, refined grains, red meat, and processed meats; moderate-to-vigorous physical&#xD;
      activity; and body mass index (BMI) after 48 weeks of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effect of four candidate intervention components (text messaging, digital&#xD;
      health tool kit, health coaching, or support person coaching), and combinations of the four&#xD;
      intervention components, on CRC survivors' American Cancer Society (ACS) guideline score&#xD;
      after 12 weeks of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe adherence to each intervention component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore the effects of each of the candidate intervention components (text messaging,&#xD;
      digital health tool kit, health coaching, support person training) on theoretical constructs&#xD;
      (e.g., self-efficacy, outcome expectations, self monitoring, social support) from 0 to 24 and&#xD;
      48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore whether sociodemographic (e.g., gender, age, race/ethnicity), clinical (e.g.,&#xD;
      stage of disease, treatment history, ostomy status, time since diagnosis), and/or&#xD;
      psychological/behavioral (e.g., self-efficacy, social support, outcome expectations,&#xD;
      depression) factors moderate the intervention components' effects on ACS guideline scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To explore change in ACS guideline score in relation to change in fasting insulin,&#xD;
      glucose, homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR), and inflammatory markers (e.g., Interleukin&#xD;
      6 (IL-6), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha&#xD;
      (TNF-alpha) from enrollment to 48 weeks among people with CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To explore change in ACS guideline score in relation to change in fatigue, depression,&#xD;
      and sleep quality from 0 to 24 and 48 weeks among people with CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. To explore changes in the ACS guideline score in relation to change in the gut microbiome&#xD;
      among people with CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;

    <measure>Mean change in American Cancer Society (ACS) guideline score at 48 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ACS Guideline Score is comprised of scores on participant reported food intake (score range from 0-2), physical activity (score range from 0-2), and body mass index (BMI) (score range from 0-2). The total score is calculated by summing the scores on each component with a total score range from 0 to 6. Greater scores indicate a greater level of healthy choices made by the participant. The investigator will assess the independent and interaction effects of the four treatment components on change in ACS score as repeated measures and using a generalized linear mixed effect model, starting with the saturated model, including coefficients for main effects, interactions up to 3-way, and stratification variables (gender and age), and reduce the model via backward variable selection with a 0.05 significance level (alpha(α)=0.05) up to 48 weeks.</description>

    <measure>Mean change in scores on the individual components of the ACS at 24 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ACS Guideline Score is comprised of individual factor scores on (1) participant reported food intake (score range from 0-2), (2) physical activity (score range from 0-2), and (3) body mass index (BMI) (score range from 0-2). Greater scores indicate a greater level of healthy choices made by the participant. The investigator will assess the independent and interaction effects of the four treatment components on change in the individual ACS guideline factors from 0 to 24 weeks using linear mixed-effects models adjusting for the stratification variables gender and age with the individual factor of interest as the outcome.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Undergone curative-intent complete surgical resection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Completed all neoadjuvant and adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation (if&#xD;
             indicated) prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Owns a smart phone that has access to the Internet and can receive daily text messages&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to speak and read English or Spanish&#xD;

             to provide informed consent and support the participant throughout the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  &gt;= 4 weeks since a major surgery to start of intervention (removal of port or catheter&#xD;
             (cath) is not major surgery; reversal of ostomy is major surgery and will require at&#xD;
             least 4 weeks prior to enrollment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Readiness, as determined by the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q). If&#xD;
             there are any indications that home-based exercise might be unsafe based on PAR-Q, the&#xD;
             patient will not be enrolled until confirmation from the patient's provider is&#xD;
             received via email and/or phone that they are safe to exercise. Providers do not need&#xD;
             to be contacted if patients answer 'yes' to 'Is your doctor currently prescribing any&#xD;
             medication for your blood pressure or for a heart condition?&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR SUPPORT PERSONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Identified by a cancer survivor participant who has consented to participate in Tools&#xD;
             To Be Fit as their support person&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;

             the 48 week study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR CANCER SURVIVORS:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  People with potential contraindications to home-based exercise based on the PAR-Q for&#xD;
             whom the investigator is unable to obtain physician clearance&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ACS guideline score of &gt;= 4 out of 6 at enrollment based on self-reported diet, BMI,&#xD;
             and physical activity. Our screening survey will ask participants to report their&#xD;
             height and weight; usual intake of foods in the ACS guidelines (e.g., red and&#xD;
             processed meat, fruits, vegetables, grains); and the Godin Leisure Time Exercise&#xD;
             Survey&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Used a physical activity tracker and a diet tracking app for &gt;= 1 week in the past 3&#xD;
             months; these are components of our digital health tool kit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planned major surgery during the study period (removal of port or cath or&#xD;
             dermatological procedures excluded)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Scheduled to receive any form of further cancer therapy during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent, actively treated other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer, in situ&#xD;
             cervical cancer or localized prostate cancer treated with surveillance only)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe cardiovascular, respiratory or musculoskeletal disease or joint&#xD;
             problems that preclude moderate physical activity. Examples include unstable angina,&#xD;
             recent myocardial infarction, oxygen-dependent pulmonary disease, and osteoarthritis&#xD;
             requiring imminent joint replacement. Moderate arthritis that does not preclude&#xD;
             physical activity is not a reason for ineligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of psychiatric disorders that would preclude participation in the study&#xD;
             intervention (e.g., untreated major depression or psychosis, substance abuse, severe&#xD;
             personality disorder) or prevent the patient from giving informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participating in another weight loss, physical activity or dietary intervention&#xD;
             clinical trial. Co-enrollment in some trials involving pharmacologic therapy is&#xD;
             allowed. Participants are also allowed to pursue weight loss and physical activity&#xD;
             programs on their own, as long as these programs are not provided as part of a&#xD;
             clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently pregnant or trying to become pregnant during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Living outside the United States during screening and/or the 48-week study period&#xD;
