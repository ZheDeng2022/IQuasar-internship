  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the longitudinal test performance of an array of&#xD;
      conventional biomarkers of glycemia, including Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and novel metabolomic&#xD;
      biomarkers for identifying progression of glucose tolerance (normal to prediabetes or&#xD;
      prediabetes to diabetes) in an overweight and obese pediatric cohort.&#xD;

        The study population will consist of normal weight, overweight or obese individuals aged 8&#xD;
        to 17 years at visits #1 and #2, and can be as old as 22 years for follow-up visits #3 and&#xD;
        #4. Participants will be recruited from a variety of sites including University Michigan&#xD;
        clinical sites, non-University of Michigan clinical sites, schools in the local area, and&#xD;
        the University Michigan medical school campus. Participants from Group 2 (visits #3-4)&#xD;
        completed visits #1-2 in 2007-2013 and formally agreed to be re-contacted for study&#xD;
        purposes.&#xD;
