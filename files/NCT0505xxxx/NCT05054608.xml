    <textblock>
      Return to work (not being on sick leave) within one year after intensive care unit (ICU)&#xD;
      admission with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) will be assessed. Risk and risk factors&#xD;
      for not having returned to work will be compared to patients admitted to hospital and general&#xD;
      population controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ICU population comprises all Swedish ICU patients with COVID-19 with at least one year of&#xD;
      follow up. The hospital admitted cohort comprises four hospital admitted patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19 per ICU patient, matched on age, legal gender and region. The general population&#xD;
      controls are matched to the ICU patients in a one to four fashion on age, legal gender and&#xD;
      region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICU patients are identified in the Swedish intensive care registry. The hospital admitted&#xD;
      patients are identified in the national patient registry and the population controls are&#xD;
      identified in the population registry. Data on socioeconomics and income are provided by the&#xD;
      Statistics Sweden. Data on comorbidity, medications and death are provided from the National&#xD;
      board of health and welfare. Finally, data on sick leave are provided from the Swedish Social&#xD;
      Insurance Agency.&#xD;
