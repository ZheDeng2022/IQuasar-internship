    <description>• GI-2 is defined as the toleration of solid food and first bowel movement.&#xD;
Ability to tolerate a solid oral diet is defined as the time from the end of surgery (the time of last skin staple or suture is placed by surgeon) to the time a patient finishes first solid meal that requires chewing and no significant nausea or vomiting for 4 hours after solid meal).&#xD;
First bowel movement is defined as the time from the end of surgery to the first passage of stool.</description>
