  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is an open-label, fixed-sequence, cross-over study conducted at a single Clinical&#xD;
      Unit to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of midazolam in healthy male and female&#xD;
      (non-childbearing potential) subjects when administered alone and in combination with AZD4831&#xD;
      after multiple doses (once daily) of AZD4831 for 10 consecutive days.&#xD;

      The study will consist of 2 treatment periods and will comprise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Screening period of maximum 28 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Period 1 and Treatment Period 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Period 1: Midazolam only (Day 1). Treatment Period 2: AZD4831 only (Days 2 to 10,&#xD;
      once daily dosing) and AZD4831 plus midazolam (Day 11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      - A final Follow-up Visit after the last administration of investigational medicinal product&#xD;
      (IMP) (Day 20 [± 1 day]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be involved in the study for approximately 7 weeks.&#xD;
