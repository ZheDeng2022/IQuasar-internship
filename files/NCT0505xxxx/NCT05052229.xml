  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive lung disease marked by reduced exercise&#xD;
      capacity and activity-related breathlessness (commonly termed dyspnea). Our previous work has&#xD;
      shown that dyspnea during exercise is associated with an increased drive to breathe&#xD;
      (inspiratory neural drive; IND). However, little work has been done to understand the&#xD;
      mechanisms of exertional dyspnea in patients with mild IPF. The objectives of this study are&#xD;
      to compare the acute effects of inhaled nitric oxide to placebo on ventilatory efficiency&#xD;
      (VE/VCO2), and IND at rest and during a standard cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). Twenty&#xD;
      patients with diagnosed IPF with mild (or absent) mechanical restriction and 20 healthy age-&#xD;
      and sex-matched controls will be recruited from a database of volunteers and from the&#xD;
      Interstitial Lung Disease and Respirology clinics at Hotel Dieu Hospital. Participants with&#xD;
      cardiovascular, or any other condition that contributes to dyspnea or abnormal&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary responses to exercise will be excluded. After giving written informed&#xD;
      consent, all participants will complete 7 visits, conducted 2 to 7 days apart. Visit 1&#xD;
      (screening): medical history, pulmonary function testing and a symptom limited incremental&#xD;
      CPET. Visit 2: Standard CT examination conducted at KGH Imaging. Visit 3: assessment of&#xD;
      resting chemoreceptor sensitivity, followed by a symptom limited incremental CPET to&#xD;
      determine peak work rate (Wmax). Visits 4 &amp; 5 (run-in): familiarization to standardized&#xD;
      constant work rate (CWR) CPET to symptom limitation at 75% Wmax. Visits 6 &amp; 7 (Randomized &amp;&#xD;
      Blinded): CWR CPET to symptom limitation while breathing a gas mixture with either 1) 40 ppm&#xD;
      iNO or 2) placebo [medical grade normoxic gas, 21% oxygen]. The proposed work has the&#xD;
      potential to provide important physiological insights into the underlying mechanisms of&#xD;
      heightened dyspnea, as well as examine therapeutic avenues to improve quality of life in&#xD;
      patients with IPF.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrotic interstitial lung disease&#xD;
      characterized by bi-basilar sub-pleural honeycombing, septal thickening, and traction&#xD;
      bronchiectasis. Patients with IPF, even in mild cases, have a reduced exercise capacity which&#xD;
      is strongly associated with exertional breathlessness (dyspnea). Our previous work in IPF has&#xD;
      shown that dyspnea during exercise is associated with increased inspiratory neural drive&#xD;
      (IND) compared with healthy controls. High IND, in turn, is related to a combination of 1)&#xD;
      reduced ventilatory efficiency (i.e. increased ventilation relative to carbon dioxide&#xD;
      production (V̇E/V̇CO2)); 2) abnormal dynamic breathing mechanics (blunted tidal volume (VT)&#xD;
      and critically low inspiratory reserve volume (IRV)), especially in more advanced disease,&#xD;
      and; 3) impaired pulmonary gas-exchange (i.e. diffusion limitation and arterial hypoxemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary work from our laboratory in patients with IPF but only mild restriction (total&#xD;
      lung capacity (TLC) &gt;70% predicted) demonstrated elevated IND and dyspnea during exercise,&#xD;
      when compared to healthy age- and sex-matched controls. The increased IND appeared to be&#xD;
      largely the result of the excess ventilation (high V̇E/V̇CO2), as dynamic respiratory&#xD;
      mechanics (VT and operating lung volumes) during exercise were similar to healthy controls,&#xD;
      when accounting for ventilation. Importantly, these patients showed only minor decreases in&#xD;
      arterial O2 saturation. These data suggest that patients with mild forms of IPF have&#xD;
      significant exertional dyspnea, secondary to reduced ventilatory efficiency (high V̇E/V̇CO2),&#xD;
      although the exact mechanisms of elevated V̇E/V̇CO2 in mild IPF remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased chemosensitivity has been linked to elevated V̇E/V̇CO2 in cardiopulmonary diseases.&#xD;
      It is reasonable to postulate that persistent V̇A/Q̇ mismatch with elevated total&#xD;
      physiological dead space and possible sympathetic over-excitation may alter central medullary&#xD;
      chemoreceptor characteristics in patients with IPF, at least partially explaining elevated&#xD;
      exercise V̇E/V̇CO2. Pulmonary microvascular abnormalities may also be a key contributor to&#xD;
      the increased dead space and V̇E/V̇CO2 during exercise in IPF. Patients with IPF and mild&#xD;
      mechanical restriction have relatively preserved gas transfer between the alveoli and&#xD;
      capillaries, even in fibrotic lung regions with interstitial thickening. This suggests that&#xD;
      regional capillary hypoperfusion in IPF with mild restriction, despite a relatively preserved&#xD;
      alveolar-capillary interface, may lead to V̇A/Q̇ mismatch (specifically an increased&#xD;
      proportion of high V̇A/Q̇ lung units), which would increase total physiologic dead space and&#xD;
      V̇E/V̇CO2. The relative contribution of increased chemosensitivity and/or pulmonary&#xD;
      microvascular abnormalities to elevated exercise V̇E/V̇CO2 in patients mild IPF has not been&#xD;
      determined and are the primary focus of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment options for dyspnea management in IPF are limited. Recent work from the INSTAGE&#xD;
      trial showed that a combination of nintedanib (anti-fibrotic) and sildenafil (pulmonary&#xD;
      vasodilator) showed minimal improvement in dyspnea. However, improvements in physical&#xD;
      activity and gas-exchange in patients with IPF following 8-week treatment of inhaled nitric&#xD;
      oxide (iNO), a selective pulmonary vasodilator have been demonstrated in other, more recent&#xD;
      studies. Since patients with mild forms of IPF are thought to have a relatively intact&#xD;
      capillary bed but a relatively high physiological dead space due to attenuation of regional&#xD;
      pulmonary perfusion, inhaled selective vasodilation may be more beneficial than in advanced&#xD;
      disease with fixed microvascular destruction. This is supported by recent work demonstrating&#xD;
      a reduced V̇E/V̇CO2 (reflecting a decrease in physiological dead space) and dyspnea during&#xD;
      exercise in patients with mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with minimal or no&#xD;
      emphysema. Importantly, arterial O2 saturation was normal throughout exercise and unaffected&#xD;
      by iNO, which suggests no deleterious effects of iNO on overall gas-exchange. The reduction&#xD;
      in V̇E/V̇CO2 during exercise with iNO suggests that iNO increases pulmonary microvascular&#xD;
      perfusion heterogeneity, leading to improved V̇A/Q̇ matching, reduced dead space and&#xD;
      therefore a lower ventilation for a given metabolic demand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an exploratory outcome, we will determine whether iNO improves V̇A/Q̇ and reduces dead&#xD;
      space and attendant dyspnea, in patients with IPF and mild mechanical restriction. Moreover,&#xD;
      this would clearly establish if partially reversible vascular dysfunction contributes to&#xD;
      V̇A/Q̇ mismatch, elevated V̇E/V̇CO2, inspiratory neural drive and dyspnea exists in&#xD;
      non-hypoxemic patients with IPF and minimal mechanical abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: It has been well established that patients with advanced IPF have mechanical and&#xD;
      pulmonary gas exchange abnormalities which require compensatory increases in inspiratory&#xD;
      neural drive and an exaggerated ventilatory response to exercise with consequent increase in&#xD;
      activity-related dyspnea. However, very little work has been done to understand mechanisms of&#xD;
      exertional dyspnea in patients IPF in whom restrictive mechanics and hypoxemia are not&#xD;
      prominent. The proposed work has the potential to not only provide important physiological&#xD;
      insight into the underlying mechanisms for increased V̇E/V̇CO2 and inspiratory neural drive,&#xD;
      but also to examine therapeutic avenues to improve ventilatory efficiency, dyspnea, exercise&#xD;
      capacity and ultimately quality of life in patients with IPF.&#xD;
