  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives are to develop and validate a classifier using multimodal passive&#xD;
      sensor data and metrics derived from normal iPhone and Apple Watch usage to distinguish&#xD;
      individuals with normal cognition from those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and to&#xD;
      develop and validate a cognitive wellness score that tracks fluctuations in cognitive&#xD;
      performance over time using multimodal passive sensor data and metrics derived from normal&#xD;
      iPhone and Apple Watch usage.&#xD;
