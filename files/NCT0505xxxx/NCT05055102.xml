  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Wovex bifurcated dacron vascular prostheses have been available on the French market&#xD;
      since 2008. They are mainly used to treat aneurysmal or occlusive aortic diseases. To date,&#xD;
      they have not been the subject of a specific clinical efficacy/safety study, unlike other&#xD;
      Dacron prostheses used in the same field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We purpose a monocentric, retrospective, consecutive study based on medical data, including&#xD;
      all the patients operated for aneurysms or occlusive disease of the abdominal aorta at Dijon&#xD;
      Bourgogne University Hospital between 2013 and 2017 and who received a WOVEX bifurcated&#xD;
      prosthesis (Wovex® Polyester Vascular Protheses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to explore the safety (short-term postoperative morbidity and mortality at 5&#xD;
      years) and efficacy (primary permeability, secondary permeability and dilatation of the&#xD;
      prosthesis at 5 years) of the WOVEX prosthesis.&#xD;
