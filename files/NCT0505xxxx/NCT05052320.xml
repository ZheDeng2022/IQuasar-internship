      The outbreak of novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona virus type 2 (nSARS-CoV-2)&#xD;
      infection in Wuhan, China in December 2019 has had impact on the world, resulting in over 2.2&#xD;
      million deaths globally The world envisioned sufferings of high proportions of losses in&#xD;
      terms of health,finances and importantly, life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The common symptoms including fever, cough, fatigue and gastrointestinal disorders have been&#xD;
      well documented. Sensorineural hearing loss has been more commonly implicated in these&#xD;
      patients although a few have exhibited conductive hearing loss. theViral upper respiratory&#xD;
      tract infections have linked to new cases of otitis media. Although There is some controversy&#xD;
      regarding the significance of viral species, but the human corona virus has been isolated&#xD;
      from middle ear fluid and linked to otitis media in children. Most patients affected are&#xD;
      asymptomatic or experience mild symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various theories explaining the involvement of the ear following covid infection have been&#xD;
      pos tulated, which include immune mediated damage,haematogenous spread, ischaemia theory,&#xD;
      inflammation of auditory pathway components, presence of angiotensin converting enzyme&#xD;
      receptors (ACE2) receptors in neurons and glial cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hearing loss in COVID-19 could also be the consequence of therapy with chloroquine and&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine, which are part of clinical practice guidelines for COVID-19 treatment in&#xD;
      several countries . These drugs are used for the treatment of malaria and some chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory diseases as well. It is well known that these medications can induce hearing&#xD;
      loss. Ototoxicity of chloroquine and hydroxy- chloroquine is the result of inner ear damage .&#xD;
      The recommended dose of these drugs for COVID-19 treatment is higher than for malaria;&#xD;
      therefore, ototoxic effect could be higher.Though many vaccines were intro- duced, the&#xD;
      disease has hit second and third waves in many countries, elevating the number of infected&#xD;
      individuals getting infected .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies reported that the COVID-19 group had significantly poorerhearing thresholds at&#xD;
      high frequencies. In addition, the amplitudes of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions ,in&#xD;
      two of thesestudies were significantly lower for the COVID-19 group.&#xD;
