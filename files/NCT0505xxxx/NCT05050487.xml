      Pain is a major problem that has to be dealt with in case of hip fracture, as it presents an&#xD;
      obstacle for examination, positioning for receiving neuroaxial anesthesia and postoperative&#xD;
      mobility and physiotherapy. With the introduction of ultrasound in regional anesthesia and&#xD;
      peripheral nerve blocks, regional analgesia float to the surface as a substitute for opioids&#xD;
      with less side effects Lumbar paravertebral nerve block has emerged as a reliable analgesic&#xD;
      option for primary total hip arthroplasty (THA). In 2018, a new block was described, termed&#xD;
      pericapsular nerve group block or PENG block, that selectively targets the articular branches&#xD;
      of the femoral and obturator nerves while sparing their motor components&#xD;

      Pain is a major problem that has to be dealt with in case of hip fracture, as it presents an&#xD;
      obstacle for examination, positioning for receiving neuroaxial anesthesia and postoperative&#xD;
      mobility and physiotherapy. With the introduction of ultrasound in regional anesthesia and&#xD;
      peripheral nerve blocks, regional analgesia float to the surface as a substitute for opioids&#xD;
      with less side effects Lumbar paravertebral nerve block has emerged as a reliable analgesic&#xD;
      option for primary total hip arthroplasty (THA). In 2018, a new block was described, termed&#xD;
      pericapsular nerve group block or PENG block, that selectively targets the articular branches&#xD;
      of the femoral and obturator nerves while sparing their motor components The pericapsular&#xD;
      nerve group (PENG) block is an ultrasound-guided approach first de-scribed by Giron-Arango et&#xD;
      al. for the blockade of the articular branches of the femoral (FN), obturator (ON) and&#xD;
      accessory obturator (AON) nerve that provide sensory innervation to the an¬terior hip&#xD;
      capsule. It has been developed as an alternative regional anesthesia technique for the&#xD;
      management of acute pain after hip fractures, but its applications are expanding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the PENG block has been used to control and reduce pain in hip-related&#xD;
      proce¬dures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are reports of PENG blocks used as surgical anesthetic techniques for hip arthro¬plasty&#xD;
      (in combination with local anesthetic and intravenous analgesics) or hip arthroscopy (in&#xD;
      combination with lateral femoral cutaneous nerve [LFCN] block). There is a report of a PENG&#xD;
      block used as analgesic technique for sickle cell disease vaso-occlusive crisis and a PENG&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation for osteoarthritis analgesia. There are also reports about the use of&#xD;
      a PENG block for non-hip related inter¬ventions, such as leg vein ligation and stripping,&#xD;
      medial thigh surgery, prevention of adductor muscle spasm during transurethral resection of&#xD;
      bladder and below-knee amputation in associa¬tion with popliteal sciatic nerve block.These&#xD;
      latter cases further extended the application of the PENG block beyond the hip-related area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, most of the reports describe preoperative or postoperative single-shot blocks, 0while&#xD;
      there are only few case reports of continuous PENG blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the novelty of this technique, there are still ongoing debates about the best&#xD;
      injection point as well as the best anesthetic concentration and the total volume to be&#xD;
      injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paravertebral blocks(PVBS) were first performed in 1905 and became a popular technique for&#xD;
      provision of analgesia in the early part of the twentieth century .However ,their use&#xD;
      declined over the years until a publication by Eason and Wyatt in 1979 began a renaissance&#xD;
      .Since then ,a considerable number of good quality studies have been published on PVB and its&#xD;
      now an established regional anesthesia and analgesia technique&#xD;

    <description>The PENG block is performed under US guid¬ance, . The pa¬tient is placed in the supine position a curvilinear low-fre¬quency ultrasound probe (2-5 MHz) is initially placed in a transverse plane over the AIIS and then aligned with the pubic ramus by rotating the probe approximately 30-45 degrees . .&#xD;
The needle, usually a 22-G80-mm echogenic device, is inserted from lateral to medial with an in-plane approach to place the tip in the plane between the psoas tendon anteriorly and the pu¬bic ramus posteriorly .&#xD;
After needle insertion and following negative aspiration, the local anesthetic is injected . The volume used of 20 ml of(L-bupivacaine; concentration 0,25% ) . This fascial plane appeared to continue in the hip pericapsular plane.</description>

    <description>Lumbar paravertebral region is obtained after positioning the probe 3-4 cm lateral and parallel to the lumbar spinous process. After identifying of the L5 transverse process, L4,3,2 transverse processes were identified by counting from downward to upward. The &quot;trident sign&quot; is identified by the ultrasound. It presents the acoustic shadow of the transverse processes. The psoas muscle was localized by being in the space between the transverse processes&quot; shadow. Nerves of the lumbar plexus are identified as the longitudinal hyperechoic structures seen on the posterior aspect of the psoas major muscle.. Upon entry of the needle to the posterior aspect of the psoas major. After negative aspiration, the local anesthetic (20mL of bupivacaine 0.25% ) was injected slowly in the third lumbar paravertebral space, and patients were closely monitored for any signs of inadvertent intravenous injection.</description>
