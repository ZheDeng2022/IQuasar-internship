      The purpose of this capstone project is to pilot Heart Smart, a virtual group program to&#xD;
      improve self-efficacy for self-management skills for homebound people with heart failure.&#xD;
      Heart Smart will provide synchronous virtual group education to homebound people with heart&#xD;
      failure receiving services from Penn Medicine at Home. The primary clinical goal is to&#xD;
      improve self-efficacy for heart failure self-management and improve their knowledge of heart&#xD;
      failure self-management strategies. Secondary outcomes will explore the feasibility of the&#xD;
      program by exploring technology, adherence and satisfaction with the program.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Self-Efficacy Measure for Chronic Disease (SEMCD)</measure>
    <time_frame>At first and final sessions (weeks 1 and 6)</time_frame>
    <description>This self-report scale has 6 items which are each rated on a scale of 1 (not at all confident) to 10 (totally confident). The score for the scale is the mean of the scores for the six items. Possible scores are 1-10 with higher scores indicating higher self-efficacy. This scale is an appropriate outcome measure for a heart failure self-management group because it was designed to measure self-efficacy in people with chronic conditions such as heart failure and has undergone psychometric evaluation. This scale is free to use without permission. Administration takes less than 10 minutes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>At first and final sessions (weeks 1 and 6)</time_frame>
    <description>This 23-item, Likert scale, self-report heart failure specific outcome measure. The instrument measures six domains: physical function, symptoms (frequency, severity and recent change), social function, self-efficacy and knowledge, and quality of life. This instrument is appropriate because it is designed for use for people with heart failure, will give an indication of participant heart failure severity for demographic purposes, and has a validated self-efficacy component. This scale requires a license which has been obtained for this pilot project. Administration takes less than 10 minutes. Scores range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating higher cardiac health status.</description>

    <measure>Change in Atlanta Heart Failure Knowledge Test V3 (AHFKT)</measure>
    <time_frame>At first and final sessions (weeks 1 and 6)</time_frame>
    <description>This 30 item multiple choice measure of heart failure self-management knowledge yields scores 0-30 which are commonly reported as a percentage (higher scores indicate more knowledge). Content validity was established through a panel of expert heart failure nurses.</description>
