  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical students have higher risks for depression, anxiety, burnout and suicide than the&#xD;
      general population and they rarely seek professional help or treatment. The group treatment&#xD;
      program &quot;Training for Awareness, Resilience, and Action&quot; (TARA) was originally developed to&#xD;
      treat depressed adolescents, targeting specific neuroscientific findings. TARA has shown&#xD;
      feasibility and preliminary efficacy in clinically depressed adolescents and corresponding&#xD;
      brain-changes in mixed community samples. In the present study feasibility and acceptability&#xD;
      of TARA in Swedish medical students are investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design was a single-arm trial with twenty-three self-selected students in early semesters&#xD;
      of medical school, with or without mental disorders. All received TARA. Self-reported&#xD;
      symptoms of depression, anxiety, perceived stress and psychological inflexibility were&#xD;
      collected before (T0) and after the intervention (T1). Qualitative data on the participants'&#xD;
      experiences of TARA was collected in focus group interviews and individually both during and&#xD;
      after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that (1) TARA will be feasible in medical students, (2) the&#xD;
      content will be acceptable, (3) attendance and retention will be good, (4) trends towards&#xD;
      improvement will be seen on the self-rating scales and (5) it will be possible and meaningful&#xD;
      to explore the students experience of participating in TARA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of TARA as&#xD;
      indicated prevention of mental disorders and stress-related symptoms in self-selected medical&#xD;
      students. We also aim to qualitatively explore the students' experiences of participating in&#xD;
      TARA both during and after the program as well as at a two-year follow-up. The study is&#xD;
      designed as a single arm pre-post intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and procedures Participants are recruited from Umeå University School of&#xD;
      Medicine. The University is located in the north of Sweden and enrolls 130 medical students&#xD;
      per semester. Participants are recruited from the second and fourth semester through oral and&#xD;
      written information at a mandatory class on professional development, including in total&#xD;
      approximately 225 students. Participation in the TARA-study is voluntary, and in addition to&#xD;
      being a medical student we have no specific inclusion or exclusion criteria. Participants are&#xD;
      allocated to one of two TARA-groups (A and B) based on their personal weekday preference,&#xD;
      since the groups are held on different days of the week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before inclusion, participants provide written informed consent. Study participation is&#xD;
      voluntary and can be cancelled by the participant at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups are held at the university campus in premises provided by the university hospital.&#xD;
      Each session for a given group is led by the same two facilitators, together covering&#xD;
      expertise in contemplative practices and clinical psychology or psychiatry. The facilitators'&#xD;
      role during sessions is to teach specific content and to model a collaborative, inclusive,&#xD;
      non-judgmental, and supportive attitude. Continuous supervision and training of facilitators&#xD;
      is provided by the principal investigator who also monitors fidelity to the manual, both in&#xD;
      terms of content adherence and the process of delivery. The facilitators are also videotaped&#xD;
      to facilitate supervision and implementation of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment procedures At baseline (T0), before the intervention, self-report of&#xD;
      sociodemographic background and outcome measures is collected online, for details see outcome&#xD;
      measures. After the intervention (T1), and at a two-year follow-up (T2) outcome measures are&#xD;
      repeated. Participants who do not provide data at the time of data collection are reminded by&#xD;
      the research team through email and/or telephone contact. The TARA-participants provide brief&#xD;
      self-assessment and session-evaluation on paper at the beginning and end of each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A semi-structured group-interview about TARA is conducted halfway through the program. Those&#xD;
      who are present at the session and willing to stay afterwards are interviewed and the same&#xD;
      participants are interviewed again upon completion of the program. The interviews are&#xD;
      conducted by an independent researcher without any background or involvement in the&#xD;
      intervention. A semi-structured interview guide created for this purpose is used. The&#xD;
      questions are mainly about the participants' experiences of TARA. At two years follow-up&#xD;
      another independent researcher conducts individual interviews with participants from both&#xD;
      groups. These interviews are held online or at the interviewees' choice of location. All&#xD;
      participants are invited by email. The semi-structured interview guide for the individual&#xD;
      interviews is adapted for the current timeframe. Example questions asked in all interviews&#xD;
      are: &quot;What are your experiences of participating in TARA?&quot; and &quot;Can you mention something&#xD;
      that was particularly hard or challenging?&quot;. The questions are broad or open. Experiences&#xD;
      before, during and after TARA are covered. When necessary and/or appropriate questions are&#xD;
      followed up using cued prompts (&quot;You said X, please tell me more about that&quot;), facilitating&#xD;
      utterances (nodding, &quot;Umm,&quot; etc.), clarifying questions (&quot;Do you mean Y?&quot;), and relevant&#xD;
      follow-up questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis The dataset is checked for illogical values. For both categorical and continuous&#xD;
      variables, responses outside the possible response categories are coded as missing.&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics are calculated using standard measures. Sum scores, as well as means&#xD;
      and standard deviations are calculated for each self-report measure. Missing data on the item&#xD;
      level is imputed using Multiple Imputations with 5 iterations, to enable calculation of sum&#xD;
      score despite missing items. The T1 scores on each item on the secondary outcome measures&#xD;
      (Hospital anxiety and depression rating scale- anxiety and depression sub scales, Perceived&#xD;
      stress scale and Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire for youth) are used as predictors in the&#xD;
      imputation model and we use a random seed. The data is checked for normality using histograms&#xD;
      and Q-Q plots, as well as skewness and kurtosis. Boxplots are used to check for outliers. No&#xD;
      interim analyses are conducted. Descriptive statistics is reported using standard measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate potential differences between the test-retest sample and the baseline sample we&#xD;
      use Fisher's test for nominal data, Mann-Whitney U test for ordinal data and non-normally&#xD;
      distributed continuous data, and unpaired T-test for normally distributed continuous data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paired samples T-tests are conducted to compare self-rated symptom severity scores at T0 and&#xD;
      T1 as well as at T0 and T2. All analyses are performed using SPSS statistics (version 26, IBM&#xD;
      Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). All significance testing is two-tailed, with a significance level of&#xD;
      0.05. P-values are not corrected for multiple comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interviews are audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim by the respective interviewer who has&#xD;
      a high degree of familiarity with the data. The transcribed data is subjected to qualitative&#xD;
      content analysis, which involves the systematic interpretation of the overt and underlying&#xD;
      content and can be used to analyze participants' reflections, experiences, and attitudes. The&#xD;
      text is first read several times separately by the authors, discussed to get sense of it as a&#xD;
      whole, and then divided into meaning units relevant to the aim of the study. The meaning&#xD;
      units are then coded and sorted into groups according to their variations, similarities, and&#xD;
      differences. The investigators meet regularly to discuss their interpretations and finally&#xD;
      agree on the structure of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time plan The investigators delivered TARA in the fall 2018. The final qualitative data&#xD;
      collection was completed in fall 2020.&#xD;

    <description>12 weekly sessions, each 90 minutes, up to 14 participants/group. Manual-based: Session 1: Introducing group members; establishing guidelines; investigating attitudes and previous experiences, introducing contemplative practices. All sessions: participants sit on yoga mats. Facilitators open and briefly check-in. Participants are guided through a breathing practice, yoga-based movement (a flow of positions synchronized with the breath) and then a meditation focusing primarily on interoceptive and sensory awareness. After a short break, a psychoeducational presentation is held followed by group exercises and discussions. The sessions conclude with feedback and questions regarding the practice, followed by a description of the home practice for the coming week. Finally, participants gather their attention and have the opportunity to express their reflections and current state.</description>
