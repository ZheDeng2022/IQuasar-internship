      The purpose of this study is to investigate feasibility and acceptability of a novel&#xD;
      intervention to integrate Butterfly IQ into antenatal care (ANC) service delivery in Malawi.&#xD;
      The study will also explore potential impact of the intervention on selected service delivery&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of a novel&#xD;
      intervention to integrate Butterfly IQ into ANC service delivery in Blantyre, Malawi. This&#xD;
      study will further the understanding of antenatal ultrasound in Malawi by testing the&#xD;
      following hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When planned and implemented collaboratively with local stakeholders, limited introduction&#xD;
      and integration of point-of-care ultrasound with Butterfly iQ into ANC service delivery at&#xD;
      health center level will be feasible and acceptable for health providers and clients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study intervention will include a multi-phased approach to design, introduction,&#xD;
      improvement, and evaluation of Butterfly IQ for routine obstetric ultrasound integrated into&#xD;
      ANC service delivery in Malawi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Training Phase 1 includes training on Butterfly IQ, integration in ANC workflow, and&#xD;
      referral/counter-referral within network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Iterative Service Delivery Phase 2 includes weekly evaluation and iterative&#xD;
      re-design of services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: Final Evaluation Phase 3 includes evaluation for potential integration into current&#xD;
      policies and frameworks; determination to pursue pending additional factors; or determination&#xD;
      of incompatibility, as well as selected support for transition/handover, if applicable.&#xD;
