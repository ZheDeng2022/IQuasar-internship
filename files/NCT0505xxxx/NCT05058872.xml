      Purpose of this study: The purpose of this study is to learn more about how hormonal oral&#xD;
      contraceptives affect brain processes and emotional wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: If participants agree to participate, the following will happen:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Eligibility visit (remote screening session)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If participants are eligible to participate in the study, they will be placed in one of&#xD;
           two groups. If they are in the first group, they will be asked to take an oral&#xD;
           contraception pill (&quot;study drug&quot;) every day for 21 days. If they are in the second, they&#xD;
           will take a placebo every day for 21 days. A placebo is a pill that looks like medicine&#xD;
           but is not real and will have no medical effect on participants. Participants will not&#xD;
           get to choose which group they are in, nor will they be told which group they are in.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. During the three-week period in which participants will take either the study drug or&#xD;
           placebo, they will be asked to complete daily check-in surveys on their computer or&#xD;
           mobile device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Participants will be asked to attend two additional visits over the course of about&#xD;
           three weeks. At these visits, participants will be asked to undergo a urine drug screen,&#xD;
           a blood draw, and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They will also be asked to&#xD;
           complete behavioral questionnaires.&#xD;

      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal investigator hypothesizes that treatment with oral contraceptives, specifically&#xD;
      a combination of a synthetic estrogen and progestin, in adult females will result in deficits&#xD;
      in reward processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjective ratings of mood and hedonic function. Based on previous evidence, the&#xD;
           principal investigator hypothesizes that H1a) treatment with a hormonal oral&#xD;
           contraceptive will result in decreased self-reports of sexual function and&#xD;
           interest/enjoyment in non-sexual pleasurable activities as measured by the Sexual&#xD;
           Function Questionnaire and Dimensional Anhedonia Rating Scale, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Neural activity in reward processing areas during an incentive delay task. Via&#xD;
           functional magnetic resonance imaging, neural activity will be measured during both the&#xD;
           anticipation and receipt of a pleasurable image (erotica, pleasant images of the&#xD;
           outdoors, and &quot;cute&quot; animals). Activation of nucleus accumbens and ventromedial&#xD;
           pre-frontal cortex is positively associated with feelings of anticipation and pleasure,&#xD;
           respectively (10). The principal investigator hypothesizes that H2) treatment with a&#xD;
           hormonal oral contraceptive will result in decreased activity in these regions,&#xD;
           consistent with decreased reward anticipation and responsiveness.&#xD;

    <description>Blood-oxygen-level dependent contrast imaging, or BOLD-contrast imaging, is a method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to observe different areas of the brain or other organs, which are found to be active at any given time. BOLD signal in the brain will be measured during a reward task both at baseline and after 21 days of receiving either levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol or placebo.</description>
