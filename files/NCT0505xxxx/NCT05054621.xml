  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single blinded randomized homologous/heterologous prime-boost vaccine&#xD;
      clinical study, designed to assess the immunogenicity of heterologous prime-boost&#xD;
      immunization with AZD1222 and MVC-COV1901 in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be healthy adults at the age of 20-70 years who have had their first dose&#xD;
      of COVID-19 vaccine, AZD1222. All eligible participants of 2 prime-boost interval strata (28&#xD;
      to 42, 56 to 70 days) will be 1:1 randomly assigned to receive a single dose of either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Homologous group: Intramuscular injection the same vaccine as their prime dose AZD1222&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heterologous group: Medigen COVID-19 vaccine MVC-COV1901. The treatment phase of this&#xD;
           study will be conducted in a single-blind fashion such that the subject will not know&#xD;
           the identity of the subjects' study treatment assignment. After receiving the treatment,&#xD;
           the participants will remain on study for 168 days following the boost vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the study primary objective, immunogenicity will be assessed during the duration of the&#xD;
      study, including serologic neutralizing antibody titer against SARS-CoV-2, serological&#xD;
      quantification of binding antibody to SARS-CoV-2 antigen, SARS-CoV-2 antigen specific B cell&#xD;
      and T cell frequencies and cytokine levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      And Safety will be assessed during the duration of the study as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Solicited adverse events (AEs; local and systemic) will be assessed for 7 days following&#xD;
           each vaccination (Day 0 through Day 7 for the boost vaccination).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unsolicited AEs will be recorded for 28 days following the boost vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be recorded from signing of the informed consent form&#xD;
           through Day 168.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) will be recorded from the boost vaccination&#xD;
           through Day 168.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is going to be conducted in a single medical center in Taiwan. An appropriate&#xD;
      number of participants will be screened to achieve approximately 44 evaluable participants&#xD;
      for each group. Participants in each group will be divided into two subgroups according to&#xD;
      the intervals, 28-42 days and 56-70 days, between the prime and booster doses.&#xD;
