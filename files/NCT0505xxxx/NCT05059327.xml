  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study intends to show that basimglurant provides effective seizure control in children&#xD;
      and adolescents with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study drug (basimglurant) is a potent inhibitor of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5&#xD;
      (mGluR5) which controls a wide range of processes in the brain, spinal cord, retina, and&#xD;
      peripheral nervous system. In animal studies, the inhibition of this receptor has shown&#xD;
      therapeutic potential for the treatment of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). This receptor's&#xD;
      inhibition decreases the frequency of seizures. In previous clinical trials, the study drug&#xD;
      has shown an advantageous safety profile in children and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to find an optimal dose at which the study drug will lead to a&#xD;
      decrease in the duration, frequency and intensity of seizures in children and adolescents&#xD;
      with TSC, while being well tolerated. All patients who positively respond and tolerate the&#xD;
      medicine will be offered the possibility to continue in an open label extension.&#xD;
