      The study will examine the effect of using Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) compared&#xD;
      with standard wound dressing among patients undergoing elective open surgery for incisional&#xD;
      hernia. The study's main hypothesis is that NPWT will decrease the post-operative incidence&#xD;
      of surgical site infections and also improve the patients' quality of life including less&#xD;
      scar-related pain and higher cosmetic satisfaction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has been utilized for the treatment&#xD;
      of complicated wounds within orthopedic and vascular surgery, whereas incisions after&#xD;
      abdominal surgery have not been treated with prophylactic negative pressure wound treatment&#xD;
      to the same extent. Patients undergoing incisional hernia repair per definition have elicited&#xD;
      insufficient wound healing (i.e. the hernia), and often carry comorbidities such as diabetes,&#xD;
      obesity and a history of smoking, leaving them at a high risk of developing wound&#xD;
      complications. Despite efforts to reduce this risk, the incidence remains as high as 50% in&#xD;
      some series. Wound complications are especially concerning in patients undergoing incisional&#xD;
      hernia repair, as a foreign body (synthetic polypropylene mesh) is placed in the abdominal&#xD;
      wall during the procedure. Wound complications are directly associated with an increased risk&#xD;
      of hernia recurrence, which reduces the patients' quality of life and has severe&#xD;
      socioeconomic costs including a higher risk of prolonged hospital admission, re-operation,&#xD;
      re-admission and increased mortality (2). The aim of this trial is to examine the effects of&#xD;
      prophylactic NPWT on postoperative wound complications after open incisional hernia repair&#xD;
      compared with standard care, i.e. an operative dressing. It is our hypothesis that NPWT&#xD;
      significantly reduces the incidence of surgical site infections (SSI) as defined by the&#xD;
      Center for Disease Control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since Bispebjerg Hospital in Denmark is the regional center for complex hernias, this is one&#xD;
      of the few sites where a randomized trial including 110 patients undergoing open incisional&#xD;
      hernia repair is feasible. To date, only five randomized controlled trials of prophylactic&#xD;
      NPWT for closed abdominal incisions have been published. In the most recent meta-analysis of&#xD;
      these trials, there was no reduced risk of wound complications in patients treated with NPWT,&#xD;
      however results indeed seemed subjective to type-II error (relative risk 0.56 (95% confidence&#xD;
      interval 0.30-1.03, P = 0.064). Thus, adding another randomized trial expectedly will alter&#xD;
      the conclusion of the next meta-analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study type is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comprising two treatment groups, i.e.&#xD;
      one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. STANDARD CARE After skin closure, a standard operative dressing is applied in the entire&#xD;
           length of the incision. This operative dressing is removed in the morning of&#xD;
           postoperative day two. Only in the case of blood or serous fluid mandating changing of&#xD;
           the dressing, will this be done prior to postoperative day 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. INTERVENTION After skin closure, NPWT in the form of Prevena™ (KCI/Acelity, San Antonia,&#xD;
           TX, USA) is applied using the following technique: The sterile foam dressing is removed&#xD;
           from the package and placed on the incision in the entire length, on top of which the&#xD;
           sterile dressing is placed, ensuring air tightness. An appropriate hole in the dressing&#xD;
           is cut at the center of the dressing and the tube for the interface pad is connected and&#xD;
           a negative pressure of 125mmHg is applied. The Prevena™ system is removed on the morning&#xD;
           of postoperative day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are included in the study during the planning of surgery in the outpatient clinic or&#xD;
      within a week before surgery at the planned visit in the department of surgery. Patients are&#xD;
      randomized to intervention or standard treatment in a 1:1 allocation ratio, which will be&#xD;
      performed using computer generated sequences with varying block sizes&#xD;
      (http://www.sealedenvelope.com/). This randomization will generate randomization and code&#xD;
      envelopes and is carried out by a physician not otherwise involved in the study. On the day&#xD;
      of surgery, the patients are given a randomization number. Corresponding randomization&#xD;
      envelopes contain information about the intervention the patient is to receive and are thus&#xD;
      opened during surgery, i.e. immediately after closure of the linea alba, whereas the code&#xD;
      envelopes will be opened at the time of data analysis after all included patients have&#xD;
      completed 30-day follow up. Based on the average number of elective open incisional hernia&#xD;
      repairs at the study's operating site, the patient recruitment is expected to take 1 to 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;

      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS This trial aim to improve the treatment of patients undergoing open&#xD;
      abdominal surgery by reducing the incidence of wound complications. We hypothesize that the&#xD;
      intervention will be an improvement compared with the standard treatment currently offered,&#xD;
      without any severe side-effects. This includes both in terms of the expected reduction in&#xD;
      wound complication incidence as well as an increase in patient quality of life. Thus, the&#xD;
      expected benefits from participation in the current trials outweigh any potential drawbacks&#xD;
      and is therefore considered ethical appropriate. Lastly, the trial conforms to the Helsinki&#xD;
      Declaration.&#xD;
