  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tooth loss is common and as consequence deteriorate patient's health and quality-of-life.&#xD;
      Dental prostheses aim to restore patients' appearance and functions by replacement of missing&#xD;
      teeth. The occlusal morphology and 3D position of the healthy natural teeth should be adopted&#xD;
      by the dental prostheses (biomimetic). Despite computer-assisted design (CAD) software are&#xD;
      available for designing dental prostheses, considerable clinical time are still required to&#xD;
      fit the dental prostheses into patients' occlusion (teeth-to-teeth relationship). Teeth of an&#xD;
      individual subjects are genetically controlled and exposed to mostly identical oral&#xD;
      environment, therefore the occlusal morphology and 3D position of teeth are inter-related. It&#xD;
      is hypothesized that artificial intelligence (AI) can automated designing the single-tooth&#xD;
      dental prostheses from the features of remaining dentition.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare four deep-learning methods/algorithms in interpreting and learning of the&#xD;
           features of 3D models;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the AI system with maxillary tooth model alone to maxillary and mandibular&#xD;
           (antagonist) models;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the occlusal morphology and 3D position of the single-tooth dental prostheses&#xD;
           designed by trained AI and by dental technicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, investigators will collect 200 maxillary dentate teeth models as training models. AI&#xD;
      will learn the relationship between individual teeth and rest of the dentition using the 3D&#xD;
      Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) by following deep-learning methods/algorithms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1) Voxel-based; Group 2) View-based; Group 3) Point-based; and Group 4) Fusion methods.&#xD;
      Investigators will collect another 100 maxillary models that serve as validation models.&#xD;
      Investigators will remove a tooth (act as control) in each model. Then investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate these deep learning algorithms in predicting the occlusal morphology and 3D position&#xD;
      of single-missing tooth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, investigators will evaluate the need of antagonist model in predicting the occlusal&#xD;
      morphology and 3D position of single-missing tooth in 100 validation models:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group i) maxillary model only and Group ii) with antagonist model using the tested&#xD;
      deep-learning algorithm in objective (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third, investigators will analyze the geometric morphometric and 3D position of dental&#xD;
      prostheses designed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group a) the trained AI system; Group b) dental technicians on the physical models; and Group&#xD;
      c) dental technicians using CAD software. Investigators will compare these teeth to the&#xD;
      corresponding natural teeth (control) in 100 validation models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, investigators will analyze the time required for tooth design in these groups as&#xD;
      secondary outcome.&#xD;
