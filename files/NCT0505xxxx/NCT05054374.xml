  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study to find out whether mirdametinib is a safe treatment for people&#xD;
      with advanced solid tumor cancer that has certain mutations. Researchers will look at whether&#xD;
      mirdametinib on its own or in combination with the drug fulvestrant is a safe treatment that&#xD;
      causes few or mild side effects in people with advanced solid tumor cancer.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects are eligible to start the treatment in the study only if all of the following&#xD;
        criteria apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Arm 1 (metastatic breast cancer):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female adults (≥18 years of age on the date of informed consent)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Postmenopausal or receiving ovarian suppression (including GnRH agonists such as&#xD;
             goserelin)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer with&#xD;
             evidence of progression on at least 1 prior line of therapy for metastatic disease&#xD;
             which should have included a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy.&#xD;
             Prior chemotherapy is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ER+ as defined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) ≥1% by local laboratory testing (as per&#xD;
             the ASCO-CAP guidelines)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HER2-negative, as defined by the negative in situ hybridization test (FISH, CISH, or&#xD;
             SISH) or an IHC status of 0, 1+ or 2+ by local laboratory testing. If IHC is 2+ (i.e.&#xD;
&#xD;
        indeterminate), then a negative in situ hybridization test (FISH, CISH, or SISH) is&#xD;
        required (as per the ASCO-CAP guidelines).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NF1 loss of function or another MAPK-activating genomic alteration documented by a&#xD;
             CLIA-certified NGS assay at any time before the start of treatment. Note: archival&#xD;
             tissue, if available and collected within 6 months of enrollment, may be used for this&#xD;
             testing in lieu of fresh tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Arm 2 (advanced solid cancers):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female adults (≥18 years of age on the date of informed consent)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed advanced, metastatic solid tumor cancer for which there is no&#xD;
             available therapy known to confer clinical benefit. Colorectal, anal, small bowel,&#xD;
             biliary or ampullary cancers are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Class 1 or class 2 MEK1 or MEK2 mutations, as described below, documented by a&#xD;
             CLIA-certified NGS assay at any time before the start of treatment. Class 3 MEK1 or&#xD;
             MEK2 mutations as described in that paper are excluded. A complete list of the&#xD;
             mutations allowed based on that paper can be found below, however, rare mutations not&#xD;
             listed in this table may be permitted at the discretion of the principal investigator&#xD;
             of the study. Note: archival tissue, if available and collected within 6 months of&#xD;
             enrollment, may be used for this testing in lieu of fresh tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Class 1 - Permitted: MEK1 D67N, MEK1 P124L, MEK1 P124S Class 2 - Permitted: MEK1 K57N, MEK1&#xD;
        C121S, MEK1 F53L, MEK1 Q56P Class 3 - Excluded: MEK1 L98-I103, MEK1 I99-K104, MEK1&#xD;
        E102-I103&#xD;
&#xD;
        The permitted mutations shown above are for MEK1. MEK1 and MEK2 are closely related, are&#xD;
        structurally similar, share 79% amino acid identity, and they share equal ability to&#xD;
        phosphylate their ERK substrates30. While the experiments performed above classify&#xD;
        individual MEK1 mutations only, the class 3 mutations in MEK1 all share in-frame deletions&#xD;
        that remove a potent negative regulatory element of MEK1. These are easily distinguishable&#xD;
        from other mutations in MEK1. Therefore, the identification of exclusionary class 3 MEK2&#xD;
        alterations will be straightforward as well, with paralogous mutant residues in MEK1 and&#xD;
        MEK2 defined in the manuscript above. A table showing the permitted enrolling paralogous&#xD;
        class 1 and class 2 residues are shown in the table below, again with the caveat that rare&#xD;
        mutations in MEK2 not listed in the table below may be eligible at the discretion of the&#xD;
        principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        MEK1: F53, Q56, K57, V60, D67, C121, P124, Y130, E203 MEK2: F57, Q60, K61, V64, D71, C125,&#xD;

               -  Systolic blood pressure &lt;150 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg (CTCAE&#xD;
                  Grade ≤1). Note: Anti-hypertensive medications are permitted, and if a patient&#xD;
                  does not meet these eligibility criteria at time of screening, treatment with&#xD;
                  additional anti-hypertensive agents is permissible at the discretion of the&#xD;
                  investigator, and blood pressure can be rechecked at a subsequent visit. Measured&#xD;
                  blood pressures that fall out of this range after screening do not render&#xD;
                  patients ineligible, however every effort should be made to medically manage&#xD;

             ° Fasting blood glucose &lt;140 mg/dL or&#xD;
&#xD;
             ° Random blood glucose &lt;250 mg/dL Note: Anti-hyperglycemic medications are permitted&#xD;
             if a patient does not meet these eligibility criteria at time of screening. Blood&#xD;
             glucose measurements that fall out of this range do not render patients ineligible,&#xD;
             and appropriate glycemic control at subsequent visits is at the discretion of the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood calcium and phosphate levels within normal levels per institutional lab standard&#xD;
