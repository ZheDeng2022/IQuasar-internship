  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) accounts for almost 10% of intensive care units&#xD;
      (ICU) admissions. Three ARDS stages have been defined, based on the PaO2/FIO2 ratio measured&#xD;
      with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ≥5 cmH2O: mild (201-300 mmHg), moderate (200-101&#xD;
      mmHg), and severe (≤100mmHg). They represent 30.0%, 46.6%, and 23.4% of ARDS, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical invasive ventilation (MV), the cornerstone of ARDS patient care, has a primary&#xD;
      goal to protect the lung from ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Delivering MV in a prone&#xD;
      position (PP) has been shown to improve oxygenation, protect the lung through a better&#xD;
      homogenization of lung stress/strain, and stabilize hemodynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials showed beneficial effect of PP vs.&#xD;
      supine position (SP) in the most hypoxemic patients. A fifth randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      further showed a significant reduction in mortality with PP in ARDS patients with PaO2/FIO2&#xD;
      &lt;150 mmHg, when neuromuscular blockade and long proning sessions were used. Therefore, PP has&#xD;
      since been strongly recommended for ARDS patients with PaO2/FIO2 &lt;150 mmHg. Yet, there is&#xD;
      limited evidence in patients with mild to moderate ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are, however, strong arguments supporting the need for a new trial in ARDS patients&#xD;
      with PaO2/FIO2 in the range 150-300 mmHg:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There is no trial that has specifically tested PP in this ARDS subset;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PP is safe and has become a standard of care in ICU;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Should VILI prevention be a mechanism through which PP improves survival, this should be&#xD;
           involved in all ARDS patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The mortality at hospital discharge in this subset of ARDS remains significant,&#xD;
           amounting to 34.9% (95% confidence intervals 31.4-38.5%) in mild and 40.3% (37.4-43.3)&#xD;
           in moderate stages;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Among 580 patients with mild ARDS at admission to the ICU, in-hospital mortality was&#xD;
           10%, 30%, and 37% for those who improved, persisted, and worsened ARDS, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Finally, PP has been shown to be cost-effective under commonly accepted thresholds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that in patients within the 150-300mmHg PaO2/FIO2 range at the time of ARDS&#xD;
      diagnosis, PP can reduce mortality as compared to a similar group left in the SP.&#xD;
