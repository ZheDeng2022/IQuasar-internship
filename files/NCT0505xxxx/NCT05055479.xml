  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multidrug Resistant (MDR) bacteria have become a major worldwide public health challenge and&#xD;
      hospitals are now increasingly faced with management of local outbreaks involving such&#xD;
      pathogens. Especially, intensive care units (ICU) provide an ideal background for outbreaks&#xD;
      caused by MDR bacteria among which carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) can be&#xD;
      found. Among CPE involved in ICU outbreaks, VIM producers have been reported worldwide, and&#xD;
      described as especially difficult to control. The COVID-19 pandemic and all of the measures&#xD;
      health workers have to implement to fight the spread of SARS-Cov-2 have also impacted the&#xD;
      management of such outbreaks. In this retrospective study, the investigators aim to describe&#xD;
      the management of an outbreak caused by a VIM-producing Enterobacter cloacae strain during&#xD;
      the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in an ICU, and show the importance of concerted measures and&#xD;
      actions implemented at multiple levels to prevent the spread of this MDR strain.&#xD;

      Multidrug Resistant (MDR) bacteria have become a major worldwide public health challenge and&#xD;
      hospitals are now increasingly faced with management of local outbreaks involving such&#xD;
      pathogens. Especially, intensive care units (ICU) provide an ideal background for outbreaks&#xD;
      caused by MDR bacteria among which carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) can be&#xD;
      found. Among CPE involved in ICU outbreaks, VIM producers have been reported worldwide, and&#xD;
      described as especially difficult to control. The COVID-19 pandemic and all of the measures&#xD;
      health workers have to implement to fight the spread of SARS-Cov-2 have also impacted the&#xD;
      management of such outbreaks. The likely source of an outbreak is not always easy to&#xD;
      pinpoint, but some common sources can be cited: an index patient with a history of&#xD;
      hospitalization abroad, a contaminated instrument, and/or an environmental reservoir. CPE&#xD;
      outbreaks in ICU usually have multifactorial origins, thus needing to combine several actions&#xD;
      to be controlled. Infection and prevention control (IPC) measures habitually rely on patients&#xD;
      screening, use of contact precautions, staff education, enhanced environmental cleaning,&#xD;
      cohorting of patients and staff as well as a proper antimicrobial stewardship. Investigation&#xD;
      of these outbreaks and implementation of IPC measures are ensured by various professional&#xD;
      categories in the hospital. This implies a tight cooperation and communication between all&#xD;
      involved healthcare workers.&#xD;
