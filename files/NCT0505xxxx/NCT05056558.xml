  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is multicenter clinical trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of Baricitinib in&#xD;
      treatment for COVID-19. This trial will compare Baricitinib, a drug recommended for&#xD;
      Rheumatoid Arthritis, against standard of care, to assess its relative effectiveness against&#xD;
      COVID-19. By enrolling patients in multiple centers, this trial aims to recruit more patients&#xD;
      to evaluate whether this drug slow disease progression or improve survival. Currently no&#xD;
      effective therapeutics treatment or vaccine is available in the world for this highly&#xD;
      transmissible respiratory borne infection, Covid-19. A number of drug trials are ongoing to&#xD;
      measure the efficacy of the drug against the virus. Bangladesh as a resource limited country&#xD;
      with limitation to provided health care services to the huge number of Covid-19 patients who&#xD;
      will need hospitalization will be benefited from this study. There is no physical,&#xD;
      psychological, social, legal risk in this study. The trial therapeutic will be approved form&#xD;
      the Directorate of drug Administration (DGDA), Bangladesh.&#xD;

    <measure>Clinical status assessed by a 7-point ordinal scale on Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>The ordinal scale is an assessment of the clinical status at a given study day. Each day, the worst(ie, lowest ordinal) score from the previous day will be recorded, ie, on Day 3, the lowest ordinal score from Day 2 is obtained and recorded for Day 2. The scale is as follows:&#xD;
Death&#xD;
Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO&#xD;
Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices&#xD;
Hospitalized, requiring low flow supplemental oxygen&#xD;
Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care (COVID-19 related or otherwise)&#xD;
Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer requires ongoing medical care (other than per protocol Baricitinib administration)&#xD;
Not hospitalized</description>
