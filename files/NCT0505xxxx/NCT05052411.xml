      This project will involve beta testing of the JomPrEP app to assess its usability and&#xD;
      acceptability among Malaysian MSM.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the evolving HIV epidemic among MSM and their challenges with accessing prevention&#xD;
      services, we previously proposed to adapt, expand, and refine an existing app (namely the&#xD;
      HealthMindr app) to deliver an integrated HIV prevention intervention that will promote HIV&#xD;
      testing and linkage to PrEP and that incorporates screening and support for P/SUD for&#xD;
      Malaysian MSM. We now plan to conduct expanded beta testing of the newly designed JomPrEP app&#xD;
      to assess its usability and acceptability among Malaysian MSM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following wireframing and usability testing, Keymind (an experienced mobile app development&#xD;
      company that has significant experience in building HIPAA-compliant apps, including&#xD;
      HealthMindr) will apply a user interface (UI) design (i.e., colors/branding) to the&#xD;
      interactive prototype, followed by the final development of the app (beta version). The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to beta test this app to identify potential bugs and to ensure its&#xD;
      usability in a real-world setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the expanded beta testing, we will also evaluate the design, functionality, and&#xD;
      usability of the JomPrEP app. This step is a critical stage of app development and will&#xD;
      increase the ability of our research team to develop an acceptable and effective app.&#xD;

    <description>All participants will be given a brief overview of the purpose of the study followed by a survey on participant characteristics and barriers to accessing HIV testing and PrEP uptake and P/SUD support services. The participant will be observed downloading the JomPrEP app and instructed with a brief tutorial on the onboarding process. The participant will be told to keep the app for 3 months and encouraged to use all app components. At 30 and 60 days, the participants will be delivered brief periodic assessments and will provide a synthesis of issues that have emerged. At 90 days, the participant will complete a post-survey, to which the Systems Usability Scale will be added. App analytics will also be collected (e.g., the number of logins). Participants will be asked to provide feedback on functionality, performance, and errors encountered, motivation to use the app, overall experiences using the app, feedback for further refinement, and subjective impact of the app on HIV prevention.</description>
