    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the correct dose and safety of combining two new&#xD;
      cancer drugs, loncastuximab tesirine and venetoclax, as a treatment for relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory B cell lymphoma.These drugs are used to treat some lymphomas, but have not yet&#xD;
      been tested in combination for the treatment of lymphoma. The main goal of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the safety of the combination.&#xD;

      This is a phase I trial designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of loncastuximab&#xD;
      tesirine given in combination with venetoclax for treatment of relapsed/refractory non -&#xD;
      Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Loncastuximab tesirine is an investigational (experimental) drug that works by targeting a&#xD;
      protein in cancer cells (called CD19) and delivering a small amount of chemotherapy directly&#xD;
      to the cancer cells. Loncastuximab tesirine is experimental because it is not approved by the&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Venetoclax, is a targeted anti-cancer drug, which works&#xD;
      by imitating a particular protein produced by the tumor and interrupting its normal&#xD;
      processes, ultimately causing the tumor cells to die. Adding venetoclax to the loncastuximab&#xD;
      tesirine regimen is believed to increase the chance of getting relapsed or refractory B cell&#xD;
      lymphoma cancer in remission. Venetoclax is approved by the FDA for treatment in some types&#xD;
      of cancer, but is not approved by the FDA for the treatment of lymphoma soit is considered&#xD;
      experimental in this study. Up to 36 subjects will take in this phase I research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective for this study: To determine the safety and tolerability of the&#xD;
      combination of loncastuximab tesirine and venetoclax to identify the recommended phase 2 dose&#xD;
      (RP2D) of these agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the adverse event profile of the combination of loncastuximab tesirine and&#xD;
           venetoclax.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the overall response rate (ORR) and complete response rate (CRR) of&#xD;
           relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated with the combination of loncastuximab&#xD;
           tesirine and venetoclax.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) of subjects&#xD;
           with relapsed / refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated with the combination of&#xD;
           loncastuximab tesirine and venetoclax.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the disease-free survival, the disease specific survival and time to&#xD;
           treatment failure of subjects with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated with&#xD;
           the combination of loncastuximab tesirine and venetoclax.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Adequate hepatic function, with transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT],&#xD;
             aspartate aminotransferase [AST], and gamma glutammyltransferase [GGT]) ≤ 2.5 times&#xD;
             the upper limit of normal;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN (unless bilirubin rise is due to Gilbert's syndrome or of&#xD;

             potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or&#xD;
             use a contraceptive method with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year during the treatment&#xD;
             period and for at least 30 days after the last dose of venetoclax and at least 9&#xD;
             months after the last dose of loncastuximab tesirine for women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, has&#xD;
             not reached a postmenopausal state (&lt; 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no&#xD;
             identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization&#xD;
             (removal of ovaries and/or uterus).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include bilateral&#xD;

        hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the&#xD;
        clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence&#xD;
        (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not&#xD;
        acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use&#xD;
        contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        --With female partners of childbearing potential, men must remain abstinent or use a condom&#xD;
        plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of &lt; 1% per&#xD;
        year during the treatment period and for at least 6 months after the last dose of&#xD;
        loncastuximab. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        With pregnant female partners, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during the&#xD;
        treatment period and for at least 6 months after the last dose of loncastuximab to avoid&#xD;
        exposing the embryo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the&#xD;
        clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence&#xD;
        (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not&#xD;
        acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
