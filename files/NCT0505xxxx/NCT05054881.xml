  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In modern anesthesiology, peripheral nerve blocks are performed using ultrasound control and&#xD;
      electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves (PEN), or only ultrasound control or only PEN.&#xD;
      The most effective methods are with the use of ultrasound control. Until now, the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the sciatic nerve blockade by the subgluteal approach, performed only under&#xD;
      ultrasound control without ESP, in comparison with the blockade of the sciatic nerve&#xD;
      performed under ultrasound control with ESP, has not been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research hypothesis: the blockade of the sciatic nerve by the subgluteal approach performed&#xD;
      only under ultrasound control has the same effectiveness as the blockade performed under the&#xD;
      ultrasound control with EPN.&#xD;

    <description>The stimulus of the needle prick was applied to check the sensory block of the sciatic nerve. Stimulation with a needle is carried out in the area of innervation of the sciatic nerve below the knee The assessment of skin sensitivity was carried out with the help of a similar scale: + +\ indicating a complete sensory block; +\ indicating a partial sensory block, a patient was unable to differentiate between the type of stimuli ; and -\ indicating that the skin sensitivity was fully preserved.</description>

    <description>Following the ultrasound visualization of the femoral nerve, a insulated injection needle was connected to the nerve stimulator . Under ultrasound visualization guidance, the needle of the electronic nerve stimulator was positioned at the sciatic nerve (in plane) from its lateral side at a slightly superior position . A marker for LA introduction was the visualization of the needle end near the nerve, and a positive muscular response . Subsequently, the introduction of LA solution was initiated.If LA was spreading from the lateral side down to the nerve, then the needle was replaced to the upper point of the nerve and the rest of LA was introduced, and vice versa . The presence of a complete and incomplete spread of LA along the entire circumference of the nerve was assessed. Correspondingly, if the anesthetic was spreading upwardly, the needle would be downwardly replaced.&#xD;
In addition, a femoral nerve block is performed.</description>

    <description>Under ultrasound visualization guidance, the needle owas positioned at the sciatic nerve (in plane) from its lateral side at a slightly superior position . A marker for LA introduction was the visualization of the needle end near the nerve. Subsequently, the introduction of LA solution was initiated. The position of the needle was corrected 1-2 times according to the type of anesthetic spread. If LA was spreading from the lateral side down to the nerve, then the needle was replaced to the upper point of the nerve and the rest of LA was introduced, and vice versa . The presence of a complete and incomplete spread of LA along the entire circumference of the nerve was assessed. Correspondingly, if the anesthetic was spreading upwardly, the needle would be downwardly replaced.&#xD;
