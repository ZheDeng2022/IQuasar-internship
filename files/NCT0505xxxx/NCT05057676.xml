      The goal of this project is to critically evaluate the effectiveness of using an online&#xD;
      program to improve diet and self-care in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and clinically&#xD;
      isolated syndrome (CIS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once eligibility criteria are determined and consent is obtained, participants would work&#xD;
      through the course modules like a non-graded online course. There are exercises and personal&#xD;
      assessments within the course participants are asked to take to build upon each other to&#xD;
      increase the success of the experience while taking the course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the course there will be modules that will discuss an inner game plan, food&#xD;
      intervention plan, physical intervention plan, and an increased resilience plan. The fourth&#xD;
      module suggests different strategies that participants can do to improve their health beyond&#xD;
      food and exercise. These types of things would include supplements, light therapy,&#xD;
      detoxification, improved sleep, stress reduction, and other ways to enhance their body's&#xD;
      resilience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators ask that participants inform and work with their healthcare team to personalize&#xD;
      their treatment and determine if the suggested strategies mentioned in the course are&#xD;
      appropriate for their healthcare path. This will provide dietary education to a larger sample&#xD;
      size compared to what has been studied in the past. The study may include more patients that&#xD;
      have limited resources, including but not limited to, money and location for access to&#xD;
      registered dietitians with expertise in dietary instruction for patient s diagnosed with&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis and CIS. There is interest in education and support that can be delivered&#xD;
      via an online platform that can lead to improved diet quality and self-care routines for&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis and autoimmune patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use a randomized single-blind wait list control design to evaluate the impact&#xD;
      of an online course that teaches the modified Paleolithic diet, nutrient dense vegetarian&#xD;
      diet and Mediterranean diets, stress reduction and exercise strategies using commercially&#xD;
      available online course for autoimmune patients. Data will be collected in the short-term&#xD;
      (after 3 months) and long-term (at the end of 6 months ) to analyze the impact of an online&#xD;
      wellness program QoL and related outcomes among people with CIS and MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use a 7-day window to collect baseline assessments. Participants will use a&#xD;
      personal email that does not contain identifying information to participate in the study.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete all baseline assessments. This email and password will&#xD;
      be used for access to the online course materials. Patients will be randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention arm based upon the baseline modified fatigue impact score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive access to the online program and 7 group support videos (released one&#xD;
      per week or 7 weeks total). Participants will access the course materials using the study&#xD;
      assigned email.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will consist of virtual-only participants and will have 3 virtual visits&#xD;
      every 3 months (months 0, 3, and 6). Online questionnaires will be sent to the participants&#xD;
      to assess fatigue and quality of life. Dietary assessments will include a questionnaire&#xD;
      through a web-based tool after baseline, at month 3, and month 6.&#xD;
