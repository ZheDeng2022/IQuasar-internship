  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional improvements are reached in patients with primary total hip arthroplasty compared&#xD;
      to the pre-operative term however some problems as continued range of motion limitations,&#xD;
      loss of joint proprioception sensation, and resulting balance and gait disorders may result&#xD;
      in failure of the Four Square Step Test. Therefore, the need for the apply of the Modified&#xD;
      Four Square Step Test in individuals with primary THA is necessary. The aim of this study is&#xD;
      to evaluate the test-retest reliability, concurrent validity and minimal detectable change of&#xD;
      the Modified Four Square Step Test in individuals with primary total hip arthroplasty.&#xD;

      Roos et al. improved the Modified Four-Square Step Test to complete the test by stroke&#xD;
      patients and not to fall due to practices of the test while performing the test. The Modified&#xD;
      Four Square Step Test variates from the The Four Square Step Test is that the person is not&#xD;
      asked to look ahead during the test, and instead of using a cane, tapes are used to prevent&#xD;
      people from losing their balance by tripping over the obstacle. Thus, although the height of&#xD;
      the obstacle is reduced, the boundaries of the obstacle are preserved.&#xD;
