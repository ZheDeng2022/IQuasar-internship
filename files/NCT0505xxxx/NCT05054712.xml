  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been extensively studied in the context of type&#xD;
      2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) due to its higher prevalence and its association with obesity and&#xD;
      syndrome metabolic, a well-established risk factor for NAFLD. Although several studies have&#xD;
      reported the accumulation of liver fat in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D), the&#xD;
      prevalence, etiology, and the consequences of NAFLD in patients with T1D are poorly&#xD;
      characterized, requiring more studies in this field. In addition, liver involvement at the&#xD;
      metabolic level in patients with T1D raises the differential diagnosis between NAFLD and&#xD;
      glycogen hepatopathy (GH), a rare complication associated with the poorly metabolic control&#xD;
      of diabetes and probably underdiagnosed, since the ultrasound pattern is the same than the&#xD;
      NAFLD. The investigators have designed a cross-sectional observational study with the&#xD;
      objective of describing the prevalence of metabolic liver diseases (NAFLD and GH) in the&#xD;
      population of patients with T1D in the healthcare area of Hospital del Mar and Hospital de&#xD;
      Vilafranca, as well as studying the relationship of these pathologies with the degree of&#xD;
      metabolic control, the presence of metabolic syndrome and the presence of micro and&#xD;
      macrovascular complications.&#xD;
