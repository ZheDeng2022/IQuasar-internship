  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical courses of COVID-19 in children are reportedly mild, and may therefore readily&#xD;
      escape diagnosis. Prolonged intestinal virus shedding has been reported in children, thus&#xD;
      rendering the pediatric population a potentially important source of virus transmission.&#xD;
      However, the infectious potential of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      coronavirus type 2) excreted in the stool has remained enigmatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that stools carrying the virus can represent a source of&#xD;
      infection, at least in a proportion of instances, and therefore intend to screen stools of&#xD;
      children admitted to the hospital regardless of the indication in order to assess the&#xD;
      frequency of intestinal virus excretion. The screening will be performed by validated RTQ-PCR&#xD;
      (reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction) assays. In positive cases,&#xD;
      stool extracts will be used to inoculate permissive cells (e.g. VeroE6) under BSL3 (Biosafety&#xD;
      Level 3) conditions, and the infectious potential of the viruses will be determined. The&#xD;
      readout will be based on the assessment of cell cytopathic effects and on the expression of&#xD;
      subgenomic mRNA. it is expected to recruit ~100 patients for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the investigators will specifically examine children admitted to the hospital&#xD;
      because of COVID-19, and will determine the temporal correlation between viral loads in the&#xD;
      upper respiratory tract (URT) and serial stool specimens using RTQ-PCR. Longitudinal studies&#xD;
      on the infectious potential of viruses from the URT and stool will be performed using the&#xD;
      experimental approach outlined above. For this part of the study, is is intended to recruit&#xD;
      ~100 children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, samples derived from &gt;200 patients from our biorepository will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The insights gained from the study will greatly expand the knowledge on the epidemiological&#xD;
      and clinical significance of SARS-CoV-2 infections in children. If stools are identified as a&#xD;
      potential source of infection, the data will have an important impact on safety measures in&#xD;
      specific settings such as the kindergarten.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overt COVID-19 is reportedly far less frequent children. In a study from China, children &lt;10&#xD;
      years of age represented only 0.9% and children between 10-19 years of age only 1.2% of the&#xD;
      diagnostically confirmed cases1. Very similar data were published by the Italian registry,&#xD;
      indicating 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively2. In the largest pediatric study published to date&#xD;
      including &gt;2000 children, 4% had asymptomatic courses, 90% had mild or moderate clinical&#xD;
      courses, and severe manifestations were documented in 6% of cases, mostly involving infants&#xD;
      below 1 year of age3. Some reports indicated asymptomatic courses in as many as 16-30% of&#xD;
      affected children within individual age groups3,4. In addition to common symptoms such as&#xD;
      fever and dry cough (40-100% of cases), diarrhea was a frequent observation in children with&#xD;
      COVID-19 (10-30% of cases), in contrast to adults with overt disease (4% of cases) 5-11.&#xD;
      Virus shedding into the stool was commonly observed in children for more than one month after&#xD;
      resolution of acute infection7,10. However, the infectious potential of intestinal virus&#xD;
      shedding, which has been demonstrated for the related viruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Middle&#xD;
      East Respiratory syndrome coronavirus), is currently unclear for SARS-CoV-212,13. Due to the&#xD;
      mild or even asymptomatic courses of COVID-19, children might represent an important source&#xD;
      of disease transmission. With the increasing numbers of adults who are vaccinated and the&#xD;
      appearance of new variants of the virus displaying different properties, the situation in&#xD;
      children might certainly change and may need to be reevaluated. The proposed study in&#xD;
      collaboration with different pediatric facilities in Austrian hospitals therefore offers an&#xD;
      excellent opportunity to address different aspects of COVID-19 pertaining to the pediatric&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Shedding of SARS-CoV-2 into the stool is detectable in a proportion of asymptomatic&#xD;
           children&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In patients with COVID-19, the frequency of intestinal virus excretion is higher and&#xD;
           persists for prolonged time periods post infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Viruses excreted with the stool may display infectious potential&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study period of 12 months, it is intended to investigate ~500 pediatric patients&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital for reasons unrelated to COVID-19, with the aim to screen for the&#xD;
      occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 shedding into the stool in children who are not suspected to carry&#xD;
      the virus. The indicated number of pediatric patients to be recruited is based on the maximum&#xD;
      achievable number within the outlined study period. Currently, it is not possible to predict&#xD;
      the proportion of patients with intestinal excretion of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, the&#xD;
      investigators will screen ~100 pediatric patients with COVID-19 to determine the frequency&#xD;
      and duration of intestinal virus shedding. The majority of patients will only be investigated&#xD;
      upon admission to the hospital and follow-up samples will be obtained in patients who tested&#xD;
      positive at first analysis to document the duration of virus detectability. Furthermore,&#xD;
      biomaterial stored in a biorepository, including stool specimens from pediatric patients who&#xD;
      were hospitalized for a variety of indications, will be analyzed to determine the&#xD;
      detectability of SARS-CoV-2 by molecular screening, and positive cases will be subjected to&#xD;
      further analysis, as specified below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular testing of SARS-CoV-2 will be performed by a validated and certified RTQ-PCR assay&#xD;
      established according to guidelines of the German reference center, the Robert Koch Institute&#xD;
      in Berlin. Processing of clinical specimens will be carried out in line with pertinent&#xD;
      biosafety regulations. The testing for infectious properties of SARS-CoV-2 pathogens detected&#xD;
      in clinical specimens including particularly stool (and potentially nasopharyngeal swabs)&#xD;
      will be carried out in a BSL3 facility (in collaboration with Prof. Dr. Willinger, Medical&#xD;
      University of Vienna) by using permissive cell lines (VeroE6, CaCo2, or HCT116) under&#xD;
      appropriate culture conditions. The readout will be based on the documentation of cell&#xD;
      cytopathic effects and expression of subgenomic mRNA using established RTQ-PCR tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection and handling logistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective analyses - stool samples (and various control specimens from other sites&#xD;
      including swabs from the pharynx, oral cavity, nose, and palms) will be collected and stored&#xD;
      at 4°C until transfer to the central laboratory, Labdia Labordiagnostik. The samples will be&#xD;
      transferred in line with the biosafety regulations (UN3373) by a rapid delivery service (EMS&#xD;
      or similar), to ensure arrival of the samples within three days (usually on the same day).&#xD;
      Upon receipt, samples will be processed immediately (virus elution in phosphate buffered&#xD;
      saline) and subjected to molecular analysis. In positive cases, stool extracts will be used&#xD;
      as quickly as possible to inoculate permissive cells (e.g. VeroE6) under BSL3 safety&#xD;
      conditions, and the infectious potential of the viruses will be determined. The readout will&#xD;
      be based on the assessment of cell cytopathic effects and on the expression of subgenomic&#xD;
      mRNA.Primary samples and isolated RNA will be stored at Labdia in a dedicated freezer at&#xD;
      -80°C until the end of the study, and will be discarded thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective analyses - biomaterial that was collected and stored in a biorepository of&#xD;
      Labdia Labordiagnostik&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations and statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval for the study and informed consent for participation in the study from the&#xD;
      patients and/or their legal representatives as well as the staff members has been obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal data will be available exclusively in the certified clinical laboratory, Labdia&#xD;
      Labordiagnostik, performing the diagnostic testing. Data processing for the present study&#xD;
      will be done in a pseudonymized manner by assigning serial numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In line with the principal aims of the study, Fisher´s exact test will be employed for&#xD;
      comparing the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 detectability in pharyngeal and stool specimens, and&#xD;
      for assessing the occurrence of infectious virus in stool specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcome and future plans:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the relative paucity of data on COVID-19 in specific pediatric settings, the proposed&#xD;
      study will provide important insights into the clinically and epidemiologically relevant&#xD;
      topics outlined above. The data obtained will serve as basis for ensuing large-scale studies&#xD;
      addressing the infectious potential of intestinal shedding of the virus, and the measures&#xD;
      required for various children facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing for infectious properties of SARS-CoV-2 pathogens detected in clinical specimens&#xD;
      including particularly stool (and potentially nasopharyngeal swabs) will be carried out by&#xD;
      using permissive cell lines (VeroE6, CaCo2, or HCT116) under appropriate culture conditions.&#xD;
      The readout will be based on the documentation of cell cytopathic effects and expression of&#xD;
      subgenomic mRNA using established RTQ-PCR tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, the collection of samples will be performed at a single time point in each&#xD;
      patient, upon admission to the hospital. Within the prospective part of the study, follow-up&#xD;
      samples will be collected from patients with COVID-19 displaying virus shedding into the&#xD;
      stool. For the assessment of cytopathic effects and expression of subgenomic mRNA, fresh&#xD;
      samples will be used, whenever possible. In all other instances, samples will be frozen at&#xD;
      -80°C, and analyzed at a later point using an established protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the apparently common occurrence of prolonged intestinal SARS-CoV-2 shedding in&#xD;
      children, who may not display any disease symptoms, it is of paramount importance to&#xD;
      understand whether this putative way of virus transmission is of clinical and epidemiological&#xD;
      relevance, as a basis for developing appropriate protection measures. Elucidation of the&#xD;
      modes of transmission is critical for current and future approaches to the containment of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 spreading.&#xD;
