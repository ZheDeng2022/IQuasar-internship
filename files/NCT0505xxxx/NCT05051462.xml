  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of systemic / family constellation&#xD;
      therapy in improving mild-moderate psychopathological symptoms and overall wellbeing in the&#xD;
      general population. Given the limited amount of evidence on this therapeutic method, special&#xD;
      attention will be given to monitor potential adverse outcomes to establish intervention&#xD;
      safety. The study will use a randomized, wait-list controlled design and a 6-month follow-up&#xD;
      time. This is the second study of this nature following a similar study from Germany.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Brief Symptom Inventory scores</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Symptom Inventory is a a broad-spectrum measure of psychopathology covering 9 symptom dimensions: Somatization, Obsessive-compulsive symptoms, Interpersonal sensitivity, Depression, Anxiety, Hostility, Phobic anxiety, Paranoid ideation, and Psychoticism. The BSI also includes a global index of distress (the General Severity Index, GSI) that reflects the mean of all items.</description>

    <measure>Change in eating disorder risk assessed by the SCOFF screening test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The SCOFF consists of five yes-or-no type questions assessing eating disorder symptoms or risk factors. Higher scores (ranging between 0 and 5) are indicative of greater risk. At least two positive answers (score of 2) indicate a high likelihood of an eating disorder.</description>

    <measure>Change in substance- and behavioral addiction severity using an abbreviated, 8-item version of the Screener for Substance and Behavioral Addictions (SSBA-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The SSBA-S is a short screening instrument for measuring self-attributed addiction problems in the general population. The SSBA-S is comprised of four self-report item stems, each reflecting a distinct sign or symptom of potentially problematic involvement in either substance-related or behavioral addictions (&quot;I did it too much;&quot; &quot;Once I started, I couldn't stop;&quot; &quot;I felt I had to do it in order to function;&quot; and &quot;I continued to do it, even though it caused problems&quot;). Scores range between 4 and 28 both for substance-related and behavioral addictions with higher scores indicative of higher problem severity.</description>

    <measure>Change in quality of life specific to interpersonal relationships using the Experience in Personal Social Systems Questionnaire (EXIS.pers)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The EXIS.pers assesses the subjective experiences of the individual in their personal social system (e.g. family, circle of friends) covering four dimensions in relation to belonging, autonomy, accord, and confidence. Scores range between 12 and 72 with higher scores are indicative of better functioning.</description>

    <measure>Change in perceived level of meaning in life using the Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The MLQ assesses both the presence of and search for meaning in a respondent's life. The scale consists of 10 items (5 items measuring both subconstructs). In both cases, scores range between 5 and 35 but while in the case of presence of meaning, higher scores indicate better functioning; in the case of search for meaning, higher scores are indicative of poorer mental health.</description>

    <intervention_name>Family / systemic constellation therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>Family / systemic constellation therapy is a short-term group counseling intervention aiming to help clients better understand and resolve their conflicts within their personal systems, which in turn might lead to a decrease in psychopathological or functional somatic symptoms. The personal system addressed is most often the family but other inter- or intrapersonal systems (e.g., ego parts, victim-perpetrator dyads) can also be the target of the intervention.</description>
