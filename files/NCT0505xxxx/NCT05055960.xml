      Stroke is a common condition which results in significant disability for patients. There are&#xD;
      different causes of stroke, but around one quarter are as a result of clots or other material&#xD;
      from the heart lodging in blood vessels in the brain, stopping the blood supply to that area.&#xD;
      Atrial fibrillation is a common cause of blood clots which go to the brain and can be easily&#xD;
      treated with blood thinning medications, which significantly reduce the risk of further&#xD;
      strokes. However, at the moment, atrial fibrillation is difficult to identify, and heart&#xD;
      monitoring can be needed for up to one year. This significantly delays starting blood&#xD;
      thinning medications and leaves patients at risk of stroke during this time. Therefore,&#xD;
      better ways of picking up strokes caused by atrial fibrillation are needed. One such method&#xD;
      may be to use brain scans which are routinely taken at the time a patient presents with an&#xD;
      acute stroke. By using mathematical models to work out the source of stroke, we may be able&#xD;
      to determine which strokes are caused by atrial fibrillation at the time the patient presents&#xD;
      with their stroke. This would reduce the number of investigations patients under-go, saving&#xD;
      money for the NHS, and reducing the number of tests patients have. Therefore, the aim of this&#xD;
      project is to create an anonymised database of brain scans from patients who have presented&#xD;
      to hospital with a stroke to develop and test these recently developed models to see if they&#xD;
      can accurately identify which strokes are caused by atrial fibrillation, and which ones are&#xD;
      not. This project has the potential to improve patient outcomes by reducing treatment delays&#xD;
      and improving the accuracy of the diagnosis of the stroke source.&#xD;

      Stroke affects more than 100 000 people each year in the UK, and up to 50% of patients are&#xD;
      left with significant disability [1, 2]. 85% of strokes result from occluded blood vessels in&#xD;
      the brain (acute ischaemic stroke [AIS]), interrupting the blood supply and resulting in&#xD;
      tissue infarction and functional impairment [1]. Stroke is responsible for significant&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality, with considerable social and economic implications, particularly for&#xD;
      working age individuals [1, 2]. The cause of AIS can be broadly classified as embolic and&#xD;
      non-embolic stroke [3]. Approximately one quarter of AIS is cardioembolic, due to embolism&#xD;
      from the left atrium (atrial fibrillation - AF), valves (valvular heart disease or prosthetic&#xD;
      valves), recent myocardial infarction, patent foramen ovale, infective endocarditis, or&#xD;
      aortic arch atheroma [3-5]. This figure is higher amongst older adults due to rising&#xD;
      prevalence of AF with age [6]. Importantly, cardioembolic strokes are more severe, resulting&#xD;
      in greater disability than other stroke sub-types [4]. Due to improving standards in vascular&#xD;
      risk factor management, the proportion of strokes resulting from cardioembolism is rising,&#xD;
      having tripled in incidence over the last few decades [4]. Correct identification and&#xD;
      management of an embolic source can reduce recurrence by up to 70% [4]. AF remains the&#xD;
      leading cause of cardioembolic stroke [4, 5]. However, correctly identifying and treating AF&#xD;
      is thought to occur in only 50% of eligible patients [3]. This may be due to clinician&#xD;
      reluctance to anticoagulate patients, particularly in the frail older population at high risk&#xD;
      of falls [3]. Up to 25% of stroke is embolic of undetermined source (ESUS), which may be due&#xD;
      to paroxysmal AF requiring prolonged cardiac monitoring to successfully identify and treat&#xD;
      patients [3, 7]. AF is asymptomatic in up to 40% of patients, and the first presentation may&#xD;
      be with a significant infarction [8]. Anticoagulation is the cornerstone of reducing stroke&#xD;
      risk in AF, but with up to a two-fold increase in bleeding risk this treatment is reserved&#xD;
      only for proven cases [9, 10]. Anticoagulation in ESUS remains an ongoing debate, and is&#xD;
      currently limited to high risk groups (e.g. multiple infarcts in different territories) [11,&#xD;
      12]. Thus, identifying and treating AF is a key priority to reduce future stroke risk, but&#xD;
      minimise complications where anticoagulation is not indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the differing aetiologies, investigation, and management of embolic and non-embolic&#xD;
      stroke, early differentiation facilitates clinical decision making, and allows focussed&#xD;
      investigation and management for patients. Radiological features of stroke can support this&#xD;
      process as the location, size, and pattern of the infarction, can indicate the likely&#xD;
      aetiology and stroke sub-type. However, at present there are no criteria by which this is&#xD;
      assessed, relying on a qualitative and thus subjective, opinion of the treating clinician or&#xD;
      radiologist. Inaccurate diagnosis has been reported in up to one third of lacunar strokes&#xD;
      relying on clinical and CT findings alone [13]. The majority of false positive findings were&#xD;
      due to cardioembolic or large artery stroke, potentially resulting in missed opportunity to&#xD;
      identify and treat AF [13]. Diffusion weighted imaging can improve the diagnosis of lacunar&#xD;
      infarction but its use is limited by cost and availability [13-15]. In a recent study of 133&#xD;
      patients with ESUS, 22.6% were found to have AF after three months of cardiac monitoring, and&#xD;
      an 8-point risk score could predict this with reasonable accuracy (area under the curve=0.70)&#xD;
      [16]. However this accuracy falls considerably where the aetiology of stroke remains&#xD;
      undetermined [16]. The true proportion of AF that goes undetected remains unknown, and&#xD;
      earlier detection through predictive modelling could potentially reduce investigation and&#xD;
      treatment delays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, improving the processes by which embolic stroke, particularly AF, may help guide&#xD;
      clinical decision making. This would allow better tailoring of investigations to patients,&#xD;
      removing unnecessary tests that could have potential economic benefits to the NHS, and&#xD;
      reducing investigation burden to patients. The development of stroke models that can&#xD;
      integrate clinical information from patients, and scan findings, may be able to provide&#xD;
      improved diagnostic accuracy for stroke-sub type classification and facilitate timely, and&#xD;
      more targeted investigation and treatment. In particular, models capable of differentiating&#xD;
      between different types of embolism may be particularly valuable and prompt extended&#xD;
      monitoring for patients who are most likely to have an AF source.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes a Monte Carlo method developed by JH and EC to simulate strokes [17-20].&#xD;
      This method has recently been adapted using an in silico cerebral vasculature [21] and tested&#xD;
      against stroke images from the Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke (ATLAS) database&#xD;
      (unpublished work). The advantage of using a computationally generated vasculature over&#xD;
      imaging is that there is no lower bound on vessel size and we are able to include vessels in&#xD;
      our model down to the capillary bed. Within the simulations, we can estimate lesion volume as&#xD;
      well as incorporate the differing metabolic demands of grey and white matter. Recently, we&#xD;
      have been able to reproduce stroke images in the anterior, middle, and posterior (ACA, MCA,&#xD;
      PCA respectively) circulations using images from the ATLAS dataset. However, the majority of&#xD;
      lesions in ATLAS were chronic in nature and this does not provide information on how this&#xD;
      model would perform at the &quot;front door&quot; where treatment decisions could be made in a more&#xD;
      timely fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this project seeks to develop an acute stroke scan database to validate these&#xD;
      recently developed simulations against and to determine the accuracy at predicting the source&#xD;
      of embolic stroke in the acute setting. Given the growing application of AI techniques to&#xD;
      clinical medicine, we will compare the ability of this recently developed stroke simulation&#xD;
      model to AI techniques to predict the source of embolic stroke. We will compare the ability&#xD;
      of the models to clinical or radiological opinion. Finally, we will test the combined ability&#xD;
      of the two techniques to determine the source of embolic stroke. Specifically, we will&#xD;
      evaluate the following sources: lacunar, cardioembolic, large vessel atherosclerotic emboli,&#xD;
      and watershed.&#xD;
