      Evaluate safety and immunogenicity of peptide cancer vaccine in patients with hepatocellular&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Ten patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who developed recurrence after surgical&#xD;
      resection are refractory to the available institutional standard of care lines of treatment&#xD;
      will be recruited to received the peptide cancer vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumour antigen peptides will be identified and separated from each patient and then&#xD;
      reinjected with an adjuvant (autologous activated monocytes with autologous tumour derived&#xD;
      heat shock protein 70) by subcutaneous route monthly for 6 months preceded by 300 mg&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide one week before start of the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow up for all cases will be performed clinically, laboratorial, and immunologically for&#xD;
      one year.&#xD;
