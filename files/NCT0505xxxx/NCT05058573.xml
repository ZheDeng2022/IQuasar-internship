      The aim of this course is to investigate the effect of temporomandibular joint relaxation and&#xD;
      myofacial relaxation techniques on quality of life , Joint range of motion, headache,&#xD;
      depression in individuals with tension type headache.&#xD;

      One of the most common complaints in society is headaches. Headaches affect the quality of&#xD;
      life of people and communities.The proportion of people who have experienced headaches at&#xD;
      least once in their lifetime is more than 90% in society, 93% in men and 99% in women.The&#xD;
      causes that are common and cause this discomfort are basically examined under two main&#xD;
      groups.These are grouped as 'primary/primary type headaches and secondary/secondary type&#xD;
      headaches'. Some studies in literature have reported that temporomandibular dysfunction and&#xD;
      headaches are 'comorbid diseases', that the presence of one will increase the symptoms of the&#xD;
      other, and that if the temporomandibular joint disorder and headchache occur together,&#xD;
      symptoms will shows sooner than expected.Some studies in literature have reported that&#xD;
      temporomandibular dysfunction and headaches are 'comorbid diseases', that the presence of one&#xD;
      will increase the symptoms of the other, and that if the temporomandibular joint disorder and&#xD;
      the tension headaches occur together, it will show symptoms sooner than expected. The&#xD;
      International Classification of Headache Disorders decodes the relationship between&#xD;
      temporomandibular joint dysfunctions and headache.it is mentioned that as headache attributed&#xD;
      to temporomandibular joint disorders. Many common points in studies have shown the&#xD;
      Association of temporomandibular dysfunction and tension-type headache. The temporomandibular&#xD;
      joint, one of the most complex joints in the body, is a loose joint that harmonizes between&#xD;
      the mandibular condyle and the mandibular Fossa of the temporal bone decoction. The skull is&#xD;
      the only movable joint between the bones decoction.November: the head and neck are a part of&#xD;
      the stomatognathic system (masticatory system), which includes the muscles of the neck,&#xD;
      chewing November, teeth-ligaments and salivary glands.Temporomandibular joint disorders are a&#xD;
      major problem, covering approximately 5% to 12% of the population.Temporomandibular joint&#xD;
      dysfunction leads to headaches, stiffness-pain in the jaw, restriction in jaw movements and&#xD;
      stress increases TMD has been noted that the patients have difficulty doing daily life&#xD;
      activities. Most Temporomandibular joint problems occur when the muscles around the joint are&#xD;
      affected and pain occurs during the movements of the mandible and decreased functional use of&#xD;
      the temporomandibular November. The muscles in the cervical region are also responsible for&#xD;
      ensuring the stable position of the head, as well as for stabilizing the neck during&#xD;
      movements of the jaw November. All November, the muscles in the craniocervical and facial&#xD;
      region are connected. Temporomandibular joint dysfunctions (TMED) are more common in people&#xD;
      with episodic tension headache (EGBTA) , migraine, and chronic tension headache (KGTBA) than&#xD;
      in those without headache. When we look at literature, there are a limited number of studies&#xD;
      in patients with Temporomandibular joint dysfunction with tension-type headache. Our study&#xD;
      aimed to examine the effectiveness of temporomandibular joint relaxation and myofacial&#xD;
      techniques on quality of life , Joint range of motion, headache, depression in individuals&#xD;
      with tension type headache.&#xD;

    <masking_description>it was calculated that 80% power could be achieved at a 95% confidence level when at least 66 people (at least 22 people for each group) were taken into the study. Therefore, our study Decocking TMJ+myofascial release+ a classic medical treatment (N= 25), TMJ Decocking+ classical medical treatment (N= 25), just the usual medical therapy (N=25) Group 3 group to be 75 individuals will be included. Assessments will be made before and after treatment. Treatment will be carried out in the form of 8 sessions in an average of 20-30 minute sessions 2 days a week for 4 weeks.</masking_description>
