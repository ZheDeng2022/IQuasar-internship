  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic wounds are important economic and health-care problem. Biofilm has been recognized as&#xD;
      a major factor in wound chronicity, delayed healing, and persistent infections, increasing&#xD;
      the need for frequent dressing changes, painful debridement and systemic antimicrobial&#xD;
      treatments influencing quality of life. In the presence of &quot;un-cultivating&quot; bacteria and&#xD;
      limitations of clinical indicators of biofilm presence, there is a need for simple&#xD;
      &quot;screening&quot; diagnostic method for biofilm detection. Chronic wounds of different etiology&#xD;
      often associated with chronic pain reduce working abilities and cause restrictions in&#xD;
      everyday living diminishing patient's quality of life. Efficacy of hyperbaric oxygenation&#xD;
      therapy (HBOT) in treating chronic wound and associated infection has been suggested. This&#xD;
      observational prospective cohort study will be conducted at the Department of undersea and&#xD;
      hyperbaric medicine and Department of dermatovenereology, Clinical Hospital Center Rijeka&#xD;
      during 3-year period from 2021. to 2024. including all patients treated due to chronic wound&#xD;
      irrespective of the ethology. The patients will be evaluated upon enrolment, after 2, 4, 6&#xD;
      weeks, and 3, 6, 9, 12 months period, to clinically evaluate the wound characteristics,&#xD;
      evaluate clinical healing rate, clinical indicators of biofilm and/or infection, need for&#xD;
      additional diagnostic or treatment procedures. The patients in both groups (control and HBOT&#xD;
      group) will be treated with standard treatment (dressings, debridement, antibiotics,&#xD;
      infection control), in addition HBOT sessions will be performed (HBOT group). Impact of&#xD;
      chronic wound and both treatment options to patient related outcome measures will be&#xD;
      evaluated assessing intensity and pain characteristics, quality of life, depression, and&#xD;
      anxiety by means of standardized questionnaires (visual analogue scale, McGill Pain&#xD;
      questionnaire, Wound Quality of Life Index, Health Quality of Life Questionnaire, Beck&#xD;
      depression and anxiety inventory). Microbiological analyses of swabs/biopsies will be&#xD;
      evaluated to determine microbial profile and resistance. Detection and objectivization of&#xD;
      biofilm will be evaluated by standard methods on microbiological isolates (Congo red agar,&#xD;
      tube method, tissue culture plate method) and confocal scanning laser microscopy, and on&#xD;
      clinical samples by light microscopy. Primary and secondary objective will be assessed after&#xD;
      1 year follow-up.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Observational prospective clinical study will be conducted at the Department of undersea and&#xD;
      hyperbaric medicine and Department of Dermatovenereology, Clinical Hospital Center Rijeka,&#xD;
      Rijeka, Croatia during the 3-year period, from 2021. to 2024. The study will include all&#xD;
      patients treated due to chronic wound irrespective of the wound ethology (arterial, diabetic,&#xD;
      venous, decubital, combined etiology, posttraumatic, postamputation, burn, and other), 18&#xD;
      years of age and older, that signed informed consent. The patients will be treated with&#xD;
      standard methods, i.e., dressings, debridement, antibiotics, and bacterial load relief&#xD;
      (control group) and another group will be additionally treated with HBOT (HBOT group).&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria of the study is failure to meet one of the inclusion criteria. The&#xD;
      patients with contraindications for HBOT, absolute or relative, patients on bleomycin&#xD;
      chemotherapy, with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, previous spontaneous pneumothorax,&#xD;
      chronic otitis media or chronic sinusitis, unstable angina pectoris, severe heart failure,&#xD;
      severe dementia, history of seizures, claustrophobia, or significant macroangiopathy with&#xD;
      absent both distal pulses and no positive response following oxygen provocation test on&#xD;
      transcutaneous oximetry that will not benefit from HBOT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size has been calculated based on the available formula for comparing two&#xD;
      independent groups according to qualitative variables with 95% confidence interval. Total&#xD;
      sample size in both groups was estimated to be 62 patients (124 patients in total) with&#xD;
      expected average of 10-15% patients to drop-out from the study, so calculated total sample&#xD;
      size in both groups was estimated to be 70 patients (140 patients in total). Wound healing&#xD;
      rate of 90% and higher is expected to be achieved in HBOT group, while expected healing rate&#xD;
      in control group is expected to be at least 20% lower after 1 year follow-up.&#xD;
      Correspondingly, the same differences are expected to be achieved in control and HBOT group&#xD;
      as regarding manifestations of clinical indications of biofilm presence, clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory signs of infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be enrolled in the study following eligibility screen, informed consent,&#xD;
      collection of patients history and demographic data (age, gender, marital status, children,&#xD;
      education level, profession, employment) with special emphasizes to comorbidities and risk&#xD;
      factors (diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, peripheral&#xD;
      arterial diseases) physical examination, clinical wound assessment and evaluation including&#xD;
      following: wound number; wound location; wound size (width, length and depth in cm, and&#xD;
      calculated wound surface in cm2 and wound volume in cm3); wound duration (days); type of the&#xD;
      wound (arterial, diabetic, venous, decubital, combined etiology, other); wound status&#xD;
      (stagnant, deteriorating, improving, healed); clinical signs of wound infection (heat/warmth,&#xD;
      erythema, increased exudate, purulent exudate, increased pain, discolored granulation tissue,&#xD;
      friable granulation tissue, oedema, wound foul odour, delayed healing, suspected biofilm;&#xD;
      clinical indications of wound biofilm presence (excessive moisture and wound exudate,&#xD;
      low-level of erythema, low-level of chronic inflammation, history of antibiotic failure even&#xD;
      with appropriate antibiotic or antimicrobial treatment, cycles of recurrent&#xD;
      infection/exacerbation, delayed healing, recalcitrant wound to antimicrobial or antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment); wound bed status (approximate % of tissues present in the wound bed rated as&#xD;
      necrotic, sloughy, granulation, suspected biofilm, epithelialization); exudate level (level,&#xD;
      type); condition of surrounding skin (healthy, macerated, dry/eczematous);&#xD;
      photo-documentation upon enrolment and at every follow-up according to the protocol.&#xD;
      Additional diagnostic procedures will be performed to assess vascular status of the patient&#xD;
      and identify the underlying pathophysiology of the wound and the wound type (pulse palpation,&#xD;
      Ankle-brachial Pressure Index, toe pressure and radiological imaging, including duplex&#xD;
      Doppler ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) imaging,&#xD;
      transcutaneous oximetry), as well as laboratory examination, swabs/biopsies for&#xD;
      microbiological examination. Upon enrollment, routine laboratory work-up (C-reactive protein,&#xD;
      complete and differentiate blood count, serum interleukin-6 and pro-calcitonin level, fasting&#xD;
      blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, kidney, and liver tests) and wound swabs/biopsy for&#xD;
      microbiological analyses will be performed, and repeated as indicated during follow-up period&#xD;
      due to clinically suspected signs of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients in control groups will be evaluated upon enrolment, after 2, 4, 6 weeks, 3&#xD;
      months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months period, and in HBOT group after 10, 20, 30 treatments,&#xD;
      3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, for clinical wound assessment and evaluation, and to&#xD;
      evaluate the wound healing rate and status, perform wound assessment, record clinical&#xD;
      indications of biofilm presence and/or signs of infection, laboratory findings, wound&#xD;
      characteristics, the need for antibiotic treatment and hospitalization and perform&#xD;
      photo-documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients in both groups will be treated routinely with standard treatment (dressings,&#xD;
      debridement, antibiotics, and bacterial load relief). The dressing will be performed&#xD;
      according to wound characteristics with change every two days including primary dressing&#xD;
      (alginates, hydrofiber dressing, antimicrobial dressing, gelling fiber dressing), with silver&#xD;
      if infected, and secondary protective dressing (foam with polyurethane) in wounds with formed&#xD;
      granulation tissue. The progression of the wound and the need for specific treatment will be&#xD;
      evaluated and recorded weekly by dermatologist and vascular surgeon specializing in wound&#xD;
      care, and appropriate treatment conducted according to wound assessment (antibiotics,&#xD;
      bandage, dressing change, debridement, amputations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In HBOT group, in addition to standard treatment, the HBOT sessions will be performed 5 days&#xD;
      a week, in multi-place chamber at 2.4 atm absolute (ATA) and 100% O2 with effective treatment&#xD;
      lasting for 90 min. The sessions will be supervised by doctors trained in hyperbaric&#xD;
      medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact of chronic wound and both, standard and combined treatment, to patient related outcome&#xD;
      measures will be evaluated assessing intensity and pain characteristics, quality of life,&#xD;
      depression, and anxiety by means of standardized questionnaires. Intensity and&#xD;
      characteristics of pain will be evaluated using self-assessment scales for evaluating pain:&#xD;
      visual analogue scale -VAS (measured while dressings are in situ, at dressing change, during&#xD;
      debridement, 30 min after dressing change or debridement), and McGill Pain questionnaire upon&#xD;
      enrolment, after 2, 4, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months period. Questionaries&#xD;
      for evaluating quality of life and overall health state of patient will be performed upon&#xD;
      enrolment, after 2, 4, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months period including:&#xD;
      Wound Quality of Life Index (Wound-QoL) and Health Quality of Life Questionnaire (EQ-5D), and&#xD;
      questionaries for evaluating depression and anxiety (Beck depression inventory, Beck anxiety&#xD;
      inventory) will be performed upon enrolment, after 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12&#xD;
      months period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, microbiological analyses of swabs/biopsies will be evaluated using&#xD;
      standardized, routine microbiological, cultural, and automatized procedures, to determine&#xD;
      microbial profile, differences, and microbial resistance. In addition, detection and&#xD;
      objectivization of biofilm will be evaluated using standard methods for biofilm detection&#xD;
      (Tissue culture plate method, Congo red agar method, Tube method), confocal scanning laser&#xD;
      microscopy (using FilmTracer LIVE/DEAD fluorescence assay and FilmTracer SYPRO Ruby Biofilm&#xD;
      Matrix stain, Invitrogen), and on clinical samples, by light microscopy and different&#xD;
      staining methods and procedures (Gram stain, Giemsa stain, Crystal violet stain, Congo red&#xD;
      stain, Periodic acid-Schiff stain, Hematoxylin and eosin stain).&#xD;
