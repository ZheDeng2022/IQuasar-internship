    <textblock>
      This study will include 3 different groups of intervention. First group of knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis patients will be applied both strengthening and 30 minutes bicycle exercises&#xD;
      in the same session, 2 days strecthing exercises and 30 minutes walking will be given in&#xD;
      seperate days as home program, Second group of knee osteoarthritis patients will be applied&#xD;
      both stretching and 30 minutes bicycle exercises in the same session, strengthening exercises&#xD;
      and 30 minutes walking will be given in seperate days as home program.Third group of knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis patients will be applied all stretching, strengthening and 30 minutes bicycle&#xD;
      exercises in the same session, only 30 minutes walking will be given as home program. The&#xD;
      primary outcome measures include the pain, function and the secondary outcome measures&#xD;
      include the joint proprioception. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects on&#xD;
      outcome measures increasing number of exercises in one session and to determine which&#xD;
      exercise types are more suitable to prescribe as a home program.&#xD;

      This study will include 3 different groups of intervention. First group of knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis patients will be applied both strengthening and bicycle exercises in the same&#xD;
      session and strecthing exercises and walking will be given as home program in the days other&#xD;
      than treatment session. Second group of knee osteoarthritis patients will be applied both&#xD;
      stretching and bicycle exercises in the same session and strengthening exercises and walking&#xD;
      will be given as home program in the days other than treatment session. Third group of knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis patients will be applied all stretching, strengthening and bicycle exercises&#xD;
      in the same session and only walking exercise will be given as home program in the days other&#xD;
      than treatment session. The primary outcome measures include the pain, function and the&#xD;
      secondary outcome measures include the joint proprioception. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the effects increasing number of exercises in one session on outcome measures&#xD;
      consisting of pain, function and proprioception. The pain will be evaluated both subjectively&#xD;
      with numeric pain scale and WOMAC scale and objectively with pressure algometer. The function&#xD;
      will be subjectively evaluated with WOMAC scale and objectively evaluated timed get up and go&#xD;
      test, 6 minute walk test and by measuring the knee joint range of motion both in flexion and&#xD;
      extension objectively . The evaluation of joint proprioception will be practiced with&#xD;
      inclinometer. All the groups will be treated 2 days per week. The duration of total treatment&#xD;
      lasts 8 weeks. All the groups practice aerobic exercises 2 days with bicycle ergometer&#xD;
      application in the clinic, and 2 days walking outside as home program. Strecthing exercises&#xD;
      will be applied for knee flexor and knee extensor muscles. Isometric strengthening exercises&#xD;
      will be applied for knee extensor muscles. Isotonic strengthening exercises will be applied&#xD;
      for hip abductor muscles, hip extensor muscles, hip flexor muscles, knee flexor muscles and&#xD;
      knee extensor muscles. The treatment outcomes will be evaluated both at the beginning of&#xD;
      treatment and at the end of treatment.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from WOMAC Score at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>WOMAC questionnaire consisting of 24 items divided into 3 subscales:&#xD;
Pain (5 items): during walking, using stairs, in bed, sitting or lying, and standing upright Stiffness (2 items): after first waking and later in the day Physical Function (17 items): using stairs, rising from sitting, standing, bending, walking, getting in / out of a car, shopping, putting on / taking off socks, rising from bed, lying in bed, getting in / out of bath, sitting, getting on / off toilet, heavy domestic duties, light domestic duties.&#xD;
The increasing scores reflect improvement in function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Numeric Pain Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from NPRS at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The NPRS is a segmented numeric version of the visual analog scale (VAS) in which a respondent selects a whole number (0-10 integers) that best reflects the intensity of his/her pain.The levels of pain felt at rest / activity / night will be evaluated. The increase in pain scores demonstrate that the health status get worse.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Pressure Treshold (PPT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Pain Pressure Treshold at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Pressure Treshold is evaluated via algometric measurement that were taken from 4 point including the mid portion of patella, 4 cm medial to patellar midline, 3 cm lateral to patellar midline, 2 cm above to patellar upper boundary.The increase in algometric measurement demonstrate the development in the pain sensitivity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance and Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Timed Get-up and Go Test at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>''Timed Get-up and Go Test'' is used for the evaluation of balance. The patient starts in a seated position. The patient stands up upon therapist's command: walks 3 meters, turns around, walks back to the chair and sits down. The time stops when the patient is seated. The increase in test duration reflects the balance get worse.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Aerobic Capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from 6 Minute Walk Test at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>&quot;6 Minute Walk Test'' is used for evaluation of Aerobic Capacity. The object of this test is to walk as far as possible for 6 minutes. You will walk back and forth in this hallway. Six minutes is a long time to walk, so you will be exerting yourself. You will probably get out of breath or become exhausted. You are permitted to slow down, to stop, and to rest as necessary. You may lean against the wall while resting, but resume walking as soon as you are able. The increase in distance that is walked in 6 minutes means that the aerobic capacity was developed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proprioception</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Inclinometric measurement at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Proprioception will be evaluated with digital inclinometer from 90 degree knee flexion to 30 degree knee flexion angle. The deviation from this interval reflects that the detoriation appears in terms of proprioception.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from SF-36 at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36, as described in the name, is a 36-item patient-reported questionnaire that covers eight health domains: physical functioning (10 items), bodily pain (2 items), role limitations due to physical health problems (4 items), role limitations due to personal or emotional problems (4 items), emotional well-being (5 items), social functioning (2 items), energy/fatigue (4 items), and general health perceptions (5 items). Scores for each domain range from 0 to 100, with a higher score defining a more favorable health state.</description>
