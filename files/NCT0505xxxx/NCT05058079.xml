  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to determine whether handholding improves patient satisfaction and&#xD;
      reduce patient's anxiety during minimally invasive outpatient spine surgery with monitored&#xD;
      anesthesia care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Minimally invasive spine interventions have emerged as a treatment options for patients with&#xD;
      previous spine surgery and patients who have never before been operated upon. These&#xD;
      procedures can be done safely in patients with advanced comorbid conditions, previous failed&#xD;
      major spine procedures, and in patients who have decided to try the least invasive approach&#xD;
      to address their lumbo-sacral spine condition in hopes of avoiding more major and potentially&#xD;
      morbid procedures. These endoscopic procedures are typically done as outpatients with light&#xD;
      sedation, ideally rendering the patient calm but completely cooperative and able to respond&#xD;
      in real-time to questions from the surgeon during the procedure. This has implications for&#xD;
      the progress and success of the procedure, the safety of the procedure and allows for a short&#xD;
      ambulatory hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hand holding has been shown to improve outcomes such as compliance, procedural success and&#xD;
      patient comfort with patients undergoing light sedation for a variety of procedures. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to determine whether adding hand holding to light sedation for&#xD;
      minimally invasive spine procedures has a positive impact on patient satisfaction and&#xD;
      perioperative outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>11-item questionnaire designed to measure the satisfaction with monitored anesthesia care. The Iowa Satisfaction with Anesthesia Scale (ISAS) score is the mean of responses to all 11questions. The score can range from a min of -3 to a maximum of +3. The responses are : -3 = disagree very much, -2 = disagree moderately, -1 = disagree slightly, 1 = agree slightly, 2 = agree moderately, and 3 = agree very much. A score of +3 would imply a totally satisfied patient.</description>

    <description>The 6-item version of the Spielberger 20-item State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) is a validated short form and correlates well with the standard inventory. It measures state anxiety (how one feels at the moment: &quot;feel questions&quot;) and trait anxiety (how one generally feels: &quot;am questions&quot;). It contains six questions with a Likert scale from 1 to 4 (1=not at all, 2=somewhat, 3=moderately so, 4=very much so) The score range is from a minimum of 6 to a maximum of 24. A low score represents no to low anxiety where as a high score represents high anxiety.</description>
