  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The infectious coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by corona virus SARS-severe&#xD;
      acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused significant disruption in&#xD;
      surgical services to patients globally. Data from the COVIDSurg Cohort Study suggest&#xD;
      mortality rates of patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 in the peri-operative period of up to&#xD;
      25.6% in emergency surgery and 18.9% in elective surgery. Based on estimates by the COVIDSurg&#xD;
      Collaborative, large numbers of elective surgical procedures are cancelled. The COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic has forced healthcare providers to 'shift from patient-centred ethics to public&#xD;
      health ethics'. This has had impact on pre-operative testing for COVID-19, and scheduling of&#xD;
      surgery. Currently, a provisional recommendation to delay surgery for at least four weeks&#xD;
      after a positive COVID test, exists. Weighing the risk of surgery and potential complications&#xD;
      during the COVID-19 pandemic, against the benefit of undergoing a surgical procedure to&#xD;
      improve quality of life, remains difficult. A study to determine the long term effect of the&#xD;
      pandemic on patient-reported outcome may provide guidance on how to safely return to surgical&#xD;
      activity that are again more focused on individualized care. There is also the opportunity to&#xD;
      record outcomes that are currently accepted as the standard for understanding longer term&#xD;
      recovery after surgery.&#xD;

      SACSOS is a patient-centered prospective observational cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, clinical teams in the South African private health care sector will be approached.&#xD;
      In later phases of the study, recruitment will include eligible patients in the South African&#xD;
      public health care sector.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient engagement and -participation will be sought during the recruitment process by&#xD;
      engaging with the clinical team (surgeon, anaesthetist, hospital clinical manager) for&#xD;
      individual patient care (at a micro level); in data collection using a patient-centric&#xD;
      platform; and in the follow up after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation from health care providers will be in a team-based approach, including a&#xD;
      surgeon, an anaesthetist and the hospital manager at each specific center. A call for&#xD;
      collaboration will be extended to hospital management groups, individual hospital managers,&#xD;
      and professional surgical and anaesthesia societies. A core group of participating centers&#xD;
      may be identified which provide surgical services in provinces with highest number of&#xD;
      apparent COVID-19 transmission at the time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will focus on patient participation with the web-based platform as the primary&#xD;
      recruitment method. This will reduce the need for clinician input, and promote greater&#xD;
      patient-centeredness. Patient participation and data capturing require internet access to the&#xD;
      web-based platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dataset is based on variables collected during the first COVIDSurg study. The data&#xD;
      collected will include a patient perspective on urgency of surgery during the pandemic, and&#xD;
      quality of life measures.&#xD;
