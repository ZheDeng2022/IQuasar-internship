      This phase III trial uses the Decipher risk score to guide intensification (for higher&#xD;
      Decipher gene risk) or de-intensification (for low Decipher gene risk) of treatment to better&#xD;
      match therapies to an individual patient's cancer aggressiveness. The Decipher risk score&#xD;
      evaluates a prostate cancer tumor for its potential for spreading. In patients with low risk&#xD;
      scores, this trial compares radiation therapy alone to the usual treatment of radiation&#xD;
      therapy and hormone therapy (androgen deprivation therapy). Radiation therapy uses high&#xD;
      energy x-rays or particles to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Androgen deprivation&#xD;
      therapy blocks the production or interferes with the action of male sex hormones such as&#xD;
      testosterone, which plays a role in prostate cancer development. Giving radiation treatment&#xD;
      alone may be the same as the usual approach in controlling the cancer and preventing it from&#xD;
      spreading, while avoiding the side effects associated with hormonal therapy. In patients with&#xD;
      higher Decipher gene risk, this trial compares the addition of darolutamide to usual&#xD;
      treatment radiation therapy and hormone therapy, to usual treatment. Darolutamide blocks the&#xD;
      actions of the androgens (e.g. testosterone) in the tumor cells and in the body. The addition&#xD;
      of darolutamide to the usual treatment may better control the cancer and prevent it from&#xD;
      spreading.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathologically (histologically or cytologically) proven diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of&#xD;
             the prostate within 270 days prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unfavorable intermediate risk prostate cancer, defined as having ALL the following&#xD;
             bulleted criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has at least one intermediate risk factor (IRF):&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  PSA 10-20 ng/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Clinical stage T2b-c (digital rectal examination [DRE] and/or imaging) by&#xD;
                       American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Gleason score 7 (Gleason 3+4 or 4+3 [ International Society of Urological&#xD;
                       Pathology (ISUP) Grade Group 2-3])&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has ONE or more of the following 'unfavorable' intermediate-risk designators:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  &gt; 1 immature reticulocyte fraction (IRF)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Gleason 4+3=7 (ISUP Grade Group 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  &gt;= 50% of biopsy cores positive&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Biopsies may include 'sextant' sampling of right/left regions of the&#xD;
                            prostate, often labeled base, mid-gland and apex. All such 'sextant'&#xD;
                            biopsy cores should be counted. Men may also undergo 'targeted'&#xD;
                            sampling of prostate lesions (guided by MRI, ultrasound or other&#xD;
                            approaches). A targeted lesion that is biopsied more than once and&#xD;
                            demonstrates cancer (regardless of number of targeted cores involved)&#xD;
                            should count as a single additional positive core sampled and positive.&#xD;
                            In cases of uncertainty, count the biopsy sampling as sextant core(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absence of high-risk features&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Appropriate stage for study entry based on the following diagnostic workup:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History/physical examination within 120 days prior to registration;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Negative bone imaging (M0) within 120 days prior to registration; Note: Tc-99m&#xD;
                  bone scan or sodium fluoride (NaF) positron emission tomography (PET) are&#xD;
                  allowed. Equivocal bone scan findings are allowed if plain films X-ray, computed&#xD;
                  tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are negative for metastasis&#xD;
                  at the concerned site(s). While a negative fluciclovine, choline, or prostate&#xD;
                  specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET may be counted as acceptable substitute for&#xD;
                  bone imaging, any suspicious findings must be confirmed and correlated with&#xD;
                  conventional imaging (Tc-99m bone scan, NaF PET, CT, X-ray, or MRI) to determine&#xD;
                  eligibility based on the latter modalities (e.g. M0 based on conventional imaging&#xD;
                  modalities)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clinically negative lymph nodes (N0) as established by conventional imaging&#xD;
                  (pelvic +/- abdominal CT or MR), within 120 days prior to registration. Patients&#xD;
                  with lymph nodes equivocal or questionable by imaging are eligible if the nodes&#xD;
                  are =&lt; 1.0 cm in short axis and/or if biopsy is negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: While a negative fluciclovine, choline, or prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA)&#xD;
        PET may be counted as acceptable substitute for pelvic imaging, any suspicious findings&#xD;
        must be confirmed by conventional imaging (CT, MRI or biopsy). If the findings do not meet&#xD;
        pathological criteria based on the latter modalities (e.g. node =&lt; 10 mm in short axis,&#xD;
        negative biopsy), the patient will still be eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;= 18&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2 within 120 days&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Non-castrate testosterone level (&gt; 50 ng/dL) within 120 days prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil &gt;= 1,000 cells/mm^3 (within 120 days prior to registration)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 8.0 g/dL, independent of transfusion and/or growth factors (within 120&#xD;
             days prior to registration)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count &gt;= 100,000 cells/mm^3 independent of transfusion and/or growth factors&#xD;
             (within 120 days prior to registration)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt;= 30 mL/min estimated by Cockcroft-Gault equation (within&#xD;
             120 days prior to registration)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For African American patients specifically whose renal function is not considered&#xD;
                  adequate by the formula above, an alternative formula that takes race into&#xD;
                  account (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration CKD-EPI formula)&#xD;
                  should be used for calculating the related estimated glomerular filtration rate&#xD;
                  (GFR) with a correction factor for African American race creatinine clearance for&#xD;
                  trial eligibility, where GFR &gt;= 30 mL/min/1.73m^2 will be considered adequate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin: 1.5 =&lt; institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (within 120 days&#xD;
             prior to registration) (Note: In subjects with Gilbert's syndrome, if total bilirubin&#xD;
             is &gt; 1.5 x ULN, measure direct and indirect bilirubin. If direct bilirubin is less&#xD;
             than or equal to 1.5 x ULN, subject is eligible)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)(serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) and&#xD;
             alanine aminotransferase (ALT)(serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]): =&lt; 2.5 x&#xD;
             institutional ULN (within 120 days prior to registration)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on effective anti-retroviral&#xD;
             therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial;&#xD;
             Note: HIV testing is not required for eligibility for this protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral&#xD;
             load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Known positive test for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBV sAg)&#xD;
                  indicating acute or chronic infection would make the patient ineligible unless&#xD;
                  the viral load becomes undetectable on suppressive therapy. Patients who are&#xD;
                  immune to hepatitis B (anti-Hepatitis B surface antibody positive) are eligible&#xD;
                  (e.g. patients immunized against hepatitis B)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been&#xD;
             treated and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment,&#xD;
             they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Known positive test for hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA)&#xD;
                  indicating acute or chronic infection would make the patient ineligible unless&#xD;
                  the viral load becomes undetectable on suppressive therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient or a legally authorized representative must provide study-specific&#xD;
             informed consent prior to study entry and, for patients treated in the United States&#xD;
             (U.S.), authorization permitting release of personal health information&#xD;
