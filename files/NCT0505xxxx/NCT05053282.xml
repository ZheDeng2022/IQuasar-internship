  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project aims to explore the mechanisms by which lifelong exercise can promote healthy&#xD;
      aging and slow down the negative impact of aging on the muscular system, immunity and the&#xD;
      circadian system. The main goal of the project is to investigate the effect of lifelong&#xD;
      endurance exercise on physical fitness, body composition, bone density and selected hormonal,&#xD;
      biochemical, histological and molecular indicators of metabolic health and circadian clock&#xD;
      function based on blood, immune cell and skeletal muscle tissue analyses in volunteers&#xD;
      differentiated by age and weekly volume of physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that lifelong endurance exercise may have beneficial effects on the&#xD;
      circadian system stability and many, but not all health outcomes. Osteopenia/osteoporosis and&#xD;
      low-grade malnutrition may be more prevalent in the group of endurance-trained senior&#xD;
      runners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve the above research aims, sixty male subjects in total will be recruited&#xD;
      according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Four groups of subjects will differ according&#xD;
      to their age and physical activity levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a group of endurance-trained seniors (age range 65 - 75 year old, n=15) ● a group of&#xD;
           sedentary seniors (age range 65 - 75 year old, n=15)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a group of well endurance-trained young men (age range 20 - 30 year old, n=15) ● a group&#xD;
           of sedentary young men (age range 20 - 30 year old, n=15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects must meet the following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. for athletes' groups: defined as more than 150 minutes of running activity per week; for&#xD;
           young athletes at least 3 years and for master athletes at least 15 years history of&#xD;
           running.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. for groups less active than recommended: no history of regular physical activity&#xD;
           training and no more practice than 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous&#xD;
           intensity per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard inclusion criterion for every group will be body mass index (range 18.5-30&#xD;
      kg/m2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      No experimental study has been published on the potential of life-long exercise to attenuate&#xD;
      the aging-induced disorganization of the circadian system and thus to promote healthy aging.&#xD;
      In this aspect, the proposed study is original and up-to-date. Moreover, also other aspects&#xD;
      of the study, e.g. exercise and inflammaging or the risks (besides the benefits) of the&#xD;
      long-life endurance training on bone tissue etc. have been studied only scarcely. Therefore,&#xD;
      more scientific information is needed before it can be safely prescribed to the aging&#xD;
      population&#xD;
