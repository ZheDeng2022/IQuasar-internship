      Description of the Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Adult Mental Health Practice Support Program (PSP) was designed in 2009 by the General&#xD;
      Practice Services Committee (GPSC) (a joint initiative of the BC Medical Association and the&#xD;
      BC Ministry of Health) to address needs expressed by the province's family physicians to&#xD;
      improve patient care in British Colombia. Its content and delivery model has been designed&#xD;
      using evidence-based key ingredients and implication factors understood to be important for&#xD;
      effective stigma reduction. These include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the use of contact-based education, a well-established best practice to reduce stigma&#xD;
           where patients share their story with a focus on recovery, showing that recovery is not&#xD;
           only possible but the goal;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  skills-building to increase confidence and provide another management option with or&#xD;
           without drugs particularly if access to mental health support services is difficult or&#xD;
           absent;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tools - using the principles of cognitive behavioural theory -- than can be flexibly&#xD;
           used within constraints of a busy practice reflecting a &quot;real world&quot; scenario;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  provider-patient shared responsibility in decision-making, patient engagement in&#xD;
           recovery process&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  practical practice support throughout the training period. The AMHPSP program has been&#xD;
           implemented and evaluated with practicing primary care practitioners in numerous&#xD;
           jurisdictions with positive results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program introduces learners to an organized approach to mental health treatment, starting&#xD;
      from a problem and strength-based assessment through to the development of an action plan,&#xD;
      which, using flow charts, providers can negotiate user-friendly CBT-based self-management&#xD;
      options tailored to patient needs. These tools can be delivered within office time&#xD;
      constraints, reflecting a &quot;real world&quot; scenario. One of the many tools is the AMHPSP&#xD;
      algorithm, which houses all program tools and can be saved on a desktop for easy access at&#xD;
      the click of a button (e.g., several validated screening scales for mental illnesses commonly&#xD;
      seen in primary care, perinatal screening tools, medication algorithm, useful referral forms&#xD;
      etc.) in addition to the three main supported self-management strategies described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Cognitive Behavioral Interpersonal Skills workbook (CBIS) The CBIS manual includes&#xD;
           three main assessment tools: 1) the Diagnostic Assessment Interview; 2) the Problem&#xD;
           List, Problem List Action Plan, and Resource list; and 3) the SAQ self-assessment&#xD;
           questionnaires, all of which engage patient participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The BounceBack program led by the Canadian Mental Health Association consists of a&#xD;
           telephone delivered provincially funded evidence-based skills program designed to help&#xD;
           adults experiencing symptoms of mild to moderate depression, low mood, or stress, with&#xD;
           or without anxiety. Mental health coaches will work with patients usually every 1-2&#xD;
           weeks. The service operates at arm's length of HCPs all the while sending providers&#xD;
           essential information on diagnosis and care course trajectory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary thrust of the program is that all tools are meant to help build a shared&#xD;
      responsibility model with the patient by increasing patient-provider interaction,&#xD;
      negotiation, and partnership. Patients are encouraged to take an active role in the&#xD;
      management of the problems most relevant to them, which in the end engages them in their&#xD;
      recovery effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While previous implementations of the PSP program were delivered in-person, the adapted&#xD;
      version for medical residents will be delivered virtually, to accommodate for any additional&#xD;
      possible disruptions that may be brought about the ongoing COVID-10 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question and Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the research is to assess the extent to which the adapted PSP program is&#xD;
      effective at increasing residents' confidence and comfort in working with patients with&#xD;
      mental health concerns; and decreasing stigmatizing attitudes, including the preference for&#xD;
      social distance. Specific research questions are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that enhanced skills in program participants will lead to increased comfort on&#xD;
      the part of the medical residents, diminished preference for social distance, and improved&#xD;
      attitudes and emotional responses towards patients with mental illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants The intervention will be delivered to approximately 30 residents from the&#xD;
      University of Dalhousie family medicine residency program for the academic year 2021/2022 .&#xD;
      All residents are in the 1st year of their program. The only eligibility criteria are the&#xD;
      provision of informed consent and that the participants are in good standing in their&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The research is an intervention study, using a longitudinal pre-post-follow up&#xD;
      design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be delivered virtually over a total of 4 sessions, covering an 8-week&#xD;
      period. Each training session will take place approximately two weeks apart and will be two&#xD;
      hours in length. A Practice Support Coordinator will support the &quot;action period&quot; work of the&#xD;
      residents in between each of the training sessions. A two hour virtually delivered booster&#xD;
      session will be provided to students approximately one year after the delivery of the initial&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The training will be delivered by cohort. The first cohort will receive the PSP training&#xD;
      September - November 2022. The second cohort will receive the training November 2021 to&#xD;
      February 2022. The third cohort will take the training March to May 2022. Each cohort will&#xD;
      include approximately 10 residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes of Interest&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have identified two primary outcomes, which are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction in stigmatizing attitudes and behaviors from pre to post intervention,&#xD;
           including preference for social distance, attitudes, and emotional responses toward&#xD;
           patients with a mental illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvements in confidence and comfort working with patients with mental health concerns&#xD;
           from pre to post intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confidence and comfort in the use of tools/strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impact of the program on emotional responses to interactions with patients with mental&#xD;
           illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our exploratory outcome of interest is an examination of the correlation between changes in&#xD;
      stigma and changes in comfort or confidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Time Frame: Pre-training, post-training, 6 , 12 and 18 months post -training]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Opening Minds Scale for Health Providers (OMS-HC) Stigma changes will be measured using&#xD;
           the 15 item Opening Minds Scale for Health Providers (OMS-HC), which captures providers'&#xD;
           overall mental health related stigma as well as three main dimensions of stigma:&#xD;
           negative attitudes, health professionals' own willingness to disclose/seek help for a&#xD;
           mental illness, and preference for greater social distance [Time Frame: Pre-training,&#xD;
           post-training, 6 , 12 and 18 months post -training]&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PSP resident study_survey v1F (Confidence Assessment Component) Confidence in managing&#xD;
           depression will be assessed using adaptations of measures used in previous evaluations&#xD;
           of this program with practicing primary care physicians. Confidence, will be assessed by&#xD;
           asking a series of 14 questions where respondents will rate their overall level of&#xD;
           confidence regarding the management of mental health conditions. This will be assessed&#xD;
           by asking respondents to rate their level of confidence from screening to developing an&#xD;
           action plane to treatment which also includes knowledge of community mental health&#xD;
           services, using a 7-point Likert scale (not at all, very low, low, moderate, high, very&#xD;
           high).&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Time Frame: Pre-training, post-training, 6 , 12 and 18 months post -training]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emotion Scale The Emotion scale stigma uses10 item Emotion Scale, assesses perceived&#xD;
      emotional responses to interactions with patients with mental illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Time Frame: Pre-training, post-training, 6 , 12 and 18 months post -training]&#xD;
&#xD;
      PSP resident study_survey v1F (Use of and confidence using tools/strategies learned in the&#xD;
      program) The PSP residency_survey also measures the reported use of and comfort in the use of&#xD;
      tools/skills, which will be assessed through a series of simple yes/no responses pertaining&#xD;
      to if the physician uses the tool, and measure levels of familiarity, confidence and comfort&#xD;
      with program specific tools and skills taught in the program using a 7-point Likert scale&#xD;
      (not at all, very low, low, moderate, high, very high).&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Time Frame: Pre-training, post-training, 6 , 12 and 18 months post -training]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlational analyses using regression techniques will be used to examine the association&#xD;
      between improvements in confidence/comfort and reductions in stigma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will examine changes in mean scores across the different time points, using paired&#xD;
      t-tests. A clinically meaningful outcome is considered as an improvement of 10% on the OMS-HC&#xD;
      from pre to post training, which is slightly higher than the score change observed in a&#xD;
      previous large scale RCT study of the PSP program with practicing physicians in Nova Scotia.&#xD;
      Our calculations indicate that a sample of 26 residents will be required. Under this&#xD;
      assumption, 80% power would be achieved to detect this difference with an alpha value of 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A report on the results of the study will be compiled, with the intention that findings are&#xD;
      publishable in the peer reviewed literature. Study findings will also be presented at&#xD;
      academic conferences.&#xD;

This scale has been widely validated and used in evaluations of anti-stigma interventions in Canada. In 2014, a rigorous examination of the psychometric properties and responsiveness of the OMS-HC scale was conducted by Modgill G, et al. Results from this evaluation showed internal consistency as acceptable for all versions of the OMS scale (α = 0.74 to 0.79) and corresponding subscales (α = 0.67 to 0.68), further depicting the OMS-HC as an accurate and reliable instrument</description>
