  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research project is to determine the feasibility of a larger study aimed&#xD;
      at demonstrating that treatment of tardive dyskinesia with Valbenazine is associated with&#xD;
      reduction of demoralization&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an Investigator-initiated, prospective, single center, interventional pilot&#xD;
      study. This study will examine the feasibility of a larger study aimed at determining if&#xD;
      there is an association between the improvement in tardive dyskinesia and the reduction in&#xD;
      demoralization and subjective incompetence in patients with tardive dyskinesia after&#xD;
      treatment with Valbenazine. Participants will be treated with Valbenazine for a total of 7&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, week 2, week 4, and week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The change in symptoms of demoralization will be measured using the Demoralization Scale-II (DS-II). Scale scores range from 0 (minimum) to 32 (maximum), with higher scores indicating more demoralization (i.e., a worse outcome). Reduction of score to below 10 will be measured</description>

    <measure>Change in subjective incompetence scale (SIS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 2, week 4, and week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The SIS consists of 12 items, each item has 4 response alternatives scored as 0, 1, 2, 3. The scores range from 0 to 36. Higher scores mean more severe subjective incompetence.</description>
