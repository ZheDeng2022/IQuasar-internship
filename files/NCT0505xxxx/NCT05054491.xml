      The purpose of this study is to determine the acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness&#xD;
      of a group antenatal care (G-ANC) model introduced at the health post level compared to usual&#xD;
      antenatal care (ANC) among women who report intention to receive ANC at the health post&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
