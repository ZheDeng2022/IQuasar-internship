    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usability of the ultrasound devices and common&#xD;
      pain relief gel. The ability of the three treatment approaches to reduce pain, stiffness, and&#xD;
      functionality as measured by NRS scale and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities&#xD;
      Arthritis Index (WOMAC) will be evaluated.&#xD;

    <description>WOMAC questionnaire will be utilized (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index) at baseline and post-treatment to calculate the change in scores. WOMAC was divided into 3 categories: pain, stiffness, function and total score. The pain category consists of five scores from 0 - 4, 0 being no pain 4 is worst pain possible, for a range of 0 - 20 points. The stiffness category consists of two scores from 0 - 4, 0 being no stiffness 10 is worst stiffness possible for a range of 0 - 8 points. The function score consists of 17 scores from 0 - 4, 0 being normal function and 10 is severely limited function, for a range of 0 - 68 points. Total score is the sum of pain, stiffness, and function scores (range of 0 - 96).</description>
