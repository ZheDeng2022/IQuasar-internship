    <textblock>
      Essential trigeminal neuralgia is the most common facial pain. In forms resistant to drug and&#xD;
      disabling treatments, surgical treatment may be offered to the patient. The type of&#xD;
      intervention will be conditioned by the presence or absence of a vasculo-nervous conflict&#xD;
      objectified by MRI(Magnetic resonance imaging) Morphological MRI with contrast injection does&#xD;
      not always allow an accurate assessment of trigeminal nerve damage in patients with essential&#xD;
      facial neuralgia. Despite advances in the anatomical definition of high-resolution MRI, the&#xD;
      correlation between a vascular conflict visible on MRI and present during surgery and&#xD;
      prolonged postoperative clinical improvement remains insufficient These data raise the&#xD;
      question of additional imaging sequences to assess the distressing characteristics of NT in&#xD;
      addition to the usual anatomical criteria for compression By performing during morphological&#xD;
      MRI two additional sequences, one in diffusion tensor (DTI) and one in resting state (fMRI),&#xD;
      we could better characterize the achievement of NT&#xD;
&#xD;
      The contribution of new imaging sequences in the context of essential trigeminal neuralgia&#xD;
      treated with microvascular decompression (MVD) would:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1/improve the diagnostic criteria for suffering and compression of the NT (trigeminal nerve)&#xD;
      2 / define objective prognostic criteria for the effectiveness of surgery, particularly in&#xD;
      the context of unusual clinical symptoms or moderate conflict on MRI (Magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging) 3 / to analyze more precisely the causes of recurrence at a distance from surgery&#xD;
      and help in the decision of re-intervention Our main hypothesis: the addition of a diffusion&#xD;
      tensor sequence and sequences (allowing functional brain analysis) in addition to standard&#xD;
      anatomical MRI in the assessment of a vasculo-nervous conflict would allow us to better&#xD;
      characterize involvement of the trigeminal nerve in essential facial neuralgia. It also helps&#xD;
      guide therapeutic management and surgical indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, monocentric cohort study. It will be offered to patients referred to&#xD;
      neurosurgery or to the pain assessment and treatment center for assessment and management of&#xD;
      a neuralgia of the essential trijumeau unilateral.&#xD;

      Name:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI in morphological sequence, diffusion tensor and resting functional&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MR exam will be performed on the Neuroradiology 3 Tesla (Philips) MR according to the&#xD;
      following protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard anatomical sequences T1, FLAIR, TOF, DRIVE, sequence centered on the V after&#xD;
           injection of gadolinated contrast product as part of standard care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diffusion tensor sequence (DTI) It allows the analysis of encephalic white matter beams&#xD;
           in healthy subjects as well as in many pathologies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  resting state sequence (fMRI) This sequence is based on the spontaneous correlation of&#xD;
           the BOLD signal (blood-oxygen level dependent) between different distant brain regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The total duration of the exam will be about 45 minutes, including 15 minutes for the&#xD;
           sequences added by the search.&#xD;
