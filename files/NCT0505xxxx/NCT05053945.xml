      Since much is unknown about factors that lead to progression of the pre-neoplastic lesions&#xD;
      and cancer. In addition, there is ongoing debate on the optimal surveillance intervals and&#xD;
      techniques. To solve these important clinical questions, we propose for the establishment of&#xD;
      a registry for a longitudinal study with the hopes of changing clinical practice in the near&#xD;
      future.&#xD;

      Helicobacter pylori is believed to affect more than half of the world's population and is&#xD;
      thought to affect nearly 2 million people in Hong Kong alone1. It is a major cause of peptic&#xD;
      ulcer disease and is implicated in the pathogenesis of the majority of gastric cancers2.&#xD;
      Since 1994, the World Health Organization has designated H. pylori infection as a class 1&#xD;
      carcinogen3. Gastric cancer was the sixth commonest malignancy in Hong Kong in 20154; it was&#xD;
      also the second commonest cause of death from cancer in Asia5. It is thought that chronic&#xD;
      inflammation of the gastric mucosa caused by H. pylori progresses to pre-neoplastic lesions,&#xD;
      namely atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia, before developing into frank dysplasia&#xD;
      and carcinoma6. Successful H. pylori eradication can lead to a rapid decrease in active&#xD;
      inflammation, with early treatment effective in preventing the progression of disease. It is&#xD;
      believed that atrophic gastritis may be reversible, whereas intestinal metaplasia has passed&#xD;
      the point of no return and unlikely to have regression7,8. National screening programmes in&#xD;
      both Japan and Korea recommend endoscopy for all men and women over 40 years of age with&#xD;
      several uncontrolled trials suggesting that this has led to a reduction of mortality due to&#xD;
      gastric cancer9. However, in countries with a lower incidence of gastric cancer, this&#xD;
      population-based approach may not be cost-effective10. Much is unknown about factors that&#xD;
      lead to progression of the pre-neoplastic lesions and cancer. In addition, there is ongoing&#xD;
      debate on the optimal surveillance intervals and techniques11. To solve these important&#xD;
      clinical questions, we propose for the establishment of a registry for a longitudinal study&#xD;
      with the hopes of changing clinical practice in the near future.&#xD;

    <description>To set up a prospective study and registry (HAR-P) for patients with H. pylori infection, atrophic gastritis or intestinal metaplasia to evaluate their clinical features and outcomes. The objectives include:&#xD;
Assess the short- and long-term patient outcomes of H. pylori patients&#xD;
Characterize factors involved in the progression or regression of pre-neoplastic lesions, namely atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia&#xD;
Gather information for a better understanding on the efficacy and role of surveillance&#xD;
Potential for the development of new screening/surveillance strategies and tools for better risk stratification of patients&#xD;
Establish a biobank for H. pylori, atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia patients</description>
