    <textblock>
      In this study, The researchers sought to explore the efficacy and safety of involving field&#xD;
      radiotherapy in the oligo-metastatic/recurrent/refractory ovarian cancer patients among&#xD;
      different groups which include drug therapy alone, radiotherapy alone, and drug therapy plus&#xD;
      radiotherapy by inviting clinical multi-center participation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The recurrent or refractory ovarian cancer tends to recur repeatedly at increasingly short&#xD;
      intervals, making treatment more and more difficult.Patients often have limited physical&#xD;
      capacity to undergo repeated systematic treatment. Currently, NCCN（ national comprehensive&#xD;
      cancer network ）guidelines recommend palliative radiotherapy in patients with local&#xD;
      recurrence of ovarian cancer. With the progress of IMRT（ intensity modulated radiation&#xD;
      therapy ）, SBRT ( stereotactic body radiation therapy ) and other radiotherapy technologies,&#xD;
      better local tumor control rate can also be achieved, while minimizing the damage to&#xD;
      surrounding normal tissues. In this study, the patients will be divided into groups according&#xD;
      to their wishes: group A (drug therapy alone), group B (radiotherapy alone), and group C&#xD;
      (radiotherapy plus drug therapy).The researchers sought to explore the the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of involving field radiotherapy in the oligo-metastatic/recurrent/refractory ovarian&#xD;
      cancer patients in different groups after treatment by inviting multiple centers to&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Group A (drug treatment group) : Patients accept paclitaxel + platinum or paclitaxel single drug chemotherapy of which paclitaxel 135-175mg/m2, carboplatin AUC=5, cisplatin 40-60mg/m2. The treatment should be repeated every 3 weeks. Other second-line and third-line chemotherapy regimens (dose is not specified) are also allowed. Targeted, immunological or PARPi drugs can be added based on pathological and genetic test results until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or informed consent withdrawal. Group B (radiotherapy group): IFRT, IMRT or SBRT is applied. Radiotherapy regimen: Involving field PGTV 60Gy-70Gy, 2-3Gy/f,5 times/week. External irradiation techniques and doses can be selected based on the previous experience of each center, but all patients enrolled within the center need to be consistent. Group C (radiotherapy + drug group) : IFRT is the same as group B;Drug therapy: same as group A.</intervention_model_description>
