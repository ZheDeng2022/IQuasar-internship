  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alumina particles from the grit blasting of Ti-alloy stems for hip arthroplasty are suspected&#xD;
      to contribute to aseptic loosening. An alumina-reduced stem surface was hypothesized to&#xD;
      improve osseointegration and show comparable short-term outcomes to those of a standard stem.&#xD;

    <description>Rectangular SL straight stems made of titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-7Nb). The experimental stem (NT SL-PLUS) underwent alumina grit blasting to reach the adequate roughness of 4-6 micron. The surface of the NT SL-PLUS stem was thereafter additionally treated chemically by short-acid etching with HF and mechanically by dry ice blasting in order to loosen and remove the residual alumina particles up to 96% without changing the existing surface microtopography.</description>
