  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4 clinical study in healthy non-drug dependent recreational opioid users to&#xD;
      assess the abuse potential of Lyrica when taken alone or in combination with oxycodone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active-controlled,&#xD;
      6-treatment, 6-period crossover, single-dose study in healthy male and/or female adult, non&#xD;
      drug-dependent recreational opioid users. The study includes Screening, a Qualification&#xD;
      Phase, a Treatment Phase and Follow-up. This study will randomize approximately 60 adult male&#xD;
      and female (at least 20% female) participants (10 participants in each sequence) in the&#xD;
      Treatment Phase to ensure at least 48 participants complete the Treatment Phase of the study.&#xD;
      There will be 8 visits to the clinic in total and a follow-up telephone call at the end of&#xD;
      the study. The duration of participation will be approximately 16 weeks and 7 of the visits&#xD;
      will involve clinic stays of 4 days/3 nights.&#xD;

             Diagnosis of substance and/or alcohol dependence (excluding caffeine and nicotine)&#xD;
             will be assessed by the Investigator using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-4&#xD;
             (DSM-4) criteria performed at Screening. Current drug use will be allowed if the&#xD;
             candidate can produce a negative urine sample and are free of any signs/symptoms of&#xD;
             withdrawal. The candidate will be informed if they have a positive breathalyzer test.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Participants with active suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior within 5 year prior to&#xD;
             Screening as determined through the use of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the&#xD;
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may&#xD;
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product&#xD;
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the&#xD;
             judgment of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with: sleep apnea, myasthenia gravis and glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary supplements within 7 days or&#xD;
             5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Herbal supplements and herbal medications must be discontinued at least 28 days prior&#xD;
             to the first dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Previous administration with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined&#xD;
             by the local requirement) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) preceding the first&#xD;
             dose of investigational product used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Positive urine drug screen (UDS) for substances of abuse at each admission in the&#xD;
             Qualification and Treatment Phase, excluding tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). If a&#xD;
             participant presents with a positive UDS excluding THC at any admission or any visit,&#xD;
             the investigator, at his/her discretion, may reschedule a repeat of UDS until the UDS&#xD;
             is negative, excluding THC, before the participant is permitted to participate in any&#xD;
             phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Unable to abstain from using THC during the Qualification and Treatment Phase of the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Has participated in, is currently participating in, or is seeking treatment for&#xD;
             substance-and/or alcohol-related disorders (excluding nicotine and caffeine).&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Has a positive alcohol breathalyzer or urine test at each admission to the study&#xD;
             center during qualification and treatment phase. Positive results may be repeated&#xD;
             and/or participants re-scheduled at the Investigator's discretions.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Participants are heavy smokers or users of other types of nicotine products (&gt;20&#xD;
             cigarettes equivalents per day).&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Participants are unable to abstain from smoking for at least 2 hours before and at&#xD;
             least 8 hours after study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Screening sitting blood pressure (BP) ≥140 mm Hg (systolic) or ≥90 mm Hg (diastolic),&#xD;
             following at least 5 minutes rest. If BP is ≥140 mm Hg (systolic) or&#xD;
&#xD;
             ≥90 mm Hg (diastolic), the BP should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3&#xD;
             BP values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility. Repeated BP tests&#xD;
             should be spaced at least 5 minutes apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Baseline (screening) 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that demonstrates clinically&#xD;
             relevant abnormalities that may affect participant safety or interpretation of study&#xD;
             results (eg, baseline corrected QT (QTc) interval as determined by the Fridericia&#xD;
             method (QTcF) &gt;450 msec, complete left bundle branch block [LBBB], signs of an acute&#xD;
             or indeterminate-age myocardial infarction, ST-T interval changes suggestive of&#xD;
             myocardial ischemia, second- or third-degree atrioventricular [AV] block, or serious&#xD;
             bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias). If the baseline uncorrected QT interval is &gt;450&#xD;
             msec, this interval should be rate-corrected using the Fridericia method and the&#xD;
             resulting QTcF should be used for decision making and reporting. If QTcF exceeds 450&#xD;
             msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated 2 more times and the average&#xD;
             of the 3 QTcF or QRS values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility.&#xD;
             Computer-interpreted ECGs should be overread by a physician experienced in reading&#xD;
             ECGs before excluding participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Participants with ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at&#xD;
             screening, as assessed by the study-specific laboratory and confirmed by a single&#xD;
             repeat test, if deemed necessary: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine&#xD;
             aminotransferase (ALT) level 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN); Total bilirubin level&#xD;
             ≥1.5 × ULN; participants with a history of Gilbert's syndrome may have direct&#xD;
             bilirubin measured and would be eligible for this study provided the direct bilirubin&#xD;
             level is ≤ ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more&#xD;
             within 60 days prior to dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Unwilling or unable to comply with the criteria in the Lifestyle Considerations&#xD;
             section of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. History of hypersensitivity to pregabalin or oxycodone or any of the components in the&#xD;
             formulation of the study products.&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Investigator site staff members directly involved in the conduct of the study and&#xD;
             their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the investigator, or&#xD;
