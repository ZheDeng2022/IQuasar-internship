    <textblock>
      The main aim was to assess the tumor vascular perfusion pattern in gastric cancer (GC). The&#xD;
      investigators used dynamic contrast harmonic imaging endoscopic ultrasound (CHI-EUS) and the&#xD;
      results were compared with the immunohistochemical expression of CD105 and&#xD;
      clinico-pathological parameters.&#xD;

      The study design is prospective and will include patients with gastric tumors referred to&#xD;
      Gastroenterology Department from University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova for EUS local&#xD;
      staging enrolled during 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected for each participant will include: Personal data (name, surname, age, sex);&#xD;
      results from previous investigations (blood count, liver and renal function tests, tumoral&#xD;
      markers, gastroscopy, computed tomography), EUS variables (including CEH-EUS), histological&#xD;
      and immunohistochemical findings, TNM and pTNM status (if possible), molecular analysis&#xD;
      findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging tests All patients will be evaluated by EUS and CEH-EUS, using radial EUS&#xD;
      instruments. Prior to the investigation the stomach has to be empty for at least 8 hours.&#xD;
      During the examination biopsies will be taken from normal and tumor tissue for gene&#xD;
      expression analysis. For EUS examination, the patient will be placed in left lateral&#xD;
      position. The EUS scope will be inserted under direct vision, passed by the tumor and&#xD;
      examination should begin during withdrawal at 7.5 MHz. The tumor will be characterized&#xD;
      describing its echogenicity, echostructure, size, extent into the wall and surrounding&#xD;
      structures, and it will be staged using the modification of the TNM classification. The&#xD;
      presence/absence of power Doppler signals will be noted. All lymph nodes will be reported&#xD;
      with their maximal size, echogenicity, shape and margins. Nodes larger than 5 mm in diameter,&#xD;
      with hypoechoic appearance, round shape (rather than ovoid or flat), sharply demarcated&#xD;
      borders and located nearby the tumor will be suspected for malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CEH-EUS procedure: A two panel image with the usual conventional gray-scale B-mode EUS image&#xD;
      on the right side and with the contrast harmonic image on the left side will be used,&#xD;
      according to pre-established presets. The examination will be performed at a low mechanical&#xD;
      index (dynamic wide-band contrast harmonic imaging mode) of 0.2. The starting point of the&#xD;
      timer will be considered the moment of intravenous contrast injection (SonoVue 2,4 mL), with&#xD;
      the whole movie (T0-T120s) recorded on the embedded HDD of the ultrasound system for later&#xD;
      analysis. Parameters for objective measurement of tumor perfusion will include maximum&#xD;
      intensity of enhancement, mean transit time, time to peak (wash-in time), wash-in slope, area&#xD;
      under the curve, representing indirectly blood flow or blood volume in GC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications may occur during EUS, but they are rare. These consist of bleeding at the&#xD;
      biopsy site which is usually minimal, self-limited and rarely requires follow-up. Perforation&#xD;
      of the stomach is extremely rare. The safety profile of the ultrasound contrast agent&#xD;
      (Sonovue®) showed a very low incidence of side effects. It is not nephrotoxic and the&#xD;
      incidence of hypersensitivity or severe allergic events is lower than with current X-ray&#xD;
      agents and comparable to that of other magnetic resonance contrast agents. Sono-Vue is&#xD;
      approved for clinical use in EU countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biological material collected during the study will be frozen and stored. This will&#xD;
      include one ml of whole blood and 4 tissue biopsies (2 from normal tissue and 2 from the&#xD;
      tumour) of 2 to 3 mm each. When the expected number of participants is reached, the samples&#xD;
      will undergo molecular studies for assessing the markers of angiogenesis as detailed further&#xD;
      in the protocol. The biological materials will be stored and analysed during an estimated&#xD;
      time of 20 months from the start of the trial. Biopsy samples for immunohistochemistry will&#xD;
      be included in formalin solution and sent at pathology laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood analysis. Whole blood (1ml) will be collected before imaging procedures in an&#xD;
           Eppendorf tube on EDTA solution, placed immediately at 40C for maximum 24 hours, and&#xD;
           then kept at - 800C for later analysis of angiogenic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biopsy samples of normal and GC tissue. Gene expression will be analyzed using qPCR with&#xD;
           Taqman®- labeled probes. To quantify the results obtained by real-time RT-PCR the&#xD;
           standard curve method will be used. The paired-samples will be collected in RNAlater&#xD;
           (Ambion), stored at 40C for 12- 24 hours, and then kept at - 800C. Later analysis will&#xD;
           assess the genes expression of angiogenic markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunohistochemistry IHC will be focused of angiogenic markers: VEGF-A family and their&#xD;
      receptors: VEGFR as well as tyrosine kinases receptors (RTKs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VEGF-C expression in tumor samples (marker of lymphangiogenesis) will be quantified.&#xD;
      Furthermore, a correlation between EUS findings (N stage) and VEGF-C expression will be&#xD;
      established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The microvessel density (MVD) will be calculated using immunohistochemistry for CD105.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The estimated number of participants enrolled to the study is at least&#xD;
      50 during first 24 months. Both descriptive data analysis and statistical inference will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlations between CE-EUS parameters and pathologic and genetic findings will be analyzed&#xD;
      using the T-test and the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) for continuous data, while the&#xD;
      Chi-square test will be applied for categorical data. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)&#xD;
      will be performed for comparison between different subgroups (T stages). Survival analysis&#xD;
      from the moment of diagnosis will be evaluated using Kaplan-Meyer curves. Traditional&#xD;
      parameters as TNM stage, type of treatment will be analyzed. Statistical significance will be&#xD;
      defined as a p-value less than 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These minimal risks will be outweighed by the potential implications for future patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research subjects will receive consent on behalf of written and oral information before&#xD;
      inclusion in the study. The interview will cover detailed information, including an&#xD;
      understandable presentation of the project with its predictable risks and side-effects,&#xD;
      expected outcomes and benefits from the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any unplanned events or adverse effects will be reported immediately to the Regional Ethics&#xD;
      Committee on biomedical research.&#xD;
