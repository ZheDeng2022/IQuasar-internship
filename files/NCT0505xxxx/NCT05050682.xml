  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, single dose study in approximately 5 healthy male and female (of non&#xD;
      childbearing potential only) participants has been designed to characterize mass balance and&#xD;
      further the understanding of human pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and excretion of PF 07304814&#xD;
      administered at a dose of 500 mg [14C] PF-07304814 containing approximately 420 nCi [14C]&#xD;
      PF-07304814 as a constant-rate, continuous IV infusion over 24 hours&#xD;
