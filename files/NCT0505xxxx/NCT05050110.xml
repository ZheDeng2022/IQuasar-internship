  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the feasibility of increasing dietary consumption of a rich&#xD;
      variety of fruits and vegetables (including those that are potassim-rich) in patients with&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease through use of nutritional counselling and hyperkalemia management&#xD;
      with patiromer&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult Patients ages 18 and older with a diagnosis of Chronic Kidney Disease will be given a&#xD;
      Diet Plan that consist of an increase of Fruits and Vegetables. Baseline data will be&#xD;
      collected after the subject has signed the consent and their most recent eGFR and potassium&#xD;
      level that is within 90 days has been reviewed to determine they are within the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the approved Veltassa package insert the subject will begin to take daily. During&#xD;
      this control period of two weeks, the subject will document their normal daily consumption of&#xD;
      fruits and vegetables in a provided food diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the Second week, patient will receive dietary/nutritional counseling on the importance of&#xD;
      potassium-rich fruits and vegetables. They will be instructed to increase their fruit and&#xD;
      vegetable intake based on personal preferences and nutritional guides located inside the food&#xD;
      diary. Choices will be documented daily in the supplied food diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Bowel Diary will be classified according to the Bristol Stool Chart and Quality of Life.&#xD;
      Nutrition Survey Questionnaire will be documented in that supplied log.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each subsequent visit, food diaries will be reviewed to evaluate fruit and vegetable&#xD;
      consumption, vital signs will be documented and labs collected to measure effects on&#xD;
      potassium metabolism. Bowel habits and questionnaires will be completed by the subject to&#xD;
      determine how their diet has affected their quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patiromer (Veltessa) dosing will be adjusted based on their serum potassium values following&#xD;
      the approved drug brochure guidelines and at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject will return to the clinic at specified time points up to 52 weeks on study. The&#xD;
      Patient can continue Veltassa while in the follow up period until week 52 at the discretion&#xD;
      of the Principle Investigator.&#xD;

    <measure>By increasing the consumption of Fruits and Vegetable in their daily diet using the Nutritional Fruits and Vegetable Diary based off of the USDA Nutritive Value of foods and completing the Quality of Life Nutritional Questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will increase the Fruit and vegetable consumption by following a Diet plan listed in the Nutritional Diary provided to them by the study site in the beginning of the study while taking Patiromer (Veltassa). This will record their daily intake of 26-28 servings of fruit and vegetables weekly. The Nutritional diary lists a Diet Plan that measures the serving size of 26-28 servings of the fruits and vegetables. The measurement of fruits and vegetables has been calculated by the Nutritionist based off of the USDA Nutritive Value of foods and listed on the diary to explain the serving sizes and suggestions of meal plans.</description>

    <measure>The Kidney Function levels will be tested at each visit from blood samples provided by the subject.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Kidney Function blood test samples will be taken from the subject to show overall kidney health in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients by increasing their fruit and vegetable intake while on patiromer. The blood tests that support this is , Magnesium, phosphorus, iPTH, lipid panel, uric acid, hemoglobin A1C, Vitamin D 25(OH), Vitamin D 1,25(OH), FGF-23 and CBC panel.</description>
