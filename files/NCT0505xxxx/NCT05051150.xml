  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternal hypotension after spinal block is a common complication after subarachnoid block in&#xD;
      this population. The incidence of maternal hypotension is nearly 60% when prophylactic&#xD;
      vasopressors are not used. Therefore, it is highly recommended to use vasopressors,&#xD;
      preferably as continuous infusion, for prophylaxis rather than delaying their use until&#xD;
      hypotension occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phenylephrine (PE) is the recommended drug for prophylaxis against hypotension during&#xD;
      cesarean delivery; however, the use of PE is commonly associated with decreased heart rate&#xD;
      and probably cardiac output because PE is a pure alpha adrenoreceptor agonist . Introduction&#xD;
      of NE in obstetric practice had shown favorable maternal and neonatal outcomes and was&#xD;
      associated with higher heart rate and cardiac output compared to PE. However, there is still&#xD;
      some mothers who develop bradycardia and diminished cardiac output with the use of NE. The&#xD;
      most desired scenario during hemodynamic management of mothers during cesarean delivery would&#xD;
      achieve the least possible incidences of maternal hypotension, bradycardia and reactive&#xD;
      hypertension. Therefore, it is warranted to reach a vasopressor regimen with the most stable&#xD;
      hemodynamic profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last year, epinephrine was reported for the first time in obstetric practice with&#xD;
      acceptable safety on the mother and the fetus. However, there is still lack of data about the&#xD;
      most appropriate dose for infusion during cesarean delivery. In this study, we aim to compare&#xD;
      three prophylactic infusion rates for epinephrine during cesarean delivery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upon arrival to the operating room, the patient will be in supine position with left uterine&#xD;
      displacement using a wedge below the right buttock. Routine monitoring will be applied&#xD;
      (electrocardiography, pulse oximetry, and non-invasive blood pressure monitor). An&#xD;
      18G-cannula will be inserted, and the patients will receive 10 mg metoclopramide, and 50 mg&#xD;
      ranitidine. Baseline heart rate and systolic blood pressure will be recorded as the average&#xD;
      of three consecutive readings with 2-minutes interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lactated Ringer's solution will be infused at rate of 15 mL/Kg over 10 minutes as a co-load&#xD;
      [11]; spinal anesthesia will be achieved by injecting 10 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine and 20&#xD;
      mcg fentanyl into the subarachnoid space at L3-L4 or L4-L5 interspace using 25G spinal&#xD;
      needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After subarachnoid block, mothers will be placed in supine position with left-lateral tilt&#xD;
      and the vasopressor infusion will be started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To maintain the double-blind scheme, the total dosage of epinephrine (mcg) for patients in&#xD;
      each group will be calculated and added to the 50 ml syringe and will be infused at rate of&#xD;
      50 mL/hour. The calculated epinephrine dose will be withdrawn using insulin syringe. The&#xD;
      vasopressor infusion will be through the same line as the intravenous fluids using a&#xD;
      three-way stopcock. the infusion will be stopped when there is tachycardia (&gt;130% of baseline&#xD;
      value) and/or reactive hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt; 120% of baseline), otherwise&#xD;
      the infusion will be stopped 5-mins after the baby delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Block success will be assessed after 5 minutes from intrathecal injection of local&#xD;
      anesthetic; and will be confirmed if sensory block level is at T4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-spinal hypotension (defined as systolic blood pressure ≤80% of the baseline reading&#xD;
      during the period from intrathecal injection to delivery of the fetus) will be managed by&#xD;
      administration of 9 mg of ephedrine Severe post-spinal hypotension (defined as systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure ≤60% of the baseline reading) will be managed by administration IV ephedrine 15 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reactive hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure ≥120% from the baseline reading)&#xD;
      will be managed by stoppage of the infusion till the next systolic blood pressure reading.&#xD;
      The infusion will be then re-started at the half of the initial rate, when systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure decreases to be within 20% of the baseline reading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative bradycardia (defined as heart rate less than 55 bpm) will be managed by IV&#xD;
      atropine bolus (0.5 mg) will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluid administration will be continued up to a maximum of 1.5 liters. An oxytocin bolus (0.5&#xD;
      IU) will be delivered over five seconds after delivery the infused at a rate of 2.5 IU/hour.&#xD;
