    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well an exercise program and continuous Fitbit monitoring&#xD;
      work for managing metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease risk in patients with&#xD;
      prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) or has come back&#xD;
      (recurrent) and does not response to treatment (refractory) and are receiving androgen&#xD;
      deprivation therapy. Balancing treatment efficacy, drug side effects, and competing&#xD;
      comorbidities with prostate cancer is essential. This trial is being done to learn if an&#xD;
      exercise program can help to improve metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular (heart) fitness in&#xD;
      prostate cancer patients who are receiving androgen deprivation therapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the relationship between a 16-week exercise program with continuous Fitbit&#xD;
      monitoring and cardiovascular fitness (defined by change in 10-year atherosclerotic&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease [ASCVD] risk score), as compared to Fitbit monitoring alone, in&#xD;
      prostate cancer patients on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the length of cardiovascular fitness effect (measured using 10-year ASCVD risk&#xD;
      12 weeks post intervention) for a 16-week exercise program with continuous Fitbit monitoring&#xD;
      in prostate cancer patients on ADT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Screen for a relationship between a 16-week exercise program with continuous Fitbit&#xD;
      monitoring and metabolic syndrome severity (defined by change in metabolic severity index&#xD;
      z-score), as compared to Fitbit monitoring alone, in prostate cancer patients on ADT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Measure the relationship between the exercise intervention and prostate-specific antigen&#xD;
      (PSA) velocity, compared to Fitbit monitoring alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Measure the relationship between the exercise intervention and physical fitness (using&#xD;
      V02 and body composition), compared to Fitbit monitoring alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Measure the relationship between the exercise intervention and physical activity (step&#xD;
      count)/heart rate, compared to Fitbit monitoring alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Measure the relationship between the exercise intervention and physical activity (as&#xD;
      measured by the Godin Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire) compared to Fitbit&#xD;
      monitoring alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Measure the relationship between the exercise intervention and, quality of life/symptom&#xD;
      burden, compared to Fitbit monitoring alone (measured by the following patient reported&#xD;
      surveys: National Cancer Institute-patient reported outcomes-Common Terminology Criteria for&#xD;
      Adverse Events [NCI-PRO-CTCAE], Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System&#xD;
      [PROMIS] Fatigue and Physical Function, Self Efficacy, European Organization for Research and&#xD;
      Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] Quality of Life Questionnaire Core30 [QLQ-C30] and Prostate&#xD;
      Cancer 25 [PR25]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Explore the relationship between the exercise intervention and markers of insulin&#xD;
      resistance, inflammation/immune function and metabolism utilizing pre- and post-intervention&#xD;
      peripheral blood analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients receive general education exercise packet with instruction to exercise&#xD;
      regularly for up to 150 minutes weekly. Patients also wear a FitBit daily over 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients participate in supervised and self-directed exercise sessions over 60&#xD;
      minutes twice a week (BIW) for up to 16 weeks. Patients also wear a FitBit daily over 16&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
