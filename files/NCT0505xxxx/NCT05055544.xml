    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to assess the efficacy of bearberry in uncomplicated cystitis.&#xD;
      Uncomplicated cystitis is a disease related to the infection of the urinary bladder. Typical&#xD;
      symptoms are dysuria, urinary urgency, and frequent voiding of small volumes. Urinary tract&#xD;
      infections are frequent in women, usually treated with antibiotics, since the disease is&#xD;
      usually caused by bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fosfomycin is a frequently used antibiotic for the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis. This&#xD;
      medicine is typically prescribed by MDs. However, since uncomplicated cystitis is quite&#xD;
      frequent, not all patients visit the doctor when experiencing the symptoms of this disease.&#xD;
      The use of over-the-counter products (medicines and food supplements) to alleviate the&#xD;
      symptoms is common. One of the most frequently used medicinal plants for this purpose is&#xD;
      bearberry. Bearberry is a medicinal plant traditionally used for the treatment of cystitis.&#xD;
      Its use is accepted by the European Medicine Agency as traditional herbal medicinal product&#xD;
      for relief of symptoms of mild recurrent lower urinary tract infections such as burning&#xD;
      sensation during urination and/or frequent urination in women. Although the experience gained&#xD;
      during the traditional use and the laboratory experiments support the supposed beneficial&#xD;
      effect of bearberry, its clinical efficacy has not been confirmed in well-designed clinical&#xD;
      trials in comparison with standard antibiotic therapy. In this study, the efficacy of&#xD;
      bearberry will be assessed in comparison with fosfomycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premenopausal women experiencing the symptoms of uncomplicated cystitis will be randomly&#xD;
      divided into two groups. Since it will be a double-blind trial, neither the participants nor&#xD;
      the experimenters will know who is receiving a particular treatment. In group A, patients&#xD;
      will receive a single dose of fosfomycin powder dissolved in water and 2 placebo tablets&#xD;
      three times a day for 7 days. In group B, patients will receive a single dose of placebo&#xD;
      powder dissolved in water and 2 bearberry tablets three times a day for 7 days. At the&#xD;
      beginning of the study (day 0) and on day 7, patients will be asked to fill in a&#xD;
      questionnaire concerning their symptoms. At the same times, urine specimens will be collected&#xD;
      to inspect the presence of bacteria in the urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of the trial is to assess the improvement of symptoms of uncomplicated&#xD;
      cystitis after 7 days of treatment with the intention to analyze whether treatment with&#xD;
      bearberry is at least as effective as fosfomycin therapy is. This will be achieved by using a&#xD;
      validated questionnaire (Acute Cystitis Symptom Score). The presence of bacteria in urine and&#xD;
      the frequency and severity of side effects will also be recorded and compared. During a&#xD;
      90-days follow-up of this study, the recurrence of urinary tract infections will be analyzed.&#xD;
      This study will deliver important data on the efficacy and safety of bearberry in the&#xD;
      treatment of uncomplicated cystitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, controlled double-blind multicentre trial will assess the non-inferiority of&#xD;
      bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi) in comparison with fosfomycin in the therapy of&#xD;
      uncomplicated cystitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical practice, acute uncomplicated cystitis is usually treated based on the clinical&#xD;
      signs and symptoms. According to current guidelines, first-line drugs are fosfomycin&#xD;
      trometamol, nitrofurantoin, nitroxoline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and pivmecillinam.&#xD;
      The advantage of fosfomycin is that a single is considered to be sufficient for the treatment&#xD;
      of uncomplicated cystitis, resulting in better patient compliance compared to other&#xD;
      antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacterial resistance is one of the major drawback of antibiotic use. Therefore, the&#xD;
      assessment of other medicines than currently used antibiotics is of primary importance. One&#xD;
      of the most widely used over-the-counter medications in the treatment of urinary tract&#xD;
      infection-related symptoms is bearberry. Although this plant has been used in traditional&#xD;
      medicine for the treatment of acute cystitis, and the European Medicines Agency acknowledged&#xD;
      its use as traditional herbal medicinal product used for the treatment of symptoms of mild&#xD;
      recurrent lower urinary tract infections such as burning sensation during urination and/or&#xD;
      frequent urination in women, the efficacy has not been assessed in well-designed clinical&#xD;
      trials. Since several patients are using bearberry-based medicines, it is important to obtain&#xD;
      clinical data on the efficacy and safety of this plant. The aim of this study is to assess&#xD;
      the non-inferiority of bearberry in comparison with a standard antibiotic (fosfomycin) used&#xD;
      in acute uncomplicated cystitis.&#xD;
