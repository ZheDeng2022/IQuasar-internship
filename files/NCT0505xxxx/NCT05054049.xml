  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Point of care testing (POCT) is described as a laboratory test conducted near the patient&#xD;
      with a rapid result obtained through a portable analysing device, as opposed to the&#xD;
      collection of a blood sample being transferred to a central laboratory for analysis and&#xD;
      reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past 15 years increasing emphasis has been placed upon the paramedic profession as a&#xD;
      possible solution to addressing the increasing demands placed on emergency departments. This&#xD;
      is largely viewed through the ability of paramedics to assess patients calling 999 and manage&#xD;
      a patient's condition away from the emergency department, with sufficient evidence supporting&#xD;
      the role of the paramedic to develop competencies to manage larger volumes of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feasibility study will seek to understand whether paramedics report that the use of POCT&#xD;
      devices is useful in safe clinical decision making with patients in the community, and if it&#xD;
      is possible to use the Abbott i-STAT device in the urgent and emergency care setting for&#xD;
      those patients where management within the community is being considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that there is very little evidence in this subject area, the research should start to&#xD;
      inform the potential for future innovations in paramedic and community practice, and build on&#xD;
      the body of evidence regarding POCT by paramedics related to community management.&#xD;
