  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we aimed to determine the knowledge levels and approaches of anesthesiologists&#xD;
      working in our clinic about postoperative residual curarization(PORC) in elderly patients&#xD;
      with a questionnaire. In addition, we aimed to determine the incidence of PORC and factors&#xD;
      associated with PORC in the recovery unit in elderly patients over 65 years of age who&#xD;
      underwent surgery under general anesthesia using muscle relaxants with a prospective&#xD;
      observational study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative residual curarization (PORC) after general anesthesia is an important&#xD;
      complication that can cause adverse patient outcomes, including symptoms of airway&#xD;
      obstruction, hypoxia, respiratory distress, muscle weakness, and dyspnea in the early and&#xD;
      late stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticholinesterase agents are commonly used to reverse neuromuscular blockade. Even with the&#xD;
      use of anticholinesterase, severe PORC can be seen. The use of anticholinesterases in elderly&#xD;
      patients is controversial due to the high side-effect profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sugammadex, which has been widely used with its approval by the United States Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration in 2015, is a reverse agent that acts through a different mechanism than&#xD;
      traditional anticholinesterase agents (it is a cyclodextrin molecule that encapsulates&#xD;
      steroid neuromuscular blockers). Compared to neostigmine, sugammadex reverses neuromuscular&#xD;
      blockade faster and more reliably.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we aimed to determine the knowledge levels and approaches of anesthesiologists&#xD;
      working in our clinic about postoperative residual curarization(PORC) in elderly patients&#xD;
      with a questionnaire. In addition, we aimed to determine the incidence of PORC and factors&#xD;
      associated with PORC in the recovery unit in elderly patients over 65 years of age who&#xD;
      underwent surgery under general anesthesia using muscle relaxants with a prospective&#xD;
      observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase of the study is a prospective observational study. Elderly patients (&gt;65) who&#xD;
      are scheduled to undergo elective surgery under general anesthesia and require intubation&#xD;
      using muscle relaxants will be screened for PORC using Train of four monitor in the recovery&#xD;
      unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second phase of the study, an online questionnaire with 15 questions will determine&#xD;
      the knowledge and attitudes of anesthesiologists working in our clinic on the use of muscle&#xD;
      relaxants and reversing agents in elderly patients, the use of neuromuscular monitoring and&#xD;
      PORC.&#xD;
