      this study was conducted to know the effect of intracanal cryotherapy on postoperative pain&#xD;
      using two different irrigation systems to deliver the cold saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      method: A total of 75 patients presenting with a diagnosis of irreversible pulpitis with&#xD;
      symptomatic apical periodontitis in single rooted teeth were included in the study and&#xD;
      randomly divided into three groups (n=25) (i.e. Control group, cryotherapy group with needle&#xD;
      irrigation and cryotherapy group with negative pressure irrigation system). After complete&#xD;
      root canal cleaning and shaping, final irrigation was done with 2.5°c 0.9% physiological&#xD;
      saline in cryotherapy groups with needle irrigation (NI) and negative pressure irrigation&#xD;
      system (NPI) whereas in control group no additional irrigation was done. Root canal treatment&#xD;
      was completed in single visit. Participants were asked through telephone to rate their&#xD;
      postoperative pain intensity after root canal treatment by visual analogue scale from day 1&#xD;
      till day 7 on given proforma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      two way repeated measures of ANOVA test were applied to know the mean difference between and&#xD;
      among the groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intracanal cryotherapy is one of the methods recently used to reduce the postoperative pain.&#xD;
      The aim of this randomized control trial was to evaluate the effect of cold saline&#xD;
      (cryotherapy) as a final irrigant on postoperative pain with two different irrigation systems&#xD;
      after single visit root canal treatment objective: To find out the effect of cryotherapy as a&#xD;
      final irrigant after root canal preparation on postoperative pain using needle irrigation and&#xD;
      negative pressure irrigation system (EndoVac).&#xD;
&#xD;
      method: the intervention used in this study was intracanal cryotherapy with two different&#xD;
      irrigation systems i.e. needle irrigation and negative pressure irrigation system(EndoVac).&#xD;
      for cryotherapy cold saline was used at temperature of 2.5 °c. total sample size was&#xD;
      calculated was 75 by using PASS version 11.non probability purposive sampling was used for&#xD;
      patient recruitment. three groups were made with sample size of 25 in each group. group&#xD;
      allocation was done by computer generated random numbers.according to inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria patients were selected and after complete diagnosis patients were thoroughly&#xD;
      explained about the treatment and informed consent were taken. to record the preoperative&#xD;
      pain ,patients were provided a proforma. proforma consisted of visual analogue scale for pain&#xD;
      record. endodontic procedure was performed by the principal investigator and it was same in&#xD;
      all the three groups.final irrigation protocol was diferent among the groups; control&#xD;
      group:no final irrigation was done, cryotherapy with needle irrigation: with needle&#xD;
      irrigation cold saline was delivered,cryotherapy with EndoVac: with EndoVac cold saline was&#xD;
      delivered. obturation in root canal was done with same protocol in all the groups.and access&#xD;
      cavity was filled with temporary restoration. postoperative instruction was given to the&#xD;
      patient and follow up procedure has also been explained to them. follow up was consisted of 7&#xD;
      days and through phone call by assessor which was blind regarding the groups. at day 7,&#xD;
      patient were returned with proforma in which they have noted the pain score of 7 days and at&#xD;
      the same visit temporary filling was replaced by permanent one. the principal investigator&#xD;
      was blind regarding the postoperative pain,as it was done by some other assessor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      statistical analysis was done by using SPSS v.16.the two-way ANOVA repeated measures was&#xD;
      performed for mean comparision among and between the groups.chi-square/fischer exact test&#xD;
      test was performed for analgesic intake.&#xD;
