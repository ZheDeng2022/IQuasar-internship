  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Choroidal neovascularization is an important path biologic mechanism encountered in a variety&#xD;
      of chorio-retinal diseases. Choroidal neo-vascularization represents new blood vessel growth&#xD;
      from the choroid that extends into the sub-retinal pigment epithelium, or sub-retinal space,&#xD;
      or a combination of both. There is some evidence that the clinical findings and angiographic&#xD;
      appearance of choroidal neo-vascular membrane correlate with the growth pattern. Choroidal&#xD;
      neo- vascularization dynamic evolution includes initiation, inflammatory active, and&#xD;
      inflammatory inactive stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It can be assumed that there is a risk of choroidal neo-vascular membrane development in any&#xD;
      case where the integrity of Bruch's membrane or the retinal pigment epithelium is impaired.&#xD;
      The most common cause of choroidal neo-vascular membrane is indisputably age-related macular&#xD;
      degeneration, but choroidal neo-vascular membrane may also occur secondary to many other&#xD;
      etiologies, such as pathological myopia, angioid streaks, uveitis, infection, and traumatic&#xD;
      Bruch's membrane-retinal pigment epithelium defects, and idiopathic cases where no etiology&#xD;
      can be detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Growth pattern:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although no two choroidal neo-vascular membrane growth patterns are exactly alike, choroidal&#xD;
      neo-vascular membrane grows in the plane between the retinal pigment epithelium and the Bruch&#xD;
      membrane, between the retina and retinal pigment epithelium, or a combination of both&#xD;
      (combined pattern). There is a retinal vascular contribution in approximately 6% of choroidal&#xD;
      neo-vascular membrane . The new blood vessels are capillary-like and, with time, become&#xD;
      arterial and venular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging modalities:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fundus fluorescein angiography with dye injection is considered the gold standard for&#xD;
      detecting choroidal neo-vascular membrane and assessing its activity. However, Fundus&#xD;
      fluorescein angiography is time consuming and invasive, resulting in varying degrees of&#xD;
      patient discomfort, including anaphylactic reactions that can occur during and/or after&#xD;
      fundus fluorescein angiography. A total of 4.8% patients were reported to have experienced&#xD;
      adverse events after the fundus fluorescein angiography, including nausea (2.9%), vomiting&#xD;
      (1.2%), and flushing/itching (0.5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optical coherence tomography has become an important non-invasive and quick method to&#xD;
      diagnose and monitor disease activity during anti- vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      treatment by revealing the fate of active choroidal neo-vascular membrane such as intra- and&#xD;
      sub-retinal fluid accumulation and retinal thickening. On optical coherence tomography CNV&#xD;
      appears as sub-retinal or sub-retinal pigment epithelium hyper reflective material with&#xD;
      limited differentiation between unreactive fibrous and/or active neo-vascular tissue.&#xD;
      Retreatment decisions are mainly based on assessment of extravascular fluid and not on an&#xD;
      analysis of neo-vascular activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optical coherence tomography angiography offers a breakthrough in diagnostic imaging by&#xD;
      allowing non-invasive visualization of retinal and choroidal vascular flow via&#xD;
      motion-contrast imaging. Optical coherence tomography angiography provides depth-resolved&#xD;
      visualization of the retinal and choroidal vasculature without the need for dye injection.&#xD;
      The technology has been applied for the diagnosis and monitoring of choroidal neo-vascular&#xD;
      membrane in age-related macular degeneration. Optical coherence tomography angiography has&#xD;
      described features of myopic choroidal neo-vascular membrane and demonstrated its high&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity for neo-vascular detection. Optical coherence tomography&#xD;
      angiography is a new noninvasive imaging modality, based on high-frequency scanning for the&#xD;
      detection of blood cell movement. This imaging modality takes advantage of the optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography capacity to generate images by measuring the amplitude and delay of&#xD;
      reflected and backscattered light. Multiple repeated scans are carried out in the same&#xD;
      retinal location, and the images obtained are compared to identify the signal differences&#xD;
      between two consecutive scans. Because the retina is a static structure, it is reasonable to&#xD;
      suppose that these changes are imputable to the blood flow. This precise and non-invasive&#xD;
      imaging modality offers novel diagnostic opportunities to fill the current gap between&#xD;
      invasive vascular and non- invasive structural imaging.&#xD;
