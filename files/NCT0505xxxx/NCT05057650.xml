  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of community health screening, health&#xD;
      education and nutritional intervention on risk factors for cardiovascular disease in a&#xD;
      predominantly African American population. The health fair and intervention will take place&#xD;
      in a church that typically improves their lifestyle by &quot;giving up for Lent&quot; certain foods or&#xD;
      habits. Participation in this nutrition intervention is voluntary and each participant will&#xD;
      sign an informed consent along with a waiver. On the waiver, the participant can agree to&#xD;
      have all testing performed but can withdraw consent at any time or decide to have only some&#xD;
      of the testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was hypothesized that a community-based health screening and nutritional intervention will&#xD;
      have a positive impact on the participants by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Measuring baseline risk factors&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Educating them about their individual risk for heart disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Providing education on healthy lifestyle&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Providing a nutritional intervention for 40 days with home- delivered plant-based meals&#xD;
           nutrition that has been shown to lower cardiac risk factors&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Repeating the risk factor assessment at the end of the intervention, to demonstrate the&#xD;
           degree of, if any, reduction in cardiac risk as assessed by the American College of&#xD;
           Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease&#xD;
           (ASCVD) Risk Calculator&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Motivating at-risk subjects to seek continued appropriate medical care and to institute&#xD;
           more permanent relevant lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, medication compliance).&#xD;

      Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective study design will be implemented. Approximately 50 participants are expected to&#xD;
      volunteer for the intervention. The health screening will consist of measuring stations.&#xD;
      After signing an informed consent and a waiver, the participant will complete an intake form,&#xD;
      which includes basic patient information and demographics including date of birth, gender,&#xD;
      height, and race/ethnicity. Also on the intake form, the participant will list medications&#xD;
      currently being taken, risk factors for heart disease (i.e., diabetes, hypertension,&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia, and smoking), family history of heart disease, and current medical&#xD;
      conditions. After completing the intake form, the participant will have their height, weight,&#xD;
      blood pressure, and pulse measured. If the participant uses oxygen regularly or is feeling&#xD;
      short of breath, oxygen saturation will be measured using a pulse oximeter. Finally, each&#xD;
      participant will have a blood tests for fasting (preferably for 9 hours) blood glucose,&#xD;
      hemoglobin A1C, insulin level, lipid profile, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, small&#xD;
      dense LDL cholesterol, lipoprotein a, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and suPAR at baseline.&#xD;
      Each of these parameters will be repeated for comparison at day 40 of Lent (Easter weekend).&#xD;
      Blood will be stored for future analysis, since assays for suPAR and TMAO may not be&#xD;
      immediately available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the information gathered, each participant will be given a baseline American College of&#xD;
      Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease&#xD;
      (ASCVD) risk score, which is an estimate of the 10-year and lifetime risks of ASCVD (defined&#xD;
      as coronary death or nonfatal myocardial infarction, or fatal or nonfatal stroke). After the&#xD;
      last visit, health education and counseling will be provided which is tailored to each&#xD;
      individual given the findings gathered during the initial screening and the change that&#xD;
      occurred. The information gathered will be written down on a form for the participant to keep&#xD;
      for his own records. Referrals to primary care physicians, cardiologists, or other healthcare&#xD;
      providers will be given as needed after the initial or post-intervention risk assessment.&#xD;
      Patients who undergo lipid, blood pressure or glucose lowering therapy between the two&#xD;
      assessments will be censured from the appropriate laboratory data analysis.&#xD;
