    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline to week 6 in Irritable Bowel Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS), a questionnaire that includes 5 questions related to the severity of abdominal pain, frequency of abdominal pain, severity of abdominal distention, dissatisfaction with bowel habits, and interference with quality of life over the past 10 days.
