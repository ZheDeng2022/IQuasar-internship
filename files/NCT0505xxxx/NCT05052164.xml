  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Celiac disease (CD) is an immunological disorder that mainly affects the small intestine,&#xD;
      generating an inflammatory process in response to the presence of gluten (a protein).&#xD;
      Autoimmune diseases are part of a group of diseases that are difficult to diagnose without a&#xD;
      specific protocol or consensus to detect them due to the number of symptoms and diseases with&#xD;
      which it has a relationship. The incidence of CD in Spain -according to data from the rest of&#xD;
      the European Economic Community, since there is no study on incidence in Spain- is assumed to&#xD;
      be approximately 1 per 100 live births. It is more frequent in women, with a 2:1 ratio. The&#xD;
      only treatment consists of a STRICT GLUTEN-FREE DIET FOR LIFE. This results in the&#xD;
      disappearance of symptoms, normalization of serology and recovery of intestinal villi.&#xD;
      Failure to follow the diet can lead to important complications which, especially in&#xD;
      adulthood, can manifest themselves in the form of osteopenia, osteoporosis and a high risk of&#xD;
      neoplasms in the digestive tract, mainly. The main objective is to achieve a physical and&#xD;
      physiological improvement in menopausal or post-menopausal celiac women. The specific&#xD;
      objectives will be to know the influence of a dietary-nutritional program combined with&#xD;
      physical exercise in menopausal or post-menopausal celiac women on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical condition (strength, endurance, functional autonomy...).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychological aspects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physiological parameters (heart rate, maximum oxygen consumption, blood analysis...).&#xD;
