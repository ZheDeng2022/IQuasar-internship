  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Epilepsy leads to cognitive impairment in 20-50%. Compared to seizures, these&#xD;
      cognitive disorders are a major additional factor in occupational, social and family&#xD;
      disability. Memory and language skills are most often impaired. These disorders are well&#xD;
      described, multifactorial, but no therapy (drug and/or non-drug) has been validated to date.&#xD;
      Recently, cognitive remediation techniques have shown benefits in certain neurological&#xD;
      pathologies, such as multiple sclerosis. In adult epilepsy, few previous cognitive&#xD;
      remediation studies were performed but suffer significant methodological shortcomings that&#xD;
      limit the scope of their results. Studies that have focused on cognitive function have shown&#xD;
      promising results for attention and memory. In contrast, in the area of language, no studies&#xD;
      have been published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: to evaluate the effectiveness of a digital solution (PRODDIGE*) on the lexical&#xD;
      access capacities in people with epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Randomized, multicentric, observational study which will compare the use of a digital&#xD;
      solution (PRODDIGE) in total autonomy versus the supervised use by a trained&#xD;
      neuropsychologist. A neuropsychological assessment will be provided before and after a period&#xD;
      of 4 months of use of the digital solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material: The medical project aims to offer an application of cognitive remediation to&#xD;
      patients who suffer from cognitive impairments and especially language disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T The App is like a serious game, it's based on the playfulness of &quot;game&quot; and the seriousness&#xD;
      of &quot;medical exercise&quot;. During the exercise the patient can ask for clues help and isn't&#xD;
      constrained by time in order to succeed &quot;his mission&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: This will be the first French speaking app specifically dedicated to&#xD;
      rehabilitation of language deficits observed in people with epilepsy. The expected benefits&#xD;
      are an improvement of the patients' language complaints, the regular use of an adapted&#xD;
      digital solution to improve their language difficulties, but also a better understanding of&#xD;
      their disorders and an improvement of their self-esteem.&#xD;

      o best help patients, Norsys enterprise designed the app with three key principles:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Co-designed, to encourage the emergence of original solutions about uses from patients&#xD;
           and therapists,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. User-friendly, to encourage the patient to exercise regularly and with pleasure (soft,&#xD;
           optimistic, pleasant and calm mood),&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Accessible design, to get an application compatible and adapted to the specifics of&#xD;
           these patients (contrast, color, typography, manipulation) According to these&#xD;
           principles, the app gives access to 6 mini-games in its first version and will be&#xD;
           available on iOS and Android smartphones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These exercises allow patients to work on specific aspects of their pathologies, this is how&#xD;
      the exercises are intended to be playful, dynamic (ex. drag'n'drop) and sometimes&#xD;
      collaborative.&#xD;
