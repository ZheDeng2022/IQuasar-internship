      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of SmokefreeTXT, a smoking&#xD;
      cessation text messaging program currently available to anyone in the United States through&#xD;
      www.smokefree.gov, and to compare cessation outcomes for smokers living in different regions&#xD;
      of Virginia while participants use the program. Participants will be asked to complete&#xD;
      assessments at Baseline, 7 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months and will be asked to use a research&#xD;
      version of SmokefreeTXT.&#xD;

    <description>The program is identical to the publicly available program available through the National Cancer Institute Smokefree.gov Initiative but has been set up to be delivered through a research account. The program will send 3-5 messages a day over 7 weeks, with one week to prepare for a quit attempt and 6 weeks of cessation support messages. Participants can get real time support for cravings, mood, and slips by texting &quot;keywords&quot; to the program. They keywords are CRAVE, MOOD, and SLIP. Participants can also re-set their quit date by texting NEW. The program asks questions each week to ask about smoking status and about mood and cravings.</description>
