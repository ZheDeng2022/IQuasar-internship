  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tabula Rasa HealthCare (TRHC), doing business as CareKinesis, is the first national pharmacy&#xD;
      that provides science-based medication risk identification and mitigation technologies and&#xD;
      services. CareKinesis utilizes medication decision support tools and pharmacists certified in&#xD;
      geriatrics to provide pharmacy services for various healthcare organizations including PACE&#xD;
      organizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) is a Medicare-Medicaid program that&#xD;
      provides comprehensive medical and supportive services to individuals &gt;55 years of age who&#xD;
      are certified by their state as needing nursing home care. As an alternative to&#xD;
      institutionalization, PACE helps these individuals live safely in their community. The aim of&#xD;
      PACE is to improve overall quality of life in four domains (physical, psychological, social,&#xD;
      and spiritual) using a multidisciplinary approach. In the United States, the vast majority of&#xD;
      PACE organizations collaborate with one pharmacy to dispense drugs, in addition to other&#xD;
      pharmacy services, for their population of participants. Presently, CareKinesis services&#xD;
      approximately 140 PACE sites, across the country. As a national PACE pharmacy provider since&#xD;
      2011, CareKinesis focuses on improving medication regimens to reduce medication-related risks&#xD;
      while enhancing economic, clinical and humanistic outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pharmacist-led pharmacogenomics (PGx) clinical services and medication safety reviews are&#xD;
      currently being offered to PACE organizations under the direction of licensed healthcare&#xD;
      prescribers by CareKinesis d/b/a Tabula Rasa HealthCare. This project aims to include&#xD;
      patients enrolled in the PACE organization who received PGx testing. PGx testing was&#xD;
      performed by one of several contracted PGx vendors with TRHC (e.g., Corriel, CQuentia,&#xD;
      OneOme) at the time. Upon return from the laboratory, PGx results were integrated into TRHC's&#xD;
      proprietary Clinical Decision Support System (Medication Risk Mitigationâ„¢ Matrix,&#xD;
      CareKinesis, Moorestown, NJ) that guides pharmacists to identify DDIs, DGIs, and DDGIs. As&#xD;
      part of this workflow, clinical pharmacists utilized PGx results combined with a&#xD;
      comprehensive DDI review (via PGx consult, medication safety review, and/or polypharmacy&#xD;
      call) to inform their recommendations to PACE prescribers to address medication problems,&#xD;
      including those related to DDIs, DGIs, and/or DDGIs (drug-induced phenoconversion). Upon&#xD;
      reviewing the pharmacist's recommendation(s) and based on their clinical assessment, PACE&#xD;
      prescribers decided whether to implement the recommended changes. This current study plans to&#xD;
      collect data retrospectively from the past six years (2016-2021) on specific PGx test&#xD;
      results, genotype-guided and interacting drugs, and recommendations, in order to look for any&#xD;
      patterns that may help optimize the process of PGx consultation and/or PGx-guided&#xD;
      recommendations, with the ultimate goal of reducing adverse drug events and improving patient&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
