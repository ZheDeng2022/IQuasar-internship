  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no recent information on the required dose of neostigmine for the reversal of&#xD;
      cisatracurium-induced moderate neuromuscular blockade (NMB) [Train-of-four (TOF) count =&#xD;
      1-3)] in children. The aim of this study will be to evaluate by means of a prospective,&#xD;
      randomized and double-blinded clinical trial, the time required for reversal of moderate NMB&#xD;
      (TOFc 3) to T4/T1 (TOF ratio, TOFr) &gt; 0.9 and TOFr = 1.0 after administration of different&#xD;
      doses of neostigmine (10, 20 or 30 mcg/kg) or placebo in children undergoing inhalational&#xD;
      (sevoflurane) general anesthesia. In addition, the probability of NMB reversal in less than&#xD;
      10 minutes, the presence of bradycardia, respiratory complications and postoperative vomiting&#xD;
      will be evaluated. The time for reversal is expected to be inversely proportional to the&#xD;
      administered dose of neostigmine.&#xD;

      Children aged between 2 and 10 years old submitted to general anesthesia to perform&#xD;
      tonsillectomy associated or not to adenoidectomy and will be evaluated in this prospective&#xD;
      and randomized study. Patients will be randomly distributed into one of 4 groups according to&#xD;
      the dose of neostigmine used for NMB reversal:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group N10: reversal with neostigmine 10 mcg/kg and atropine 5 mcg/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group N20: reversal with neostigmine 20 mcg/kg and atropine 10 mcg/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group N30: reversal with neostigmine 30 mcg/kg and atropine 15 mcg/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group P: spontaneous reversal (placebo)&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient, an opaque envelope will be prepared, sealed and numbered sequentially&#xD;
      containing the group to which the patient will be allocated. A list of randomized&#xD;
      computer-generated numbers (www.random.org) will be used for this purpose. No surgeon,&#xD;
      assistant nursing, and anesthesiologist involved in anesthesia control or data collection&#xD;
      will be aware of the dose of neostigmine to be administered. An anesthesiologist not involved&#xD;
      in the study will be responsible for preparing the solution containing neostigmine and&#xD;
      atropine (diluted with saline solution until complete 10mL) according to the group to which&#xD;
      each patient belongs. The syringes will be similar and identified only with a label with the&#xD;
      word &quot;reversal&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY SEQUENCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia No child will receive preanesthetic medication. After entry into the operating&#xD;
      room, all patients will be monitored with cardioscope, noninvasive blood pressure, pulse&#xD;
      oximetry and, after tracheal intubation, with capnography. In all children, venous access&#xD;
      will be obtained in one of the upper limbs after induction under facial mask with sevoflurane&#xD;
      (6%) in mixture with O2 5 L/min. After pre-oxygenation, tracheal intubation will be performed&#xD;
      after intravenous fentanyl (3 mcg/kg) and cisatracurium (0.1 mg/kg). Anesthesia maintenance&#xD;
      will be based on sevoflurane (1 to 2 CAM) diluted in O2/air flow (60%) 2 L/min. Ventilation&#xD;
      will be controlled, with tidal volume and respiratory rate adjusted for the maintenance of&#xD;
      PETCO2 between 30 and 40 mmHg. When there is a suspicion of inadequate anesthesia plan the&#xD;
      concentration of sevoflurane will be increased and if adequacy is not sufficient, additional&#xD;
      fentanyl bolus (1 mcg/kg) will be administered. Repeated doses of cisatracurium (0.02 mg/kg)&#xD;
      will be used to maintain TOFc &lt; 4. All patients will receive clonidine 2 mcg/kg&#xD;
      intravenously, dexamethasone 0.1 mg/kg, ondansetron 0.1 mg/kg, dipyrone 30 mg/kg and morphine&#xD;
      0.1 mg/kg. Hydration will be performed with 0.9% saline (2 mL/kg/h). The central temperature&#xD;
      will be kept above 36 degrees Celsius and peripheral (tenar eminence of the monitored palm)&#xD;
      above 32 degrees Celsius. The NMB reversal will be performed when TOFc 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of neuromuscular blockade NMB will be monitored by the acceleromyography method&#xD;
      (TOF Watch ®; Schering-Plough) as recommended for use in clinical research. The acceleration&#xD;
      transducer will be fixed on the volar side of the distal phalanx of the thumb. Venous access&#xD;
      and blood pressure cuff will be positioned on the opposite arm to the limb used for NMB&#xD;
      monitoring. After cleaning the skin in the path of the ulnar nerve in the forearm, the&#xD;
      electrodes will be positioned at the height of the wrist with a distance between 3 to 6 cm&#xD;
      between them. Calibration will be performed after automatically after a 50 Hz tetanic&#xD;
      stimulation for 5 seconds. The stimulation (Train-of-Four, TOF) will be applied every 15&#xD;
      seconds for 2 minutes before cisatracurium administration. No additional doses of NMB will be&#xD;
      given. Once the third response to TOF is obtained, a dose of neostigmine (10, 20 or 30&#xD;
      mcg/kg) will be administered and the time until the TOF reaches values equal to 0.9 and 1.0&#xD;
      will be recorded. The primary outcome will be the time required for the reversal of moderate&#xD;
      NMB (TOFc 3) up to TOFr 0.9 and TOFr 1.0. In addition, the probability of reversal of NMB in&#xD;
      less than 10 minutes after administration of different doses of neostigmine will be&#xD;
      evaluated. The sample size will be based on a previous study that determined the need for 12&#xD;
      patients per group to detect a difference of 4 minutes and a standard deviation of 3 minutes&#xD;
      with a power of 80% and alpha error of 5%. 9 Considering the possible losses, a total of 60&#xD;
      children will be randomized.&#xD;
