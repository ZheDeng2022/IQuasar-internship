      DianaWeb is a community-based participatory research (CBPR) offered to Italian breast cancer&#xD;
      patients. The aim of the study is the evaluation of effectiveness of a lifestyle and&#xD;
      nutrition intervention to improve the prognosis. DianaWeb study utilizes an interactive&#xD;
      website - http://www.dianaweb.org/ - to monitor patient life-style, and to obtain clinical,&#xD;
      pathological and anthropometric data (height, body weight, waist circumference and blood&#xD;
      pressure). Detailed instructions were provided for measuring at home. The website contains&#xD;
      theoretical and practical advice to encourage women to follow healthy lifestyles and&#xD;
      nutrition, and the indications emerging from research for women diagnosed with breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DianaWeb study intends to recruit 50.000 women with breast cancer diagnosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to carry out a participatory research on the influence of lifestyle&#xD;
      after cancer diagnosis on the risk of recurrence. The investigators intend wake available to&#xD;
      breast cancer survivors' evidence-based information on the effects of lifestyle on quality of&#xD;
      life and prognosis and to invite and help them to adopt potentially preventive sustainable&#xD;
      lifestyle changes. To improve the prognosis, the investigators will base the recommendations&#xD;
      on the European Code Against Cancer 2014 (ECAC), on the World Cancer Research Fund 2018&#xD;
      (AICR/WCRF), Continuous Update Project (CUP) 2014 specific recommendations to breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors, and on Mediterranean diet. As for the prevention of side effect of treatments&#xD;
      there is no definitive evidence, but the daily exercise seems for reducing menopausal&#xD;
      symptoms and osteoporosis, while regular consumption of food with diuretic effect for&#xD;
      arthralgia due to aromatase inhibitors. The investigators are aware that the path for&#xD;
      creating data to implementing evidence in routine practice is long and arduous. The&#xD;
      investigators are confident, however, that engaging participants in the research process will&#xD;
      enable many of participants to implement evidence-based practices in everyday life. The&#xD;
      investigators, together with computer programmers, have developed an interactive website to&#xD;
      build a large cohort of breast cancer survivors and to follow up participants about the&#xD;
      impact of lifestyles and nutrition on recurrences, incidence of second breast cancer,&#xD;
      metastasis, other cancers and other chronic diseases. The investigators will also monitor the&#xD;
      prevalence of side effects of treatments (the investigators will focus on menopausal&#xD;
      symptoms, arthralgia, osteoporosis and bone fractures). Observational epidemiological studies&#xD;
      have consistently shown that sedentary lifestyle, overweight, metabolic syndrome, chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory status, high glycemia and insulinemia, and a few specific dietary factors (low&#xD;
      fibre and high saturated fat) are associated with poor breast cancer specific survival. There&#xD;
      is ample room for reducing recurrences and cancer progression through lifestyles and&#xD;
      nutrition. All these factors are clearly modifiable, but there is uncertainty, however, over&#xD;
      whether voluntarily changing these factors after breast cancer diagnosis improve prognosis.&#xD;
      In a 5 years' time the study after recruitment, the investigators are expected to confirm the&#xD;
      prognostic role of this factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Italy every year over 50.000 women develop breast cancer. The country is fairly well&#xD;
      equipped with excellent breast cancer units and in the second decade of the twenty-first&#xD;
      century 5-year breast cancer net survival reached 88%, a performance similar to the best&#xD;
      European countries. Over 750.000 Italian women live with a previous diagnosis of breast&#xD;
      cancer. Many of them with some form of cancer treatment and suffer from feeling left alone,&#xD;
      fear of cancer recurrence and not receiving enough information and guidance after treatment:&#xD;
      on prognosis, side effects of treatment, lifestyle strategies to help preventing side effects&#xD;
      of treatments, recurrences and new primaries. Many survivors integrate adjuvant treatment&#xD;
      with complementary treatments without scientific proof of efficacy, even with folk treatments&#xD;
      that might increase the risk of recurrences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Young women undergoing adjuvant breast cancer therapy experience a heavy impairment in&#xD;
      important quality of life domains (anxiety, depression, loss or sexual desire, weight gain).&#xD;
      The great majority of women under hormonal treatment experience an increase in the prevalence&#xD;
      of menopausal symptoms and have sexual dysfunction that is distressing and difficult to&#xD;
      resolve. In postmenopausal survivors with aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia the&#xD;
      intensity of pain is associated with fear of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigating whether lifestyle factors affect breast cancer patients' survival is a&#xD;
      relatively new area of research, but there is growing evidence that the effect of modifiable&#xD;
      anthropometric and metabolic factors may be of the same order of magnitude than the effect of&#xD;
      the usual clinic-pathological risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiological evidence, even if based only on observational studies, suggest that lifestyle&#xD;
      modification, including physical exercise and dietary habits, might have a strong impact on&#xD;
      breast cancer patients overall and specific survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CUP have shown that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. overweight and obesity are associated with 10-20% increased risk of recurrences;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. physical activity after diagnosis is associated with 30-40% reduction of recurrences and&#xD;
           mortality;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. soy food consumption is associated with lower risk&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. saturated fat consumption is associated with higher risk&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. higher consumption of foods containing fibre after diagnosis of primary breast cancer&#xD;
           reduces risk of all-cause mortality Epidemiological studies have shown that modifiable&#xD;
           lifestyle factors and biomarkers affecting the occurrence of breast cancer also affect&#xD;
           breast cancer prognosis: obesity, metabolic syndrome, sedentary lifestyle, high fat&#xD;
           intake, alcohol consumption, high fasting glucose plasma levels (independently of the&#xD;
           presence of metabolic syndrome), clinical chronic inflammation, high plasma insulin and&#xD;
           sex hormone levels, low sex hormone-binding protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity is associated with a higher incidence of locally advanced disease, and worse&#xD;
      prognosis after diagnosis, both before and after menopause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The obesity is also related to poor quality of life and increased risk of developing comorbid&#xD;
      conditions. Weight gain during and after cancer treatment also increases the risk of&#xD;
      recurrence. Both chemotherapy and, to a lesser extent, tamoxifen and nonsteroidal aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitors have been associated with weight gain. Among the potential mechanisms behind the&#xD;
      association between weight gain, obesity, and breast cancer recurrence and mortality there is&#xD;
      an increased conversion of androgens to oestrogens in peripheral adipose tissue and increased&#xD;
      circulating levels of insulin, insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), and leptins, that promote&#xD;
      tumour cell proliferation. Current breast cancer treatments can have a negative impact on&#xD;
      cardiovascular health (left ventricular dysfunction, accelerated cardiovascular disease-CVD),&#xD;
      and for women with pre-existing CVD, this might influence cancer treatment decisions by both&#xD;
      the patient and the provider. Improvements in early detection and treatment of breast cancer&#xD;
      have led to an increasing number of breast cancer survivors who are at risk of long-term&#xD;
      cardiac complications from cancer treatments. Ideal breast cancer outcomes are reliant on&#xD;
      coexisting cardiovascular health along the entire journey of breast cancer treatment. During&#xD;
      breast cancer treatment, surveillance, prevention, and secondary management of cardiotoxicity&#xD;
      are crucial; thereafter, long-term post-treatment monitoring for late cardiotoxicity and even&#xD;
      non-treatment-related development of CVD is essential. Breast cancer and CVD share a number&#xD;
      of common risk factors. Cardiovascular clinical care and research have focused on risk&#xD;
      factors for &gt;60 years, because it is believed that 80% of CVD can be prevented through risk&#xD;
      factor modifications such as promoting a healthy diet, physical activity, and a healthy&#xD;
      weight; abstinence from tobacco; blood pressure control; diabetes mellitus management; and a&#xD;
      good lipid profile. In women with breast cancer, treatment and the disease itself contribute&#xD;
      to weight gain and to decreases in physical activity. Furthermore, it has been reported that&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary function in patients with breast cancer improves with exercise, and regular&#xD;
      exercise results in an improvement in quality of life. Although the usefulness of exercise to&#xD;
      prevent CVD in patients with breast cancer has not been evaluated in randomized trials, it is&#xD;
      reasonable to follow the recommendations for physical activity, that is, moderate-intensity&#xD;
      aerobic physical activity of ‚â•30 minutes 5 days each week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High fasting glycaemia, even within the normal range, is associated with higher incidence of&#xD;
      recurrences. Also, the metabolic syndrome is associated with increased risk of breast cancer&#xD;
      recurrences in patients diagnosed both before and after menopause and risk of developing&#xD;
      distant metastasis than patients without any metabolic syndrome trait. Metabolic syndrome,&#xD;
      also called insulin-resistance syndrome, is usually associated with high insulin and&#xD;
      testosterone levels, and with clinical chronic inflammation. Independently of the presence of&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome several studies have shown that breast cancer patients with high&#xD;
      testosterone levels have worst prognosis. Insulin stimulates the synthesis of testosterone in&#xD;
      the ovary, and high plasma insulin levels are associated with increased risk of recurrences.&#xD;
      Insulin also increases the bioavailability of IGF-I (through the promotion of its liver&#xD;
      synthesis and the inhibition of the synthesis of its binding proteins IGFBP-I) associated&#xD;
      with prognosis in women with breast cancer. Also, high plasma levels of C-Reactive Protein&#xD;
      (CRP), even within the normal range, are associated with increased risk of recurrence and&#xD;
      shorter survival in patients with advanced breast cancer. It seems reasonable to hypothesize&#xD;
      that a comprehensive lifestyle modification, based on AICR/WCRF and ECAC recommendations,&#xD;
      consistent with traditional Mediterranean diet, may reduce the risk of recurrences and&#xD;
      improve prognosis. Studies have shown that dietary intervention recommending a modified&#xD;
      Mediterranean diet can reduce biological markers of breast cancer risk and recurrences:&#xD;
      glycemia, insulinemia, IGF-I bioavailability and chronic inflammatory status. The Western&#xD;
      dietary pattern, high in refined grains, sugars, simple carbohydrates, red meat, and high-fat&#xD;
      dairy products, increases the levels of pro-inflammatory markers such as CRP and&#xD;
      interleukin-6 (IL-6). In contrast, a traditional Mediterranean diet with consumption of whole&#xD;
      grains cereals, pulses, vegetables, fruits, fish, nuts and extravirgin olive oil is&#xD;
      associated with lower levels of pro-inflammatory biomarkers, including endothelial adhesion&#xD;
      molecules, CRP, and tumor necrosis-Œ± (TNF-Œ±). Physical exercise also seems to reduce chronic&#xD;
      inflammation. Furthermore, several studies have suggested a decrease of breast cancer&#xD;
      recurrence and death in patients who exercise at least 30 min /day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These information's are not currently available to patients and are not yet included in&#xD;
      oncology protocols. With a few exceptions, physicians too are not aware of these scientific&#xD;
      results and are not yet culturally prepared for life-style prescriptions. DianaWeb does not&#xD;
      interfere with prescribed oncological treatments, on the contrary it recommends participants&#xD;
      to follow the oncologist's prescriptions, but the study wants avoid the access to&#xD;
      non-scientifically correct information that could worsen the prognosis or change the quality&#xD;
      of life or health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is increasing interest, in the research community, in a community-based participatory&#xD;
      research. Its relevance often is relegated to the &quot;right end&quot; of the research continuum, but&#xD;
      may contribute also to asking the right questions, in particular the more relevant questions&#xD;
      for the patients, to improve compliance, and to ensure that basic science research findings&#xD;
      affect cancer outcomes in materially important ways especially for large communities that&#xD;
      communicate through modern media as websites.&#xD;
