  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During a pandemic, length of hospital stay (LOS) is critical to managing high patient volumes&#xD;
      and preserves access to care related to non-COVID-19 for maintaining the healthcare system.&#xD;
      Moreover, identiﬁcation of prolonged hospital stay may allow physicians to reevaluate&#xD;
      critical patients, focused delivery of specific interventions, and improve the efficiency of&#xD;
      hospital care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, in previous recent studies, attention has been paid to patients with diabetes&#xD;
      and COVID-19 infection may require a prolonged LOS. However, there is little evidence on&#xD;
      prognostic factors associated with an extension of hospitalization in mild or moderate&#xD;
      illness due to COVID-19 infection. Therefore, it is crucial to determine the most vulnerable&#xD;
      patients with diabetes mellitus even if they have a non-severe COVID-19 infection during the&#xD;
      pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the clinically relevant inflammatory parameters may have an impact on LOS&#xD;
      in older adults with diabetes and non-severe COVID-19 infection. Therefore, we aim to&#xD;
      investigate whether baseline inflammatory parameters on admission hospitals as possible&#xD;
      predictors of prolonged LOS in older adults with diabetes and non-severe COVID-19 infection&#xD;
      during the pandemic.&#xD;
