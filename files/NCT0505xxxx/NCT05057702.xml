      The current study will use a new treatment approach based on the molecular characteristics of&#xD;
      each participant's tumor. The study will test the feasibility of performing real-time drug&#xD;
      screening on tissue taken during surgery, and of having a specialized tumor board assign a&#xD;
      treatment plan based on the results of this screening and genomic sequencing. The aim of this&#xD;
      trial is to allow every child and young adult with medulloblastoma to receive the most&#xD;
      effective and least toxic therapies currently available, and will pave the way for improved&#xD;
      understanding and treatment of these tumors in the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm multi-center pilot trial within the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology&#xD;
      Consortium (PNOC). Relapsed participants will receive an individualized treatment&#xD;
      recommendation including up to four FDA-approved drugs based on the results of real-time&#xD;
      high-throughput drug screening, whole exome sequencing (WES), and RNA sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the feasibility of using the results of real-time in vitro drug screening,&#xD;
      whole exome sequencing, and RNA sequencing of participant-derived specimens to guide&#xD;
      treatment recommendations by a specialized tumor board, in a clinically-actionable timeframe,&#xD;
      for children and young adults with recurrent medulloblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and describe the toxicity of treating children and young adults&#xD;
      with relapsed medulloblastoma according to a specialized tumor board that makes treatment&#xD;
      recommendations based on real-time drug screening and genomic sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the objective response rate, progression free survival at 6 months (PFS-6) and&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) of relapsed medulloblastoma in children and young adults treated with&#xD;
      an individualized treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess Quality of Life (QOL) measures in participants with relapsed medulloblastoma&#xD;
      treated with an individualized regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To archive tumor and normal DNA from each participant along with serial blood draw&#xD;
      following therapies as biospecimens for later studies to determine whether circulating tumor&#xD;
      DNA (ctDNA) sequences in the participant's blood serve as biomarkers of tumor burden,&#xD;
      response to therapy, or development of drug resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may continue treatment as tolerated for up to two years or until disease&#xD;
      progression. Participants will be followed until progression, death, or up to 5 years from&#xD;
      start of therapy.&#xD;
