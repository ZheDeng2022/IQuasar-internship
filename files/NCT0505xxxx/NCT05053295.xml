             of the IP and treatment with steroids, etc. is not required for 7 days before&#xD;
             administration of the IP after treatment of central nervous system or brain&#xD;
             metastases.) C. Diseases that may clinically increase the risk of gastrointestinal&#xD;

             is uncontrolled or requires treatment (e.g., heart disease, decreased lung function,&#xD;
             decreased kidney function, hypotension, hypertension, findings of myelosuppression,&#xD;
             hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, history of alcohol addiction, myocardial infarction)&#xD;
