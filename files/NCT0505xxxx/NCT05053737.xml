      Hypothesis: that the addition of SBRT to neoadjuvant checkpoint inhibition would be safe and&#xD;
      would prime the immune system and improve the chances of a successful surgery and overall&#xD;
      survival. The preliminary analysis demonstrated the safety of dose escalation of&#xD;
      anti-PD-L1-RT to 18Gy in 3 fractions. In this study, the maximum dose to the tumor was&#xD;
      escalated to 133%, an equivalent dose of 24 Gy in 3 fractions, with no safety or unexpected&#xD;
      surgical issues encountered. At interim analysis, counting all patients, even those treated&#xD;
      for the 12Gy in 2 fractions and even those that received surgery at 2 weeks, the rate of&#xD;
      pTR-2 or greater was close to 100%. With only 11 analyzable patients and counting those who&#xD;
      received the dose escalated 18 Gy in 3 fractions radiation with anti-PD-L1, investigators&#xD;
      have observed much higher pathological responses. Another group of investigators has also&#xD;
      demonstrated the safety of delivering 24 Gy in 3 fractions with anti-PD-L1&#xD;
      (https://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/26/12_Supplement_2/B01). Given the safety and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of 24 Gy in 3 fractions SBRT with anti-PD-L1 therapy in the neoadjuvant&#xD;
      setting, the investigators propose the present study to assess the impact of this regimen on&#xD;
      pathologic tumor response rate.&#xD;

                  are eligible for the study&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with eczema, psoriasis, lichen simplex chronicus, or vitiligo with&#xD;
                  dermatologic manifestations only (e.g., patients with psoriatic arthritis are&#xD;
                  excluded) are eligible for the study provided all of following conditions are&#xD;
                  met:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  Disease is well controlled at baseline and requires only low-potency topical&#xD;
                       corticosteroids&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  No occurrence of acute exacerbations of the underlying condition requiring&#xD;
                       psoralen plus ultraviolet A radiation, methotrexate, retinoids, biologic&#xD;
                       agents, oral calcineurin inhibitors, or high-potency or oral corticosteroids&#xD;
                       within the previous 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes clinical&#xD;
             history, physical examination and radiographic findings, and TB testing in line with&#xD;
             local practice), hepatitis B (known positive HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) result),&#xD;
             hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (positive HIV 1/2 antibodies). Patients&#xD;
             with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core&#xD;
             antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible. Patients positive for&#xD;
             hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is negative&#xD;
             for HCV RNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, organizing pneumonia (e.g., bronchiolitis&#xD;
             obliterans), drug-induced pneumonitis, or idiopathic pneumonitis, or evidence of&#xD;
             active pneumonitis on screening chest computed tomography (CT) scan. History of&#xD;
             radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field (fibrosis) is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. Treatment with a live, attenuated vaccine within 120 days prior to initiation of study&#xD;
             treatment, or anticipation of need for such a vaccine during atezolizumab treatment or&#xD;
             within 150 days after the final dose of atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
         27. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding or male or female patients of&#xD;
             reproductive potential who are not willing to employ highly effective birth control&#xD;
             from screening to about 1 80 days after the last dose of atezolizumab monotherapy.&#xD;
             Patient must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours of study&#xD;
             entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
         28. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any of the study drug&#xD;
             excipients&#xD;
&#xD;
         29. Prior randomization or treatment in a previous atezolizumab clinical study&#xD;
&#xD;
         30. Patients with p16-positive oropharyngeal SCC. No verification of p16 status is needed&#xD;
             for laryngeal cancer or oral cavity cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
         31. Patients with distant metastatic disease on initial screening imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
         32. Judgment by the investigator that the patient is unsuitable to participate in the&#xD;
             study and the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and&#xD;
             requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
         33. History of severe allergic anaphylactic reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies&#xD;
             or fusion proteins&#xD;
&#xD;
         34. Known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or to any component of&#xD;
             the atezolizumab formulation&#xD;
