  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present test-negative design study aims to estimate the real-world effectiveness of&#xD;
      Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine on symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and its&#xD;
      consequences following a mass vaccination campaign in the city of Toledo in Southern Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals aged 12 years or older who seek the public healthcare system with symptoms&#xD;
      suggestive COVID-19 will be enrolled. Participants with a positive polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 will be classified as cases, and those with negative PCR test for&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 will be classified as controls. Cases will be followed-up for a period of one year&#xD;
      by means of structured telephone interviews.&#xD;
