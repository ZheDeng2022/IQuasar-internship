    <textblock>
      This will be a single centre, Phase 1, placebo-controlled, randomized, doubleblind,&#xD;
      sequential SAD study to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of GMA106 in healthy&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

      The objective of the study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of single GMA106 SC&#xD;
      injection. The study design is a standard design for this type of study. This SAD study will&#xD;
      consist of 6 cohorts (1 cohort per dose level). Within each cohort, 8 subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive under fasting conditions, either the study drug GMA106,&#xD;
      or matching placebo. In each cohort, 6 subjects will be administered GMA106 and 2 subjects&#xD;
      will receive the matching placebo, for a total of 48 subjects planned for evaluation in this&#xD;
      study. One randomization scheme will be produced for each cohort separately.&#xD;
