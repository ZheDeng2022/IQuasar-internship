  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fabry disease is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficient activity of&#xD;
      the enzyme α-Gal A resulting from mutations affecting the GLA gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is characterized by severe multi-systemic involvement that leads to major organ failure&#xD;
      and premature death in affected men and in some women. The α-Gal A deficiency results in&#xD;
      progressive accumulation of un-degraded glycosphingolipids, predominantly&#xD;
      globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), within cell lysosomes throughout the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients at the second or third decade, progressive proteinuria, decline in glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate (GFR), and tubular damage occur usually, and renal failure develops in the&#xD;
      fourth decade. Life-threatening renal, cardiac, and cerebrovascular diseases are added in&#xD;
      later decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to that, Fabry disease patient will eventually face end-stage renal disease&#xD;
      (ESRD) which was the most common cause of death in Fabry patients before the development of&#xD;
      dialysis and renal transplantation. Thus it is critical to identify Fabry patient as early as&#xD;
      possible, before reaching the stage of ESRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, early intervention of enzyme replacement therapy for Fabry Disease patient&#xD;
      which will help the patient to preserve a better renal function and benefit from treatment&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from that today there is only one study published from Turkey for Fabry disease&#xD;
      screening in CKD patient where they have screened 1453 and found that the overall prevalence&#xD;
      of Fabry disease in CKD patient was found to be 0.2% , 3/1453 (in which 0.4% in 656 male,&#xD;
      0.0% in 783 female). However, there was no information available within the Asia region&#xD;
      thereby a very low Fabry disease awareness and diagnostic awareness among nephrologist in&#xD;
      Taiwan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore in the present study the investigators are aiming to investigate the prevalence of&#xD;
      Fabry disease in the CKD population (CKD stage 1 ~ 5) by conducting the first and largest&#xD;
      high risk screening prevalence study among 2,000 CKD patients over 3 years in Taiwan and the&#xD;
      investigators hope by doing such a pilot study our data would contribute to a new paradigm of&#xD;
      Fabry disease diagnosis in the Asia region.&#xD;
