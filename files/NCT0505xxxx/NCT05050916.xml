      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 1.5 million U.S. women of reproductive age are estimated to be infertile. Many more&#xD;
      have difficulty getting pregnant. Menstrual cycles are an indicator of a woman s general&#xD;
      health. Menstrual cycle changes may predict difficulties in getting pregnant. Researchers&#xD;
      want to see what role vitamin D may play in menstrual cycle health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the hormones that come from the brain&#xD;
      and the ovary during a menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women aged 19-40 who have spontaneous menstrual cycles (are not taking any hormones) less&#xD;
      than 50 days in length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will fill out a screening survey about their demographics and health history. It&#xD;
      will take 5-10 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 3 study visits. Participants who are deficient will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either a lower or higher dose of vitamin D supplements. Participants who are&#xD;
      sufficient will receive placebo. If they are vitamin D deficient, they will not get the&#xD;
      placebo. They will take the capsules by mouth, once per week, for 3 menstrual cycles (or&#xD;
      about 90 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have physical exams. Their height, weight, body fat percentage, blood&#xD;
      pressure, and waist-hip ratio will be measured. They will give blood samples. They will have&#xD;
      vaginal and oral swabs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will keep a daily menstrual diary. They will do daily home ovulation testing.&#xD;
      They will collect urine at home. Some women may collect menstrual blood at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will fill out an online survey. It will ask about their health, diet, and&#xD;
      physical activity; birth control use; pregnancy history; menstrual cycle; smoking and&#xD;
      drinking habits; education; and occupation. It will take 20-30 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for four menstrual cycles (about 4 months).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II randomized, dose-ranging clinical trial translates both animal studies and&#xD;
      human observational research into public health relevant research. We will investigate&#xD;
      vitamin D s influence on the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis by careful evaluation of&#xD;
      hormonal, ovulatory, and overall menstrual cycle changes that occur with vitamin D treatment.&#xD;
      Vitamin D supplementation may be a low-cost intervention that improves menstrual cycle&#xD;
      function and fertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After recruitment, there will be two phases to this study: Phase 1 will follow all women for&#xD;
      at least one menstrual cycle prior to supplementation, the 'pre-supplementation cycle'.&#xD;
      During Phase 1, blood will be drawn and assayed for 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD). If their&#xD;
      level is less than 20 ng/ml (deficiency), they will be invited to participate in Phase 2. A&#xD;
      small sample of participants with a level &gt;= 20 ng/ml will also be invited to participate in&#xD;
      Phase 2, as a control group. Participation ends for the remaining women whose level is 20&#xD;
      ng/ml or higher. During Phase 2, deficient women will be randomized (2:3) to receive a&#xD;
      blinded dose of either 4,200 IU or 50,000 IU of vitamin D supplementation per week. The small&#xD;
      group of sufficient women will receive a placebo. Participants will not be told what their&#xD;
      25OHD level was or what group they are in. Women will be followed for three more menstrual&#xD;
      cycles. In the pre-supplementation cycle and in the last of these three cycles, the&#xD;
      'supplemented cycle', women will collect daily urine specimens. Hormone levels will be&#xD;
      compared between the pre-and post-supplementation cycles as the primary analysis. A secondary&#xD;
      analysis will compare the supplemented cycles in the deficient women who received 50,000 IU&#xD;
      and the deficient women who received 4,200 IU&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this trial will test the following hypotheses by comparing vitamin D&#xD;
      supplemented cycles to the pre-supplementation cycles, within-woman: (1) Mid-luteal&#xD;
      progesterone is higher in vitamin D supplemented cycles; (2) Rate of estrogen rise is higher&#xD;
      in vitamin D supplemented cycles; (3) Pre-ovulatory LH is higher in vitamin D supplemented&#xD;
      cycles.&#xD;

    <description>This is a Phase II randomized, dose-ranging clinical trial including 1) a within-woman comparison of hormones pre- and post-supplementation and 2) a comparison across women of two different dose levels. After recruitment, there will be two phases: Phase 1 will follow all women for one menstrual cycle prior to supplementation; blood will be assayed for 25OHD. Phase 2 includes only: 1) women with less than 20 ng/ml 25OHD ('deficient') OR 2) a small ~10% sample of women with &gt;20 ng/ml 25OHD ('sufficient') as the placebo group. During Phase 2, deficient women will be randomized (2:3) to receive a blinded dose of either 4,200 IU or 50,000 IU of vitamin D supplementation per week and followed for three more menstrual cycles. Hormone levels will be compared between the pre-and post-supplementation cycles as the primary analysis. The primary aim will test: if mid-luteal progesterone, rate of estrogen rise and pre-ovulatory LH are higher in vitamin D supplemented cycles.</description>
