  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (HTICi) is a pathology, affecting young adults with a&#xD;
      predominance of women, due to an increase in intracranial pressure, which may be associated&#xD;
      with stenosis of the cerebral venous sinuses and whose origin remains unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This hypertension can lead to papillary edema (OP) which can lead to a narrowing of the&#xD;
      visual field and progress to blindness. Along with weight reduction, acetazolamide, which&#xD;
      reduces the production of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), is prescribed as a first-line treatment.&#xD;
      Its efficacy is inconsistent in resolving papillary edema and there are many side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of ineffectiveness or dependence on acetazolamide associated with hygiene and&#xD;
      dietetic rules, a second line of therapy is then considered: neurosurgical (internal shunt of&#xD;
      the LCS) or endovascular (venous stenting) treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These invasive techniques have each proven their effectiveness in the rapid and permanent&#xD;
      resorption of OP, allowing improvement or preservation of visual function. In terms of&#xD;
      induced morbidity, the superiority of one technique over the other, if it exists, has not&#xD;
      been established. In fact, the literature mainly consists of series of cases or case reports&#xD;
      suggesting a 98% improvement in OP for the stent versus 90% for the neurosurgical shunt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, patients and the assessment of outcomes are very heterogeneous. Major complications&#xD;
      concern 7.6% and minor complications up to 33% of patients treated by bypass according to&#xD;
      Satti et al. in 2015. For stents in 2% of cases major complications occur and minor&#xD;
      complications were reported in 4.4% of cases (Aguilar-Perez et al. 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objective is to compare the efficacy, safety, and safety of LCS bypass surgery versus&#xD;
      venous sinus stenting in HTICi with moderate to severe visual impairment after failure of&#xD;
      medical treatment defined by the absence of resorption of the OP after several months&#xD;

      Intervention 1 Name : internal ventricular shunt (neurosurgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other name [facultatif] :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The internal ventricular shunt consists of the introduction of a catheter from a lateral&#xD;
      ventricle into the atrium or peritoneum. It is associated with a valve whose opening pressure&#xD;
      is adjustable. The goal is that cerebrospinal fluid can be absorbed extra-cranial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention 2 Name : endovacascular stenting (interventional neuroradiology)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other name [facultatif] :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The placement of a vascular endoprosthesis (stent) is an interventional neuroradiology&#xD;
      procedure aimed, by venous approach (percutaneous puncture), to restore the diameter of a&#xD;
      venous sinus. It requires 6 months of antiplatelet aggregation. The aim is to allow better&#xD;
      venous drainage from the brain to increase the absorption of cerebrospinal fluid.&#xD;
