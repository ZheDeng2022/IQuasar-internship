  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that intranasal dexmedetomidine will provide significantly more effective&#xD;
      analgesia and anxiolysis for subjects undergoing a simple laceration repair when compared to&#xD;
      either intranasal fentanyl or intranasal midazolam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional hypotheses include that there will be 1) no significant increase in adverse&#xD;
      effects between drugs and 2) significantly higher satisfaction rates for both subject&#xD;
      experience and ease of laceration repair based on structured, proceduralist feedback.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intranasal medications are rapidly gaining popularity as agents for analgesia and anxiolysis&#xD;
      in the pediatric hospital setting. One of the primary reasons for the popularity of&#xD;
      intranasal medications is ease of administration combined with favorable pharmacokinetics. It&#xD;
      has been well established that children identify venipuncture as one of the most painful and&#xD;
      anxiety-producing procedures during time spent in the hospital, and these experiences have&#xD;
      been shown to have a more lasting impact, producing increased anxiety and fear at subsequent&#xD;
      visits. Although oral and rectal administration of analgesics are also non-invasive,&#xD;
      bioavailability, time to onset, and half-lives are significantly longer with these routes of&#xD;
      administration in comparison to intranasal administration. Multiple studies have shown that&#xD;
      intranasal fentanyl, midazolam, and dexmedetomidine have similar pharmacokinetics to&#xD;
      intravenous preparations and reach adequate serum levels in both the blood and cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid. In the pediatric emergency room setting, intranasal fentanyl and midazolam have been&#xD;
      shown to provide effective analgesia and anxiolysis for a variety of settings, including pain&#xD;
      management (e.g. pain associated with long bone fractures, burns, incision and drainage) and&#xD;
      pre-procedural sedation/anxiolysis (e.g. radiological imaging).Numerous studies have examined&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of intranasal fentanyl and midazolam, and several studies have&#xD;
      examined the efficacy of intranasal dexmedetomidine for non-painful procedural sedation. To&#xD;
      date, two studies have compared the use of intranasal dexmedetomidine and intranasal&#xD;
      midazolam or intranasal dexmedetomidine, intranasal fentanyl, and intranasal midazolam for&#xD;
      anxiolysis in painful procedural sedations. However, as of 2020, no previous studies have&#xD;
      compared the use of intranasal dexmedetomidine, intranasal fentanyl, and intranasal midazolam&#xD;
      for painful procedures in the pediatric emergency setting.&#xD;
