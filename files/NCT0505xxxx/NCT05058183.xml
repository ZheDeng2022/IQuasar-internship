  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the rates of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) in patients&#xD;
      treated with surgery for stage 1 breast cancer that is HER2 positive or triple negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve collecting blood samples from patients before and after surgery, if&#xD;
      patients are enrolled after surgery, blood samples will be collected after the procedure. On&#xD;
      the follow-up visit, the results obtained from the blood tests will serve as a diagnostic&#xD;
      method to discern adverse outcomes in the groups of patients with positive and negative ctDNA&#xD;
      detection. Also, the results obtained will aid physicians in determining treatment courses&#xD;
      for patients, in order to reduce the intensity of adjuvant chemotherapy. By identifying the&#xD;
      patients with residual disease with ctDNA analysis, it is possible that this will improve&#xD;
      disease prognosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with stage 1 breast cancers have a very good prognosis, with the substantial&#xD;
      majority cured by local therapy alone. However, the vast majority of HER2 positive and triple&#xD;
      negative breast cancers (TNBC) with stage 1 (T1b and T1c) disease receive adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy after surgery. To reduce morbidity shorter courses of chemotherapy have become&#xD;
      the standard. For HER2 positive breast cancer twelve weeks of weekly taxol and trastuzumab&#xD;
      has very good long term outcomes, with only 1% of patients having a distant recurrence at&#xD;
      seven year follow-up. Similarly for triple negative breast cancer four cycles of&#xD;
      chemotherapy, for example with the docetaxel-cyclophosphamide regimen, may be used. This&#xD;
      compares to the use of full adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2 positive breast cancer for example&#xD;
      4 cycles of anthracycline-cyclophosphamide chemotherapy followed twelve weeks of weekly taxol&#xD;
      with trastuzumab and pertuzumab, and full (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy for TNBC of 4 cycles of&#xD;
      anthracycline-cyclophosphamide chemotherapy followed twelve weeks of weekly taxol with&#xD;
      carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detection of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) in plasma, after treatment for primary breast&#xD;
      cancer, is associated with a very high risk of future relapse. As cancer cells proliferate&#xD;
      and die, a small amount of cancer cell DNA is released into blood circulation. Sequencing of&#xD;
      the primary cancer to identify the mutations present in the cancer, allows very sensitive&#xD;
      detection of these mutations in DNA extracted from plasma. Detection of cancer specific&#xD;
      mutations in the plasma DNA implies that there is cancer present in the body. For patients&#xD;
      who have already had potentially curative treatment for breast cancer, detection of cancer&#xD;
      specific mutations or ctDNA, identifies the presence of molecular residual disease, and that&#xD;
      this residual disease is proliferating. The identification of ctDNA in these patients is&#xD;
      associated with a very high risk of future relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As most patients with stage I breast cancer are cured by the surgery alone, it is not&#xD;
      possible on a population basis to discern adverse outcomes with reducing the intensity of&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy, by offering shorter courses of chemotherapy. Yet for those few&#xD;
      patients who will relapse without chemotherapy, those with molecular residual disease,&#xD;
      short-course chemotherapy increases their risk of relapse compared to full combination&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy. Yet in routine clinical practice there is no way of identifying who&#xD;
      has molecular residual disease. If we can identify who the patients with residual disease&#xD;
      with ctDNA analysis, those patients can escalate treatment to full chemotherapy and thereby&#xD;
      improve their outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Signatera assay identifies the presence of molecular residual disease with high accuracy&#xD;
      in many tumour types. Patients with ctDNA detected have a very high risk of future relapse.&#xD;
      The assay is available as a routine validated clinical test, of proven clinical validity. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to allow patients to access the Signatera assay as part of their&#xD;
      standard clinical care, and to identify which patients have a high risk of relapse after&#xD;
      treatment for stage I breast cancer by detecting the presence of ctDNA after surgery, who&#xD;
      would have a higher risk of relapse if treated with short-course chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled into the study prior to surgery, in preference, to shorten the time&#xD;
      from surgery to the ctDNA testing result being available. Patients will also have a ctDNA&#xD;
      test taken prior to surgery, to explore whether this result may also have prognostic&#xD;
      significance. The pre-surgery result will not be made available to patients or their treating&#xD;
      clinicians in this study, as the full clinical importance of this result is not as clear as&#xD;
      detection after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol describes a study that will be conducted in the United Kingdom, and a parallel&#xD;
      protocol will recruit patients in the United States sponsored by Massachusetts General&#xD;
      Hospital. The two protocols share the same objectives and statistical design and endpoints,&#xD;
      although are tailored to the individual health care systems. The sample size describes the&#xD;
      combined recruitment of the protocols, and the databases of the two protocols will be&#xD;
      combined for assessment of all endpoints. The study will aim to recruit a minimum of 40% of&#xD;
      patients from each country (up to 200 patients from each country).&#xD;
