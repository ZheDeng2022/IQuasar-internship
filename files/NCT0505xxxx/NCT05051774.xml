  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease (CHD), the major group of cardiovascular disorders, is the leading&#xD;
      cause of cardiac-associated mortality, causing &gt;9 million death in 2016. American Heart&#xD;
      Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) recognized that&#xD;
      lifestyle modification including physical activity is the class one-level recommendation for&#xD;
      secondary prevention and risk reduction therapy for patients with CHD. The assessment of&#xD;
      physical activity and confidence in performing exercise for patients with CHD will help&#xD;
      healthcare professionals to develop and implement the appropriate intervention to enhance&#xD;
      patients' confidence in performing exercise and physical activity to promote and maintain&#xD;
      their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the increasing morbidity and mortality from CHD, especially in low and middle-income&#xD;
      countries, secondary prevention including exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) plays an&#xD;
      important role to improve the prognosis of CHD patients. High prevalence of physical&#xD;
      inactivity, unhealthy dietary practices, poor control of blood glucose, blood pressure (BP),&#xD;
      blood lipid, and body weight (BW) was found among CHD patients in the world as well as in Sri&#xD;
      Lanka. Therefore, it is important to design and implement an appropriate intervention to&#xD;
      improve the physical activity level, exercise self-efficacy, and cardiovascular risk factors&#xD;
      in CHD patients in Sri Lanka. This study aims to develop and examine a culturally specific&#xD;
      motivated, action-based intervention for improving physical activity level, exercise&#xD;
      self-efficacy, and cardiovascular risk factors of CHD patients in Sri Lanka.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be patients who admitted to the coronary care unit (CCU) and medical&#xD;
      wards of the Teaching Hospital Batticaloa, Sri Lanka with CHD for the first time confirmed by&#xD;
      electrocardiogram with aged 18 years or above, able to reads and speak Tamil, able to attend&#xD;
      clinic follow-up, obtain a medical clearance from a cardiologist to perform the exercise and,&#xD;
      able to understand and give informed consent. The medical records of the CHD patients will be&#xD;
      reviewed to screen for their eligibility. In addition, the cardiologist of the participants&#xD;
      will be consulted for their suitability to perform the exercise of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study, the data collection procedures, the potential risk and benefits,&#xD;
      the maintenance of confidentiality, and the voluntary basis of participation will be clearly&#xD;
      explained to the participants, and informed written consent will be obtained before data&#xD;
      collection. Ethical approval was obtained from The Joint Chinese University of Hong Kong -&#xD;
      New Territories East Cluster Clinical Research Ethics Committee and Ethics Review Committee,&#xD;
      Faculty of Health Care-sciences, Eastern University, Sri Lanka.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Statistical Package for Social Science version 22.0 software (SPSS 22.0) will be used to&#xD;
      analyze the data and the p-value less than 0.5 will be considered as significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide evidence on the effectiveness of a motivated, action-based&#xD;
      intervention on the physical activity level, cardiovascular risk factors, and exercise&#xD;
      self-efficacy of CHD patients in Sri Lanka. Findings from this study could be useful to&#xD;
      promote healthy lifestyle behaviors in CHD patients in a low-resource setting. Furthermore,&#xD;
      this study will provide information on which level this intervention could be applied and&#xD;
      possible constraints that hinder the outcomes of the results.&#xD;

    <description>It will be measured using validated Tamil version of Cardiac Exercise Self-Efficacy Instrument (CESEI-T).The CESEI-T is a 16-item instrument to assess the individual's confidence to perform physical exercise in cardiac patients. Each item is rated on a five-point Likert scale from 1 (very little confidence) to 5 (quite a lot of confidence). Participants will be asked to rate their confidence level in performing exercise in various situations such as &quot;fitting exercise into a busy day,&quot; &quot;exercising without getting chest pain,&quot; &quot;taking own heart rate before and after exercise,&quot; and &quot;enduring light exercise&quot;. The CESEI-T score range from 16-80 and a higher score indicates that a high level of self-efficacy in performing the exercise.</description>
