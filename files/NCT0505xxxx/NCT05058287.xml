      This study seeks to evaluate the impact of intra-operative topical epidural steroid usage in&#xD;
      patients undergoing 1-2 level lumbar laminectomy. The study will examine post-operative&#xD;
      opioid usage, length of stay, return to work, and patient reported outcomes following these&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;

      This is a randomized controlled trial seeking to evaluate the impact of intra-operative&#xD;
      topical epidural steroid usage in patients undergoing 1- to 2- level lumbar laminectomies.&#xD;
      Subjects enrolled in this study will be randomized to one of two treatments: either 40 mg&#xD;
      Depo-Medrol or 1 mL of sterile normal saline will be applied to the surgical wound prior to&#xD;
      closure. The study will examine post-operative opioid usage, length of stay, return to work,&#xD;
      and patient reported outcomes following these procedures. Subjects will be assessed&#xD;
      pre-operatively, while admitted for surgery, and postoperatively daily for two weeks, then&#xD;
      again at 1- and 3- months.&#xD;
