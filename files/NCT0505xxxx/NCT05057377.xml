  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) due to trauma and/or neurologic disease is a leading cause of&#xD;
      long-term disability in the United States. The loss of balance for people with a traumatic&#xD;
      brain injury can have a large effect on their walking abilities and this can come with a&#xD;
      number of challenges. There is a greater risk of falling after being discharged from the&#xD;
      hospital. In addition, people are more likely to become sedentary after TBI, which leads to&#xD;
      the loss of muscle strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To help provide the best care, clinicians need accurate measurements when people begin their&#xD;
      therapy, as well as throughout to ensure they are making appropriate progress. The tests&#xD;
      currently used by clinicians may not provide the most accurate measurements that show what a&#xD;
      person is capable of physically doing. The study you are being asked to participate in aims&#xD;
      to provide more accurate measurements by using a robotic treadmill device and by assessing&#xD;
      motivating factors that are important to you. The treadmill device will allow us to more&#xD;
      accurately test your walking ability in a safe, fall-free environment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury due to trauma and/or neurologic disease is a leading cause of&#xD;
      long-term disability in the United States. Balance impairments observed within the post-TBI&#xD;
      population can greatly impact walking abilities and pose a variety of challenges. Following&#xD;
      hospital discharge, there is a greater fall risk as well as a decrease in physical activity&#xD;
      and increase in sedentary behaviors that lead to deconditioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is difficult to determine the extent of what a person is capable of doing using current&#xD;
      overground assessment methods, which are the current standard means of physical capability&#xD;
      measurements (i.e. 6-minute walk test, 5 times sit-to-stand, 10-meter walk test). Improvement&#xD;
      of walking and balance outcomes in this population requires the re-evaluation of current&#xD;
      approaches and the testing/implementation of new approaches. This will allow more appropriate&#xD;
      assessment of baseline walking abilities in order to apply the appropriate amount of&#xD;
      challenge during rehabilitation training. This study will involve the use of a robotic&#xD;
      treadmill device in order to determine maximum walking capacities of participants and compare&#xD;
      these capacities to standard overground assessments. It has been shown that walking speeds&#xD;
      overground are correlated with walking speeds on a robotic device (and even specifically on&#xD;
      the KineAssist-MX, which will be used for this project). If it is found that maximum&#xD;
      capacities be greater on the robotic device, rehabilitation training goals can be more&#xD;
      appropriately tailored to these participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims and hypotheses of this research project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1) Assess function at preferred performance in an overground environment vs. a&#xD;
      safety-enhanced robotic environment to establish concurrent validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1) Participants with the highest overground performances (strength, speed, and&#xD;
      endurance) will have the highest performances on the KineAssist-MX and vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2) Assess maximum capacities of participants over ground vs. in the safety-enhanced&#xD;
      robotic environment to establish content validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2) Maximum capacity will be higher in the safety-enhanced robotic environment than&#xD;
      overground and vice versa. Therefore, people will be able to do more in the robotic&#xD;
      environment than overground.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3) Assess the capacities of individuals across different baseline functional strata to&#xD;
      establish usability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3) Individuals in the lower quadrants of baseline function will have lower maximum&#xD;
      capacities in the safety-enhanced robotic environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will occur over a two-day period of time during which participants will undergo&#xD;
      overground assessments during day 1 and robotic safety-environment assessments during day 2.&#xD;
      There will be no interventions implemented.&#xD;
