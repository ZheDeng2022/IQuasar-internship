  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is mainly associated with food intolerance and presents a&#xD;
      particular challenge in gastrointestinal practice. The clinical symptoms are often associated&#xD;
      by patients with the consumption of certain foods. This leads to strict elimination diets,&#xD;
      and often without identification of the triggering food. In particular, the avoidance of&#xD;
      wheat yields a relief of the clinical symptoms in many patients. Nevertheless, it is unclear&#xD;
      which components of wheat are responsible for the symptoms. Besides the glutens, other wheat&#xD;
      proteins, such as the amylase trypsin inhibitors, but also carbohydrates are discussed as&#xD;
      triggers of the diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is a new diagnostic method for detecting the local effect&#xD;
      of food on the mucosa. CLE enables microscopic assessment of the mucosa already during an&#xD;
      endoscopic examination and also allows statements to be made about intestinal permeability&#xD;
      through changes in the influx of fluorescein into the intestinal lumen. In the course of the&#xD;
      study, diluted food solutions are applied to the mucosa after a detailed assessment of the&#xD;
      mucosa via the endoscope. The changes in mucosa and permeability are observed and documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue samples are then taken for histopathological assessment of the degree of inflammation.&#xD;
      Further biopsies are taken and cultured in vitro to produce human organoids. The organoids&#xD;
      are stimulated with the food. Changes in proliferation, gene and cytokine expression are&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the proposed project is to investigate the influence of the main allergens, e.g.&#xD;
      wheat, soy, milk, yeast and chicken egg white on the intestinal mucosa. The data obtained&#xD;
      will be compared with the histopathological findings and the in vitro data in the human&#xD;
      organoid model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal is to establish a valid patient-based rapid detection method for the&#xD;
      detection of the triggering substances in patients with IBS or food intolerances.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with IBS of unclear etiology, i.e. non-IgE mediated food intolerances (FI), often&#xD;
      have a long course of suffering. It is not uncommon for patients to follow self-imposed&#xD;
      strict diets to alleviate food-dependent intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms. However,&#xD;
      these diets carry a high risk of malnutrition. In practice, an elimination diet followed by&#xD;
      provocation of individual foods attempts to identify the triggers of the intolerances.&#xD;
      However, since the reaction to the food antigens can occur with a delay and not infrequently&#xD;
      a combination of several intolerances is present, the correct diagnosis is often difficult.&#xD;
      This often leads to a massively reduced quality of life for the patients and repeated&#xD;
      examinations, such as gastrointestinal endoscopies, which lead to the patient being&#xD;
      hospitalised again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to medical approaches to alleviate the symptoms (drugs for diarrhoea, laxatives&#xD;
      for constipation), an improvement is often achieved through a change in diet. Recently, there&#xD;
      have been increasing reports that patients with IBS respond to a diet that is reduced in&#xD;
      FODMAPs (fermentable oligo-, di- and monosaccharides as well as polyols) with a significant&#xD;
      improvement in symptoms. Furthermore, patients with IBS often report significant symptom&#xD;
      relief with adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD), so that current estimates suggest that&#xD;
      almost half of patients with IBS benefit from a GFD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The introduction of CLE provides a new objective method for detecting changes at the cellular&#xD;
      level.The CLE allows a microscopic assessment of the mucosa already during the endoscopic&#xD;
      examination and thus enables an vivo histology, with an exact analysis of the intestinal&#xD;
      mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Others already showed that stimulation of intestinal mucosa with food antigens causes an&#xD;
      increased permeability and cell shedding in patients with FI (Fritscher-Ravens et al.&#xD;
      Gastroenterology 2014). The response to food antigens can be visualized after administration&#xD;
      of intravenous fluorescein and measurement of the release of fluroescein in the gut lumen. A&#xD;
      major advantage of CLE is the direct local assessment of food antigens on the intestinal&#xD;
      mucosa and the identification of patients who have a clinically relevant FI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: We suggest that patients with IBS and/or FI react more strongly to mucosal&#xD;
      applied food antigens than healthy controls due to an existing low-grade intestinal&#xD;
      inflammation. We plan to apply wheat, soy, milk, yeast and chicken egg white during CLE and&#xD;
      record cell shedding and fluorescein efflux in the gut lumen. Since many patients with IBS&#xD;
      are known to respond positively to a wheat-free diet, we expect the strongest mucosal&#xD;
      response especially after application of wheat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to prove our hypothesis by the increased cell shedding and the increased efflux of&#xD;
      fluorescein into the intestinal lumen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After CLE, tissue samples are taken for routine histopathological analysis. In addition,&#xD;
      mucosal biopsies are taken and used to isolate stem cells and generate in vitro organoids.&#xD;
      These organoids are cultured and supplemented with food antigens and changes in&#xD;
      proliferation, gene, cytokine and chemokine expression are determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal is&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the evaluation of CLE with histopathological data, this means the determination of&#xD;
           patients who have a good match of histopathologically confirmed inflammation with the&#xD;
           assessment of mucosal changes detrrmined in CLE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine the number of patients with IBS who have an response or change in&#xD;
           permeability after application of the food antigens (wheat, soy, milk, yeast, chicken&#xD;
           egg white) in CLE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the identification of molecular parameters after stimulation of in vitro organoids with&#xD;
           food antigens&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the correlation of data derived from in vitro organoids with in vivo assessment during&#xD;
           CLE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is planned for a period of 2 years. 40 patients aged 18 years and older with IBS&#xD;
      who have a clinical need for oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy, e.g. to diagnose IBS or to exclude&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease, gastritis, eosinophilic oesophagitis or coeliac disease, will be&#xD;
      included in the study. Furthermore, 20 healthy control subjects who come for preventive&#xD;
      medical checkup will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food antigens are applied during oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy, starting in the distal&#xD;
      duodenum and proceeding sequentially to the proximal duodenum. The application of food&#xD;
      antigens is randomised. The biopsies are taken after the application of the food antigens&#xD;
      from the duodenal mucosa and used for histopathological analysis or in vitro generation of&#xD;
      organoids.&#xD;
