  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD ) in the American population is&#xD;
      approximately 30% in adults and 10% in children, making it the most common. Cause of chronic&#xD;
      liver disease in the United States. Although the majority of patients with NAFLD have a&#xD;
      benign clinical course, the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH ), with&#xD;
      necro-inflammation and progressive fibrosis, increases the risk for development of cirrhosis&#xD;
      and its complications. Among patients with NASH, approximately 28% develop cirrhosis over an&#xD;
      8-year follow-up period. NASH and advanced fibrosis is associated with increased morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality among those patients with advanced histologic severity such as NASH and&#xD;
      fibrosis the gold standard for diagnosing and staging NAFLD is liver biopsy. Liver biopsy is&#xD;
      associated with costs and risks that make it impractical for generalized use in a condition&#xD;
      that affects such a high portion of the population. Furthermore, liver biopsy is also limited&#xD;
      by significant sampling error in NAFLD. Thus, there is a pressing need for accurate&#xD;
      non-invasive predictors of NAFLD that would also allow differentiation of those subjects at&#xD;
      higher risk of disease progression. At present, in the clinical setting, some demographic&#xD;
      factors, blood tests, and imaging studies can be used to predict a higher risk of disease in&#xD;
      patients being evaluated for NAFLD. These predictors, however, are of limited sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity compared with liver biopsy. The development and validation of accurate predictors&#xD;
      and scoring systems to identify patients at higher risk for NASH and fibrosis would allow&#xD;
      identification of subjects who would benefit the most from liver biopsy and potentially help&#xD;
      monitor disease&#xD;
