    <textblock>
      The older residents in the long-term care facilities frequently experience loneliness,&#xD;
      anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Improving residents' psychological health problems is one&#xD;
      of the important tasks for nursing staff. Individual experiences a sense of security and&#xD;
      feels of being cared for after tactile massage (TM).The randomized controlled trial research&#xD;
      design and convenience sampling will be employed. Through skin-to-skin contact, the oxytocin&#xD;
      can be induced to make individual feel relaxed, reduce anxiety, and feel pleasure. The&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial research design and convenience sampling will be employed. The&#xD;
      eligible residents will be randomly assigned to intervention group 1 (TM1), intervention&#xD;
      group 2 (TM2), and comparison group (usual care). . The intervention group 1 will receive one&#xD;
      15-min tactile massages per week for 6 weeks. The intervention group 2 will receive five&#xD;
      15-min tactile massages per week for 6 weeks. The comparison group will receive regular care&#xD;

      The older residents in the long-term care facilities frequently experience loneliness,&#xD;
      anxiety, and depressive symptoms. The negative emotions might affect residents' quality of&#xD;
      life and even increase their mortality. Improving residents' psychological health problems is&#xD;
      one of the important tasks for nursing staff. Individual experiences a sense of security and&#xD;
      feels of being cared for after tactile massage (TM). Through skin-to-skin contact, the&#xD;
      oxytocin can be induced to make individual feel relaxed, reduce anxiety, and feel pleasure.&#xD;
      Moreover, TM does not need any tools and can be conducted at any time and any place. It is&#xD;
      very convenient and accessible. Therefore, the purpose of this study is going to examine the&#xD;
      effects of tactile massage in improving older residents' mental health and physiological&#xD;
      effect in LTCFs. The randomized controlled trial research design and convenience sampling&#xD;
      will be employed. LTCFs will be selected and contacted by researchers. The eligible residents&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to intervention group 1 (TM1), intervention group 2 (TM2), and&#xD;
      comparison group (usual care). The intervention group 1 will receive one 15-min tactile&#xD;
      massages per week for 6 weeks. The intervention group 2 will receive five 15-min tactile&#xD;
      massages per week for 6 weeks. The comparison group will receive regular care and activities.&#xD;
      Data will be collected at baseline, after intervention, and three months and six months after&#xD;
      intervention using questionnaires including demographic and related information&#xD;
      questionnaire, University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) loneliness Scale version 3,&#xD;
      Geriatric Anxiety Inventory, Geriatric Depression Scale short form (GDS-SF).Chinese Happiness&#xD;
      Inventory, comfort Visual Analogue Scale, Relaxed Visual Analogue Scale. heart rate&#xD;
      variability and Data analysis will be conducted by performing percentage, mean, one-way&#xD;
      ANOVA, chi-square, and generalized estimating equations (GEE) using SPSS 22.0 software.&#xD;
      Intention-to-treat analysis will be applied in this study.&#xD;
