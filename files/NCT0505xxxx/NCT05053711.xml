  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and repetitive peripheral magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (rPMS) are innovative treatments for patients with stroke. Therefore, augmented&#xD;
      efficacy of rPMS on the rTMS is employed in this project. This proposal aims at exploring&#xD;
      different novel treatment strategies in the treatment of UE dysfunction in patients with&#xD;
      stroke: augmented efficacy of rPMS on the rTMS. Several aims in this study include (1)&#xD;
      identifying the most optimal treatment protocols for rPMS (TBS treatment and nerve&#xD;
      stimulation location), (2 ) establish a novel treatment protocol (augmented efficacy of rPMS&#xD;
      on the rTMS), (3) identifying augmented efficacy of rPMS on the rTMS, (4) determining the&#xD;
      mechanism of neuro-motor control, and (5) related biomarkers for the novel treatment&#xD;
      protocol. The investigators applied a 3-year plan before, however, the Ministry of Science&#xD;
      and Technology plan passed one year only (108-2314-B-182-043-). The investigators carried out&#xD;
      the pilot study to investigate the augmented effects of rPMS (radial nerve) on the rTMS in&#xD;
      the treatment of upper limb function in patients with stroke patients. The previous plan had&#xD;
      preliminary results. This year the investigators will apply for a three-year plan to continue&#xD;
      the previous pilot study for getting the comprehensive results.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to further explore whether rPMS intervention in different nerves can&#xD;
      augment rTMS efficacy on upper limb function in patients with stroke. A total of 72-96&#xD;
      patients with stroke will be recruited in 2 phases and 36-48 participants will be divided&#xD;
      into four groups according to their severity and the onset of stroke, and then randomly&#xD;
      enrolled into 3 groups in each phase (12-16 participants in each group) based on different&#xD;
      rPMS- stimulated methods and location. All patients will receive the rPMS in addition rTMS on&#xD;
      the brain cortex. In phase 1, each patient will receive either one of three rPMS methods on&#xD;
      median nerve (iTBS, cTBS, sham). During phase 2, each patient will receive either one of&#xD;
      three rPMS methods on ulnar nerve. Outcome measures include clinical assessments based on&#xD;
      International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and motor control&#xD;
      (Motor Evoked Potential, MEP, kinetics, and kinematics) that administered at pretest,&#xD;
      posttest, and 3-month follow-up. This study aims to establish a novel assessment and&#xD;
      treatment protocols in patients with stroke. The intervention will be conducted 10 times for&#xD;
      each participant. The optimal effective treatment protocol of augmented efficacy of rPMS on&#xD;
      the rTMS will also be established. The results of this study will be applied to the&#xD;
      translational and evidence-based medicine of the neuro-rehabilitation field of stroke&#xD;
      research.&#xD;

    <description>All participants will be instructed to perform a series of upper-extremity tasks. The tasks include reaching and grasping. An 7-camera motion analysis system (Vicon system, 3-D Oxfort Metrics Ltd, Oxford, UK) is used in conjunction with a personal computer to capture the movement of markers placed on the participant's body; analog signals were collected simultaneously. Movements were recorded at 120 Hz and digitally low-pass filtered at 5 Hz using a second-order Butterworth filter. Reference markers are placed on the distal interphalangeal joints of the thumb and index finger, the styloid process of the ulna, proximal end of the second metacarpal, and the object.</description>
