    <description>Administration by intravenous infusion. SI-B001 was administered intravenously once a week (QW). The first intravenous infusion is 120 min±10min. If the infusion reaction is tolerable during the first administration, the subsequent administration can be completed in 60-120 min. Paclitaxel dose was 80mg/m2 QW. SI-B001 and paclitaxel were used on the same day. After the infusion of SI-B001, paclitaxel pretreatment and paclitaxel infusion were performed for no less than 3 hours. The 4-week cycle of the study was maintained until disease progression or cessation due to intolerable toxicity or other reasons</description>
