  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of breast cancer and the treatments implemented have a significant impact on&#xD;
      the professional situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintaining employment and/or reintegration into working life are therefore major issues for&#xD;
      cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial proposes to study the feasibility of a support/coaching program for a return to&#xD;
      work in patients after breast cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study involves patients with breast cancer at the end of their adjuvant treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a support program for an adapted&#xD;
      return to work of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This back-to-work support program including an individual interview to identify patient needs&#xD;
      and expectations, 7 coaching workshops (every 3 weeks +/- 15 days) and a final individual&#xD;
      assessment post workshops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evolution of quality of life, psychological distress and perceptions concerning work will&#xD;
      also be evaluated through assessments and questionnaires before (inclusion) and after the&#xD;
      support program [1 month (+/- 7 days) and 6 months (+/- 1 month) after the final individual&#xD;
      assessment].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study also aims to estimate the recruitment rate in the study and to assess the&#xD;
      satisfaction of this support program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the impact of this support program on the return to work will be described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This initial study will eventually lead to a larger research protocol on the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the program, using a randomized controlled trial design.&#xD;

    <description>Description of the evolution of the psychological distress of patients. Measured by HADS scale (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). The HADS is a 14 items questionnaire: 7 items related to anxiety and 7 items related to depression scored on a scale. Scores for items in each subscale of the HADS are summed to produce an anxiety score (HADS-A) or a depression score (HADS-D), or can be added to produce a total score corresponding to emotional distress (HADS-T). Each item is rated on a 4-point Likert scale (1 = &quot;not at all&quot;, 2 = &quot;a little&quot;, 3 = &quot;quite a bit&quot;, and 4 = &quot;very much&quot;), for a total score ranging from 0-21 for each subscale. The entire scale (emotional distress) range from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating more distress.</description>
