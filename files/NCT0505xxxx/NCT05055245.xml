  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the development of assisted reproductive technology (ART), more and more infertile women&#xD;
      are obtaining their offspring through assisted reproductive technology. However, a growing&#xD;
      number of national and international studies have shown that infertility patients are prone&#xD;
      to negative emotions such as anxiety and depression during ART treatment, which not only&#xD;
      affects their physical and mental health, but also affects the embryo implantation rate and&#xD;
      pregnancy rate of ART. The purpose of this study is to investigate the stress faced by&#xD;
      participants undergoing ART with different cycles and to further investigate its impact on&#xD;
      pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the rapid social and economic development in recent years, the incidence of infertility&#xD;
      has increased significantly due to environmental pollution, poor lifestyle habits and&#xD;
      increasing stress in various areas. According to global statistics, one in six married&#xD;
      couples suffers from infertility. With the development of assisted reproductive technology&#xD;
      (ART), more and more infertile women are obtaining their offspring. In clinical practice,&#xD;
      however, a significant proportion of patients undergoing ART have low embryo implantation and&#xD;
      pregnancy rates and experience recurrent implantation failure (RIF). A growing number of&#xD;
      national and international studies have shown that infertility patients are prone to negative&#xD;
      emotions such as anxiety and depression during ART treatment, which not only affects their&#xD;
      physical and mental health, but also affects the embryo implantation rate and pregnancy rate&#xD;
      of ART. This effect is more pronounced in patients with multiple failed transfers. In this&#xD;
      study, investigators intend to investigate the stress faced by participants undergoing&#xD;
      assisted reproduction with different cycles to provide a reliable basis for future&#xD;
      psychological interventions and health education for this group of patients and improve the&#xD;
      quality of life of infertility patients.&#xD;
