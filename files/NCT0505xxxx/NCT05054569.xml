      The purpose of this study is to develop and pre-test an eHealth group intervention for young&#xD;
      adult cancer survivors.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the first part of this study, the investigators adapted an evidence-based intervention for&#xD;
      improving HRQOL to better meet the needs of young adult cancer survivors, and then conducted&#xD;
      focus groups with young adult cancer survivors to get feedback on the adapted intervention.&#xD;
      In the second part of the study, the investigators will conduct a single-arm pilot trial in&#xD;
      which the adapted intervention will be delivered over videoconference via weekly group&#xD;
      meetings with a trained facilitator over the course of 10 weeks.&#xD;
