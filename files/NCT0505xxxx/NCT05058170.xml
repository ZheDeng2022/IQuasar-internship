  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the reduction in acute rejection episodes in renal transplant patients due to modern&#xD;
      immunosuppression, proportionate improvements in long-term allograft survival have not been&#xD;
      achieved. Virtually any disease or injury affecting renal allografts can culminate in&#xD;
      irreversible injury of tubular epithelial cells and the development of interstitial fibrosis&#xD;
      and tubular atrophy (IFTA). Renal allograft fibrosis drives chronic kidney disease (CKD)&#xD;
      progression, predicts allograft failure and is associated with increased patient mortality.&#xD;
      Other prognostic and/or actionable diagnoses described by the pathologic Banff scheme, such&#xD;
      as inflammation, often co-exist and contribute to IFTA. Immune cell infiltration within&#xD;
      allografts and within areas of IFTA (i-IFTA) can drive progressive kidney injury, fibrosis&#xD;
      and worsened outcome. Pathology is the reference standard for IFTA; however, allograft biopsy&#xD;
      has many well-known limitations and is not an ideal method for monitoring patients during&#xD;
      trials of new therapies aimed at improving allograft survival. There is an urgent and unmet&#xD;
      need for non-invasive assessment of renal allograft IFTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), including relaxometry [the spin-lock relaxation time T1ρ, a&#xD;
      marker of interaction of water with macromolecules in tissues; the spin-lattice relaxation&#xD;
      time T1, a marker of interstitial edema and collagen volume fraction)] and advanced diffusion&#xD;
      [intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI), a marker of diffusion&#xD;
      and perfusion] provides insight into renal structure and function. Validation of advanced MRI&#xD;
      methods as markers of renal allograft IFTA would be of major clinical significance to enable&#xD;
      early detection, assess the efficacy of novel anti-fibrotic agents, and provide longitudinal&#xD;
      disease monitoring. The study team has established proof-of-concept in renal allografts with&#xD;
      stable function and IFTA without confounding rejection or infection that mpMRI techniques are&#xD;
      feasible for measuring fibrosis, especially using the combination of T1 and DWI. The study&#xD;
      has established that urinary biomarkers for renal allograft fibrosis are also promising and&#xD;
      have been validated against pathology in initial studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposal, the researchers will develop a short, non-contrast multiparametric MRI&#xD;
      (mpMRI) protocol, consisting of advanced relaxometry (T1 mapping and T1ρ) and advanced&#xD;
      diffusion weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI) to accurately detect and stage allograft fibrosis,&#xD;
      taking into account confounding Banff variables of inflammation and tested against biopsy.&#xD;
      The researchers will also assess the added value of urinary biomarkers of IFTA and if&#xD;
      successful, this study will benefit a large population of patients with renal allograft&#xD;
      fibrosis in the United States, enabling early diagnosis, optimized treatment planning,&#xD;
      prognostication and longitudinal disease monitoring.&#xD;
