  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life SF-36 questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from the baseline to 4th Week</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36) questionnaire consists of eight scales yielding two summary measures: physical and mental health. The physical health measure includes four scales of physical functioning (10 items), role-physical (4 items), bodily pain (2 items), and general health (5 items). The mental health measure is composed of vitality (4 items), social functioning (2 items), role-emotional (3 items), and mental health (5 items). A final item, termed self-reported health transition, is answered by the client but is not included in the scoring process.&#xD;
The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

    <measure>Oxygen Saturation (SpO2)</measure>
    <time_frame>4th Week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline SPO2 was measured in percentage. Oxygen immersion is the division of oxygen-soaked hemoglobin with respect to add up to hemoglobin in the blood. Pulse oximeter measure it.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pulse Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>4th Week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline, Pulse rate was measured per minute through pulse oximeter</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion</measure>
    <time_frame>4th week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from the Baseline, It is a subjective numeric scale ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 indicates &quot;no dyspnea&quot; and 10 indicates &quot;unbearable dyspnea.&quot; A number is chosen by the patient in order to decide the best score that matches his level of dyspnea during physical activity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Systolic and diastolic blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>4th week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from the Baseline, Blood pressure is measured through sphygmomanometer</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>VO2 max</measure>
    <time_frame>4th week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from the Baseline, Maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max), refers to the maximum amount of oxygen that an individual can utilize during intense or maximal exercise.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>METS</measure>
    <time_frame>4th Week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from the Baseline, Metabolic equivalents (METS) Associated with Common Types of Endurance Exercise.&#xD;
METs may be calculated during Standard Bruce Protocol by dividing oxygen uptake per minute with the product of 3.5 × bodyweight (kilograms)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quick Physical Activity Rating (QPAR) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>4th Week</time_frame>
    <description>10 items covering passive activities, walking, hobby and recreational activities, exercise, and housework with exemplars provided. Hobby activities, exercise and housework were further divided into light, moderate, and strenuous activities. Respondents were asked to consider these physical activities over the prior 4-week period. Each activity was weighted in intensity ranging from 1 (light) to 3 (heavy) intensity. Frequency of activity per week was collected as never (0 days), seldom (1-2 days), sometimes (3-4 days), and often (5-7 days). Duration of activity was collected as less than one hour per day, 1-2 hours per day, and more than two hours per day. Multiplication of the intensity (1-3), frequency (0-3) and duration (1-3) scores permitted calculation of a dose of physical activity ranging from 0-153. The QPAR took 3-5 minutes to complete.
