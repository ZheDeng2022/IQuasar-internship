      A multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      fluticasone propionate (metered dose inhaler - MDI) added to standard care at early stage of&#xD;
      COVID-19 in reducing the incidence of adverse outcomes (any of those following: oxygen&#xD;
      therapy, systemic corticosteroids, hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and mortality) in&#xD;
      symptomatic patients either from 18 to 49 years of age with risk factors or older than 50&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

      This study has 2 arms: the standard care group followed the COVID-19 guidelines of the&#xD;
      Ministry of Health of Vietnam and the interventional group: Fluticasone propionate MDI with&#xD;
      spacer, twice a day for 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants will be monitored via video call from day 1 to day 14, day 21, and day&#xD;
      28 after randomized.&#xD;
