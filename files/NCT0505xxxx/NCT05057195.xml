      Intraoperatively, in the bed of the removed tumor, a surgical mesh is sutured onto which the&#xD;
      intrastats are fixed. On days 2-3, topometric preparation is carried out, the choice of the&#xD;
      amount of irradiation, the calculation of the program. On the 4-5th day after the operation,&#xD;
      a course of intra-tissue radiation therapy begins in a single dose of 3 to 5 Gy in 10&#xD;
      fractions 2 times a day with an interval between fractions of 6 hours, the planned total dose&#xD;
      is from 30 to 50 Gy. (from 40 to 70 IGy). Follow-up examination after 4 weeks and then every&#xD;
      3 months for 24 months&#xD;

      1 day before the operation, taking blood tests: general blood test with counting the&#xD;
      leukocyte formula and the number of platelets; biochemical blood test with the determination&#xD;
      of indicators of liver and kidney function (including electrolytes); coagulogram; performing&#xD;
      surgical treatment with urgent histological examination of the edge of the tumor;&#xD;
      intraoperatively, in the bed of the removed tumor, a surgical mesh is sutured onto which the&#xD;
      intrastats are fixed with the fixation of the outlet ends on the skin with the help of&#xD;
      buttons. 1 day after the operation, taking blood tests: a general blood test with the&#xD;
      calculation of the leukocyte formula and the number of platelets; biochemical blood test with&#xD;
      the determination of indicators of liver and kidney function (including electrolytes);&#xD;
      coagulogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the 2-3rd day after the surgical treatment, topometric preparation, the choice of the&#xD;
      amount of radiation, and the calculation of the program are carried out. On the 4-5th day&#xD;
      after the operation, a course of interstitial radiation therapy begins in a single dose of 3&#xD;
      to 5 Gy in 10 fractions 2 times a day with an interval between fractions of 6 hours, the&#xD;
      planned total dose is from 30 to 50 Gy, which is equivalent to 40 to 70 IGy (isogrey). On the&#xD;
      6th day, removal of intrastats, on the 7th day after the operation, ultrasound of the wound&#xD;
      and n / c vessels; assessment of the nature of wound healing. On the 10th day, discharge from&#xD;
      the hospital.&#xD;
