    <measure>Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) assessment - Tricuspid valve regurgitation peak velocity</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>This is measured in apical 4 chamber view, with continuous wave Doppler using modified Bernoulli equation. Systolic pulmonary artery pressure is equivalent to right ventricular systolic pressure in absence of outflow obstruction.&#xD;
Systolic Pulmonary Artery Pressure (SPAP) = Right Ventricular Systolic Pressure = 4x TR2 + Right Atrial Pressure (RAP) (RAP= 3-5 mmHg)</description>
