      Introduction: The aim of this study was to compare the effects of intracanal medicaments on&#xD;
      the incidence of postoperative pain and flare-up in asymptomatic retreatment cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: One hundred twenty patients with asymptomatic teeth with single-root, single-canal&#xD;
      without spontaneous pain or swelling were included in the present study. All patients were&#xD;
      previously undergone endodontic treatment but still had periapical radiolucencies. Patients&#xD;
      were randomly and equally divided into three groups in which stratified randomization was&#xD;
      performed based on the gender and the age of the patients. Intracanal medicaments were placed&#xD;
      into the root canals following the removal of previous root canal fillings and&#xD;
      re-instrumentation. Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2), chlorhexidine gel (CHX), calcium hydroxide,&#xD;
      and chlorhexidine gel combinations were used as intracanal medicaments in the present study.&#xD;
      Postoperative pain scores were recorded at 6 and 12 hours and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 days&#xD;
      using a visual analog scale (VAS). Sensitivity on percussion, spontaneous pain, swelling, and&#xD;
      antibiotic and analgesic requirements of the patients were evaluated during clinical&#xD;
      examinations performed postoperatively after 2 and 7 days.&#xD;
