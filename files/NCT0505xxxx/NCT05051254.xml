  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory muscle testing allows a quantitative assessment of inspiratory and expiratory&#xD;
      muscles in children of any age with primary or secondary respiratory muscle impairment, in&#xD;
      order to better understand the pathophysiology of respiratory impairment and guide&#xD;
      therapeutic management. The use of an invasive technique (esogastric probe) makes it possible&#xD;
      to specifically explore the diaphragm, the accessory inspiratory muscles and the expiratory&#xD;
      muscles in order to detect dysfunction or paralysis of these muscles, and to estimate the&#xD;
      work of breathing in order to better guide the respiratory management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the respiratory effort in children with&#xD;
      primary or secondary impairment of the respiratory muscles during spontaneous breathing or&#xD;
      during mechanical ventilation.&#xD;

      Respiratory muscle testing allows a quantitative assessment of inspiratory and expiratory&#xD;
      muscles in children of any age with primary or secondary respiratory muscle impairment, in&#xD;
      order to better understand the pathophysiology of respiratory impairment and guide&#xD;

      muscles in order to detect dysfunction or paralysis of these muscles, and to estimate the&#xD;
      work of breathing in order to better guide the respiratory management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory muscle testing by means of esogastric measurements may allow assessing the effect&#xD;
      of pharmacological treatment by comparing respiratory muscle strength before and after a few&#xD;
      months with treatment. Moreover, esogastric measurements can be used to better adapt&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation or to determine the possibility of weaning from the respiratory&#xD;
      support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the respiratory effort in children with&#xD;
      primary or secondary impairment of the respiratory muscles during spontaneous breathing or&#xD;
      during mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
