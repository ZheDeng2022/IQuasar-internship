  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a complication of prematurity. Postnatal corticosteroid is used&#xD;
      to treat the inflammatory part of this pathology, in particular to wean premature infants&#xD;
      from the ventilator at the end of the first month of life. However, this therapy remains&#xD;
      controversial because it may induce suboptimal neurocognitive development. Parents of infants&#xD;
      who receive postnatal corticosteroid should be provided with information about the risks. The&#xD;
      objective of our work was to evaluate the respiratory, neurodevelopmental and growth outcomes&#xD;
      at 24 months corrected age of extremely preterm infants who received postnatal&#xD;
      corticosteroid.&#xD;
