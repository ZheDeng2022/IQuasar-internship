  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to minimal volitional activation of the impaired arm, these individuals are less able to&#xD;
      engage in activities of daily living (ADL's). Moreover, simultaneous use of the hand and arm&#xD;
      are needed throughout ADL's. The effects of these two approaches (circuit class training and&#xD;
      individual task-specific training) on upper extremity function and activities of daily living&#xD;
      (ADL's) have not yet been clearly identified, and studies on its effects on chronic stroke&#xD;
      patients are limited.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      several research found that circuit training improved various functional parameters after&#xD;
      stroke. And most of the circuit based tasks from the published studies were focused on the&#xD;
      leg strength, walking speed, distance and balance etc. Previous literature found that circuit&#xD;
      class training is effective in improving upper extremity function in chronic stroke patients&#xD;
      disregarding the type of stroke and the results of that study are not generalized for chronic&#xD;
      stroke patients with upper extremity deficit. Secondly, circuit class training and&#xD;
      task-specific training are effective for improving upper limb function following a stroke but&#xD;
      in the acute stage. In fact, there is no evidence in which comparison of these two approaches&#xD;
      has been done in chronic stroke patients and thirdly, between these two approaches which&#xD;
      approach is more effective towards improving upper limb function in chronic stage.&#xD;

    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Assessment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment is the gold standard to assess motor function of post-stroke hemiparesis. The Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity (FMUE) Scale is a widely used and highly recommended stroke-speciﬁc, performance-based measure of impairment. It is designed to assess reﬂex activity, movement control and muscle strength in the upper extremity of people with post-stroke hemiplegia.</description>

    <measure>Modified Ashworth Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Ashworth scale is the most universally accepted clinical tool used to measure the increase of muscle tone. The modified Ashworth scale is a muscle tone assessment scale used to assess the resistance experienced during passive range of motion, which does not require any instrumentation and is quick to perform</description>

    <measure>Stroke Specific-Quality of Life Urdu Version (SS-QOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SS-QOL scale is a health-related outcome measure that comprises 49 items in 12 areas of vision, mobility, thinking, social roles, self-care, language, personality, family roles, work/productivity, upper limb function, mood and energy. It covers a more extensive inclusion of capacities ordinarily influenced by stroke.</description>
