    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if one year of romosozumab (Evenity®), a monthly&#xD;
      injection given in the arm under the skin, prior to an infusion of zoledronic acid Reclast®,&#xD;
      works to treat bone loss and prevent it from worsening in older women (ages 65 and older) who&#xD;
      have osteoporosis and reside in long-term care (LTC) facilities.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of this study is to improve health, well-being and quality of life in the&#xD;
      frail Long-term Care (LTC) population by reducing fractures. The short-term goal is to&#xD;
      demonstrate efficacy of the novel dual action Romosozumab (ROMO) to improve Bone Mineral&#xD;
      Density (BMD) and skeletal integrity and its safety, a necessary (but not sufficient)&#xD;
      precondition of a large fracture reduction trial. The investigators propose to conduct a&#xD;
      2-year, randomized, double-blind, calcium vitamin D controlled trial to test the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of the sclerostin inhibitor ROMO among a cohort of 200 underserved, institutionalized,&#xD;
      frail women ≥65 years old. Bone measures will be collected in a mobile lab. The monthly&#xD;
      subcutaneous therapy negates concerns regarding poor oral absorption or compliance. The use&#xD;
      of annual Zoledronic Acid (ZOL) to follow ROMO, will prevent bone loss and insure the entire&#xD;
      group will be provided with at least 1 year of therapy. The groups include: 1) ROMO →ZOL vs&#xD;
      2) placebo →ZOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Evaluate efficacy of bone building ROMO treatment prior to ZOL in improving bone&#xD;
      mineral density. H1: Women on ROMO →ZOL will have greater hip and spine BMD increases after 2&#xD;
      years (H1.1-primary) and 1 year (H1.2), and at other locations (H1.3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Examine improvements in 3D trabecular microstructure (TBS), markers of bone turnover&#xD;
      and collect preliminary evidence for a fracture reduction trial. The investigators will&#xD;
      measure vertebral trabecular bone score (TBS), a 3-D microarchitectural image and parameters&#xD;
      of the spine, hip, and lateral spine H2: Women on ROMO →ZOL will have greater increases in&#xD;
      TBS measures of spine, hip and lateral spine after one (H2.1) and two (H2.2) years; and&#xD;
      improvement in bone turnover markers (CTx and P1NP; H2.3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Determine characteristics associated with responders and non responders. The&#xD;
      investigators will use multiple regression analyses and other data mining techniques to&#xD;
      identify baseline characteristics of responders and non-responders. H3.1: Poor baseline&#xD;
      functional/cognitive status/immobility will be associated with poor bone healthy outcomes.&#xD;
      H3.2: Greater early changes in bone turnover markers will be associated with greater skeletal&#xD;
      improvements.&#xD;
