  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to advance the knowledge of a novel strategy of exercise to help people&#xD;
      achieve the health benefits of exercise in less commitment time. As opposed to the&#xD;
      traditionally recommended long periods (60 min) of moderate intensity exercise, this study&#xD;
      will examine the effects of two exercise programs which consist of different intensities and&#xD;
      repeated bouts of short intense exercise followed by rest periods. By incorporating short&#xD;
      intense bouts of exercise, it may be possible that individuals enjoy this strategy of&#xD;
      exercising more, which may influence them to continue to train in this way, increase their&#xD;
      exercise levels in daily life and achieve exercise-related health benefits. Overall healthy&#xD;
      women will be divided into a novel sprint interval training group or a high intensity&#xD;
      interval training group or a traditional moderate intensity continuous training group. To&#xD;
      evaluate the success of each training approach, a health-related quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaire, one mile run test, weight, strength test and adherence to study requirements&#xD;
      will be assessed over a 6-week period. The investigators hypothesize that the sprint interval&#xD;
      training group will experience greatest strength measurements, will lose most body fat, have&#xD;
      the greatest exercise benefits and will enjoy the novel training program more and will&#xD;
      therefore adhere to the program more than the moderate continuous training group.&#xD;

      Since the majority of the population is inactive, this study is being done to develop a&#xD;
      better strategy that might encourage people to exercise more and improve their health. The&#xD;
      current physical activity guidelines suggest that adults aged 18-64 should perform at least&#xD;
      150 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity per week . However,&#xD;
      84% of the Canadian population is insufficiently active. The large percentage of inactive&#xD;
      individuals may be due to the daunting expectation that individuals must exercise for long&#xD;
      periods of time to achieve health benefits, and many individuals report not having enough&#xD;
      time. However, studies have shown that exercising for short, repeated bouts of intense&#xD;
      exercise resulted in improved cardiometabolic health to the same extent as traditional&#xD;
      endurance training, despite lower exercise volume. One study found that the prescription for&#xD;
      a higher frequency of exercise significantly increased the accumulation of exercise without a&#xD;
      negative effect on adherence. Further, in another study, participants who performed short&#xD;
      intense bouts of physical activity have shown greater adherence than participants who were&#xD;
      performing traditional exercise, working at a moderate intensity for a prolonged exercise&#xD;
      period (89% and 71%, respectively). None of the studies mentioned above examined time matched&#xD;
      exercise groups and included varying intensities of exercise, and collected data through&#xD;
      virtual means, mimicking the natural environment of participants. The investigators believe&#xD;
      that the proposed study will address these concerns and therefore advance the knowledge of&#xD;
      sprint interval training.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in the HIIT group will start with a 2.5-minute warm-up at about 30% VO2 max. The participants will then complete 3 running bouts at 80-90% VO2 max. Each running bout will be separated by 2 minutes of active rest where the participants will walk at 50% VO2 max. The total exercise time of this protocol will be 15 minutes. Finally, the participants will finish with a 2.5 min cool-down where they will walk at a light intensity of 30% VO2 max, for a total exercise duration of 20 minutes.</description>

    <description>Participants in the Sprint Interval Training group will perform a 2.5-minute warm up at a VO2 max of 30%. Next, the participants will perform 6 all-out sprints at 150-200% of VO2 max, separated by 2-minute active rests at 50% VO2 max. The total exercise time of the SIT protocol is about 14 minutes. Finally, the participants will perform a walking cool-down of 3.5 minutes at 30% VO2 max, for a total exercise duration of 20 minutes.</description>

After the warm up, participants will be running for 15 minutes at 45-60% of VO2 max.

    <description>Our current study will compare three exercise groups which will all vary in intensity. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups. Two groups will be assigned to high intensity bouts of exercise with an active rest between, and one group will perform moderate intensity continuous training without resting. All groups will exercise for 20 minutes. Exercise adherence and it will be measured by a self-report online Google Document.</description>
