      The &quot;Promoting Healthy Brain Project&quot; (PHBP) is part of the Lurie Children's Hospital&#xD;
      Strategic Research Initiative on Perinatal Origins of Childhood Disease: Research &amp;&#xD;
      Prevention at the Maternal-Fetal Interface. The overall purpose of the PHBP is to test&#xD;
      whether reducing maternal stress during pregnancy is associated with improved&#xD;
      neurodevelopment in the first year of life. This will be tested via a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (n = 100) of a technology and mindfulness enhanced prenatal stress-reduction&#xD;
      intervention (Mothers and Babies; MB).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The &quot;Promoting Healthy Brain Project&quot; (PHBP) aims to improve infant neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      trajectories by intervening on the fetal environment. The PHBP will experimentally test&#xD;
      whether reducing prenatal maternal stress is associated with improved neurodevelopment in the&#xD;
      first year of life. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a technology and&#xD;
      mindfulness-enhanced prenatal maternal stress-reduction intervention (The Mothers and Babies&#xD;
      Course; MB), compared to usual prenatal care. Prospective evaluation of infant&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcomes will take place through infant age 24 months. Participants&#xD;
      assigned to the intervention group will be offered the 12-session MB intervention, a&#xD;
      well-studied intervention that will include new mindfulness practice enhancements designed to&#xD;
      promote practice of awareness and attention to the present moment. MB visits will be&#xD;
      delivered 1-on-1 by a trained facilitator in an open and nonjudgmental way, and will be&#xD;
      offered in-person, over the phone, and/or by video chat. Throughout the intervention, all&#xD;
      participants (intervention group and control group) will also wear a wireless, &quot;smart&quot; health&#xD;
      sensing device (BioStamp Sensor - nPoint Device) that will measure heart rate and motion.&#xD;
      Mothers' heart rate variability and self-reported stress and emotion will be monitored using&#xD;
      the BioStamp Sensor and brief smartphone surveys. For mothers in the intervention group,&#xD;
      patterns of prolonged stress will trigger a &quot;just-in-time adapted intervention&quot; (JITAI) that&#xD;
      will be delivered to mothers' smartphones. The booster intervention will include activities&#xD;
      that will enhance skills learned in the MB course. All participants will complete self-report&#xD;
      measures of prenatal maternal stress, emotion, depression, and skills related to the&#xD;
      intervention (e.g., mindfulness). Infant neurodevelopmental health will be measured via brain&#xD;
      and behavioral indicators of self-regulation, including performance-based indicators of&#xD;
      executive function and corollary prefrontal cortex maturation and dimensional phenotypes of&#xD;
      disruptive behavior, particularly irritability.&#xD;

The Mothers and Babies course (MB) is a 12-session manualized stress-reduction intervention that will be delivered to participants, prenatally, with an integrated technology suite designed for timely detection and response to maternal stress. Sessions are delivered 1-on-1 with a trained facilitator and are based on principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and attachment theory. The MB course is divided into 3 sections: 1) Pleasant Activities; 2) Thoughts; 3) Contact with Others. Throughout each module, mindfulness skills training will be integrated as a strategy to help &quot;center&quot; participants. All participants will receive a Participant Manual for Families, containing worksheets that correspond to the 12 sessions.</description>

    <ipd_description>De-identified data will be shared with other investigators. Investigators from outside the study will be asked to sign an agreement of confidentiality in order to receive the data requested. Data will be stored for at least 7 years. We plan to archive the de-identified data in a data repository for future use by other researchers, after the study is completed. Additionally, data from this study will be used in the Mental Health Earlier Synthetic Cohort (MHESC) Study in order to generate a pragmatic clinical risk calculator to predict preschool psychopathology. MHESC pools three extramural cohorts at Northwestern University and Washington University in St. Louis, one of which is the Wellness for 2 Study to form a clinically enriched &quot;synthetic&quot; cohort. Therefore, data will be shared with authorized individuals at Washington University.</ipd_description>
