    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm phase II trial to determine the efficacy and safety of Tislelizumab in&#xD;
      addition to bronchial arterial chemoembolization in stage III-Ⅳ NSCLC patients who failed,&#xD;
      refused or ineligible to receive standard treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchial artery chemoembolization (BACE) is a technique of drug delivery and embolization&#xD;
      performed via injecting anti-tumor drugs with drug carriers and implanting the embolization&#xD;
      agents into the tumor feeding artery, promoting the clinical outcomes of patients and&#xD;
      providing a palliative treatment option for patients with NSCLC. while the short-term effect&#xD;
      of BACE is good, it is easy to relapse and metastasize.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rapid development of immunotherapy checkpoint inhibitors represented by PD-1/L1&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody has changed the treatment pattern of NSCLC. The publication of early&#xD;
      research data repeatedly verified the long-term survival benefit characteristics of PD-1/L1&#xD;
      in NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tislelizumab is an investigational humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody with high affinity and&#xD;
      binding specificity for PD-1. Tislelizumab was engineered to minimize binding to FcγR on&#xD;
      macrophages in order to limit antibody-dependent phagocytosis, a potential mechanism of&#xD;
      resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. Tislelizumab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy&#xD;
      as first-line treatment for advanced SCLC and NSCLC, including nsq-NSCLC, resulted in robust&#xD;
      responses in a phase 2 study (BGB-A317-206 [NCT03432598]), In phase 3 study, addition of&#xD;
      tislelizumab to chemotherapy resulted in significantly improved progression-free survival&#xD;
      (PFS) compared with chemotherapy alone in patients with stage IIIB or IV squamous NSCLC&#xD;
      (RATIONALE 307; BGB-A317-307 [NCT03594747]) and nsq-NSCLC (RATIONALE 304; BGB-A317-304&#xD;
      [NCT03663205]). Second-and third-line tislelizumab monotherapy prolonged OS in the ITT and&#xD;
      PD-L1 ≥ 25% populations vs docetaxel in patients with advanced NSCLC(RATIONALE 303;&#xD;
      BGB-A317-303 [NCT03358875]). China NMPA have approved for tislelizumab + chemotherapy for 1L&#xD;
      NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is designed to determine the efficacy and safety of Tislelizumab in addition to&#xD;
      Bronchial Arterial Chemoembolization in stage III-Ⅳ NSCLC patients who failed, refused or&#xD;
      ineligible to receive standard treatments.&#xD;
