      The aim of this work was to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the use of echocardiography in the assessment of hemodynamic stability in&#xD;
           newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the prevalence of congenital heart diseases or any cardiac abnormalities in&#xD;
           infants born to diabetic mother in relation to the glycemic control of their mothers&#xD;

    <description>Using M-mode images under guidance of two dimensional echocardiography in parasternal long axis view was done measuring of the following:&#xD;
Ejection fraction (EF) using Teichnolz techniqe.&#xD;
Fractional shortening (FS).&#xD;
Left ventricular end systolic diameter (LVDs).&#xD;
Left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVDd).&#xD;
Inter ventricular septal diameter (IVSd).&#xD;
Left ventricular posterior wall thickness during diastole (LVPWd).&#xD;
Left ventricular posterior wall thickness during systole (LVPWs)&#xD;
The two-dimensional measurements will be calculated according to recent guidelines. (reference 1)</description>
