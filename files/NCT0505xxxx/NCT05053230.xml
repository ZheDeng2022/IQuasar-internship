  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether the Integrative Medicine at Home (IM@Home)&#xD;
      program can help reduce patients' symptoms (such as tiredness, pain, or insomnia) and improve&#xD;
      their satisfaction with treatment for their disease. The IM@Home program offers virtual&#xD;
      (online rather than in-person) group classes focusing on mind-body practice. Mind-body&#xD;
      practice is a health practice that combines mental focus, controlled breathing, and body&#xD;
      movements to help relax the body and mind.&#xD;

    <description>Primary outcome will be measured by the average fatigue severity measured by the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI). The BFI is a 9-item instrument designed to assess one construct of fatigue severity in cancer and non-cancer populations. Three items ask patients to rate the severity of their fatigue at its &quot;worst,&quot; &quot;usual,&quot; and &quot;now&quot; during normal waking hours, with 0 being &quot;no fatigue&quot; and 10 being &quot;fatigue as bad as you can imagine.&quot; Six items assess the amount that fatigue has interfered with different aspects of the patient's life during the past 24 hours. The interference items are measured on a 0-10 scale, with 0 being &quot;does not interfere&quot; and 10 being &quot;completely interferes.&quot;59 A composite fatigue severity score can be found by averaging the 9 item scores.</description>

    <description>Participants will be enrolled into either IM@Home or enhanced usual care prior to or within 2 weeks at the start of their systemic therapies for the study duration of 12 weeks.&#xD;
IM@Home is an online mind-body program consisted of a series of virtual, synchronous classes that offer a variety of rigorously tested mind-body therapies led by an Integrative Medicine Service (IMS) clinical therapist. The virtual mind-body group therapy sessions will be conducted using Zoom video conferencing platform.</description>
