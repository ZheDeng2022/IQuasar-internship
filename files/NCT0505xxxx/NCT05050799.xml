      Single arm, observational, multi-center, consecutively enrolling, post-market surveillance&#xD;
      study. Treating patients in need of central venous access who have upper body venous&#xD;
      occlusions or other conditions that preclude central venous access by conventional methods,&#xD;
      and who meet the requirements described in the device labeling.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single arm, observational, multi-center, consecutively enrolling, post-market surveillance&#xD;
      study. A minimum of 30 patients will be enrolled in the study, all cases to be performed&#xD;
      un-proctored at 10-12 sites in the United States, with no site enrolling more than 3&#xD;
      subjects. All patients enrolled will sign an informed consent form for use of their data.&#xD;
      Investigators will invite patients who will be treated with the device in accordance with the&#xD;
      approved labeling and who met enrollment criteria to join the study.&#xD;
