      The investigators included all patients who were developed acute perforated peptic ulcer&#xD;
      manifestations and were admitted to our hospital between December 2019 to August 2021. The&#xD;
      study was approved by the research and Ethics committee of our university and performed in&#xD;
      accordance with the code of ethics of the world medical association (Declaration of Helsinki)&#xD;
      for studies involving humans. A written informed consent was obtained from all participants.&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated using open Epi program using the following data ; confidence&#xD;
      interval 95% , power of test 80% , ratio of unexposed/exposed 1, percent of patients with&#xD;
      successful management of acute perforated peptic ulcer by surgical intervention 90% and those&#xD;
      with successful management by endoscopy 99% , odds ratio 99%, and risk ratio 2 , so the&#xD;
      calculated sample size equal 100 patients divided into two equal groups. Group (1) included&#xD;
      50 patients managed by combined endoscopic &amp; radiologic intervention , group (2) included 50&#xD;
      patients managed by surgery.&#xD;

      The investigators included all patients who were developed acute perforated peptic ulcer&#xD;
      manifestations and were admitted to our hospital between December 2019 to August 2021. The&#xD;
      study was approved by the research and Ethics committee of our university and performed in&#xD;
      accordance with the code of ethics of the world medical association (Declaration of Helsinki)&#xD;
      for studies involving humans. A written informed consent was obtained from all participants.&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated using open Epi program using the following data ; confidence&#xD;
      interval 95% , power of test 80% , ratio of unexposed/exposed 1, percent of patients with&#xD;
      successful management of acute perforated peptic ulcer by surgical intervention 90% and those&#xD;
      with successful management by endoscopy 99% , odds ratio 99%, and risk ratio 2 , so the&#xD;
      calculated sample size equal 100 patients divided into two equal groups. Group (1) included&#xD;
      50 patients managed by combined endoscopic &amp; radiologic intervention , group (2) included 50&#xD;
      patients managed by surgery. Any patients with acute perforated peptic ulcer manifestations&#xD;
      and age over 18 years were included. Patients presented with septic shock and age below 18&#xD;
      years were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective randomized controlled trial , all patients were subjected to the&#xD;
      followings: patients were selected by randomization method , Full history taking , Complete&#xD;
      physical examination , laboratory investigations ( complete blood picture , liver and kidney&#xD;
      functions , coagulation profile ) , radiological investigations ( chest x- ray erect ,&#xD;
      abdominal &amp; pelvic u/s ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical techniques :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional surgical exploration and Graham omental patch repair with abdominal lavage either&#xD;
      open or laparoscopy was done for group (2). For group (1) endoscopic management using stent ,&#xD;
      clipping and sewing combined with radiologic interventional drainage was used. For duodenal&#xD;
      ulcer only metallic stent was used due to narrow space while for gastric ulcer either stent ,&#xD;
      clipping and sewing were used due to capacious space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metallic stent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upper GI endoscopy ( Model GIF - 2TH180; Olympus , Tokyo, Japan) was done , allowing through&#xD;
      it stent placement. The endoscopy was passed beyond the site of perforation , a guide wire&#xD;
      was passed through the endoscopy into the proximal part of the jejunum and a partially&#xD;
      covered duodenal stent ( Hanaro, MI-tech Korea) was advanced and released over the wire (&#xD;
      Jagwire ; Boston Scientific , Marlborough , M , USA) to cover the perforation site. Attention&#xD;
      was taken to place the oral part of the stent above the pylorus and the covered part of the&#xD;
      stent at site of perforation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At same time of stent placement a radiologic interventional team worked and drainage was done&#xD;
      &amp; 2 intra-peritoneal tube drains were inserted one was placed sub-hepatic another was placed&#xD;
      in the pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During postoperative day one a methylene blue test was done . and blue color was observed in&#xD;
      the drain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stent was removed 3 weeks later and site of perforation was observed . if there was any sings&#xD;
      of remaining perforation a new stent was placed for another 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic clips:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clips are used to approximate the tissue surrounding the defect to effect closure. Standard&#xD;
      clips should be deployed perpendicular to the long axis of the defect. If needed, multiple&#xD;
      clips can be placed sequentially, starting at either edge of a defect and meeting at the&#xD;
      center. Currently available through-the-scope clips achieve superficial tissue apposition&#xD;
      engaging the mucosa and submucosa (with 1.2-mm-wide and 6-mm-long arms capable of an&#xD;
      approximately 12-mm grasp), and have been used in conjunction with thermal ablation or&#xD;
      mechanical scraping of the tissue around the edges of the defect to achieve a more resilient&#xD;
      seal. The Over-the-Scope Clip (Ovesco Endoscopic AG, Tubingen, Germany) is a nitinol clip&#xD;
      placed on a cap at the endoscope tip . Unlike clips inserted through the endoscope, the&#xD;
      OVESCO can perform full-thickness apposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At same time a radiologic interventional team worked and drainage was done &amp; 2&#xD;
      intra-peritoneal tube drains were inserted one was placed sub-hepatic another was placed in&#xD;
      the pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During postoperative day one a methylene blue test was done . and blue color was observed in&#xD;
      the drain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sewing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Stomaphy X suturing system (Endo Gastric Solutions, Redmond, WA) and the Apollo Over&#xD;
      Stitch (Apollo Endo surgery, Austin, TX), which creates full-thickness plications , has shown&#xD;
      early success .&#xD;
&#xD;
      At same time a radiologic interventional team worked and drainage was done &amp; 2&#xD;
      intra-peritoneal tube drains were inserted one was placed sub-hepatic another was placed in&#xD;
      the pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During postoperative day one a methylene blue test was done . and blue color was observed in&#xD;
      the drain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up after surgery and discharge from the hospital:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators examined the patients clinically, made routine laboratory investigations ,&#xD;
      and for group (1) upper GI endoscopy at 2 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected data were analyzed by computer using Statistical Package of Social Services&#xD;
      version 22 (SPSS), Data were represented in tables and graphs, Continuous Quantitative&#xD;
      variables e.g. age were expressed as the mean ± SD &amp; (range), and categorical qualitative&#xD;
      variables were expressed as absolute frequencies (number) &amp; relative frequencies&#xD;
      (percentage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suitable statistical tests of significance were used after checked for normality. Categorical&#xD;
      data were cross tabulated and analyzed by the Chi-square test or Fisher's Exact Test;&#xD;
      Continuous data were evaluated by student t- test. The results were considered statistically&#xD;
      significant when the significant probability was less than 0.05 (P &lt; 0.05). P-value &lt; 0.001&#xD;
      was considered highly statistically significant (HS), and P-value ≥ 0.05 was considered&#xD;
      statistically insignificant (NS).&#xD;
