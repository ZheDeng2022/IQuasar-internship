      A study of acalabrutinib plus venetoclax (AV) versus venetoclax plus obinutuzumab (VO) in&#xD;
      previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the screening period, eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio to each of the following intervention arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)-limited finite AV therapy Arm B: MRD-limited finite VO&#xD;
      therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of screening, treatment, and post-intervention follow-up periods.&#xD;
      Participants will undergo safety and efficacy assessments during each period for each study&#xD;
      arm. The duration of individual participant involvement in the study will be approximately 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants who discontinue study intervention will be followed for safety assessments&#xD;
      and survival status. Safety/survival follow-up is not required if the participant permanently&#xD;
      discontinues study intervention due to withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or death.&#xD;

    <description>To assess symptoms, functional status and global health status/quality of life (QoL), in participants treated with AV versus VO using the EORTC QLQ-C30.&#xD;
EORTC QLQ-C30 consists of 30 items and measures symptoms, functioning, and global health status/QoL for all cancer types. Questions are grouped into 5 multi-item functional scales, 3 multi-item symptom scales, a 2-item global QoL scale, 5 single items assessing additional symptoms commonly reported by cancer participants, and 1 item on the financial impact of the disease.&#xD;
The EORTC QLQ-C30 will be scored according to the EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual. An outcome variable consisting of a score from 0 to 100 will be derived for each of the symptom scales, each of the functional scales, and the global measure of health status scale. Higher scores on the global measure of health status and functional scales indicate better health status/function, but higher scores on symptom scales represent greater symptom severity.</description>

    <description>To assess symptomatic toxicities patient perceived benefit-risk in participants treated with AV versus VO using the NCI PRO-CTCAE item for Bruising.&#xD;
It was designed to be used as a companion to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), the standard lexicon for adverse event reporting in cancer trials.

    <description>To assess patient perceived benefit-risk of treatment in participants treated with AV versus VO using the PGI-BR.&#xD;
PGI-BR consists of 4 study medication-related questions, one each on efficacy, side effects, convenience of use, and overall benefit-risk. Each item is scored separately, with the final item providing a single metric of a participant's overall benefit-risk assessment.&#xD;
The response from each question will be semi-quantitative. Each question ranges from Very (negative, Somewhat [negative]), Neutral, Somewhat [positive], Very [positive].</description>
