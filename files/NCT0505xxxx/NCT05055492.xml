  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will conduct an evaluation of a program that is being implemented SickKids /&#xD;
      Toronto Public Health that provides take-home saliva testing kits in schools. Operationally,&#xD;
      there is a planned randomization so that all schools have an equitable chance to receive the&#xD;
      intervention at various time periods during the planned operational roll-out, which will&#xD;
      require a staggered implementation consistent with the stepped-wedge study design. This study&#xD;
      will leverage this chance implementation to do a robust evaluation of the public health&#xD;
      intervention. Schools that are not being rolled out to week one, will begin in the &quot;control&#xD;
      phase&quot; (testing at an assessment center, primary care or acute care center) and transition to&#xD;
      the program &quot;intervention phase&quot; (take home saliva kits available at schools) at a randomly&#xD;
      assigned time (wedge) over a 6-week period with all schools receiving the program by the end&#xD;
      of the study. The investigators will evaluate the impact of the program on SARS-CoV-2 case&#xD;
      identification in schools.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective evaluation of a program that is being implemented using a&#xD;
      stepped-wedge, cluster randomized design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible elementary public schools high SARS-CoV-2 incidence regions (quintiles 4 and 5) in&#xD;
      Toronto will be randomized. The study will occur over a 7-week period with a minimum of&#xD;
      one-week of baseline data (control phase - testing at an assessment center, primary care or&#xD;
      acute care center) and then schools will start the program in a stepwise manner (20&#xD;
      crossovers per week) with take-home saliva being available to all 120 schools by the end of&#xD;
      the study period. The primary objective of the study is to assess whether the availability of&#xD;
      take home saliva kits at schools for symptomatic testing leads to increased diagnosis of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 cases in the school.&#xD;
