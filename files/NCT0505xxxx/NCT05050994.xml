  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with liver cirrhosis frequently develops portal hypertension. One of the serious&#xD;
      complications to portal hypertension is splenomegaly, which may result in pancytopenia,&#xD;
      especially thrombocytopenia that may cause bleeding tendencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptomatic splenomegaly is often treated with partial splenic embolization (PSE). PSE is&#xD;
      effective but may give rise to postembolization syndrome not well tolerated in the pediatric&#xD;
      population. In adults, microwave ablation (MWA) has been used to treat splenomegaly with&#xD;
      promising results but with less post-operative pain. Our study is a pilot trial to evaluate&#xD;
      the feasibility and acceptability of this treatment in children.&#xD;

      The ablation will be performed under general anesthesia by an experienced interventional&#xD;
      radiologist. Ultrasound will be used for peri-operative assessment and the microwave antenna&#xD;
      will be inserted under ultrasound guidance focusing on the middle to inferior part of the&#xD;
      spleen to avoid harm to the diaphragm. After the emission of microwaves for up to 5 minutes,&#xD;
      the antenna will be pulled back and the emission will be repeated until the ablation zone is&#xD;
      approximately 1 cm from the splenic surface. In this way, two or three overlapping areas will&#xD;
      be ablated with every insertion of the antenna. The ablation zones will be visible as&#xD;
      hyperechoic areas on b-mode ultrasound during operation, and the goal is to ablate up to&#xD;
      40-50% of the total volume of the spleen (as estimated by the radiologist). If the ablated&#xD;
      volume is less than 40-50% at follow up, the procedure can be repeated in a second session&#xD;
      for additional effect.&#xD;
