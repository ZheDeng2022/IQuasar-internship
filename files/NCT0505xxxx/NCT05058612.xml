    <textblock>
      Vasopressors are medications that are given intravenously to increase the blood pressure of&#xD;
      patients with illnesses that cause dangerous blood pressure drops. When a doctor prescribes a&#xD;
      vasopressor, they ask that the dose be adjusted to achieve a specific blood pressure. This&#xD;
      kind of medical support with intravenous (IV) vasopressors are usual treatments in intensive&#xD;
      care unit (ICU) settings. Oral vasopressors, such as midodrine, have been historically used&#xD;
      to maintain blood pressure in non-critically ill patients. In this study, the investigators&#xD;
      will be using midodrine to reduce the need for IV vasopressors as blood pressure improves&#xD;
      during the stay in the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LIBERATE multi-site study will continue the work of the pilot study to evaluate the role&#xD;
      of midodrine for patients with low blood pressure in the ICU.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Purpose: Resuscitation and hemodynamic support with intravenous (IV) vasopressors is a prime&#xD;
      indication of treatment in intensive care unit (ICU) settings. Hemodynamic support is&#xD;
      typically provided with intravenous (IV) vasopressors. However, these have been shown to have&#xD;
      significant negative effects including increased central venous catheter line associated&#xD;
      infections, venous thromboembolic disease, impaired mobility and gastrointestinal injury and&#xD;
      ischemia. Oral vasopressors, such as midodrine, have been historically used for hemodynamic&#xD;
      support in non-critically ill patients, but their study in patients as IV pressor sparing&#xD;
      therapy has been limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: to evaluate the expanded role of midodrine for any vasoplegic patients in the&#xD;
      ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification: In 2018, there were 1,613 admissions to the adult general systems ICU (GSICU)&#xD;
      at the University of Alberta Hospital (UAH). Patients were sick, with a mean Acute Physiology&#xD;
      and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE) score of 21.3, with 36.4% requiring vasopressors on&#xD;
      admission, accounting for 1942 patient-days (data from eCritical TRACER database). In the&#xD;
      environment strained healthcare resources and limited ICU capacity, the ability to safely&#xD;
      wean patients from IV vasopressors with transition to oral hemodynamic supporting agents&#xD;
      would greatly improve how patients navigate through the healthcare system. This in turn will&#xD;
      improve patient-centered case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the effect of enteral midodrine vs. placebo in critically ill patients with&#xD;
      vasoplegia receiving continuous IV vasopressor therapy on ICU length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: To compare the effect of enteral midodrine vs. placebo on: Total and&#xD;
      post-hospital length of stay, Duration of IV vasopressor support, 90-day all-cause mortality,&#xD;
      Rates of ICU re-admission, Rate of re-initiation of IV vasopressors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary Objectives: To determine the health economic effects of the usage of midodrine vs&#xD;
      placebo on: ICU costs, Hospital costs, Total healthcare costs, Cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Endpoints: Adverse drug reactions, Serious adverse drug reactions, Suspected&#xD;
      unexpected serious adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method/Procedures: The LIBERATE Trial is a multi center, concealed-allocation&#xD;
      parallel-group blinded randomized controlled trial. Patients will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      midodrine (enteral, 10mg every 8h) or placebo (microcrystalline cellulose) for the duration&#xD;
      of their IV vasopressor therapy and 24h following the discontinuation of their IV vasopressor&#xD;
      therapy. The recruitment target is 350 patients (i.e., 175 patients per arm) with full&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
