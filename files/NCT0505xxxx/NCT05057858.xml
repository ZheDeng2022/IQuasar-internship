      The study seeks to define the expected blood levels of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)&#xD;
      medications (tenofovir) for cisgender women taking directly observed oral PrEP therapy to&#xD;
      understand the frequency of PrEP dosing associated with HIV protection in cisgender women.&#xD;
      Cisgender women will be randomly assigned to receive varying frequency of weekly PrEP doses&#xD;
      and followed for up to 16 weeks. The study will also investigate how pregnancy affects the&#xD;
      expected blood levels to help define optimal dosing of PrEP for HIV prevention during&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, three-arm, directly observed therapy study. HIV-uninfected&#xD;
      non-pregnant cisgender women at low risk for HIV will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 dosing&#xD;
      frequencies of directly observed therapy (DOT) Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate/Emtricitabine&#xD;
      (TDF/FTC) PrEP to help differentiate poor and modest from perfect dosing. An additional&#xD;
      contemporaneous cohort of pregnant to receive daily dosing will also be recruited to evaluate&#xD;
      the impact of pregnancy on blood and cellular drug levels. Drug concentrations in blood,&#xD;
      vaginal fluid, and tissue will be measured during the study. The primary objectives of the&#xD;
      study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To define the cisgender women-specific expected blood concentrations and&#xD;
           dose-proportionality for Tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP) in dried blood spots (DBS) and&#xD;
           Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells(PBMCs) using directly observed TDF/FTC therapy at 2,&#xD;
           4, 7 doses per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To establish a model to predict adherence rate to TDF/FTC by level of TFV-DP in DBS for&#xD;
           cisgender women. HIV-uninfected non-pregnant cisgender women will be randomly assigned&#xD;
           to 1 of 3 dosing frequencies of directly observed therapy (DOT) TDF/FTC PrEP: 2, 4, or 7&#xD;
           doses/week to help differentiate poor and modest from perfect adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be the first to define TDF-PrEP adherence-blood concentration thresholds for&#xD;
      African cisgender women, a priority population for HIV prevention. The findings will guide&#xD;
      accurate interpretation of adherence and success of PrEP programs in cisgender women. This&#xD;
      data will also help guide decisions on optimal PrEP dosing for HIV at-risk pregnant cisgender&#xD;
      women in Africa.&#xD;

          -  Willing to use DOT and come to clinic frequently for DOT PrEP for at least 8 weeks&#xD;

             to come to the clinic or as determined by the study staff, the participant resides in&#xD;
             close location to clinic to permit home visit if unable to come to the clinic. i.e.,&#xD;
             potential participants without a smartphone may be enrolled in the study if&#xD;
             investigator determines that the participant resides within reasonable distance from&#xD;
             the clinic that would permit home visit id the participant misses their visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intention to stay within the study site's catchment area for at least 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Resides or works in catchment area with high speed internet coverage to permit video&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Not pregnant or breast feeding&#xD;

             not on ART or on ART for &lt;6 months, &gt;1 partner of unknown status, transactional sex,&#xD;
             recent STI, recurrent PEP use, inconsistent condom use, or injection drug use. So,&#xD;
             non-pregnant cisgender women reporting any of these factors will not be eligible for&#xD;
             the study but will be linked for PrEP at clinic of choice including at Thika Site&#xD;
             itself.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  At screening, evidence of a viable pregnancy with gestational age of 13-26 weeks after&#xD;
             the date of conception with sonographic confirmation. If adequate sonographic results&#xD;
             are not available from medical records at screening, an ultrasound must be performed&#xD;
             in the interim so that the result is available at study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At elevated risk for acquiring HIV according to Kenya guideline for PrEP. This is to&#xD;
             ensure an ethical approach for provision of PrEP in pregnancy (i.e., only exposing&#xD;
             PrEP to those who want and might benefit from it). Kenya national guidelines define&#xD;
             substantial risk for HIV and recommend PrEP be an option for individuals reporting&#xD;
             partner of HIV-infected person not on ART or on ART for &lt;6 months, &gt;1 partner of&#xD;
             unknown status, transactional sex, recent STI, recurrent PEP use, no or inconsistent&#xD;
             condom use&#xD;
