  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cohort, single-center, prospective study that seeks to analyze the circulating&#xD;
      tumor DNA (ctDNA) in patients diagnosed with breast cancer, who will undergo neoadjuvant&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is a major public health problem, being the most common cancer in women&#xD;
      worldwide. Breast cancer can be diagnosed through multiple tests, including an imaging and&#xD;
      tissue biopsy. However, accurate assessment and prediction of the response is a major&#xD;
      challenge. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has shown promise in the detection of breast cancer&#xD;
      and clinical and cancer outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate a possible correlations between ctDNA levels with the&#xD;
      pathological complete response and detection of residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy in&#xD;
      patients with breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to start ctDNA surveillance, patients will be asked to participate in blood draws,&#xD;
      every 15 days, during neoadjuvant standard institutional treatment and allow study staff to&#xD;
      review medical records.&#xD;
