    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to learn more about the safety profile of Elaprase in Indian&#xD;
      children and adults with hunter syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive Elaprase once per week over a 3-hour period which can be reduced to&#xD;
      1 hour as determined by the study doctor. Participants will need to visit the clinic weekly&#xD;
      during the duration of the study.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of the study drug administration up to end of study (EOS) (Week 53)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory value), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in: death; is life-threatening: requires inpatient hospitalization or results in prolongation of existing hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; leads to a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is an important medical event. AEs include SAEs, treatment emergent AEs, treatment emergent SAEs, discontinuation due to AEs, and death.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) Based on Hunter Syndrome-Functional Outcomes for Clinical Understanding Scale (HS-FOCUS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 27 and 53</time_frame>
    <description>HS-FOCUS was developed as disease-specific measure of the impact of Hunter syndrome on HRQL. The HS-FOCUS is designed to gather information on the participant's daily life and wellbeing, satisfaction with treatment, and hospitalizations, as well as on how Hunter syndrome impacts participant's general quality of life. HS-FOCUS includes 2 validated components: a parent version and a participant self-reported version for those over age 12 years. The HS-FOCUS (shortened version) questionnaire has 5 function domains (walking/standing, grip/reach, school/work, activities, and breathing). Items are scored using a response scale from 0 to 3, with 0 signifying an ability to complete the activity-related functions 'without any difficulty' and 3 score denoting highest disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the HRQoL Based on Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 27 and 53</time_frame>
    <description>The CHAQ was initially developed for assessing juvenile idiopathic arthritis, from the perspective of the parent or participant, and has been previously applied to other chronic disabling conditions such as Hunter syndrome. It is a 30-item instrument that measures functional capacity and independence in activities of daily life across eight domains: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, reach, grip, hygiene, and activities. For each domain, there is a 4-level difficulty scale that is scored from 0 to 3, with 0 corresponding to 'without any difficulty' and 3 to 'unable to do'.</description>
