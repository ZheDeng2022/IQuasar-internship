  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot trial is to examine the preliminary efficacy of online-delivered&#xD;
      Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics - Enhanced (CBIT-E). In the study, 30 children&#xD;
      with persistent tic disorders (PTDs) will be recruited via information provided to patients&#xD;
      of the Marquette University (MU) Tic Disorders Specialty Clinic (TDSC) and information&#xD;
      conveyed via local medical health professionals, with the goal of randomizing 10 participants&#xD;
      to each group. For those randomized to CBIT-E, treatment will be administered according to&#xD;
      the standard CBIT manual, but there will be two modifications. CBIT typically consists of the&#xD;
      implementation of strategies to help manage the environment related to tics and the&#xD;
      implementation of an exercise to engage in when an individual feels the urge to tic. CBIT-E&#xD;
      will include these same techniques, plus additional in-session and out of session practice of&#xD;
      the exercises, called competing responses, that individuals use when they feel the urge to&#xD;
      tic. Treatment will be delivered over Microsoft Teams, which is a secure video conferencing&#xD;
      system. The therapist will administer treatment from a private room in the Marquette&#xD;
      University Tic Disorder Specialty Clinic, while the parent and child will be at their home.&#xD;
      Treatment will include a screening visit, baseline assessment, 11 weeks (9 sessions) of&#xD;
      CBIT-E, a post treatment assessment, and a three-month follow up assessment. Further,&#xD;
      starting after session 3, there will be four 15-minute practice periods scheduled each week&#xD;
      between sessions. During these practice periods, the child and therapist will meet over&#xD;
      Microsoft Teams and the therapist will administer an enhanced reward task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children randomized to the waitlist control (WLC) will not receive treatment during the&#xD;
      11-week period. Instead, they will be placed on a waitlist to receive standard CBIT following&#xD;
      the end of the study period. Participants in this group will complete a screening visit,&#xD;
      baseline assessment, and a final assessment, which will occur approximately 11 weeks after&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;

    <description>Clinician-rated measure that assesses motor and vocal tic severity and impairment over the past week. Motor and vocal tic number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference are rated on a 0-5 scale and summed to create separate motor and vocal tic severity scores (each ranging from 0-25). These ratings are combined to create a total tic severity score (Range = 0-50). Clinicians also rate overall tic-related impairment on a 50-point scale. Higher scores are related to more tic severity/impairment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Will be completed by the independent evaluator at post (11 weeks after baseline) and 3-month follow-up (3 months after post)</time_frame>
    <description>Clinician-rated scale used to assess overall treatment response. Ratings on the CGI-I range from 1 (very much improved) to 8 (very much worse). CGI-I scores of 2 (much improved) or 1 (very much improved) indicate positive treatment response. Higher scores are related to worse treatment response.</description>
