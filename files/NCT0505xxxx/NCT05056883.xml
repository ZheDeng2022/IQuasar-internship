  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy and safety of K-237 0.3-0.4 mg/kg orally administered once daily for 3 days will&#xD;
      be evaluated in patients with mild COVID-19 using a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group&#xD;
      comparative method with placebo as a control. Efficacy will be assessed using a stratified&#xD;
      log-rank test to determine the superiority of the drug over placebo in terms of time to&#xD;
      improvement in clinical symptoms from the start of study drug administration to 168 hours.&#xD;
