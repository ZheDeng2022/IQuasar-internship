  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching objective of this proposal is to conduct a multi-site Sequential Multiple&#xD;
      Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) across multiple Military Health System (MHS) sites to&#xD;
      optimize the sequencing and integration of two intervention strategies in total knee&#xD;
      arthoplasty (TKA) patients: a single-session mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) and an&#xD;
      intensive 8-week MBI-Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) designed to&#xD;
      simultaneously reduce prolonged pain and chronic opioid use by enhancing self-regulation. Aim&#xD;
      1: Evaluate the extent to which a brief preoperative MBI improves TKA patients' postoperative&#xD;
      musculoskeletal health and reduces chronic opioid use. Aim 2: Evaluate the extent to which an&#xD;
      intensive MBI (MORE) improves musculoskeletal health and reduces chronic opioid use among&#xD;
      patients non-responsive to preoperative intervention. Aim 3: (A) Determine patient baseline&#xD;
      characteristics that moderate MBI treatment responses. (B) Quantify the degree to which the&#xD;
      impact of Phase 1 and 2 MBIs on musculoskeletal health and opioid dose are mediated by&#xD;
      changes in mechanistic autonomic marker of self-regulation: heart-rate variability (HRV).&#xD;
