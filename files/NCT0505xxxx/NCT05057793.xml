  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of a daily geko™ wound therapy&#xD;
      (duration of 12 hours), in conjunction with standard of care (SC), to SC alone, in&#xD;
      participants with venous leg ulcers.The participants will go through a four-week run-in&#xD;
      phase, followed by a four-week treatment phase and a three-month long term follow-up.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of geko™ therapy for 12 hours daily in&#xD;
      conjunction with Standard Care (SC), consisting of multilayer, multicomponent compression&#xD;
      therapy intended for the treatment of VLUs, compared to SC alone in participants with VLUs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a multicentre study with study centres in Ontario Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have three phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A four-week Run-In Phase (day 0-28)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A four-week Treatment Phase (day 28-56)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A long term Follow-Up Phase (day 84, 112 &amp; 140 after EOT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Run-In Phase all participants will receive SC only and will be evaluated on a&#xD;
      weekly basis (day 0, 7, 14 &amp; 21). On day 28, once the Investigator has confirmed the&#xD;
      participant's continued eligibility, randomization and assignment to study treatment will&#xD;
      take place. During the long term follow-up phase, participants continue with their assigned&#xD;
      study treatment and will be seen and evaluated on day 84, 112 and 140&#xD;
