    <textblock>
      Despite advances in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the prognosis in adults is&#xD;
      still poor, largely due to the resistance of treatment at diagnosis or early relapse. Among&#xD;
      the strategies associated with the treatment of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia is&#xD;
      rehabilitation and physical medicine in order to improve the quality of life, body&#xD;
      composition, fitness, strength and improve the attachment and acceptance of their treatment&#xD;

      Previous evidence had shown that among the beneficial effects of an exercise intervention in&#xD;
      cancer is the reduction of adverse events associated with treatment, such as nausea and&#xD;
      fatigue. Also, the overexpression of Interleukin-15 in cancer is related to a poor prognosis,&#xD;
      biologically the implementation of a cross-training exercise routine can function as a&#xD;
      regulatory pathway for its expression due to its consumption at muscular level. Finally, the&#xD;
      time to consider a relapse with a very poor prognosis is during first three months of&#xD;
      treatment, so implementation of an exercise strategy during this period could reduce the&#xD;
      proportion of early relapses mediated by Interleukin-15 expression&#xD;
