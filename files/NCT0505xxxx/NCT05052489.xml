      This Study based on the actual clinical diagnosis and treatment of data, evaluate the&#xD;
      clinical characteristics of children with diarrhea Therapeutic effect and security, and&#xD;
      establish the platform to childhood diarrhea registration, long-term accumulation of clinical&#xD;
      data, develop the clinical characteristics and therapeutic effect of childhood diarrhea,&#xD;
      safety monitoring data, and provide reliable data support for the clinical application.&#xD;

      To evaluate the causes, clinical manifestations, treatment plans and clinical outcomes of&#xD;
      diarrhoeal disease in children in a real diagnosis and treatment setting。 Evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of different treatment schemes in actual clinical application,the clinical use of&#xD;
      nutrition-supported zinc in oral rehydration fluids,the influencing factors of clinical&#xD;
      efficacy, including the demographic characteristics and clinical characteristics of the&#xD;
      children, as well as drug combination regimens, etc. To evaluate the clinical use of&#xD;
      antibiotics,the clinical effects of different probiotics in the treatment of diarrhoeal&#xD;
      disease in children,the effectiveness, safety and economy of the dose course of the clinical&#xD;
      application of Clostridium butyricum bivariate living agents, the medical costs and resource&#xD;
      consumption of treatment for diarrhoeal diseases in children.&#xD;
