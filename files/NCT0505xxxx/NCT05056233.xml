      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate reduced corneal staining with use of&#xD;
      Systane Hydration among subjects with dry eye disease (DED) undergoing routine cataract&#xD;
      removal and monofocal intraocular lens (IOL) implantation.&#xD;

      Subjects will attend 6 scheduled study visits for an individual duration of participation of&#xD;
      6 weeks. One eye (study eye) will be followed.&#xD;

    <measure>Corneal staining</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 30 post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>The National Eye Institute (NEI) grading scale will be used to evaluate the five corneal regions: Superior, inferior, central, temporal and nasal. Each region will be graded on a 0-3 scale, where 0 = normal (no staining), 1 = mild/superficial stippling micropunctate staining, 2 = moderate/macropunctate staining with some coalescent areas, and 3 = severe/numerous coalescent macropunctate areas and/or patches. The regions will be summed for a resultant overall score of 0 to 15.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>DEQ-5 Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 30 post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>The Dry Eye Questionnaire-5 (DEQ-5) is a patient-reported outcome measures questionnaire designed to assess symptoms of dry eye disease. Subjects will respond to 5 questions using a 0-4 Likert-type scale, for a resultant overall score of 0 (best) to 20 (worst).</description>

    <measure>Ocular Comfort Questionnaire Score: My eyes are comfortable</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 30 post-operative</time_frame>
