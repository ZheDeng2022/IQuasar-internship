    <textblock>
      This Clinical trial study for the effect of a product E-PR-01 will be studied for its ability&#xD;
      to attain rapid pain relief in the individuals suffering from exercise-induced knee joint&#xD;
      pain, as well as determine its sustained effect on pain reduction over a treatment period of&#xD;
      five days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over study to explore the&#xD;
      effect of a product E-PR-01 on joint pain. Approximately 50 participants aged between ≥ 20&#xD;
      and ≤ 60 years will be screened. At least 40 participants will be randomized, and the&#xD;
      participants will be crossed over both the IP and placebo arms. A minimum of 32 participants&#xD;
      must complete the study, after accounting for the screening failure and dropout /withdrawal&#xD;
      rate of 20% each. The duration of each treatment for all the study participants will be 5&#xD;
      days, the washout period between each treatment period being 5 ± 2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total study period from the first start of treatment visit, inclusive of the washout and&#xD;
      treatment periods, is estimated to be 15 days.&#xD;

    <description>To determine the effect of IP after single dose on time taken to achieve meaningful pain relief as assessed by the time taken to have a reduction of at least 40 % from baseline (0-hour post exertion) on a 100-point pain visual analogue scale as compared to placebo..</description>

    <description>In this study, the Pain VAS will be used as the method of pain intensity assessment. The values of Pain VAS measured right after IP consumption and each specified time intervals will be the value used to assess PID.at 2-, 3- and 4-hours Day 1 as compared to placebo. Minimum score is 0 represent No pain and 100 means worst possible pain.</description>

    <description>VAS score will be taken at 0-hour post exertion and at 4 hours post IP consumption after the performance of the modified Naughton Protocol. The summation of the PID values obtained will be used to calculate the sum of Pain Intensity Difference (SPID). Minimum score is 0 represent No pain and 100 means worst possible pain.&#xD;
