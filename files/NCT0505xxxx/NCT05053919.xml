    <textblock>
      The double-blinded and randomized study evaluated the effectiveness and side effects of a&#xD;
      novel non-invasive treatment, Schumann resonance (SR), in treating insomnia. The objective of&#xD;
      this study is (1) to evaluate the improvement of sleep quality of patients with insomnia&#xD;
      disorder by SR and (2) to be the basis for the future development of physical magnetic&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a common sleep disturbance that affects the health and quality of life of&#xD;
      individuals and accounts for considerable utilization of medical resources. The prevalence of&#xD;
      insomnia is approximately 30%; in Asia, the prevalence of insomnia is approximately 4% in&#xD;
      Japan, 9.9% in South Korea, 10.3% in Taiwan. Based on the statistic of Taiwan BNHI office in&#xD;
      a 2013 report, there is worth of 1.3 billion prescriptions of hypnotic drug in one year. In&#xD;
      addition, the reimbursement expenditure pays up more than 1 billion New Taiwan Dollars (NTD)&#xD;
      with increasing expense rate of 15% every year, showing insomnia causes great distress to&#xD;
      Taiwanese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The characteristics of insomnia are difficulty with initiating or maintaining sleep, early&#xD;
      morning waking, or non-restorative sleep. In DSM-5, the diagnosis of primary insomnia has&#xD;
      been renamed insomnia disorder to avoid the differentiation between primary and secondary&#xD;
      insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common treatment for insomnia is pharmacological therapy with hypnotics such as a&#xD;
      benzodiazepine, zolpidem, or zopiclone. However, treatment with hypnotics includes the risk&#xD;
      of adverse effects, drug tolerance and dependence . Some past reports on different&#xD;
      non-pharmacological treatment strategies, such as Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), muscle&#xD;
      relaxation training, stimulus control, sleep restriction, and sleep hygiene, have&#xD;
      demonstrated the effectiveness of most of these non-pharmacological treatments. However, the&#xD;
      poor compliance and inconvenience for CBT is always a big issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Except the traditional treatment of insomnia, some folk therapies' clinical effect does not&#xD;
      been confirmed, such as aromatherapy, music therapy, etc. Nowadays, due to development of&#xD;
      technology for medical devices, some sleep devices were launched, aim to prolong the&#xD;
      slow-wave sleep and enhances the sleeping quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational device in this study is a sleep device with SRF (Sleep Restore&#xD;
      Frequency), the principle is to integrate the bio-energy generated Schumann resonances,&#xD;
      native from Earth, and the shocks from the Earth's magnetic field. Through the non-contact&#xD;
      method with bio-energy waves, SRF are coupled to the sleep center of the brain, inducing and&#xD;
      adjusting the electrical activities of the sleep center. It prolongs the in-depth sleep and&#xD;
      enhances the sleeping quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is (1) to evaluate the improvement of sleep quality of patients&#xD;
      with insomnia disorder by sleep device and (2) to be the basis for the future development of&#xD;
      physical magnetic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Approximately 60 subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      enrolled into the trial and averagely separated two arms for statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Efficacy evaluation statistics will be conducted with independent t-test&#xD;
      or Fisher's exact test for testing the differences and conducted with Pearson correlation&#xD;
      coefficient for the association between variables.&#xD;
