  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the feasibility of undertaking a randomised controlled&#xD;
      trial investigating the effectiveness of a 12-week home-based exercise programme for people&#xD;
      with intermittent claudication.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      30 participants with PAD will be randomised to one of two groups: either exercise or usual&#xD;
      care. The 12 week exercise intervention will consist of a home-based circuit programme,&#xD;
      including both resistance exercises and walking. This will be combined with promoting&#xD;
      free-living walking throughout the rest of the week. Exercise will be regulated via the use&#xD;
      of a wearable activity monitor. Biweekly phone calls will address compliance with the&#xD;
      intervention. The primary outcomes are feasibility and acceptability, which will be&#xD;
      determined after 12 weeks via recruitment and attrition rates, protocol adherence and with&#xD;
      participant interviews. Secondary outcomes include changes in pain-free and maximal walking&#xD;
      distances with both a graded treadmill test and six-minute walk test, hand grip strength,&#xD;
      physical activity behaviour (measured with an accelerometer), quality of life (measured with&#xD;
      the SF-36, VascuQol and E5-5D-5L questionnaires) after 12 and 24 weeks. Investigators will&#xD;
      also assess changes in markers of inflammation, vascular remodeling, mitochondrial biogenesis&#xD;
      and oxidative stress at 12 and 24 weeks. Other outcomes include changes in time spent resting&#xD;
      during a six-minute walk test and time to pain cessation following a graded treadmill test at&#xD;
      12 and 24 weeks.&#xD;
