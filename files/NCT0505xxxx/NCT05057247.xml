    <textblock>
      This trial that is investigating a medication called duvelisib in combination with docetaxel&#xD;
      for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) that has returned&#xD;
      or spread outside the head and neck area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duvelisib (PI3K inhibitor)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Docetaxel chemotherapy&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, phase II open-label, single-arm trial will enroll participants with&#xD;
      recurrent or metastatic (R/M), incurable squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN)&#xD;
      who have failed or discontinued PD-1 blockade in the first-line (1L) advanced disease&#xD;
      setting, regardless of human papillomavirus (HPV) and smoking status, or PI3K pathway&#xD;
      alteration status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study involves the oral (taken by mouth) agent duvelisib with the intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) chemotherapy agent docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duvelisib (PI3K inhibitor)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Docetaxel chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive study treatment for up to 2 years and will be followed for 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 30 people will take part in this research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug (duvelisib) to learn whether it works in&#xD;
      treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved duvelisib for this specific&#xD;
      disease but has approved it for other uses (such as certain types of blood cancers). The FDA&#xD;
      has approved docetaxel as a treatment option for head and neck cancer, as well as other&#xD;
      cancer types.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 7 days of study registration. Female subjects of childbearing&#xD;

             completion of stud drug administration. Contraception is required before starting the&#xD;
             first dose of study medication through 120 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
             medication. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and&#xD;
             preferred contraception for the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be&#xD;
             eligible for admission into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have been previously treated with 3 or more lines of systemic therapy for R/M SCCHN.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -- Have received treatment with a prior PI3K pathway inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received radiation therapy (RT) within 14 days of the first dose of duvelisib on&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or&#xD;
             carcinomatous meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may&#xD;
             participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging and&#xD;
             off systemic steroids for at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study&#xD;
             treatment), and have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases. This exception&#xD;
             does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical&#xD;
             stability, because of the poor prognosis and progressive neurologic dysfunction that&#xD;
             would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent administration of other cancer specific therapy or investigational agents&#xD;
             during the course of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection; evidence of symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;
             stroke, or ventricular arrhythmia within 6 months of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received a live or live attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks of the first dose of&#xD;
             duvelisib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received medications or consumed foods that are strong inhibitors or inducers of&#xD;
             cytochrome P450 (CYP3A) within 2 weeks of, or while on, duvelisib.&#xD;
