    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are a) to investigate the effect of a personalized and&#xD;
      computerized cognitive stimulation program on sleep quality, cognitive performance, and&#xD;
      quality of life; and b) verify if cognitive stimulation can be used as a non-pharmacological&#xD;
      alternative to improve the quality of sleep in individuals who have insomnia.&#xD;

      After determining the eligibility for study entry, all participants will be informed about&#xD;
      the study and potential risks and give written informed consent before undergoing an 8-week&#xD;
      cognitive stimulation program. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to an&#xD;
      intervention group (activities presented will be automatically adjusted in difficulty and&#xD;
      requirement according to each participant's performance so that a cognitive effort is always&#xD;
      required) and control group (activities will be of constant difficulty throughout the&#xD;
      intervention). Participants will perform cognitive stimulation activities five consecutive&#xD;
      days (Monday to Friday), 30 minutes per day, for a total of eight weeks.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The intervention will be carried out through the CogniFit® online platform so participants will access it from home using a personal computer or smart device. The training will last for a total of 8 weeks (40 training sessions), with five consecutive training days per week (Monday to Friday), and sessions lasting between 20 and 30 minutes each. Since this process is autonomous, participants will be contacted periodically (a minimum of one phone call per week) to ensure adherence and check that they have not had any incidence. The platform will records participants' performance, providing researchers with real-time feedback on the performance of each participant.&#xD;
*After the post-test, all the participants in group 2 will be given the possibility to complete the intervention with the difficulty adjustment algorithm. Hence, at the end of a 16-week period, both groups will have been provided with what is considered to be the best intervention, thus complying with ethical precepts.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Participant)</masking>
    <masking_description>Participants will be randomly assigned to one out of two groups (control/experimental). Both groups will perform the same type of cognitive stimulation activities. The activities presented to group 1 (experimental group) will be automatically adjusted in difficulty and requirement according to each participant's performance so that a maximum cognitive effort is always required. The activities for Group 2 (active control group) will be of constant difficulty throughout the intervention and will not target the intended cognitive processes (namely, they will target orthogonal unrelated aspects). Participants are blind to whether they are in the intervention or the control group. In this way, placebo or waiting-list effects are avoided.</masking_description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Sleep quality on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days before starting the intervention and 3 days after finishing the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-report questionnaire that assesses sleep quality. The measure consists of 19 individual items, creating 7 components that produce one global score, and takes 5-10 minutes to complete. The PSQI includes a scoring key for calculating a patient's seven subscores, each of which can range from 0 to 3. The subscores are tallied, yielding a &quot;global&quot; score that can range from 0 to 21. A global score of 5 or more indicates poor sleep quality; the higher the score, the worse the quality. Change = (Week 8 Score - Baseline Score).</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Insomnia on the Insomnia Severity Index at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days before starting the intervention and 3 days after finishing the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) is a brief instrument that was designed to assess the severity of both nighttime and daytime components of insomnia. It comprises seven items assessing the perceived severity of difficulties initiating sleep, staying asleep, and early morning awakenings, satisfaction with current sleep pattern, interference with daily functioning, noticeability of impairment attributed to the sleep problem, and degree of distress or concern caused by the sleep problem. Possible scores ranges from 0 (No clinically significant insomnia) to 28 (Clinically insomnia - Severe). Change = (Week 8 Score - Baseline Score).</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Quality of life on Measuring Quality of Life | The World Health Organization - abridged version</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days before starting the intervention and 3 days after finishing the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Measuring Quality of Life | The World Health Organization - abridged version (WHOQOL-BREF) is a generic questionnaire to measure the quality of life created by the Study Group on Quality of Life of the World Health Organization. It has 26 questions, two general questions on the quality of life and satisfaction with the state health, and 24 questions grouped into four areas or domains: Physical Health, Psychological Health, Social Relations and Environment. The measure is calculated by summing the point values for the questions corresponding to each domain and then transforming the scores to a 0-100 point interval. Possible scores for each domain ranges from 0 (poor perceived quality of life) to 100 (greater perceived quality of life). Change = (Week 8 Score - Baseline Score).</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Executive function on Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days before starting the intervention and 3 days after finishing the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version (BRIEF-A) is a standardised measure that captures views of an adult's executive functions or self-regulation in his or her everyday environment. Only the self-report format will be used. The BRIEF-A is composed of 75 items within nine theoretically and empirically derived clinical scales that measure various aspects of executive functioning; Inhibit, Self-Monitor, Plan/Organise, Shift, Initiate, Task Monitor, Emotional Control, Working Memory, Organisation of Materials. The clinical scales form two broader indexes: Behavioral Regulation (BRI) and Metacognition (MI), and these indexes form the overall summary score, the Global Executive Composite (GEC). Also includes three validity scales (Negativity, Inconsistency, and Infrequency). It takes approximately 10-15 minutes to administer. All 75 items are rated in terms of frequency on a 3-point scale: 0 (never), 1 (sometimes), 2 (often). Raw scores for each scale are summed</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Depressive symptoms on The Beck Depression Inventory-II at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days before starting the intervention and 3 days after finishing the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) is a 21-item, self-report inventory designed to measure the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms. Items include somatic-affective symptoms as well as cognitive symptoms. Possible scores ranges from 0 (no depressive symptoms) to 63 (severe depression). Change = (Week 8 Score - Baseline Score).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Anxiety symptoms on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days before starting the intervention and 3 days after finishing the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) is a self-report that assesses two types of anxiety - state anxiety, or anxiety about an event, and trait anxiety, or anxiety level as a personal characteristic. Only the 20 items referred to state anxiety will be administered. Possible scores ranges from 0 (no anxiety) to 60 (severe anxiety). Change = (Week 8 Score - Baseline Score).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in worrying on The Penn State Worry Questionnaire at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days before starting the intervention and 3 days after finishing the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) is a 16-item questionnaire that aims to measure the trait of worry. The items on the scale assess the occurrence, intrusiveness, pervasiveness, and other characterizing features of an individual's experience with worry. The scale has been shown to identify worry, over and above anxiety and depression. Items are rated on a five-point scale: 1-Not at all typical of me to 5-Very typical of me. Possible scores ranges from 16 (low worry) to 80 (high worry). Change = (Week 8 Score - Baseline Score).</description>
