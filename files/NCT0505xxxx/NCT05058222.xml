      exercise combined with physical training can positively influence the sleep duration and&#xD;
      quality. This study will provide the evidence that during the postoperative period deep&#xD;

      Subjects will be randomly placed into Control group and Interventional group. The control&#xD;
      program will consist of Deep Breathing Exercises (from Morning to night every three hours;&#xD;
      each session consisting of 10 deep breaths with a few seconds pause between each set, for 3&#xD;
      days) in addition with progressive Exercises. Two daily sessions with an average duration of&#xD;
      25 min will be performed. In addition to the physiotherapeutic program standardized by the&#xD;
      hospital's team of physical therapists, the intervention group will perform additional Deep&#xD;
      breathing Exercises (from Morning to night every three hours; each session consisting of 30&#xD;
      deep breaths with a few seconds pause between each set, for 3 days). Deep breathing exercises&#xD;
      will start 48 hours after extubation and full education along with the routine care (i.e.:&#xD;
      from the fourth to sixth postoperative day).&#xD;
