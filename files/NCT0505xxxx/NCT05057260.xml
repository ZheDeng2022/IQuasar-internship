  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Long Covid (LC) affects over one million people in the UK, it has various&#xD;
      symptoms and impacts daily life. Although there are 83 LC clinics in England, most people&#xD;
      have not had access to them, and waiting times to be seen are long. We realise the urgency&#xD;
      for LC patients to access prompt and appropriate care in clinics and doctors' surgeries, as&#xD;
      well as manage their symptoms effectively at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:Our research aims to produce a 'gold standard' for care by analysing what is happening to&#xD;
      patients now, creating new systems of care and evaluating them to establish best practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outline Of Research: This research has been developed with LC patients and will continue to&#xD;
      include patients working as equal partners. Key priorities of LC patients are: correct&#xD;
      clinical assessment; advice and treatment; and help with returning to work and other roles.&#xD;
      This research is also based on the experience of a wide range of NHS professionals already&#xD;
      treating people in ten LC clinics across the UK, and led by academics (universities) with&#xD;
      links to other LC funded studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will take place in three settings: LC clinics; at home (including&#xD;
      self-monitoring on a mobile device using a set of questions on symptoms built into an app);&#xD;
      and in doctors' surgeries. We will track where patients are being referred or not referred,&#xD;
      and learn from the experience of clinics by interviewing patients and recording outcomes.&#xD;
      Throughout, specialists in 'Healthcare Inequality' will reach people who are not accessing&#xD;
      clinics. We will put in place new processes in clinics and doctors' surgeries, monitored&#xD;
      throughout to make sure they are the correct standard, accessible for patients and staff, and&#xD;
      cost-effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Comparing findings across our partnership of ten LC Clinics we will learn more&#xD;
      about treatment, providing real-time education to other healthcare staff and patients, and&#xD;
      establishing a 'gold standard' that can be shared within England and the rest of the UK.&#xD;

      Background: Long COVID (LC) or Post-COVID syndrome affects up to one million people in the UK&#xD;
      and is a syndrome of persistent and fluctuating symptoms, with underlying organ dysfunction&#xD;
      and multimorbidity. England has 83 dedicated multidisciplinary LC clinics (with no funding&#xD;
      yet in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland), but these are unable to meet the growing demand&#xD;
      and many patients are currently not getting timely care. There is an urgent need to develop a&#xD;
      UK-wide efficient integrated LC service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: We will optimise LC management across three settings of care - LC specialist clinics&#xD;
      (Work stream (WS)1); Homes/self-management (WS2) and Primary care (WS3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: WS1: The management options for multisystem medical problems will be standardised to&#xD;
      derive best practice guidance using a Quality Improvement collaborative involving embedded&#xD;
      clinician researchers from 10 UK-wide LC clinics. Experience-based co-design with patients&#xD;
      and healthcare professionals will inform training and resources for both. Ethnic and&#xD;
      socioeconomic inequalities of care and vocational challenges of patients will be addressed&#xD;
      using qualitative and mixed methods approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WS2: A digital platform incorporating wearable technology will capture symptom fluctuations&#xD;
      and individual condition triggers to enable biofeedback for self-management. Core outcomes&#xD;
      measures including the first published LC patient-reported outcome measure (Yorkshire&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Scale C19 YRS, developed by the co-CI) will be made available on the digital&#xD;
      platform for monitoring and directing interventions remotely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WS3: Existing primary care and LC clinic integrated data will assist in developing and&#xD;
      evaluating new integrated cost-effective service models that will enable the best practice&#xD;
      guidance developed in WS1 to be delivered at point of contact in primary care. We have links&#xD;
      with previously funded NIHR LC projects to enable co-learning and maximising impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PPI/E: From understanding how COVID-19 has disproportionately affected different communities,&#xD;
      we have created a seven-member core PPI Advisory Group (PAG) that is inclusive of different&#xD;
      cultural, ethnic and socio-economic groups. They have attended our proposal research planning&#xD;
      meetings and met separately to examine and develop the research aim/objectives/ questions,&#xD;
      ensuring these are aligned with the key research priorities of patients with LC as well as&#xD;
      representing different patient needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAG members have lived experience of LC, and bring information and experience from&#xD;
      participating in patient support groups including Long Covid Support (n=38K), doctors with LC&#xD;
      and a LC Physio. PAG members have been involved in research design for previous NIHR bids,&#xD;
      have acted as patient representatives on the NHS England LC Taskforce, and have led national&#xD;
      audits on access to LC clinics. The PPI Lead is a founding member of the LC Employment&#xD;
      Taskforce of Society of Occupational Medicine and a representative on the Access to WHO Covid&#xD;
      Therapies Accelerator (ACT-A) committee. Some members meet weekly as members of Employment&#xD;
      Steering Group of the LC Support Group including liaising with Unions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the PAG will meet quarterly to review progress, ensure the research is&#xD;
      answering the most relevant urgent issues in LC care and that the findings are translational&#xD;
      and rapidly informing LC care. To ensure the different demographics of each of the ten LC&#xD;
      Clinics are represented, two PPI members from each Clinic will be invited to join a Patient&#xD;
      Advisory Network (PAN). Information will flow between the PAG and the PAN via the PPI Lead&#xD;
      and Co-lead, ensuring that the voices of the PAN are represented within the PAG, and that&#xD;
      they receive updates about research activity in the same way as PAG members. With support&#xD;
      from the PPI Lead and Co-lead, PAN members will have an active role in gathering and sharing&#xD;
      local intelligence about various aspects of the LC experience and LC Clinic access from LC&#xD;
      patients representative of different groups e.g. via the voluntary sector and GP surgeries in&#xD;
      different locations, including remote areas where there may be more elderly people with less&#xD;
      access to LC clinics. The PPI Facilitator will provide the PAN members with PPI training, and&#xD;
      provide them with the appropriate support needed to carry these activities out and contribute&#xD;
      to the PAG.&#xD;
