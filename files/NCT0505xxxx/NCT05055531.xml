      The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 continues to pose a threat to public health worldwide.&#xD;
      Currently, approximately 2,397,312 people have died from it and 108,715,375 confirmed cases&#xD;
      have been reported, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) as of February 13, 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are, from stage 3, at risk for a severe form of&#xD;
      COVID 19 and this risk increases with the severity of the disease, including in dialysis or&#xD;
      transplant patients according to the press release. HAS of December 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, France has prioritized vaccination for these patients the mRNA vaccine&#xD;
      Therefore, the objective of this work is to study the safety of the vaccine in a population&#xD;
      of hemodialysis patients in a heavy center, and the efficacy on the immune response (IgG) and&#xD;
      the kinetics induced after 3 doses of the anti-Covid vaccine. to RNA.&#xD;

      The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 continues to pose a threat to public health worldwide.&#xD;
      Currently, approximately 2,397,312 people have died from it and 108,715,375 confirmed cases&#xD;
      have been reported, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) as of February 13, 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are, from stage 3, at risk for a severe form of&#xD;
      COVID 19 and this risk increases with the severity of the disease, including in dialysis or&#xD;
      transplant patients according to the press release. HAS of December 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, France has prioritized the mRNA vaccine vaccination for these patients in&#xD;
      accordance with the vaccination strategy defined by the Minister of Health on Friday, January&#xD;
      15, 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 trials of RNA vaccines have shown good tolerability and greater than 90% efficacy in&#xD;
      preventing symptomatic infection after two doses given 3 to 4 weeks apart , but hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients did not not included in the first clinical trials of Covid-19 vaccination. Little is&#xD;
      known about the immunological response to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, as is the need for new&#xD;
      doses, given the usually low immune response in this population . Seroconversion after&#xD;
      confirmed infection approaches 100% in the dialysis population, but the durability of this&#xD;
      protective immune response remains uncertain. Some studies indicate that the IgG titers of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 decrease considerably after 3 months Therefore, the objective of this work is to&#xD;
      study the safety of the vaccine in a population of hemodialysis patients in a heavy center,&#xD;
      and the efficacy on the immune response (IgG) and the kinetics induced after 3 doses of the&#xD;
      anti-Covid vaccine. All patients at the dialysis center were offered the coronavirus vaccine.&#xD;
      The vaccination was carried out during a dialysis session. The vaccines administered were the&#xD;
      only ones to have had Marketing Authorization from January 2021: Pfizer / BioNTech and&#xD;
      Moderna. Not all patients were vaccinated at the same time. The first doses given to the&#xD;
      first dialysis patients were given in January 2021, then the injections were staggered over&#xD;
      time. In accordance with the recommendations of the Ministry of Health, patients were offered&#xD;
      3 doses of vaccine (from the same laboratory).&#xD;
