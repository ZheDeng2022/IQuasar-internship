    <textblock>
      This study is a continuation study of the original V-01-I phase trial, using a single-center,&#xD;
      single-arm, open design to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the third dose booster&#xD;
      immunization of Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Fusion Protein Vaccine (V-01) in healthy participants&#xD;
      immunized with two doses schedule of V-01.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the Immunogenicity of the third dose booster&#xD;
      immunization of V-01 in healthy participants immunized with two doses schedule of V-01.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety of the third dose booster immunization of&#xD;
      V-01 in healthy participants immunized with two doses schedule of V-01.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The plan is to booster immunize the participants previously in 10μg test group in V-01&#xD;
      clinical trial phase I, 48 participants are planned to be enrolled. The actual case number&#xD;
      will be calculated by the participants who signed the ICF and got actual inoculation with the&#xD;
      third dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccination and follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three to six months after the two doses of V-01 (10 μg) were vaccinated, the participants&#xD;
      received a booster dose of investigational vaccine (V-01, 10 μg) at the deltoid muscle of the&#xD;
      upper arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perform safety and immunogenicity related inspections in accordance with the schedule in the&#xD;
      plan.&#xD;
