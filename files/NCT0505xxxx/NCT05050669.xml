    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective study is to characterize the natural history of ENPP1&#xD;
      Deficiency (including Generalized Arterial Calcification of Infancy Type 1 [GACI] and&#xD;
      Autosomal Recessive Hypophosphatemic Rickets Type 2 [ARHR2]) and the early-onset form of&#xD;
      ABCC6 Deficiency (Generalized Arterial Calcification of Infancy Type 2 [GACI-2])&#xD;
      longitudinally.&#xD;

      Study INZ701-003 is a multicenter, prospective, longitudinal, observational study to evaluate&#xD;
      disease presentation and progression in infant, pediatric, and adult subjects with ENPP1&#xD;
      Deficiency and the early-onset form of ABCC6 Deficiency. The study will gather information&#xD;
      about the biochemical, physiological, anatomic, radiographic, and functional manifestations&#xD;
      (including patient reported outcomes [PROs]) of each disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive the current standard of care available at the clinical site along with&#xD;
      additional assessments administered by the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject participation will consist of a Screening Period and an Observational Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Screening Period, eligibility will be determined. A subject will be enrolled into&#xD;
      the study if they meet all eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Observational Period, subjects will be assessed for changes in their disease in&#xD;
      the following areas: measurements of physiological function (including laboratory testing,&#xD;
      anatomical and radiographical assessment of calcification and bone mineralization,&#xD;
      performance outcomes, patient, caregiver, and physician reported outcomes) and healthcare&#xD;
      utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The type and timing of assessments will be based on the age of the subject at the time of&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;

        This study will enroll all eligible subjects, from birth through adulthood (infant,&#xD;
        pediatric, and adult populations), with ENPP1 Deficiency and the early-onset form of ABCC6&#xD;
        Deficiency who consent to participate.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals eligible to participate must meet all of the following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Must provide written or electronic consent (if able) and/or the consent of the legally&#xD;
             authorized representative/caregiver and assent for subjects &lt;18 years of age after the&#xD;
             nature of the study has been explained and prior to any research-related procedures,&#xD;
             following the policies of the clinical site&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Clinical diagnosis of ENPP1 Deficiency or the early-onset form of ABCC6 Deficiency&#xD;
             (GACI 2) based on clinical, radiological, or biochemical evidence and confirmed by&#xD;
             prior or concurrent genetic testing. The early-onset form of ABCC6 Deficiency is&#xD;
             defined as diagnosis of GACI 2 before 5 years of age for subjects of any age at&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Male or female, birth through adulthood&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. In the opinion of the Investigator, must be willing and able to complete all aspects&#xD;
             of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Agree to provide access to relevant medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals who meet the following exclusion criterion will not be eligible to participate:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. In the opinion of the Investigator and/or Sponsor, presence of any clinically&#xD;
             significant disease (outside of those considered associated with the diagnosis of&#xD;
             ENPP1 Deficiency or the early-onset form of ABCC6 Deficiency [GACI 2]) that precludes&#xD;
             study participation or may confound interpretation of study results, such as an&#xD;
             unrelated bone, mineral, or muscle disease or genetic connective tissue disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Receiving any investigational new drug or device or plans to do so before completion&#xD;
             of participation in the study. Participation in an interventional trial of an approved&#xD;
             drug or device being used in an investigational manner is allowed, depending on review&#xD;
             and approval of the Sponsor&#xD;
