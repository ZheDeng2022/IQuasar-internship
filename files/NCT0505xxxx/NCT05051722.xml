  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching objective of this project is to develop a uterine (endometrial and cervical)&#xD;
      cancer detection test using unique endometrial cancer-specific methylated DNA markers and&#xD;
      high-risk human papilloma virus (HR-HPV) detected in vaginal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal defines Phase II MDM-based cancer detection studies in endometrial cancer and&#xD;
      endometrial hyperplasia with atypia in tampon-collected vaginal fluid. Additionally, it&#xD;
      defines necessary Phase I MDM-based cancer detection and exploratory aims to test novel&#xD;
      cervical cancer MDMs and test the specificity of cancer-specific MDMs among various common&#xD;
      benign gynecologic pathologies.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Detection of endometrial and cervical cancers at an early stage vastly increases the chances&#xD;
      of cure and may also avert morbidity secondary to surgical staging, radiation, and/or&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Despite the great successes of cervical cancer screening, comparable early&#xD;
      detection methods for other gynecologic cancers and their precursors are not available. While&#xD;
      nearly 1.5 million women per year in the United States are evaluated for abnormal uterine&#xD;
      bleeding (AUB) or postmenopausal bleeding (PMB), the most common symptom of endometrial&#xD;
      cancer, most undergo an invasive diagnostic biopsy with the finding of benign etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaginal bleeding is often the only presenting symptom of women ultimately diagnosed with&#xD;
      endometrial cancer (EC) or its precursor lesion, endometrial hyperplasia(EH). More than 90%&#xD;
      of women with EC present with vaginal bleeding. Cervical cancer and cervical dysplasia can&#xD;
      present as intermenstrual bleeding, post-coital bleeding, or other abnormal vaginal bleeding.&#xD;
      However, most women who present with AUB or PMB have a benign etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are approximately 70 million women ≥45 years of age in the United States based on the&#xD;
      most recent census data. Between 4-11% of women will be worked up for perimenopausal AUB or&#xD;
      PMB in their lifetime. As only 5-10% of those women will have an EC or EH, there is a great&#xD;
      clinical need for a less invasive clinical diagnostic test that can reliably distinguish&#xD;
      between benign uterine bleeding and bleeding associated with an underlying endometrial&#xD;
      cancer, cervical cancer, or a precursor lesion.&#xD;

    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Complete a phase II biomarker development study of a methylated DNA marker (MDM)-based endometrial cancer detection test performed on vaginal fluid collected via intravaginal tampon. The phase II aspect of this biomarker development study will narrow the number of endometrial cancer MDMs within the biomarker panel in order to optimize the next phase of test development.</description>

    <measure>Using 95% specificity cutoffs of the final tampon-based MDM EC panel, determine the false positive rate among women undergoing surgical removal of common benign gynecologic pathology</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>As part of this biomarker test development, understanding whether common non-cancerous uterine or gynecologic conditions may also lead to the finding of currently apparent endometrial cancer-specific MDMs in vaginal fluid is critical in determining specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the test.</description>
