  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of nemolizumab&#xD;
      administered in combination with topical background therapy (topical corticosteroids [TCS]&#xD;
      with or without topical calcineurin inhibitors [TCI]) in adult participants with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) who are not adequately controlled with or are not&#xD;
      advised to use oral cyclosporine A (CsA) for medical reasons. The secondary objective is to&#xD;
      investigate the safety of nemolizumab in adult participants with moderate-to-severe AD who&#xD;
      are not adequately controlled with or are not advised to use oral CsA for medical reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in up to 70 different locations across Europe.&#xD;

    <description>EASI assesses severity and extent of AD signs through a composite score of erythema, induration/population, excoriation, and lichenification. The severity will be assessed on a scale of 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) for each of the 4 body areas: head/neck, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs, with half points allowed. The EASI score can range from 0 to 72 with higher scores representing greater severity of atopic dermatitis.</description>
