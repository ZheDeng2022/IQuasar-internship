  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reconstructive surgery of the clitoris is part of the care offered during a process of care&#xD;
      of women victims of MSF. It consists in reconstituting a clitoral neogland after removal of&#xD;
      the vulvar excisional scar and recovery of the remaining clitoris. Studies that have&#xD;
      monitoring the implementation of this surgery show that it improves the well-being of the&#xD;
      patients, brings benefits anatomically, sexual health, personal development, and in the long&#xD;
      term decreases chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently the standard method used in the usual care of the patient is: general anesthesia&#xD;
      with an intravenous analgesic protocol then oral without anesthesia regional loco The&#xD;
      pudendal block that the investigators want to evaluate in this research, is a technique that&#xD;
      has made proven in several types of surgery, associated with very few complications and&#xD;
      easily reproducible.&#xD;

      research, is a technique that has made proven in several types of surgery, associated with&#xD;
      very few complications and easily reproducible. The human clitoris is the most sensitive&#xD;
      organ in the human body, with over 8000 endings nervous. All these endings come from the&#xD;
      pudendal nerve, itself most often of nerve roots S3. The main hypothesis is that a bilateral&#xD;
      anesthetic block of this nerve would reduce postoperative pain in clitoral surgery&#xD;
