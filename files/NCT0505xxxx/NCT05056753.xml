  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized, double-blind, controlled, parallel group study (conducted over&#xD;
      12-months), enrollment is expected of up to 60 subjects (30 men and 30 women) ages 18+ who&#xD;
      are currently going through withdrawal of OUD and being treated at local substance abuse&#xD;
      clinics. The study visits will include screening, baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4, with both&#xD;
      safety and efficacy assessments.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximate time commitment is 30 minutes / day, for 5 days / week, in testing effects of&#xD;
      specialized 'massage' chair for a period of 4 weeks (up to total 20 treatment periods). Only&#xD;
      about 20 minutes time is in the test chair, and the rest is setup time and completing&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upon arrival to the clinic for treatment, some short questions are asked.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant is seated in a HWBV chair device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A clip is attached to one finger to track heart rate and skin response to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After relaxing for about 5 minutes, the HWBV chair actuated for 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The finger attachment is disconnected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-treatment, some more survey questions conclude the session.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Participants will spend approx 30 min/day for 5 days/week in HWBV testing for the 4-week treatment period at the treatment clinic. Eligible participants who consent to the study are screened and randomized to either the active or control group, using the vibration device with controller that has 2 unmarked presets as to which treatment protocol they represent (HWBV or monotonic vibration). Neither the study coordinator, technician, nor site investigator will know which setting is the active or control. The device technician (blinded to the treatment hypothesis) will help participants set up the device and provide assistance. To avoid unblinding, device technician will be segregated from all study personnel and data. He/she will also be instructed not to comment to the patients on any aspects of the device and defer study related questions to the study staff. A blinded coordinator / staff member will conduct study assessments at baseline, weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4, visits.</masking_description>

    <description>The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) measures severity of anxiety, with 14 domains and is administered by a clinician. Severity is rated from 0 - 4 on each question, with a total possible of 56 points. A higher score is reflects worse severity</description>

    <description>The Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) is an 11-item scale designed to rate common signs and symptoms of opiate withdrawal to show overall severity of addiction. Each question ranks severity from 0-4 or 5, depending on the question. A higher score indicates greater severity. The COWS to be administered by a clinician</description>

    <description>The HWBV chair consists of a custom-made saddle-seat type of chair. The vibration actuators are embedded into the underside design of the chair. The base contains two vibrators, one for each side of the chair, and the chair is split in half vertically so that the vibrating actuators are able to send a harmonic vibration at alternating frequencies, upwards through each side of the chair. The HWBV system is considered a non-significant and non-substantial risk device.</description>

    <description>The Control device is identical in construction to the Active device. The vibration mode, however, is a significantly different setting than that used by the Active version, so that the mechanoreceptors in the cervical spine are not effectively stimulated.</description>
