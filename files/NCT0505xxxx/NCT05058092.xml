  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a chronic and complex condition with symptoms that have a strong impact of&#xD;
      patients' quality of life, including musculoskeletal pain, insomnia, fatigue, and stiffness.&#xD;
      These symptoms are due to a dysfunction of the central nervous system, namely increased&#xD;
      sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic levels of activity, and a deficit in endogenous&#xD;
      pain inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remedee Labs is developing a unique technology using millimeter waves to stimulate&#xD;
      subcutaneous nerve receptors of the wrist, sending a message to the brain, which in turn&#xD;
      releases endorphins. These endorphins induce a hypoalgesic effect and activate the&#xD;
      parasympathetic nervous system, which reduces pain, stress, and improves sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Remedee Solution evaluated in this study is a wristband designed to deliver millimeter&#xD;
      wave, a mobile application that allows the patient to follow his treatment sessions and a&#xD;
      personalized support which aims to improve patient adherence to the technology and to&#xD;
      increase compliance and effectiveness of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that regular use of the Remedee Solution for three months&#xD;
      improves the quality of life of fibromyalgia patients.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of patients who significantly improve their fibromyalgia-specific quality of life on the FIQ questionnaire between the inclusion visit at D0 and the 3-month visit (M3).</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>A decrease in FIQ score ≥ 14% is considered clinically meaningful (Bennett et al., 2009)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evolution of the quality of sleep between D0 and M3 on the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The score of the PSQI questionnaire is between 0 and 21. The higher score (21) means the worse quality of sleep.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evolution between D0 and M3 of the average pain score over the week on a Visual Analogic Scale (VAS).</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>

    <measure>Evolution between D0 and M3 of anxiety and depression on the Hospital and Anxiety Depression scale (HAD).</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The HAD scale has two dimensions: anxiety score is between 0 and 21 and depression score is between 0 and 21. The higher score means the worse anxiety or depression.&#xD;
To screen for anxiety and depressive symptoms, the following interpretation can be proposed for each of the scores:&#xD;
&lt;7 : no symptomatology&#xD;
8 to 10: doubtful symptomatology&#xD;
&gt;11 : definite symptomatology.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evolution between D0 and M3 of fatigue between the two groups on the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory questionnaire (MFI20)</measure>

    <description>The MFI is a 20-item scale designed to evaluate five dimensions of fatigue: general fatigue, physical fatigue, reduced motivation, reduced activity, and mental fatigue.&#xD;
The score of each dimension is between 4 and 20. Higher score correspond with more acute levels of fatigue.</description>
