  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic is currently a priority for health services&#xD;
      worldwide. Unlike the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epidemic in&#xD;
      2012, the COVID-19 shows specific alterations in the white blood cell count, accentuated in&#xD;
      severe cases, and with respiratory failure. Among the most relevant data are both&#xD;
      lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and eosinopenia. The Neutrophil Lymphocyte Index has been&#xD;
      beneficial in the evaluation of infectious respiratory processes, showing a sensitivity&#xD;
      similar to scales such as CURB65 (Confusion, Uremia, Respiratory rate, BP, age ≥ 65 years).&#xD;
      Because COVID-19 infection shows alterations in the blood cell ratio, these indices may be&#xD;
      useful in evaluating patients with COVID-19 infection.&#xD;

      The hematological alterations in patients with COVID-19 divided into two aspects: the main&#xD;
      ones, the global leukocyte count, and the individual counts. Most of the information about&#xD;
      the behavior of blood counts come from cases attended in Wuhan, China. At the Zhongnan&#xD;
      Hospital in Hubei Province, identified that the lymphocyte count was lower in critically ill&#xD;
      patients. At the same time, the leukocyte counts were higher in deaths associated with&#xD;
      COVID-19, this elevation being mainly of neutrophils. The lymphopenia is also a constant data&#xD;
      in COVID-19 (47.4%), especially in cases that entered the Intensive Care Unit. As in&#xD;
      community pneumonia, severe lymphopenia has associated with a high risk of death. A&#xD;
      relationship between neutrophils and lymphocytes is called the Neutrophil-Lymphocyte index.&#xD;
      This index is especially useful for predicting respiratory complications, such as for&#xD;
      COVID-19, where mortality ranges from 2-9% compared to the 2012 epidemic (10%) or Middle East&#xD;
      Respiratory Syndrome (37%). In Mexico, there is a high prevalence of chronic diseases that&#xD;
      increase the risk of COVID-19 infection. This study's main objective is to identify the&#xD;
      association of blood abnormalities on respiratory complications associated with COVID-19&#xD;
      infection. All data were obtained from the clinical records of patients treated by COVID-19.&#xD;
