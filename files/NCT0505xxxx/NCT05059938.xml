  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is studying whether patients who use MyFitnessPal as an aid to weight loss have&#xD;
      more success than patients who are only given traditional medical guidance from the patient's&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be given a survey determining the patient's eligibility to be part of the&#xD;
      study. Based on the results patients will be consented and then randomized into two arms. The&#xD;
      intervention group will download MyFitnessPal onto the patient's smartphone and given&#xD;
      guidance on how to use the application in order to help with weight loss. The control group&#xD;
      will receive traditional weight loss counseling from the physician. Both groups will have&#xD;
      measurement recorded for weight, blood pressure, and waist circumference at the patient's&#xD;
      initial visit. All patients will be asked to return to the clinic at no cost to the patient&#xD;
      to have measurements recorded for the patient's weight, blood pressure, and waist&#xD;
      circumference at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after the patient's initial visit. At the&#xD;
      conclusion of the study, patients who were in the intervention group will be asked to take a&#xD;
      final survey regarding the patient's use of the MyFitnessPal application.&#xD;
