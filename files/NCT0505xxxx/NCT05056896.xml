  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug intervention as a possible chemoprevention strategy&#xD;
      for colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The name of the study intervention involved in this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low Dose Aspirin&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial to measure&#xD;
      the effects of daily low-dose (81 mg/day) aspirin on tissue, urine, plasma, and stool&#xD;
      biomarkers associated with colorectal cancer with a focus on the effect of age. It is a&#xD;
      direct extension of an earlier study: ASPIRED trial NCT02394769&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aspirin is part of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) family, which are drugs&#xD;
      routinely used for their pain-killing (analgesic), fever-reducing (antipyretic), or&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory properties. Most NSAIDs are available as over-the-counter formulations.&#xD;
      Substantial evidence has conclusively demonstrated that aspirin reduces the risk of&#xD;
      colorectal polyps and cancer, yet there remains uncertainty surrounding its mode of action.&#xD;
      Aspirin may prevent colorectal cancer through multiple interrelated biological mechanisms&#xD;
      including the reduction of chronic inflammation, a known risk factor for colorectal cancer.&#xD;
      Aspirin has been shown to directly affect prostaglandins, a class of biologic molecules that&#xD;
      play important roles in controlling the normal inflammatory responses within your body. The&#xD;
      exact mechanism by which aspirin acts to prevent colorectal cancer is still unknown.This&#xD;
      study is looking at the mechanisms of aspirin's anti-cancer effect, which may lead to the&#xD;
      discovery of novel specific characteristics (markers) that can be used to select patients for&#xD;
      aspirin treatment. the study will also look at the effect age may have on these mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment and&#xD;
      scheduling two clinical research visits immediately before and after intervention with the&#xD;
      study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized into two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A: Daily Placebo (no aspirin) for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B: Daily low dose aspirin (81 mg/day) for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be contacted periodically after the study (no more than 1- 2 times annually)&#xD;
      for up to 10 years to follow-up on additional information including any continued aspirin use&#xD;
      or follow-up colonoscopy results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 160 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is supporting&#xD;
      this research study by providing funding for the research study.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have undergone screening or surveillance colonoscopy with removal of&#xD;
             at least one adenoma within the last 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years and less than 55 years or greater than or equal&#xD;
             to 65 years at the time of enrollment This study will only include adult participants&#xD;
             because colorectal carcinogenesis in children is more likely to be related to a cancer&#xD;
             predisposition syndrome with distinct biological mechanisms compared with sporadic&#xD;
             colorectal cancer in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not currently taking aspirin (any dose) within the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of aspirin on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration&#xD;
             of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while she is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) at any dose at&#xD;
             least three times a week during the two months prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, liver or kidney disease, bleeding diathesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any prior diagnosis of gastrointestinal cancer (including esophageal, small intestine,&#xD;
             colon, pancreatic), or any diagnosis of other cancers (with the exception of&#xD;
             non-melanoma skin) in which there has been any active treatment within the last three&#xD;
             years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to aspirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known diagnosis of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) or Hereditary Non-Polyposis&#xD;
             Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC, Lynch Syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any adenoma that was not completely removed during previous colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of aspirin intolerance, bleeding diathesis, peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal&#xD;
             bleed, endoscopic complications, or contraindication to colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability or unwillingness to abstain from non-protocol use of aspirin or NSAIDs or to&#xD;
             provide blood, urine, or stool samples or colon biopsies during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because aspirin&#xD;
             is an FDA Category D agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient&#xD;
             effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing&#xD;
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with aspirin, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with aspirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must be able to swallow pills.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is taking any anticoagulant agent (e.g. warfarin) or antiplatelet agent&#xD;
             (e.g. clopidogrel).&#xD;
