  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease affecting young adults. Impaired balance,&#xD;
      walking, reduced physical activity and participation in employment are common, however, less&#xD;
      integrated in the health care. The researchers have developed a multidisciplinary&#xD;
      intervention and pathway delivered across health care levels targeting the promotion of&#xD;
      balance, walking, physical activity and participation in employment. The research team will&#xD;
      perform a pilot feasibility Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) and interviews to investigate&#xD;
      the feasibility of the new intervention compared to a standard care for individuals with&#xD;
      lower levels of disability.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study addresses core elements in the health services for individuals with MS,&#xD;
      constituting approximately 11000 in Norway. The two-armed pilot feasibility-RCT will be&#xD;
      performed across the MS-outpatient (MS-OP) clinic, Nordland Hospital Trust, Bodø (NLSH), and&#xD;
      in two surrounding municipalities, including 30 employed participants who will be followed&#xD;
      for 10-weeks. The new intervention and pathway, CoreDISTparticipation, builds on&#xD;
      GroupCoreDIST, which is previously found effective short and long term compared to standard&#xD;
      care. CoreDISTparticipation consists of three phases: a) at the MS-OP clinic, in addition to&#xD;
      the regular consultations, the patient will have a structured digital conversation with the&#xD;
      MS-nurse addressing work related issues and a session with a physiotherapist exploring&#xD;
      possibilities for change in balance and walking; b) in the municipality, a physiotherapist&#xD;
      will continue exploration of improvements, followed by four weeks of GroupCoreDIST for 60&#xD;
      minutes, 2 times per week supplemented with home exercise programs focusing on balance,&#xD;
      walking and physical activity. The participants will have access to exercise programs on&#xD;
      videos through an open website at Nord University to digitally support home training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To promote participation in employment, a structured digital meeting between each patient,&#xD;
      the MS-nurse, the patient's employer, and the physiotherapist (who leads the group trainings)&#xD;
      will take place in phase b; followed by phase c) which include four weeks of outdoor group&#xD;
      based exercises and physical activity led by a physiotherapist, for 60 minutes, 2 times per&#xD;
      week supplemented with the same home exercise programs as in phase b.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of employment and physical activity will be conducted using an evaluation form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will receive usual consultations at the MS-OP clinic, as well as a session&#xD;
      with a physiotherapist at the MS-OP clinic, exploring possibilities for change in balance and&#xD;
      walking. In the municipality the control group will follow standard care (their usual&#xD;
      follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will examine feasibility, preliminary between-group differences regarding&#xD;
      balance, walking, physical activity level, health related quality of life and barriers in&#xD;
      employment, as well as the users' experiences with participation in the&#xD;
      CoreDISTparticipation.&#xD;
