  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on plasma and milk concentrations, a PopPK model will be performed (i) to document the&#xD;
      average and individual exposure to amoxicillin in milk, (ii) to identify the factors&#xD;
      explaining the inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability and (iii) to determine the daily&#xD;
      dose ingested by the infant and its variability for different dosage regimens applied to the&#xD;
      mother. The secondary objectives are to monitor (i) predefined adverse reactions in infants&#xD;
      and (ii) the impact on milk production.&#xD;

      This study will complement the clinical data on amoxicillin in breastfed new-borns&#xD;
      considering that current knowledge in terms of authorized drugs use during breastfeeding is&#xD;
      not sufficient to guarantee the child absence of exposure, even minimal. As a consequence,&#xD;
      this lack of certainties leads to premature discontinuation of breastfeeding, well known to&#xD;
      be beneficial for the breastfed new-borns. Amoxicillin, prescribed alone or with clavulanic&#xD;
      acid at 2 to 3g per day for 7 days, including in lactating women, is mainly used to treat&#xD;
      β-hemolytic strep throat, infections of the genitourinary tract as well as ear, nose and&#xD;
      throat infections.&#xD;
