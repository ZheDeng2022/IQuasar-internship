      This is a national, multicenter, phase II clinical trial to evaluate the potential benefit of&#xD;
      pre-transplant consolidation and post-transplant maintenance with navitoclax and venetoclax&#xD;
      in patients with T-ALL, LBL and MPAL T/M in first complete remission designated for&#xD;
      allogeneic transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-transplantation consolidation with venetoclax and navitoclax:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in CR designated for transplantation will be treated with venetoclax 400 mg QD and&#xD;

      Feb 16;candisc.1465.2020. doi: 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-20-1465.) for two 28 day cycles.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite several therapeutic advancements, the outcome of adults with T-cell acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) remains unsatisfactory,&#xD;
      especially in those patients with high-risk disease features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In such high-risk patients, allogenic transplantation is usually recommended, when feasible.&#xD;
      Interventions to increase response and survival are needed for this high-risk subset of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In pre-clinical studies, certain T-cell ALL cell lines were shown to be particularly&#xD;
      sensitive to BCL2 inhibition (Peirs et al, Blood 2014). Recent reports demonstrate that&#xD;
      venetoclax in combination with navitoclax is an effective approach to patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory ALL (Lacayo. ASH 2019. Abstr 285). Venetoclax in combination with&#xD;
      chemotherapy in elderly patients with ALL also demonstrated promising efficacy with&#xD;
      preliminary reasonable safety signals (Jain. ASH 2019. Abstr 3867). We hypothesize that&#xD;
      adding venetoclax and navitoclax as a pre-transplant intervention and as maintenance may&#xD;
      improve post-transplant outcome for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the efficacy of venetoclax in combination with navitoclax consolidation in&#xD;
           newly diagnosed T-ALL patients prior to alloSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the safety and potential benefit of post-transplant venetoclax and&#xD;
           navitoclax maintenance therapy in patients with T-ALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To evaluate the impact of pre-transplant venetoclax/navitoclax consolidation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a national, multicenter, phase II clinical trial to evaluate the potential benefit of&#xD;
      pre-transplant consolidation and post-transplant maintenance with navitoclax and venetoclax&#xD;
      in patients with T-ALL, LBL and MPAL T/M in first complete remission designated for&#xD;
      allogeneic transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-transplantation consolidation with venetoclax and navitoclax:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in CR designated for transplantation will be treated with venetoclax 400 mg QD and&#xD;
      navitoclax 50mg QD according to the RP2D presented by Jabbour et al. (EHA25; S116) for two 28&#xD;
      day cycles. Following 2 cycles re-staging marrow including MRD assessment and imaging as need&#xD;
      will be followed by alloSCT according to local protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-transplantation maintenance with venetoclax and navitoclax:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 90 days from alloSCT patients will be started on venetoclax and navitoclax&#xD;
      maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to lack of data regarding the toxicity of navitoclax and venetoclax in the ALL post&#xD;
      alloSCT maintenance setting a dose escalation scheme based on the BOIN design will be applied&#xD;
      as outlined (TBD) with a maximal dose of venetoclax 400 mg QD and navitoclax 50mg QD&#xD;
      according to the RP2D presented by Jabbour et al. (EHA25; S116).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BOIN design will be based on the cumulative number of subjects who experience a&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) at a particular dose level. Dose escalation decisions will be&#xD;
      based on 3-6 DLT-evaluable subjects at each dose level. At least 6 subjects will be treated&#xD;
      during dose escalation and assessed for safety at what is ultimately used for expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned follow up is durring maintnance every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;
