  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infusion and parenteral nutrition play an important role in the management of neonatal&#xD;
      intensive care patients. Administration of drugs and parenteral nutrition solutions to the&#xD;
      patient is performed via different systems including a catheter and a perfusion system. In&#xD;
      critically ill, high risk neonates, use of these systems is associated with complications&#xD;
      such as infections, interactions between drugs simultaneously infused on the same route&#xD;
      (precipitates, catheter obstruction), less effective treatment due to modified amount of drug&#xD;
      administered compared to expected or to compatibility issues between drugs. Sepsis and&#xD;
      reduction of treatment efficacy can have an impact on survival or subsequent&#xD;
      neurodevelopment. Late onset sepsis is one of the most frequent complications in very&#xD;
      premature infants born before 33 weeks gestational age and most of those infections occur in&#xD;
      infants requiring a perfusion system and an intravenous catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, a new multiperfusion device was developed (Multiline Néo®, Doran, France) to&#xD;
      remove access to the infusion system from the incubator where high temperature and humidity&#xD;
      favour bacterial growth. But also to allow the administration of several drug solutions&#xD;
      simultaneously avoiding contact between drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that the new perfusion system helps to reduce the risk of infections,&#xD;
      without increase in costs.&#xD;
