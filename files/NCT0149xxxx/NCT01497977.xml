      The goal of the study was to assess the impact of soy and red clover derived phytoestrogens&#xD;
      on serum lipids in postmenopausal women. Both soya and red clover have high phytoestrogen&#xD;
      content. Phytoestrogens, a class of estrogenic molecules produced by plants bind to the&#xD;
      estrogen receptor and are capable of producing estrogenic effects. Therefore, our hypothesis&#xD;
      was that they can reduce the levels of serum lipids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: Researchers investigated total cholesterol, cholesterol fractions and&#xD;
      triglycerides in blood, before treatment and in six months periods, throughout 18 months. The&#xD;
      study involved 74 healthy postmenopausal women, divided into three groups. The first group of&#xD;
      23 patients received red clover derived isoflavones, the second one with 26 patients got soy&#xD;
      derived phytoestrogens, while the third, control group with 25 patients, was without&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;

      A classic clinical sample was constructed. A total of 117 consecutive postmenopausal women&#xD;
      who came to us in four months periods due to the postmenopausal symptoms (hot flushes, sleep&#xD;
      disturbances, mood swings and vaginal dryness) were enlisted for the research. Out of them 74&#xD;
      fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were randomized. Randomization process was simple manual&#xD;
      and was done in the way that every woman with the odd randomization number received soya&#xD;
      while those with the even randomization number received red clover derived isoflavones.&#xD;
      However, during the study neither the doctors nor the patients knew what the randomization&#xD;
      was and what the medication was. Women in the control group did not receive any medications&#xD;
      and were only used for comparison. Examinees for this group were randomly selected from&#xD;
      healthy postmenopausal women who had regular colposcopic check-ups during the same period.&#xD;
      Out of 186 such women, 111 fulfilled the inclusion criteria, and every third was recruited&#xD;
      for the study. In such way patients have been randomly divided in three groups (soya - S, red&#xD;
      clover - RC, control - C) consisting of 37 women each. However, 6 women had to be excluded&#xD;
      from soya and 5 from red clover group, as they did not take treatment on regular basis.&#xD;
      Moreover, 7 women from soya, 6 from red clover and 9 from control group were excluded as a&#xD;
      result of developing health problems (hypertension in 11 cases and uterine bleeding in 8&#xD;
      cases and H-SIL in 3 cases). One woman from soya group wanted to start taking hormone&#xD;
      replacement therapy. Three women decided to drop out from the control group. So, finally 23&#xD;
      women from soya group, 26 from red clover and 25 from control group had undergone the study&#xD;
      to the end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women were taking one capsule per day of either soya or red clover derived phytoestrogens,&#xD;
      early in the morning, before meal. The soya daily dose contained 2 isoflavones: genistein&#xD;
      (39mg) and daidzein (1mg), while the red clover capsule consisted of 4 isoflavones: biokain A&#xD;
      (23mg), daidzein (1mg), formononetin (15mg) and genistein (1mg). Each patient was keeping&#xD;
      self-reported daily diary of the therapy administration, symptoms and adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers investigated total cholesterol, cholesterol fractions (LDL, HDL) and&#xD;
      triglycerides, in cubital vein blood of patients, as well as body height and weight for each&#xD;
      subject (out of which Body Mass Index - BMI was calculated by the standard formula). Data&#xD;
      were recorded at the study beginning and 6, 12 and 18 months after the treatment&#xD;
      commencement. Standard tests for lipid level evaluation were carried out on Olympus AU 400&#xD;
      automatic analyzer with referral rates for triglycerides from 0,61 to 2,10 mmol/l, total&#xD;
      cholesterol 3,63 - 6,46 mmol/l, HDL 0,75 - 1,99 mmol/l, LDL 1,60 - 4,78 mmol/l.&#xD;
