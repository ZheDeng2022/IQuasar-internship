      In particular circumstances T cells can be an effective treatment for malignant disease, for&#xD;
      example, donor lymphocyte infusions following allogeneic transplants or treatment of EBV&#xD;
      related lymphomas post allograft. However, many common cancers are poorly recognised by the&#xD;
      immune system in part because of a lack of suitable T cell targets and in part because of&#xD;
      defects in antigen presentation by tumours (Garrido, et al 1997). Genetically modified T&#xD;
      cells engineered to express chimeric immune receptors (CIRs) on their cell surface can bypass&#xD;
      the need for MHC presentation and thus represent an attractive approach to immunotherapy&#xD;
      (Gross, et al 1989).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      CD19 is an Immunoglobulin-like 95kDa glycoprotein that is expressed on all B lymphocytes&#xD;
      until differentiation into terminal effector cells (Tedder and Isaacs 1989). It plays an&#xD;
      important role in regulating cell signalling thresholds and also as a costimulatory molecule&#xD;
      for B cell receptor signalling (Tedder, et al 1997). CD19 is present on the majority of&#xD;
      B-CLL, B-ALL, and both low and high grade non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). It is rarely lost&#xD;
      during the process of neoplastic transformation and is not expressed on haematopoetic stem&#xD;
      cells. B cell malignancies are often highly responsive to chemotherapy, with cures possible&#xD;
      in significant numbers of those with high grade tumours. However, improved treatments are&#xD;
      needed for those with low grade tumours and those with high grade tumours who relapse after&#xD;
      conventional therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years the introduction of Rituximab, a CD20 monoclonal antibody, into clinical&#xD;
      practice has increased the options available for the treatment of NHL (Maloney, et al 1994).&#xD;
      The success of Rituximab and other monoclonal antibodies has demonstrated that B cell&#xD;
      malignancies may be particularly suitable as a target for immunotherapy. However, there are&#xD;
      number of potential advantages of T cells engineered to express a CIR over monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody therapies. Firstly, the possibility of in vivo T cell persistence and expansion may&#xD;
      enable stable expression of the CIR over a prolonged period of time (Walker, et al 2000).&#xD;
      Secondly, homing to the tumour site may mean that T cells need not rely on diffusion to&#xD;
      achieve localisation (Balkwill 2004, Mitsuyasu, et al 2000) and thirdly following tumour&#xD;
      recognition T cells can produce cytokines that may recruit and activate other effector cells.&#xD;
      An alternative to CIR engineered T cells is the generation of peptide specific T cells.&#xD;
      Lymphoma models suggest these can be effective (Armstrong, et al 2002, Armstrong, et al&#xD;
      2004), but to produce clinically applicable numbers of T cells is technically demanding and&#xD;
      there is a lack of generic peptide target antigens in lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One potential problem in the use of CIR engineered T cells in general is that tumour&#xD;
      associated antigens are frequently expressed at low levels on normal tissues, thus providing&#xD;
      the potential for autoimmunity. Targeting B cell malignancies with CD19 specific T cells is&#xD;
      attractive because whilst CD19 is expressed on B cells and the majority of B cell&#xD;
      malignancies it is not expressed on any other cell type. It is clear from clinical use of&#xD;
      anti-CD20 antibodies that prolonged depletion of B cells (&gt;6 months) is safe (Plosker and&#xD;
      Figgitt 2003) and that even in patients with hereditary B cell deficiency immunoglobulin&#xD;
      infusion restores normal health in most patients (Ochs and Smith 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators have therefore propose a clinical trial using T cells expressing a CD19&#xD;
      targeting CIR by retroviral transduction of the CIR into activated T cells in order to target&#xD;
      B cell malignancies.&#xD;
