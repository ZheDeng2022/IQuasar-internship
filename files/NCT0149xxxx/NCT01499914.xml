    <textblock>
      Multicenter prospective cohort of approximately 1000 cystic fibrosis patients followed in the&#xD;
      Ile de France during the 2009-2010 influenza season with the main objective to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of antiviral vaccination (H1N1). All subjects will be included, without&#xD;
      excluding factor. In particular populations at risk are additional infants 6 to 23 months,&#xD;
      pregnant women and lung transplant will also be included. These people will be vaccinated&#xD;
      with un-adjuvanted vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If flu symptoms until the results of PCR to confirm or refute the diagnosis of influenza,&#xD;
      oseltamivir is administered in accordance with official recommendations and based on the&#xD;
      results of the pharmacokinetic study.&#xD;

      Methodology :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized. Multicenter prospective cohort of approximately 1000&#xD;
      CF patients followed in the Ile de France during the 2009-2010 influenza season&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients with CF followed in Ile de France and the two transplant centers (IDF&#xD;
           service of Thoracic Surgery at the European Hospital Georges Pompidou and Foch) will be&#xD;
           included as much as possible, about 1000 patients (about 600 children).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  200 of them (100 children at least 6 months, 100 adults) participate in the study of&#xD;
           immunogenicity after vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 patients over 12 years will realize the pharmacokinetic study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product under consideration :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Influenza vaccine (H1N1) v pandemic will be administered. It will mainly adjuvanted vaccine&#xD;
      but also the un-adjuvanted vaccine in subjects at risk: infants 6 to 23 months, pregnant&#xD;
      women, transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If flu symptoms until the results of PCR to confirm or refute the diagnosis of influenza,&#xD;
      oseltamivir is administered in accordance with official recommendations and based on the&#xD;
      results of the pharmacokinetic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint :vaccine efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine vaccine efficacy VE on susceptibility, the measure used is the complement to 1&#xD;
      of the Hazard Ratio (HR hazard ratio) for the appearance of an influenza episode (Halloran,&#xD;
      AJE, 1997). The existence of an effective vaccine will be tested by comparing HR 1. Using the&#xD;
      HR measurement is preferred to that using the ratio of cumulative incidence rates among&#xD;
      vaccinated than unvaccinated because of a change in the number of groups vaccinated /&#xD;
      unvaccinated can occur over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, the immunization schedule now includes two doses given at 3 weeks / 1 month apart,&#xD;
      even if it appears that the antibody response can be achieved in the first half after the&#xD;
      first dose. It is possible that some subjects may be infected before the first dose after the&#xD;
      first but before the second, or after receiving the full presentation. On the other hand, the&#xD;
      date of infection could be similar to that of vaccination, a time when efficiency is not&#xD;
      optimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the primary analysis, individuals will be considered unvaccinated if they do not receive&#xD;
      vaccination and during 15 days of initial vaccination. For the latter, a time-dependent&#xD;
      variable representing the immunization status will take into account their relative&#xD;
      contribution to periods vaccinated / unvaccinated. The analysis will be stratified by age&#xD;
      groups corresponding to the quartiles of the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In secondary analysis, the investigators vary the initial term conferring protection, the&#xD;
      investigators also consider only those who received the full vaccination schedule, it will&#xD;
      also determine the impact of using the cumulative incidence rate in the vaccinated population&#xD;
      initially and ultimately vaccinated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Membership in the vaccination will be measured as a proportion, together with a confidence&#xD;
      interval 95%, as well as the incidence of clinical influenza in vaccinated and unvaccinated&#xD;
      cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tolerance of pandemic influenza vaccine (H1N1) v will be evaluated by binomial confidence&#xD;
      intervals. Individual factors leading to the decision of vaccination and immunization events&#xD;
      will be determined by logistic regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical expression is described by the percentages of symptom onset. An analysis of the&#xD;
      frequency of symptoms in groups of vaccination will be carried out. Factors related to the&#xD;
      presence of symptoms will be sought using logistic regression. The percentage of serious&#xD;
      forms will be measured. Vaccine efficacy against serious will be measured using techniques&#xD;
      described by causal analysis Hudgens &amp; Halloran.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The longitudinal lung function of patients enrolled will be analyzed through the data&#xD;
      provided in the patient tracking software in place in services. A mixed effects linear model&#xD;
      will be used to analyze changes in respiratory function (including FEV) and test whether the&#xD;
      infection is accompanied by a change in the current level of functioning or a change in the&#xD;
      evolution Compared to the situation pre-infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pan-genomic analysis will evaluate SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) associated with&#xD;
      the presence of (1) a prolonged infection, (2) of immunoprotection, (3) infection, (4) of a&#xD;
      severe infection. Some patients, corresponding to extreme forms of the disease (severe and&#xD;
      not severe) has been genotyped, and the whole cohort will be genotyped at term. Each patient&#xD;
      has been genotyped about 300,000 SNPs. It is generally accepted that an association in this&#xD;
      case is &quot;genomically significant&quot; when the significance level is smaller than 10-7. Actual&#xD;
      calculations made in the project analysis of modifier genes Pr Clément, which resulted in the&#xD;
      cohort, showed that in the comparison of two cohorts of 500 subjects, it was possible to&#xD;
      obtain a significant result genomically a difference of about 20% between frequencies of&#xD;
      genotypes for SNPs not rare (&gt; 5%), with a risk factor (FDR) of approximately 10%. For the&#xD;
      analysis of two groups of 150 subjects, under the same conditions, the FDR, however, was&#xD;
      close to 1. The staff here will be compared between the two terminals, and often unbalanced.&#xD;
      It is hoped to highlight the differences in genotype frequency, if any, of the order of 20%&#xD;
      or more, in the case of a comparison involving the entire cohort, but the investigators will&#xD;
      probably find that imbalances are larger (&gt; 50%) in the analysis of smaller subgroups. In any&#xD;
      case, it will be important to try and validate this information through independent study.&#xD;
