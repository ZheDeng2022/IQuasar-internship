    <textblock>
      Preliminary research has shown that a vaginal gel containing the antiretroviral (ARV) drug&#xD;
      tenofovir may reduce the risk of HIV infection in women when used near the time of sexual&#xD;
      intercourse. This study will evaluate the safety of 1% tenofovir gel in HIV-uninfected&#xD;
      pregnant women and their newborns when the gel is used once a day for a period of 28 days at&#xD;
      a designated time during pregnancy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women often maintain sexual activity, and research has shown that they may have a&#xD;
      greater risk of acquiring HIV infection during pregnancy. Preliminary research has suggested&#xD;
      that tenofovir 1% gel, a vaginal microbicide, may reduce the risk of HIV infection for women&#xD;
      when it is applied at the time of sexual intercourse. However, safety data on the use of&#xD;
      tenofovir 1% gel during pregnancy are limited. This study will enroll pregnant women who will&#xD;
      use tenofovir 1% gel on a daily basis for 28 consecutive days during their pregnancy, which&#xD;
      is a longer period of use than has been studied previously. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety of 1% tenofovir gel in HIV-uninfected pregnant women when used during the&#xD;
      late first trimester and second trimester of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be healthy, HIV-uninfected pregnant women and will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      use either 1% tenofovir gel or placebo gel once a day for 28 days or until delivery,&#xD;
      whichever comes first. Participants will be further divided into four groups of varying&#xD;
      gestational age ranges. These groups will be filled sequentially, starting with the later&#xD;
      gestational ages (closer to the time of delivery) group first. Once the safety for this group&#xD;
      is confirmed, groups of participants with earlier gestational ages will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of participation in this study will vary depending on gestational age at the time of&#xD;
      enrollment, but each participant will have visits at study entry; Days 7, 14, and 28; 2 weeks&#xD;
      after the last dose of the assigned gel; and once every 4 weeks until delivery. Participants&#xD;
      who have used the gel within 24 hours of arriving at the hospital for delivery also will have&#xD;
      a delivery visit. At most visits, participants will give a medical history; undergo blood and&#xD;
      urine collection; and have a physical exam, including obstetric (OB) abdominal and pelvic&#xD;
      exams. Participants also will report adverse events and complete an adherence assessment. If&#xD;
      a participant has a delivery visit, blood will be collected from the umbilical cord and&#xD;
      delivery and infant information will be collected. All participants will attend a follow-up&#xD;
      study visit 30 days after delivery.&#xD;
