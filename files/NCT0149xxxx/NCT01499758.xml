    <textblock>
      This study assessed the relative bioavailability of 80 mg Atorvastatin Calcium Tablets&#xD;
      (containing atorvastatin calcium equivalent to 80 mg atorvastatin) manufactured by OHM&#xD;
      Laboratories, Inc., USA (A subsidiary of Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals., USA) compared to that of&#xD;
      80 mg LIPITOR® Tablets (containing atorvastatin calcium equivalent to 80 mg atorvastatin)&#xD;
      distributed by Parke Davis, Division of Pfizer Inc., USA following a single oral dose (1 x 80&#xD;
      mg tablet) in healthy adult subjects when administered under fasting conditions.&#xD;

      This was an open-label, balanced, randomized, two-period, two-treatment, two-sequence,&#xD;
      single-dose crossover bioequivalence study under fasting conditions. The total duration of&#xD;
      the study, screening through study exit, was approximately 8 weeks with at least a 14-day&#xD;
      washout period between doses. At study check-in, the subjects reported to the clinical site&#xD;
      at least 36 hours prior to Day 1 dosing and were required to stay for 24 hours after Day 1&#xD;
      dosing. Blood sample collections were obtained within 90 minutes prior to dosing (0 hour) and&#xD;
      after dose administration at 0.167, 0.25, 0.333, 0.417, 0.5, 0.583, 0.667, 0.833, 1, 1.25,&#xD;
      1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 96 hours. A total&#xD;
      of 30 blood samples were collected per study period for a total of 60 samples or 180 mL total&#xD;
      volume.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Informed of the nature of the study, had agreed to, and was able to read, review, and&#xD;
             sign the informed consent document prior to Period I dosing. The informed consent&#xD;
             document was written in English, therefore the volunteer must have had the ability to&#xD;
             read and communicate in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Completed the screening process within 4 weeks prior to Period I dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Healthy male or female, 18 years of age or older at the time of dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Body mass index (BMI) between 18 - 32 kg/m2, inclusive, and weighed at least 110 lbs.&#xD;

             but not limited to an evaluation of the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory,&#xD;
             and central nervous systems), vital sign assessments, 12-lead ECG, clinical laboratory&#xD;
             assessments, and by general observations. Any abnormalities/deviations from the&#xD;
             acceptable range that might have been considered clinically relevant by the study&#xD;
             physician or investigator were evaluated as individual cases, documented in study&#xD;
             files, and agreed upon by the principal investigator (or sub-investigator) prior to&#xD;

             dosing. All subjects were to be advised not to donate plasma for four weeks after&#xD;
