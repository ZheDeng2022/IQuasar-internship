  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to estimate the impact of the protein content of breastmilk at the&#xD;
      end of hospitalization of the preterm newborn, on the neurodevelopment at 2 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect a difference of at least 5 points of Development Quotient (DQ) when&#xD;
      comparing extreme terciles of the protein content of breastmilk at the end of&#xD;
      hospitalization.&#xD;
