      You are invited to participate in a research study for the development of an artificial&#xD;
      pancreas. An artificial pancreas uses a program which takes information from a continuous&#xD;
      blood glucose monitor and uses that information to tell an insulin infusion pump how much&#xD;
      insulin to deliver. The primary purpose of this study is to gain experience with insulin&#xD;
      delivery algorithms or programs program (algorithm) provides the best regulation of glucose&#xD;
      levels so that there are no severe low blood glucose reactions and blood glucose levels are&#xD;
      generally between 70 to 180 mg/dl.&#xD;

      You are invited to participate in a research study for the development of an artificial&#xD;
      pancreas. An artificial pancreas uses a program which takes information from a continuous&#xD;
      blood glucose monitor and uses that information to tell an insulin infusion pump how much&#xD;
      insulin to deliver. The primary purpose of this study is to gain experience with insulin&#xD;
      delivery algorithms or programs program (algorithm) provides the best regulation of glucose&#xD;
      levels so that there are no severe low blood glucose reactions and blood glucose levels are&#xD;
      generally between 70 to 180 mg/dl. If the system is working properly, you would not need to&#xD;
      enter the amount of food you were eating, give an insulin bolus, or change your basal rates&#xD;
      while wearing the device. You would need to periodically check to be sure the continuous&#xD;
      glucose sensor was functioning properly and you would need to respond to alarms that might&#xD;
      occur if your blood glucose was too high, too low, or the glucose sensor or pump were not&#xD;
      working well. In addition to this the investigators will also gain experience with insulin&#xD;
      delivery algorithms to minimize the number of glucose readings which are above or below&#xD;
      target. It is our intention to modify the algorithms during these studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators plan to use a commercially available insulin infusion pump&#xD;
      (OmniPod) to deliver lispro (Humalog) insulin. The investigators will use Navigator&#xD;
      continuous glucose sensors both to monitor glucose levels (sensor 1) and provide the glucose&#xD;
      concentration for the closed loop algorithm (sensor 2). The signal from the second Navigator&#xD;
      will be sent by serial cable to a computer which will be at the patient's bedside. A control&#xD;
      algorithm will reside on the computer, and the amount of insulin to be delivered will be&#xD;
      transmitted to the OmniPod Personal Device Manager which will then send a radiofrequency (rf)&#xD;
      signal to the Omnipod pump residing on the subject. A health care provider will be in&#xD;
      attendance and monitoring discrete blood glucose levels (YSI, GlucoScout, or HemoCue&#xD;
      measurements) at least every 30 minutes. While the Navigator and Omnipod are commercially&#xD;
      available they will be used in this study as part of an investigational system while you are&#xD;
      in the hospital, an investigational system is one that is not approved for use by the FDA.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligibility&#xD;

          1. Clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and using daily insulin therapy for at least one&#xD;
             year. The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes is based on the investigator's judgment;&#xD;
             Cpeptide level and antibody determinations are not needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age 21 years to less than 45.0 years&#xD;
