  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Female urinary incontinence (UI) can be caused by pure stress UI (SUI), pure urgency UI (UUI)&#xD;
      and mixed SUI and UUI (MUI). Clinically it might not be that easy to separate MUI and SUI.&#xD;
      Patients might perceive urgency when they have an incompetent urethra and a full bladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinary tract nerve growth factor (NGF)is produced by bladder urothelium and smooth muscle.&#xD;
      Increased levels of NGF have been reported in the bladder tissue and urine of patients with&#xD;
      overactive bladder (OAB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the urinary levels of NGF differ among women with pure SUI and MUI, then urinary NGF level&#xD;
      might be a biomarker in the differential diagnosis of MUI in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, decreased urinary NGF level was reported in OAB patients of whom the symptoms were&#xD;
      improved. So, we might expect that the remnant OAB symptom including urgency incontinence can&#xD;
      be improved, if the urinary NGF levels decrease after midurethral slings for SUI in MUI&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aimed to explore the value of the urinary NGF as a biomarker for differential diagnosis&#xD;
      and as a prognostic marker for predicting the improvement of OAB symptom after midurethral&#xD;
      slings.&#xD;
