  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the registry is to assess results of combined operative and catheter based&#xD;
      (hybrid procedure) treatment of patients with significant coronary artery disease using&#xD;
      essential clinical and angiographic parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on existing literature we expect the results of coronary artery bypass grafting of the&#xD;
      anterior descendent coronary artery (LAD), segment 1 and 2, using the so-called mammary&#xD;
      artery graft, to be superior to stent treatment of the same artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time a catheter based intervention using balloon, bare metal stents (BMS) or drug&#xD;
      eluting stents (DES) seems to be a better treatment that a saphenous vein graft for other&#xD;
      coronary arteries than the LAD. I.e. the right coronary artery (RCA) and the left circumflex&#xD;
      coronary artery (CX).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we expect a combination of the mentioned surgical and catheter based techniques to&#xD;
      be a better treatment than bypass operation or catheter based intervention alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 150 consecutive patients will be included in the study. The patients will have a&#xD;
      coronary artery narrowing located to the LAD, which can be treated with a mammary graft, and&#xD;
      a stenosis located to other coronary arteries (RCA and CX), which can be treated by balloon&#xD;
      or stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients included in the study will be recruited from patients who are referred to the&#xD;
      Department of Cardiology/Department of Thoracic Surgery, Aarhus University Hospital, Skejby&#xD;
      for treatment of significant coronary artery disease. We will not announce for patients, and&#xD;
      the patients will not receive a honorarium for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 100 patients will be treated i two seances; operation and stent treatment with few&#xD;
      days interval. The last 50 patients will be treated in a hybrid operation room with operation&#xD;
      and stent treatment in the same seance.&#xD;
