      This is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the ACTIVE memory training intervention and&#xD;
      ACTIVE speed of processing training to waitlist, no-contact control conditions. Specific aims&#xD;
      and hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Evaluate the acceptability and usefulness of the ACTIVE memory intervention among&#xD;
      Breast Cancer Survivors (BCS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: BCS assigned to the memory intervention arm will perceive the intervention as&#xD;
      more acceptable and useful than BCS assigned to the attention control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Establish preliminary efficacy of the ACTIVE memory training intervention relative to&#xD;
      the attention control and no-contact control conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Memory training will result in greater memory enhancement immediately post and&#xD;
      2-months post-intervention relative to attention control or no-contact control conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Memory deficits are a prevalent, bothersome, and potentially debilitating symptom for&#xD;
      millions of breast cancer survivors (BCS). Evidence-based treatment is difficult because&#xD;
      there has been little intervention research in this area. Memory training may be a viable&#xD;
      treatment option for BCS in need. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the&#xD;
      acceptability, usefulness, and preliminary efficacy of the memory training intervention from&#xD;
      the Advanced Cognitive Training in Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) trial, the largest controlled trial&#xD;
      of cognitive interventions in the behavioral sciences. The memory training intervention will&#xD;
      be compared to attention control and no-contact control groups. Specific aims are to (1)&#xD;
      evaluate the acceptability and usefulness of the memory intervention in BCS and (2) establish&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of the ACTIVE memory training intervention relative to attention control&#xD;
      and no-contact control conditions. Acceptability and usefulness will be assessed through&#xD;
      self-report. Memory will be assessed through objective neuropsychological tests. A total of&#xD;
      108 eligible BCS will be randomized to memory training, attention control, or no-contact&#xD;
      control. A blinded and trained tester will perform data collection and neuropsychological&#xD;
      testing at three time points: baseline prior to the intervention, immediately&#xD;
      post-intervention, and 2 months post-intervention. Findings will provide information about&#xD;
      the acceptability, usefulness, and preliminary efficacy of the ACTIVE memory training&#xD;
      intervention on memory performance in BCS. Positive results will lead to a larger, full-scale&#xD;
      study to determine efficacy of memory training interventions for BCS. Nursing interventional&#xD;
      research in this area is vital to the development of evidence-based interventions to address&#xD;
      memory deficits in BCS.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. female gender (breast cancer is rare in men);&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. self-reported memory impairment and desire for treatment (to focus on BCS in greatest&#xD;
             need);&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. first diagnosis of non-metastatic breast cancer (to control for multiple treatments or&#xD;
             brain metastases in women with recurrent or metastatic disease);&#xD;

          4. ≥ 1 year post-treatment including surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy (reduce&#xD;
             confounding factors related to acute effects of treatment);32&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. age ≥ 40 years (our prior studies indicate approximately 75% of BCS meet this&#xD;
             criterion and reduce sample variability);&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. post-menopausal (majority are post-menopausal at diagnosis and reduce sample&#xD;
             variability); and&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. able to read, write, understand, and speak English (to ensure informed consent).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women will be excluded if they have other co-morbidities or deficits that would&#xD;
        sufficiently impair performance or inhibit cognitive training including:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. substantial cognitive decline (score &lt; 24 on the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE);33&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. history of stroke, encephalitis, traumatic brain injury, brain surgery, dementia,&#xD;
             Alzheimer disease, or Parkinson disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. cranial radiation therapy or intrathecal therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. current active major depression or substance abuse or history of bipolar disorder,&#xD;
             psychosis, schizophrenia, or learning disability;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. history of or current other cancer except for basal cell skin cancer; or&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. receiving other cognitive training (to avoid exposure to other training).&#xD;
