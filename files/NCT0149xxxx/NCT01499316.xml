  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a condition which refers to the narrowing of the small blood&#xD;
      vessels that supplies blood and oxygen to the heart. It is a common cause of chest-pain&#xD;
      related symptoms and as a result of a 'heart attack'. In most cases, to assess the severity&#xD;
      of the disease is to use coronary angiography, which is a medical imaging technique that uses&#xD;
      contrast (a dye) and x-ray to show the blood-flow supply of the coronary arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimal treatment for patients with symptomatic coronary disease is aggressive medical&#xD;
      therapy. Current guidelines recommend patients with symptomatic CAD and severe disease on&#xD;
      angiography undergo revascularisation therapy, which aims to restore blood flow to blocked&#xD;
      arteries. This can be done by either percutaneous coronary intervention (feeding a small&#xD;
      balloon or other device on a thin tube through blood vessels to the point of blockage and&#xD;
      then inflate the balloon to open the artery), or coronary artery bypass grafting (open-heart&#xD;
      surgery)2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For many symptomatic patients who have only moderate disease on angiography, further&#xD;
      functional testing is required to assess the extent of the blockage. This can be achieved by&#xD;
      placing a pressure wire to the artery of interest, to determine the likelihood that the&#xD;
      blockage impedes oxygen delivery to the heart muscle, known as the Fractional Flow Reserve&#xD;
      (FFR)3. FFR is commonly performed at the Alfred hospital in the assessment of such patients.&#xD;
      During an FFR procedure, further information regarding the health of the small arteries of&#xD;
      the heart can be obtained with the calculation of the index of micro-vascular resistance&#xD;
      (IMR),&#xD;
&#xD;
      Giving oxygen to patients with CAD is a common clinical practice, especially to all patients&#xD;
      in the catheterisation laboratory whose had a 'heart attack' and often administered&#xD;
      concurrently with light sedation during elective procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, however, the safety of routine supplemental oxygen in patients with CAD has been&#xD;
      questioned5. A research study analysed the outcomes of three small randomised studies on&#xD;
      oxygen in patients who experienced a 'heart attack', while suggestive of harm, the findings&#xD;
      of the study remain inconclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may also be deleterious effects of supplemental oxygen, on more stable patients with&#xD;
      CAD, who are not experiencing a 'heart attack'. Supplemental oxygen administered in the&#xD;
      catheterisation laboratory to patients with stable CAD, has been shown to significantly&#xD;
      reduce coronary artery blood flow and increase its resistance6-8. It has also been shown to&#xD;
      reduce cardiac output and effect the relaxation phase of the heart cycle. Based on this data&#xD;
      it is hypothesised that supplemental oxygen may affect FFR in patients with moderate CAD. The&#xD;
      investigators therefore propose to undertake a study of the effects of supplemental oxygen on&#xD;
      FFR in patients with moderate CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients enrolled into the study will be scheduled for an elective normal contrast&#xD;
      diagnostic or interventional procedure as part of their clinically-indicated care. Once a&#xD;
      moderate blockage of the artery has been identified, FFR and IMR will be measured. During the&#xD;
      first phase of the FFR study, the patient will breathe room air and have a blood test to&#xD;
      measure their oxygen level (blood gas). There is a 3 minute washout period, followed by the&#xD;
      second phase, whereby the patient will be given 100% oxygen for 10 minutes and have another&#xD;
      blood gas measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at Alfred Hospital with a total enrollment of 18 subjects. The&#xD;
      estimated time to complete enrollment is 6-10 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected on each patient will include demographics, medical history, vital signs (heart&#xD;
      rate, blood pressure, height, and weight), usage of cardiovascular medications, pathology&#xD;
      results and procedural records. Any adverse events or serious adverse events related to the&#xD;
      study procedure will also be recorded.&#xD;
