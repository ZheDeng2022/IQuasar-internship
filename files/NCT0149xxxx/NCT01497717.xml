  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis - Behcet's disease is a multisystemic chronic relapsing inflammatory disease,&#xD;
      classified among the vasculitides. The clinical manifestations include mucocutaneous lesions,&#xD;
      articular, ocular, vascular, gastrointestinal and/or central nervous system involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aetiology of Behcet's disease is unknown, however. Experimental evidence suggests that&#xD;
      TNF-α may play an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, case reports and small open-short term studies report the efficacy of anti-TNFα&#xD;
      therapy (Infliximab and Etanercept), especially regarding ocular and mucocutaneous&#xD;
      involvement in Behcet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no double blind long term studies on larger number of patients regarding the&#xD;
      efficacy of anti-TNFα, especially Humira in healing arthritis +/- other manifestations of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

      Study Design (including visit schedule, dosing and procedures/methods):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screen visit, 1st visit -treatment initiation, follow-up visits - after 1 month and&#xD;
      afterwards every 8 weeks for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screen visit: informed consent, medical history,inclusion and exclusion criteria, pregnancy&#xD;
      test, vital signs, physical examination, joint evaluation (no. of tender joints, no. of&#xD;
      swollen joints), patient/investigator global disease activity, pain VAS, HAQ, Behcet Disease&#xD;
      Current Activity Forms (BDACF), ECG, PPD and chest X-ray screening for tuberculosis, routine&#xD;
      labs (performed at local HMO as a routine follow-up of the patient treatment with DMARD's):&#xD;
      CBC, blood chemistry, ESR, CRP, urinalysis, HbsAg and AntiHCV, immunology labs (rheumatoid&#xD;
      factor, anti-CCP, anti nuclear antibody - ANA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An induration of greater than 5 mm will be considered a positive PPD reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up visits .: Vital signs, joint evaluation, patient/investigator global disease&#xD;
      activity, pain VAS, HAQ, BDACF, routine labs (performed at local HMO as a routine follow-up&#xD;
      of the patient treatment with DMARD's): CBC, blood chemistry, ESR, CRP, urinalysis, research&#xD;
      blood samples for storage.&#xD;

    <description>Open label pilot trial.&#xD;
The study includes 3 phases :&#xD;
Open label treatment period of 24 weeks.&#xD;
Extension follow -up (3 years): Patients who responded well to study drug and their disease relapsed within the first 12 weeks following study drug interruption will be eligible to receive the study drug for 3 years in order to comply with the Israeli Ministry of Health requirements.&#xD;
Safety follow-up: For patients who withdraw from either the open label treatment period or extension period, for another 24 weeks.</description>
