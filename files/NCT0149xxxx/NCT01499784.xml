  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence (UI) is a very common condition in women, with estimates of prevalence&#xD;
      varying from 10% to 40% in most studies and showing a gradual increase with age. UI is a&#xD;
      serious medical problem that can lead to urinary tract infections, low back pain, respiratory&#xD;
      disorders, pressure sores, and an increased risk of falls. It also leads to social problems,&#xD;
      creating embarrassment and negative self-perception for those who suffer from it. Women with&#xD;
      urinary incontinence find themselves isolated and relatively inactive. A wide range of&#xD;
      treatments has been used in the management of women's UI, including conservative&#xD;
      interventions, pharmaceutical intervention, and surgery. A Cochrane Review from 2008 stated&#xD;
      that pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is better than no treatment for UI and supports the&#xD;
      recommendation that PFMT should be the first treatment line in conservative management&#xD;
      programs for women with UI. Recently, there have been a few articles published that looked at&#xD;
      the effectiveness of treating UI in a group-like setting with both behavioral modifications&#xD;
      and pelvic floor exercises. One study was able to prove that group training of behavioral&#xD;
      modification helped to reduce UI severity, increase pelvic floor strength, and reduce voiding&#xD;
      frequency when compared to a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the studies cited were performed in community-dwelling persons with out-patient&#xD;
      services and interventions. Dr. Fitzgerald and her colleagues from The Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Institute of Chicago (RIC) were able to confirm in a poster presentation that many patients&#xD;
      admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation facility do have UI. In 2005, out of 403,697 Medicare&#xD;
      beneficiaries admitted to a rehab hospital, 24% were incontinent. These studies were able to&#xD;
      illustrate that UI affects all diagnoses. UI was shown to make a significant contribution to&#xD;
      patient outcomes independent of functional status at admission. It is also a large&#xD;
      determinant of discharge destination. In the United Kingdom in 2004, 62% of incontinent&#xD;
      stroke patients were discharged to a sub acute home with only 5% placement for continent&#xD;
      stroke survivors. Another study determined that urinary incontinence after having a stroke&#xD;
      predicted a higher likelihood of an adverse outcome when controlled for age, type of stroke,&#xD;
      and length of hospital stay. May, et. al., was able to state while in an acute rehab setting&#xD;
      that patients with spinal cord injuries ranked bowel and bladder care, along with skin care,&#xD;
      as most important in an education class with 12 different topics. This shows that patients&#xD;
      find bladder function a large priority in their care, even in an in-patient setting. In the&#xD;
      poster presentation mentioned above, many patients with UI in an acute care rehab setting do&#xD;
      not improve Functional Independence Measure (FIM) status from admission to discharge.&#xD;
      Currently there is no research available for the treatment of UI in an acute care rehab&#xD;
      hospital, though it has been shown to be an issue with many of those admitted. So the&#xD;
      question arises, &quot;Would addressing urinary incontinence with physical therapy interventions&#xD;
      and behavioral modifications improve incontinence in this population during the acute rehab&#xD;
      stage?&quot;&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This project will look at the possibility of treating in-patients with UI at RIC while in the&#xD;
      acute rehab hospital setting to determine what positive outcomes are possible. Subjects will&#xD;
      be provided both individual and group sessions to help educate and treat those suffering with&#xD;
      UI. Subjects would participate in a weekly educational class of lecture and video and then&#xD;
      perform both pelvic floor and general exercises in a group setting for the remainder of their&#xD;
      stay. Pre- and post- values of the listed outcome measures would be taken and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this fellowship is to determine if, through an educational and exercise class&#xD;
      setting, improvements can be made in women with UI in an acute rehab hospital. Also, surveys&#xD;
      will be used to see if patients find this type of intervention satisfactory and appropriate&#xD;
      in this level of care. Another outcome of this fellowship will be to expand this intervention&#xD;
      to other inpatient units and day rehab sites in the RIC system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #1: To determine if women with urinary incontinence in an acute care rehab&#xD;
      setting are satisfied with a group setting to treat UI Hypothesis 1: Women with urinary&#xD;
      incontinence in an acute care rehab setting will find a group educational and exercise class&#xD;
      appropriate for an acute care rehab hospital setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2: To determine if women with urinary incontinence in an acute rehab setting&#xD;
      feel the group setting of educational class of lecture and video and exercise class was&#xD;
      effective in reducing the amount or severity of UI Hypothesis 2: Women with urinary&#xD;
      incontinence in an acute care rehab setting will find a group educational (lecture and video)&#xD;
      and exercise class effective in reducing the amount or severity of UI Specific Aim #3: To&#xD;
      determine if women's quality of life improves with treating incontinence in an inpatient&#xD;
      rehab setting Hypothesis 3: Quality of life will improve for women with urinary incontinence&#xD;
      treated through group educational and exercise classes in an acute care rehab setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This is a prospective pilot study of 15 women who have been admitted to the Rehab&#xD;
      Institute of Chicago. There will not be a control group, and all 15 women will be in the&#xD;
      intervention group. Patients will be selected from the 4th floor inpatient unit. Diagnoses&#xD;
      will include women with orthopedic injuries, spinal surgeries, s/p surgical procedures, and&#xD;
      general debility due to hospitalizations. All types of incontinence will be included in the&#xD;
      study. UI will be defined as having an episode of loss of urine in the last 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study participants will be recruited from the therapy (PT and OT), nursing, and medical&#xD;
           staff on the 4th floor of the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago by patient report&#xD;
           during initial assessment/evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigator will determine if subject fits inclusion criteria for study by checking the&#xD;
           medical record and subjective interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participants will be recruited for a period of 8 months with the expectation to enroll&#xD;
           15 women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The women who consent to participate in the study will be given a set of questionnaires&#xD;
           at the time of consent and asked to complete by the next session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Consenting patient will undergo an internal and external pelvic floor muscle&#xD;
           examination. These procedures will be performed by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. If upon evaluation, the patient can perform the pelvic floor muscle contraction, she&#xD;
           will then be enrolled in both an educational class and a pelvic floor exercise class. If&#xD;
           extra time is needed for the patient to improve the contraction, the patient will&#xD;
           receive more 1:1 time before being enrolled in the exercise class.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The educational class will focus on the anatomy of the pelvic floor, physiology of&#xD;
           urination, urinary incontinence, behavioral modifications in bladder training, dietary&#xD;
           impact on bladder function, and performance of pelvic floor muscle exercises. The&#xD;
           exercise class will have an emphasis on pelvic floor exercises, core exercises, and&#xD;
           general body conditioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. An external and internal pelvic floor muscle examination will be performed after the&#xD;
           intervention, prior to discharge to next level of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. All intervention will be performed while the patient is in the hospital, and no&#xD;
           follow-up visits will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Participants will not be compensated for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Staff nurses, resident physicians, attending physicians, nurse practitioners, physical&#xD;
           or occupational therapists will inform investigator of any patient self-reports of&#xD;
           incontinence by women admitted to the 4th floor nursing unit during initial evaluations&#xD;
           or any other time during their stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The staff member will explain the study to the woman, and she will be asked if the study&#xD;
           investigator could come and discuss the possibility of enrolling in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The investigator will approach every woman referred to the study and will explain the&#xD;
           study in more detail. Participants will be asked to sign the consent form if they agree&#xD;
           to participate and allow collection of personal health information. Ample time will be&#xD;
           allowed for reading and answering any questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. After consent if gathered, the investigator will determine if the subject fits all&#xD;
           inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Subject will be notified of investigators findings within 1 day of talking with the&#xD;
           investigator for confirmation or exclusion of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Following HIPPA guidelines, patient identifiable data will be coded to protect each&#xD;
      patient's identity. The data obtained from the patients will be entered onto electronic&#xD;
      teleforms and imported into the database. This is an RIC secure server where access will only&#xD;
      be given to project staff. We are familiar with using this technology on other studies. It is&#xD;
      efficient to complete in clinical setting and minimize data entry errors. The data will be&#xD;
      used to describe patient characteristics and trends in findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will run descriptive analyses to characterize the patients in the study. We will report&#xD;
      the percent of patients who indicate they were satisfied with the program. We will compare&#xD;
      pre-program and post-program outcomes using t-tests. Outcomes include: the frequency and&#xD;
      severity of incontinence, quality of life, satisfaction with intervention, and FIM bladder&#xD;
      score. Analyses will be conducted using SPSS version 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures Frequency and severity of Incontinence: We will be measuring this concept&#xD;
      using the FIM data from the patient's medical chart to note the number of accidents reported&#xD;
      in a 24 hour time frame. The severity of incontinence will be measured with the Sandvick's&#xD;
      severity index, a valid measure to score the severity of urinary incontinence in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of Life: The quality of life of these subjects will be tested using the International&#xD;
      Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF) Satisfaction: A satisfaction&#xD;
      survey developed by the Principal Investigator will be used to understand the subject's&#xD;
      satisfaction with the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Time points Data will be collected at 2 separate time points. Data will be&#xD;
      collected initially upon consent to the study and then again prior to subject discharge to&#xD;
      the next level of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Format Personal Health Information will be collected by the investigator&#xD;
      through review of the subject's medical chart and subjective interview after consent to&#xD;
      participate is received. Participants will be given paper copies of the survey questionnaires&#xD;
      to complete and the investigator will collect the surveys. The results of the surveys and&#xD;
      physical examinations will be entered onto an Excel spreadsheet by study personnel. All data&#xD;
      will be stored on a password protected file in a RIC secure server with access only to&#xD;
      project staff. No names will be included in the data files, only study identification&#xD;
      numbers. The study identification numbers will be tracked in a separate data folder on the&#xD;
      same secure network, also password protected. A detailed description of data to be collected&#xD;
      follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation/Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will consist of patient responses to standardized and non-standardized&#xD;
      questionnaires and physical examination. In addition, we will collect relevant demographic&#xD;
      data and medical utilization data to describe the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective interviews will be given to understand the specifics of each subject's urinary&#xD;
      incontinence and previous treatments. A satisfaction survey will be developed by the&#xD;
      principal investigator and given to subjects at the end of their enrollment. The purpose of&#xD;
      the survey will be to determine if the information was understood and if the patient was&#xD;
      satisfied with the type of interventions. The International Consultation on Incontinence&#xD;
      Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF) will be used to look at quality of life issues with the&#xD;
      participants before and after the intervention. The ICIQ-SF has been proven to show&#xD;
      widespread applicability as an outcome measure in patients with incontinence. Admission FIM&#xD;
      and discharge FIM score for the bladder management will be collected to address if the&#xD;
      intervention was successful in decreasing the number of accidents/episodes of incontinence&#xD;
      per day. All objective findings will follow the Laycock PERFECT Scale and ICS guidelines to&#xD;
      standardize the terminology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests and Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will perform an external and internal pelvic floor muscle examination. This&#xD;
      will include a sensory screen to external pelvic region, anal wink reflex, and external&#xD;
      observation of perineal body mobility. Internally, the investigator will assess tone in&#xD;
      pelvic floor musculature, and muscle strength will be assessed using the Modified Oxford&#xD;
      scale and Laycock PERFECT scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and post-intervention ICIQ-SF and FIM scores will be compared using a one sample&#xD;
      t-test (if normally distributed) or the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test (if data are not normally&#xD;
      distributed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Examination Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Internal Muscuoloskeletal Tests and Measures: During all procedures, unless otherwise noted,&#xD;
      the patient will be disrobed below the waist and allowed to wear her choosing above the&#xD;
      waist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Internal assessment of pelvic floor muscle function: The examiner observes the movement&#xD;
           of the patient's perineum with the patient in the supine position with legs spread or in&#xD;
           the dorsal lithotomy position; approximate time for testing 2 minutes, graded as present&#xD;
           or absent&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. voluntary contraction: moves ventrally and cranially during contraction&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. voluntary relaxation: able to relax on demand, descends from ventral position&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. involuntary contraction: takes place preceding increase in abdominal pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. involuntary relaxation: takes place when straining as in defecation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Modified Oxford scale: The examiner inserts a finger into the patient's vagina to&#xD;
           perform a manual muscle test of right and left pelvic floor muscles with the patient in&#xD;
           the supine or dorsal lithotomy position using the modified Oxford scale ; approximate&#xD;
           time for testing 3 minutes. The patient is instructed to contract her pelvic floor&#xD;
           muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. 0/5 = no discernible contraction of muscles&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. 1/5 = flicker or pulsation is felt, no discernible lifting or tightening&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. 2/5 = weak contraction, no discernible lifting or tightening&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. 3/5 = moderate, some lifting of the posterior wall and some tightening around the&#xD;
                examiner's finger, contraction is visible&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. 4/5 = good, elevation of the vaginal wall is felt against resistance, drawing in of&#xD;
                the perineum is felt, able to hold for 5 or more seconds&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. 5/5 = strong resistance is felt; if two fingers are inserted, fingers will be&#xD;
                approximated, able to hold for with 10 second hold&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Laycock PERFECT scale. Approximate time for testing is 10 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. P=Use modified Oxford scale and ICS guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. E=List number of seconds contraction is held&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. R=List number of repetitions contraction is hel&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. F=list number of contractions that can be performed in 10 seconds&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. E=elevation of posterior vaginal wall toward pubic bone (absent or present)&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. C=Co-contraction of the deep abdominal muscles (absent or present)&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. T=Timing-involuntary pelvic floor muscle contraction (absent or present)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pelvic floor palpation exam: The patient is disrobed from the waist down and is lying&#xD;
           supine with hips and knees flexed. The examiner inserts a finger into the patient's&#xD;
           vagina and performs manual palpation of pelvic floor and obturator internus musculature&#xD;
           for tenderness. Approximate time for testing 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Right and left superficial genital muscles i. Anterior ii. Perineal body iii.&#xD;
           posterior b. Right and left levator ani c. Right and left obturator internus&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Impact and Significance Urinary incontinence is a very prevalent problem in women, even those&#xD;
      who are admitted to inpatient rehab units. Previous studies on treating UI have been done on&#xD;
      community dwelling women, not those that are in a hospital setting. The research has shown&#xD;
      that there is both a need and want to treat this condition in an inpatient hospital.&#xD;
      Interventions with physical therapy and behavioral modifications have been proven to be the&#xD;
      best first line of treating this condition so should be tested in this patient population.&#xD;
      Improvements could be made in the subjects' severity of incontinence, quality of life,&#xD;
      self-efficacy, and possible discharge destination. This study will also be of benefit to the&#xD;
      Rehab Institute of Chicago by bringing urinary incontinence to the forefront of the rehab&#xD;
      team and improve the process and techniques in which it is managed.&#xD;
