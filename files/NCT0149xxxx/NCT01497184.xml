  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if researchers can successfully and&#xD;
      safely give HSCT patients an infusion of white blood cells (called T-cells) that have been&#xD;
      genetically changed. The process of changing the DNA (the genetic material in cells) of these&#xD;
      T-cells is called &quot;gene transfer.&quot; Researchers want to learn if these genetically-changed&#xD;
      T-cells are effective in attacking cancer cells in patients with advanced B-cell lymphoma or&#xD;
      leukemia, after they have received standard allogeneic HSCT. Researchers want to find out the&#xD;
      highest dose of these special T-cells that can be given safely to leukemia and lymphoma&#xD;
      patients. Researchers also want to learn how long the changed T-cells stay in your body, and&#xD;
      if adding them to standard transplant can improve how you respond to treatment.&#xD;

      Gene Transfer:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gene transfer involves drawing blood from a transplant donor, and then separating out the&#xD;
      T-cells using a machine. Researchers then perform a gene transfer to change the T-cells' DNA,&#xD;
      and then inject the changed T-cells into the body of the patient receiving the transplant.&#xD;
      This process is called a modified donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to 1 of 4&#xD;
      study arms, based on your age, treatment schedule, and disease status:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants in Arm 1 will receive the T-cells by vein about 6-12 weeks after the stem&#xD;
           cell transplant. (Adults participants only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants in Arm 2 will receive the T-cells by vein if, at any point, the disease&#xD;
           comes back after stem cell transplant. Your doctor may decide that you need to receive&#xD;
           chemotherapy before you are given the T-cells, in order to clear out the T-cells that&#xD;
           are in your body already. This may help the infused T-cells work better. If more&#xD;
           chemotherapy is needed, you will sign another informed consent document, which will the&#xD;
           chemotherapy and its risks in detail. (Pediatric and adult participants eligible)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants in Arm 3 will receive the T-cells by vein about 6-12 weeks after the stem&#xD;
           cell transplant. (Pediatric participants [ages 1-17] only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants in Arm 4 will be given the T-cells as a scheduled infusion or if the&#xD;
           disease comes back. This group is also scheduled to receive a stem cell transplant from&#xD;
           a mismatched family member donor. (Pediatric and adult participants eligible)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once you have been assigned to a study arm, you will be assigned to 1 of 4 dose levels of&#xD;
      genetically-changed T-cells, based on when you joined this study. The first group of&#xD;
      participants will receive the lowest dose of T-cells, and each new group will receive a&#xD;
      higher dose of changed T-cells than the group before it, as long as no intolerable side&#xD;
      effects were seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy and HSCT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After your donor's stem cells have been successfully collected, you will be admitted to the&#xD;
      hospital to receive chemotherapy and the HSCT. These procedures are not considered part of&#xD;
      this research study. You will discuss these procedures with a study doctor and sign an&#xD;
      informed consent document with specific details of the HSCT procedure and possible risks, at&#xD;
      another time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The T-cell Infusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the HSCT, the study chair will decide when you will be eligible for the T-cell&#xD;
      infusion. You must be at least 42 days past your transplant without any serious evidence of&#xD;
      active graft versus host disease (GVHD). GVHD occurs when donor cells attack the cells of the&#xD;
      person receiving the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the infusion, you will receive drugs to lower your risk of allergic reaction to the&#xD;
      T-cells. Tylenol速 (acetaminophen) will be given by mouth, and Benadryl速 (diphenhydramine) may&#xD;
      be given by mouth or by vein over a few minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The T-cell infusion is given by vein, usually over 15-30 minutes. During the infusion, your&#xD;
      vital signs will be checked. The infusion may be given on one day, or it may be divided into&#xD;
      two parts at least 24 hours apart. The first part of the infusion will be a much smaller part&#xD;
      to ensure that you have no immediate side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the T cell infusion, you will receive drugs to lower your risk of allergic reaction to&#xD;
      the T cells. Acetaminophen (Tylenol速) will be given by mouth, and diphenhydramine (Benadryl速)&#xD;
      will be given by vein over a few minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your cancer returns after the transplant, you may receive an additional T-cell infusion.&#xD;
      If you receive an additional T-cell infusion, the screening tests will be repeated. The study&#xD;
      doctor will discuss the results of the repeated screening tests with you. If the screening&#xD;
      tests show that you are not eligible to receive the additional T-cell infusion, other&#xD;
      treatment options will be discussed with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 3 days after the T-cell infusion, and then about 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 3&#xD;
      months, 6 months and 12 months after the T-cell infusion, the following tests will be&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your height, weight, and vital&#xD;
           signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons each time) will be drawn for research tests to check the&#xD;
           level of the infused T-cells and to measure the number of B-cells and other&#xD;
           (non-transplanted) T-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons each time) will be drawn for routine tests and tests of your&#xD;
           blood chemistry, and blood sugars. During the 4 week, 8 week, 3 month, 6 month, and 12&#xD;
           month visits, part of this blood sample will be used for tests of certain protein&#xD;
           levels. During the Month 3 visit, part of this blood sample will be used to check for&#xD;
           HAMA immune system reactions. If you leave the study before the Month 3 visit, blood&#xD;
           (about 1 tablespoon) may be collected for HAMA immune system reaction testing, if&#xD;
           possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have be checked for possible reactions to your treatment, including GVHD and&#xD;
           graft failure. Graft failure occurs when donor cells may not be able to grow and&#xD;
           multiply in your body. If this happens, there will be a high risk of infections and/or&#xD;
           bleeding. If the number of white blood cells does not get back to high enough levels&#xD;
           within 3 weeks after the transplant, more blood stem cells from the stem cell donor may&#xD;
           be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You may need a skin biopsy or an endoscopy to check for GVHD and/or graft failure, as&#xD;
           well. To collect a skin biopsy, the biopsy area is numbed with anesthetic, and a small&#xD;
           amount of skin is collected using a needle or scalpel. An endoscopy is an exam where you&#xD;
           will be mildly sedated to allow a thin, flexible, lighted tube, called an endoscope, to&#xD;
           be inserted inside the esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestine. This&#xD;
           will allow the doctor to look for abnormal areas that might not be so easily seen in&#xD;
           x-rays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 3 months after the T-cell infusion, you will have CT scans and/or a bone marrow biopsy&#xD;
      to check the status of the disease. An extra sample of bone marrow aspirate (about 2&#xD;
      teaspoons each time) will be drawn for research tests whenever a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy&#xD;
      is being done if possible. These samples will be used for research tests to study how your&#xD;
      immune system responds to the infusion of T-cells. To collect a bone marrow aspirate, an area&#xD;
      of the hip is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow is withdrawn through&#xD;
      a large needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking part in this study for up to 3 months. You will be taken off study if&#xD;
      the disease gets worse, you have any infections, or intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on this study will be over once you have completed the planned study&#xD;
      visits at 3 months after the T-cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retreatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are taken off study because the disease got worse, you may be able to enroll on study&#xD;
      again once the highest tolerated dose of T-cells is found. If this happens, you will follow&#xD;
      the same schedule for dosing and study tests as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For safety reasons, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that patients who&#xD;
      receive infusions of stem cells treated with a gene transfer procedure must have long-term&#xD;
      follow-up for at least 15 years after receiving the gene transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The gene transfer or DLI (infusion with genetically-changed&#xD;
      T-cells) are not commercially available or FDA approved for use in this type of disease.&#xD;
      Their use in this study is considered investigational. The donor's leukapheresis procedure to&#xD;
      collect cells for the manufacture of changed T-cells will be provided at no cost to you while&#xD;
      you are on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 140 patients (and up to 140 donors) will take part in this study. All will be enrolled&#xD;
      at MD Anderson.&#xD;
