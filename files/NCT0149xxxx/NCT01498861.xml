    <textblock>
      Dolutegravir (DTG, GSK1349572 is an integrase inhibitor that is currently in Phase 3 clinical&#xD;
      development for the treatment of HIV infection. DTG will likely be used in women on oral&#xD;
      contraceptives (OC) for birth control. Based on accumulated non-clinical and clinical drug&#xD;
      metabolism and pharmacokinetic data, there is a low likelihood of drug interaction between&#xD;
      DTG and most widely used OC drugs. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of DTG administration on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a commonly used&#xD;
      oral contraceptive product, Ortho-Cyclen (combination of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol),&#xD;
      in healthy female subjects. Each subject will participate in a Run-in period (if needed),&#xD;
      followed by two treatment periods. Approximately 16 subjects will be randomized in a&#xD;
      cross-over fashion to either Ortho-Cyclen with DTG or Ortho-Cyclen with Placebo for 10 days&#xD;
      and switch to the alternate treatment for another 10 days. Subjects will return to the study&#xD;
      center for final follow up evaluations 7 - 14 days after the final dose of study medication.&#xD;
