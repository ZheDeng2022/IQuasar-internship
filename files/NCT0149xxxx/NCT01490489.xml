  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the potential prognostic value of seric concentrations&#xD;
      of EG-VEGF for Pre-eclampsia and/or intrauterine growth restriction and will allow checking&#xD;
      whether plasma levels of EG-VEGF at 14-18 weeks of gestation could be proposed as prognostic&#xD;
      marker for preeclampsia.&#xD;

      Successful human placentation depends on adequate transformation of the uteroplacental&#xD;
      vasculature by extravillous trophoblast (EVT) following proliferation, migration, and&#xD;
      invasion of these cells into the maternal decidua. This process of vascular remodelling rises&#xD;
      to a peak by the end of the first trimester and declines rapidly thereafter. Poor invasion&#xD;
      can lead to the development of pathological condition such as Pre-eclampsia (PE) and&#xD;
      intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). PE affects 5-6 % of pregnancies in France and causes&#xD;
      the death of ten or so women per year. Our research project is dedicated to the comprehension&#xD;
      of the mechanisms underlying the development of PE and to the search of gold prognostic&#xD;
      marker of this pathology. We were particularly interested in the study of the new angiogenic&#xD;
      factor, EG-VEGF, recently reported as new factor specific to endocrine glands including the&#xD;
      placenta. In recent results obtained by our team, we have shown that i) placental EG-VEGF&#xD;
      showed a peak of expression just before the establishment of the foeto-maternal circulation&#xD;
      ii) EG-VEGF receptors, PKR1 and PKR2 were also expressed during the first trimester of&#xD;
      pregnancy and iii) EG-VEGF expression and that of its receptor PKR1 were up-regulated by&#xD;
      hypoxia. In our last publication &quot;under press in JCMM&quot; we have shown that EG-VEGF inhibits&#xD;
      EVT migration and invasion. More importantly, we have succeeded to measure EG-VEGF&#xD;
      circulating levels in non pregnant and in pregnant women at the three trimesters of pregnancy&#xD;
      and showed that its highest levels (5 times the non pregnant levels) were found during the&#xD;
      first trimester of pregnancy with a significant decrease thereafter. Furthermore, on a cohort&#xD;
      of 19 PE patient and 21 age matched controls, we have observed a significant increase in&#xD;
      EG-VEGF levels in the PE group. Therefore we hypothesize that EG-VEGF could play an important&#xD;
      role in human placentation and that a persistence in its expression over the first trimester&#xD;
      of pregnancy may contribute to the development of PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the Doppler analysis method for the assessment of uterine artery transformation by&#xD;
      the end of 1st trimester, we propose to search for a correlation between the circulating&#xD;
      levels of the new angiogenic factor EG-VEGF in the sera of pregnant woman between 14 to 18&#xD;
      WG, and the development of PE and/or IUGR. Doppler ultrasonography is a predictive method of&#xD;
      the pregnancy outcome at the time of the development of the disease (1st to 2nd trimester),&#xD;
      before threatening symptoms launch (end of the 2nd to the 3rd trimester). In normal&#xD;
      pregnancy, impedance to flow in the uterine arteries decreases with gestation as result of&#xD;
      trophoblastic invasion of the spiral arteries and their conversion into low-resistance&#xD;
      vessels by the end of first trimester of pregnancy. Therefore, the present study will also&#xD;
      allow the search for a negative correlation between the level of uterine artery&#xD;
      transformation and the level of EG-VEGF. The study will be conducted in collaboration with&#xD;
      the Clinical centre of the Grenoble CHU Hospital (Dr JL. Cracowski). In this study we plan to&#xD;
      include 500 pregnant pregnant women. Patients will be recruited at the time of their first&#xD;
      ultrasonography between 11 and 13 WG and included in the study between 14 and 18 WG. For each&#xD;
      patient a blood sample will be taken for the measurement of circulating EG-VEGF and Doppler&#xD;
      analysis for uterine artery transformation will be performed. These results will provide&#xD;
      information concerning the potential prognostic value of seric concentrations of EG-VEGF for&#xD;
      PE and/or IUGR and will allow checking whether plasma levels of EG-VEGF at 14-18 weeks of&#xD;
      gestation could be proposed as prognostic marker for preeclampsia.&#xD;
