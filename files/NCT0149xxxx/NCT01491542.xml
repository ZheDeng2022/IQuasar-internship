      The purpose of this pilot clinical trial is to evaluate the feasibility of using the&#xD;
      investigational implant (INFUSE® Bone Graft and MASTERGRAFT® Granules with the CD HORIZON®&#xD;
      Spinal System) as a method of facilitating spinal fusion in patients with symptomatic&#xD;
      degenerative disc disease.&#xD;
