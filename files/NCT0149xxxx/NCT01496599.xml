      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Parkinson s disease (PD) causes slow movement, stiffness, and tremor. It results from the&#xD;
      loss of a brain chemical called dopamine. PD gets worse over time, but researchers do not&#xD;
      fully understand why the brain cells that produce dopamine stop working or die in people with&#xD;
      PD. This study will use different ways of imaging the brain and brain chemicals to look at&#xD;
      PD. It will compare brain imaging in people who definitely have PD to people who might have&#xD;
      PD and to people without signs of PD. It will provide more information how the brain in&#xD;
      people with PD changes over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To understand the changes that occur in the brains of people with Parkinson s disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have definite or possible Parkinson s disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a screening visit with a physical exam and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will visit the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center every 18 month&#xD;
           or 3 years for up to 9 years. There will be up to 6 total visits. Most visits will last&#xD;
           5 to 6 hours a day for 1 to 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some or all of the following tests will be performed at each visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging to take pictures of the brain. Some of these tests will be&#xD;
           done at rest. Others will require participants to perform an activity during the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication withdrawal for 12 hours overnight for people taking PD medications. This may&#xD;
           be done before some scans. Participants who feel unwell when they stop taking&#xD;
           medications will be allowed to start taking them again.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will continue with the follow up visits until the end of the study.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this protocol is to evaluate possible imaging biomarkers for diagnosis and&#xD;
      assessment of disease progression in Parkinson disease (PD) through multi-modal neuroimaging&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Part 1: Compare brain images of PD subjects and healthy volunteers (HVs) using various&#xD;
           imaging techniques in a case-control analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Part 2: Compare findings on serial brain images with clinical assessments of clinically&#xD;
           defined PD subjects, subjects with prodromal Parkinson disease, and healthy volunteers,&#xD;
           over the following 9 years. The findings from this exploratory study will help develop&#xD;
           additional hypothesis-driven studies investigating PD pathology. PD patients will yield&#xD;
           information about how imaging outcomes change over time, and their relationship with&#xD;
           disease progression; the patients with prodromal symptoms will give information as to&#xD;
           which imaging modalities/analysis might predict the clinical manifestation of PD,&#xD;
           healthy volunteers will serve as controls for subjects aging and technological changes&#xD;
           due to scanner functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Part 1 (Case-control study): 38 patients fitting the MSD Clinical Diagnostic Criteria&#xD;
           for PD, and 38 age-matched healthy volunteers (HVs) as controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Part 2 (Longitudinal study): We will continue to study qualifying subjects from Part 1&#xD;
           periodically over the following 9 years. We will also study 38 subjects fitting the MDS&#xD;
           prodromal criteria for PD for up to 9 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Part 1: (Case-control study). Eligible participants will come for a 1 to 3 day visit.&#xD;
           They will have a clinical assessment, and a magnetic resonance (MR) scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Part 2: (Longitudinal study).&#xD;
&#xD;
           -Participants will be followed up for up to 9 years. Each visit will last 2-3 days,&#xD;
           during which they will have several outpatient tests done. Visits will be scheduled&#xD;
           according to the following plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
           --Subjects without neurological disorder (HV) will be seen every three years for a&#xD;
&#xD;
           total of 9 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
           --Subjects with clinical PD for more than 5 years will be seen every three years for a&#xD;
&#xD;
           total of 9 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subjects with clinical PD for less than 5 years will be seen every 18 months, until&#xD;
                the 5y of diagnosis, and every three years after, for a total of 9 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subjects assigned to the Prodromal group will be seen will every 18 months, until&#xD;
                the 5y of diagnosis if symptoms do not progress into neurodegeneration (up to 3&#xD;
                visits), and until year 9 if symptoms progress towards PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Subjects who participated in the cross-sectional part will be included in the&#xD;
                     longitudinal section if they fulfill the inclusion/exclusion criteria. New&#xD;
                     subjects can be enrolled to complete this section.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Structural MRI (SWI images): The primary outcome measure is the difference in&#xD;
                susceptibility changes in iron-rich structures (ie. The SN, red nucleus, striatum)&#xD;
                across groups and within groups over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical presentation: We will evaluate how the prodromal symptoms influence the&#xD;
                progression to clinical PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Structural MR (morphometry and diffusion analyses): The outcome measures are the&#xD;
                differences in gray and white matter morphometry across groups and within groups&#xD;
                over time. We will derive measures such as fractional anisotropy, trace, and&#xD;
                parenchymal volume fractions as measures of fiber tract integrity, across groups&#xD;
                and within groups over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  fMRI: The outcome measure for fMRI is the difference in resting state functional&#xD;
                connectivity patterns as reflected by BOLD signal fluctuations and their dynamics&#xD;
                across groups and over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  MRS: The outcome measure for MRS is the difference in the spectroscopy signal&#xD;
                amplitude of phosphorus-containing compounds and neurotransmitters in the&#xD;
                sensorimotor cortices and basal ganglia across groups and over time.&#xD;

        Part 1 (Case-control study): We will study 30 patients with well-defined PD, as defined by&#xD;
        the UK Parkinson s Society Brain Bank diagnostic criteria (Hughes et al., 1992, Olanow et&#xD;
        al., 2009, Defer et al., 1999). We will also study 15 age-matched healthy volunteers (HVs)&#xD;
        as controls. Part 2 (Longitudinal study): We will continue to study subjects from Part 1&#xD;
        periodically over the following 9 years. We will also study 30 subjects with early&#xD;
        parkinsonism (EP). EP subjects are defined as individuals who have experienced at least one&#xD;
        but fewer than 3 of the cardinal symptoms of PD at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
