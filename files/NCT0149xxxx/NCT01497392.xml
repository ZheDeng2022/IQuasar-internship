      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of dovitinib lactate when given&#xD;
      together with gemcitabine hydrochloride and capecitabine in treating patients with advanced&#xD;
      or metastatic solid tumors or advanced pancreatic cancer. Dovitinib lactate may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride and capecitabine, work in different ways to&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Giving dovitinib lactate together with combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor&#xD;
      cells&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of dovitinib&#xD;
      (dovitinib lactate) when administered concurrently with gemcitabine (gemcitabine&#xD;
      hydrochloride) and capecitabine in patients with advanced solid malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize the safety profile of dovitinib, gemcitabine and capecitabine combination&#xD;
      in patients with advanced solid malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of dovitinib, capecitabine, gemcitabine and&#xD;
      their metabolites when administered concurrently in patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the preliminary efficacy of the study combination in patients with advanced&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma of the pancreas or biliary tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore serum and tumor biomarkers predictive of efficacy to the study combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of dovitinib lactate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive dovitinib lactate orally (PO) on days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19, gemcitabine&#xD;
      hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, and capecitabine PO twice&#xD;
      daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks and then every 3&#xD;
      months for 1 year.&#xD;
