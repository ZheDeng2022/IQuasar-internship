  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how inhaled treprostinil sodium (Tyvaso) affects the&#xD;
      amount of air and blood that reach the alveoli, or tiy air sacs, in the lungs of patients&#xD;
      with Group 1 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension with concomitant Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary&#xD;
      Disease (COPD).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In patients with severe COPD where the FEV1 is 50% or less than predicted, emphysema and&#xD;
      obliterating bronchiolitis presenting a &quot;ceiling&quot; to any improvement in function that can be&#xD;
      achieved by therapies that dilate the airways or lessen inflammation. Such severe COPD is&#xD;
      commonly associated with pulmonary hypertension at rest or during exercise. Although hypoxia&#xD;
      has been classically considered to be the major pathogenic mechanism of pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension in COPD and oxygen has been the mainstay of therapy, other mechanisms may play&#xD;
      important roles. Indeed, endothelial dysfunction can be observed in patients with mild to&#xD;
      moderate COPD who do not have hypoxemia and in smokers with normal lung function. In&#xD;
      addition, long-term oxygen therapy does not generally result in resolution of the pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension. A key question that remains is whether the newer therapies for pulmonary&#xD;
      arterial hypertension (PAH) could improve pulmonary hypertension and therefore exercise&#xD;
      tolerance in COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately the use of non-selective pulmonary vasodilator therapy in oral, intravenous or&#xD;
      subcutaneous form for PAH patients who have unrelated concomitant COPD, is known to cause&#xD;
      worsening gas exchange and intensification of symptoms despite a decrease in pulmonary&#xD;
      vascular resistance and arterial pressures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that an inhaled pulmonary vasodilator may not worsen ventilation-perfusion&#xD;
      mismatching by selectively vasodilating well ventilated areas in PAH patients with&#xD;
      concomitant COPD and in fact may improve ventilation perfusion matching leading to&#xD;
      preservation or improvement of oxygenation.&#xD;
