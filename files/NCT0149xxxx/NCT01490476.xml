      The purpose of the study is to determine if RAD001 treatment will shrink or slow the growth&#xD;
      of the vestibular schwannoma(s) in Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is a Phase II, open-label, efficacy and safety study of single-agent RAD001 in&#xD;
      patients with NF2. During the study, subjects will receive continuous daily oral treatment&#xD;
      with RAD001 for up to 4 years or until tumor progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To determine whether RAD001 has an effect on the VS growth in patients&#xD;
      with NF2 at a rate sufficient to submit the drug for further testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: To determine whether RAD001 has an effect on the volume of other&#xD;
      intracranial tumors; to assess the effect of RAD001 on hearing function in patients with NF2&#xD;
      (when applicable); to determine whether RAD001 modulates signaling pathways in intracranial&#xD;
      NF2 tumors removed during the course of the study. And determine the long term safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be treated with RAD001 10 mg p.o. daily dose (5mg if 15-17 years old with&#xD;
      cutaneous surface area &lt;1.5m2) for one year except in case of unacceptable toxicity, death,&#xD;
      or discontinuation from the study for any other reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 12 months an extension for another one year of RAD001 treatment will be discussed in case&#xD;
      of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is stable (decrease or increase lower than 20%), treatment should be stopped&#xD;
      and the patient should be kept under quarterly continuous surveillance. Resumption of&#xD;
      treatment will be discussed case by case basis if tumor regrowth over 20% relative to the&#xD;
      tumor volume at the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have a follow-up visit (including MRI) scheduled at 24 months after&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We modify the protocol to extend the treatment by RAD001 for a period of two additional years&#xD;
      for stable patients still on treatment two years after enrollment.&#xD;
