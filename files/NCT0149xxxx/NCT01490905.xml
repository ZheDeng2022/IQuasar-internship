      This research protocol will compare Theramine to a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug&#xD;
      (NSAID) in the treatment of chronic back pain. The study will examine the efficacy and&#xD;
      tolerability of Theramine alone in patients with chronic back pain in comparison to the&#xD;
      NSAID, Ibuprofen, and the co-administration of Ibuprofen with Theramine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis and management of back pain is a challenge for both primary care physicians and&#xD;
      specialists. Establishing an etiology can be difficult and often problematic, with treatment&#xD;
      options capable of producing serious and potentially life threatening side effects.&#xD;
      Treatments often exert a modest impact on the natural history of the condition. Non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently prescribed to treat chronic back pain. NSAIDs&#xD;
      are only moderately effective in relieving pain. NSAIDs are the leading cause of drug-induced&#xD;
      gastrointestinal bleeds, the most common cause of drug-induced morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      particularly at high dose. They can also exacerbate hypertension, edema and produce&#xD;
      nephrotoxicity. The effects are also dose dependent. Recent data indicates NSAIDs are a risk&#xD;
      factor for myocardial infarction, particularly at high doses. Recent data also indicates&#xD;
      NSAIDs disrupt collagen repair in injured tissue. Muscle relaxants and narcotic analgesics&#xD;
      show limited efficacy and often produce sedation, constipation or inappropriate usage.&#xD;
      Physical therapy and local modalities often are not satisfying, costly, and require&#xD;
      considerable investment of patient time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurotransmitter depletion has been demonstrated to contribute to chronic pain states.&#xD;
      Increased nutrient requirements associated with pain syndromes and the consequent reduced&#xD;
      production of neurotransmitters contribute to maladaptive pain responses. The ability to&#xD;
      enhance neurotransmitter production associated with pain syndromes is limited by multiple&#xD;
      factors, specifically unavailability of adequate essential amino acids in the diet and&#xD;
      increased turnover rates of amino acids needed to produce neurotransmitters in pain&#xD;
      syndromes. Other factors such as prolonged pharmaceutical use deplete the nerve cells of&#xD;
      neurotransmitters. Attempts to modify brain neurochemistry have focused on single&#xD;
      neurotransmitters such as serotonin or GABA. However, this approach fails to address the&#xD;
      complexity and complementary influences of multiple neurotransmitters on patient perception&#xD;
      of pain and suffering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theramine is a proprietary prescription Medical Food which concurrently enhances several&#xD;
      neurotransmitters that are involved in pain modulation and sensation by providing&#xD;
      neurotransmitter precursors in the form of amino acids, (see attached Monograph for detailed&#xD;
      discussion). Small trials have found Theramine effective in reducing and modifying pain&#xD;
      without demonstrable side effects. Theramine simultaneously stimulates the production of the&#xD;
      neurotransmitters serotonin, GABA, brain induced cortisol, nitric oxide, and glutamate.&#xD;
