  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ICP is known to cause abnormal bile acid homeostasis and to be associated with an increased&#xD;
      risk of diseases of the biliary system in later life. There have been small studies (Dann et&#xD;
      al. 2006; Wójcicka-Jagodzińska et al. 1989) suggesting that it causes dyslipidaemia (raised&#xD;
      lipids) and impaired glucose tolerance in pregnancy. However the underlying mechanisms of&#xD;
      these abnormalities is not known. Similarly the influence of cholestasis on fetal metabolism&#xD;
      is not known, and nor is the role of the placenta. It is also not known whether women with&#xD;
      ICP have a predisposition to abnormal lipid and glucose homeostasis when they are not&#xD;
      pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GDM is characterized by raised plasma glucose levels in pregnant women (in the absence of&#xD;
      pre-pregnancy diabetes mellitus). This condition is associated with large-for-gestational age&#xD;
      babies and obstructed labour. Women with GDM have increased risk of subsequent type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, and if they have this condition in a subsequent pregnancy there is an&#xD;
      increased risk of stillbirth. This work is important to understand the causes of the&#xD;
      metabolic abnormalities associated with ICP and GDM. If we demonstrate abnormal lipid and&#xD;
      glucose profiles, these may be of relevance to the fetal complications of both disorders. It&#xD;
      will also be of relevance to the future health of affected women and their children.&#xD;

      CLINICAL FEATURES OF INTRAHEPATIC CHOLESTASIS OF PREGNANCY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), is a pregnancy-specific liver disorder which&#xD;
      typically presents with maternal pruritus (itching) in late pregnancy and affects about 0.7%&#xD;
      of women in the UK. Biochemically, it is characterised by liver dysfunction with raised serum&#xD;
      bile acids, and clinically by a significantly increased incidence of fetal complications,&#xD;
      including spontaneous preterm labour, fetal distress, meconium staining of the amniotic fluid&#xD;
      and sudden fetal death (Geenes and Williamson 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cause of ICP is complex and not fully understood. In addition the pathological mechanisms&#xD;
      behind the adverse fetal outcomes have not been elucidated. The maternal disease is likely to&#xD;
      be caused by interaction between sex hormone metabolites and bile acids in genetically&#xD;
      susceptible women (Abu-Hayyeh et al. 2010). To date, we and others have identified genetic&#xD;
      variation in several biliary transporters e.g. ABCB4, ATP8B1, ABCB11 and the main bile acid&#xD;
      receptor, FXR, that predispose women to the disease (Dixon et al., 2000; Mullenbach et al.,&#xD;
      2005; Pauli-Magnus et al., 2004; Van Mil et al, 2007; Dixon et al. 2009). Due to their&#xD;
      inherent toxicity, bile acids are also likely to be responsible for the fetal component of&#xD;
      the disease. Consistent with this the incidence of fetal complications has been shown to be&#xD;
      increased in pregnancies where the levels exceed 40 uMol /L (Glantz et al., 2004). There are&#xD;
      currently several theories about how bile acids may affect fetal wellbeing; with regard to&#xD;
      the increased incidence of spontaneous prematurity, they have been shown to cause premature&#xD;
      delivery in sheep (Campos et al., 1986), and increased myometrial contractility in response&#xD;
      to oxytocin (Germain et al., 2003; Israel et al., 1986). Furthermore, bile acids are also&#xD;
      known to cause increased colonic motility in rabbits (Snape et al., 1980) and cardiac&#xD;
      dysrhythmias in rats (Williamson et al., 2001), which could explain meconium staining of the&#xD;
      amniotic fluid and sudden fetal death respectively. While it is known that bile acids can be&#xD;
      transported by proteins in the placenta, the precise role of the placenta in bile, lipid and&#xD;
      glucose metabolism is not known. Our group has demonstrated that cholestasis alters lipid&#xD;
      pathways in mouse placentas (unpublished data) but this has not been studied in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BILE ACID HOMEOSTASIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bile acids are the end product of hepatic cholesterol metabolism and act as the main route of&#xD;
      excretion for cholesterol. In the adult human two primary bile acids are produced by the&#xD;
      liver, i.e. cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid. There is some evidence that maternal bile&#xD;
      acids gradually rise with advancing gestation, but they usually remain within normal limits&#xD;
      (&lt; 14 uMol /L) (Fulton et al., 1983; Pascual et al., 2002). This is in contrast to an ICP&#xD;
      pregnancy, where maternal bile acids may be raised to 100 times the upper limit of normal&#xD;
      (Walker et al.,2002). In OC, elevated levels of bile acids are also found in the fetal&#xD;
      circulation (Laatikainen, 1975).&#xD;
&#xD;
      THE ROLE OF BILE ACIDS IN LIPID AND GLUCOSE METABOLISM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is accumulating evidence that FXR, the nuclear hormone receptor responsible for&#xD;
      regulation of bile acid homeostasis, also plays a role in the regulation of lipid and glucose&#xD;
      metabolism. FXR null mice have been shown to have abnormal blood lipid profiles including&#xD;
      elevated plasma cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, high density lipoprotein and&#xD;
      triglyceride levels (Ma, 2006). They also exhibit glucose intolerance and reduced insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity (Zhang, 2006). Furthermore, ICP patients have raised levels of cholesterol and&#xD;
      other lipid parameters (Dann et al. 2006). Specifically, the serum concentrations of&#xD;
      low-density lipoprotein (LDL), apolipoprotein B-100, cholesterol and total cholesterol were&#xD;
      markedly increased in women with ICP. They have also been shown to have impaired glucose&#xD;
      tolerance (Wójcicka-Jagodzińska et al. 1989). Recent data from our group (Martineau et al.&#xD;
      2014, 2015) and others (Marschall et al. 2014) have shown that women with ICP have increased&#xD;
      rates of GDM, and implicate raised serum bile acids in susceptibility to diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
      Therefore this study will also include women with ICP and superimposed GDM in addition to&#xD;
      women with GDM in the absence of ICP. This will enable us to evaluate the impact of&#xD;
      cholestasis on the onset of diabetes mellitus in pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cholestasis bile acids accumulate in the liver, and this results in the induction of&#xD;
      pathways that enhance bile acid excretion. This may also cause abnormal cholesterol and&#xD;
      triglyceride levels. Bile acids also signal via FXR in the gut. Bile acids are stored in the&#xD;
      gallbladder in the fasting state and released following ingestion of a meal. Once bile acids&#xD;
      are in the intestine they are transported into enterocytes (gut cells) where they activate&#xD;
      FXR which causes production and release of the hormone FGF19. FGF19 binds the FGF4 receptor&#xD;
      on hepatocytes, and signals (via the jnk kinase pathway) to suppress cholesterol 7&#xD;
      alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), a critical rate-limiting enzyme in synthesis of bile acids from&#xD;
      cholesterol. There have been no studies of the gut-liver axis in pregnancy, but we&#xD;
      hypothesise that abnormal bile acid signalling causes raised cholesterol in addition to&#xD;
      increased serum bile acids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bile acids also bind the G-protein-coupled receptor (TGR5). In the gut this results in&#xD;
      release of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)(Thomas et al. 2009). GLP-1 is an anti-diabetic&#xD;
      hormone that increases glucose-dependent insulin production and decreases glucagon production&#xD;
      by the pancreas. To date, there have been no studies of the relationship between cholestasis&#xD;
      and GDM and the levels of other fasting gut hormones that may influence glucose and lipid&#xD;
      metabolism in pregnancy.&#xD;
