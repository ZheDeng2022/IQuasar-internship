  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-commercial study to explore the use of Heliox21 in a new patient cohort. The&#xD;
      fundamental aim is to assess the therapeutic benefits of Heliox21 and practicalities of gas&#xD;
      delivery in patients who require non-invasive ventilatory support following extubation on the&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit. Thus, the investigators aim to extend our knowledge of the potential&#xD;
      role for Heliox21 in the post-extubation environment of the Intensive Care Unit. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to answer a specific, clinically relevant question. That is whether Heliox21&#xD;
      helps to reduce the effort of breathing in the period following withdrawal of mechanically&#xD;
      assisted ventilation in patients on the intensive care unit.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Failure to wean from mechanical ventilatory support occurs when the magnitude of respiratory&#xD;
      system loading exceeds its capacity to respond. Extubation success depends on the condition&#xD;
      being resolved or improved. Gas exchange capacity, respiratory muscle strength, laryngeal&#xD;
      function and cough strength, nutritional status and psychological state can all lead to&#xD;
      extubation failure. However, efforts to reduce the work of breathing might offer an&#xD;
      alternative strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies recently carried out in both paediatric and adult populations disclose the serious&#xD;
      consequences of failed extubation, namely prolonged intensive care and hospital stays,&#xD;
      greater mortality rates and increased care costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gas flow in an airway can be either laminar or turbulent. There needs to be a greater&#xD;
      pressure differential to drive a turbulent flow than a laminar one. Helium is an inert gas&#xD;
      with no systemic biological effects (at standard temperature and pressure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The low density and viscosity of Helium means that its substitution for nitrogen in air&#xD;
      allows laminar flow to be maintained at much higher flow rates, and flow rates to be&#xD;
      maintained at much lower working pressures (5). As a result, the use of helium-oxygen&#xD;
      mixtures (Heliox21) has potential to reduce work of breathing, and also to limit dynamic gas&#xD;
      trapping through increased cavity emptying, and altered lung mechanics/ forced expiratory&#xD;
      pressures. As a result, Heliox21 has been used as a respiratory therapeutic bridge for over&#xD;
      30 years, with demonstrable advantage in the management of conditions including tracheal&#xD;
      obstruction and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In theory, the use of Heliox21 should reduce work of breathing by improving the balance&#xD;
      between work demand and capacity during the process of weaning patients from mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation. In general studies of the use of Heliox21 after extubation have been limited.&#xD;
      Thus, we aim to extend our knowledge of the potential role for Heliox21 in the&#xD;
      post-extubation environment of the Intensive Care Unit. Whilst Heliox21 has generally been&#xD;
      administered through a simple face-mask (+/- rebreathing bag), the development of the&#xD;
      HAMILTON G5 AVEA ventilator now allows the accurate administration of Heliox21 (21%&#xD;
      helium/79% oxygen) with defined inspired fractional oxygen concentrations. This advent offers&#xD;
      the means to safely administer helium as an adjunct to non-invasive ventilatory support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with a predicted requirement for post extubation non-invasive ventilatory&#xD;
      support continuous positive airway pressure/bilevel positive airway pressure/noninvasive&#xD;
      ventilation(CPAP/BiPAP/NIV) will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference between the frequency to tidal volume (f/VT) ratio* after four hours of&#xD;
      Heliox21 and the f/VT ratio after four hours of Air O2.&#xD;
