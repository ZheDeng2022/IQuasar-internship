      The aim of this trial is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of penicillin&#xD;
      V in non-infectious children to estimate the optimum dosage regime in children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although occasionally questioned, the efficacy of penicillin in eradication of respiratory&#xD;
      tract infections in children has not been convincingly reported in the literature. Two&#xD;
      randomized multicenter antibiotic efficacy trials have been reported in eradication of group&#xD;
      A streptococci where both oral and intramuscular administration of penicillin had relatively&#xD;
      high microbiologic failure rates. But the trials only confirm that the treatment is not&#xD;
      effective in the given dose. The recent recommendations on penicillin are unfortunately based&#xD;
      upon past practices, clinical trial results and recent resistance trends and pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      have not been considered to support the choice of drug and dosage regimen. Some&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic trials have been made on meropenem, cefotaxime, piperacillin-tazobactam and&#xD;
      amoxicillin in children but so fare no trials have been described on penicillin. It is well&#xD;
      described in adults but the absorption and secretion might be depended on age. Penicillin&#xD;
      exhibit a time-dependent killing which means that the time over minimal inhibitory&#xD;
      concentration (MIC) is the parameter best related to efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of penicillin V in&#xD;
      non-infectious Danish children at age 0-10 years who were admitted for a&#xD;
      chromium-51-EDTA-clearance test. The investigators excluded children with allergy to&#xD;
      penicillin and children with a prior known reduced glomerular filtration rate. The parents of&#xD;
      each child who participated gave written informed consent before the study and ethical&#xD;
      approval was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antimicrobial dosage and administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 children were assigned to receive per oral penicillin suspension 22-32 mg/kg. The dosage&#xD;
      was estimated 25 mg/kg by the weight the parents rapported and they had a weight control at&#xD;
      admission. The exact given dose was then calculated. The penicillin were not taken on an&#xD;
      empty stomach to imitate reality as much as possible and the time of administration was&#xD;
      noted. Another 40 children were given 50 mg/kg penicillin mixture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blod samples of 1 ml were taken after 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 minutes after the Crom-EDTA&#xD;
      examination had started giving a dispersion in time compared to the intake of penicillin. The&#xD;
      samples were collected in vacuum tubes containing EDTA as an anticoagulant and then&#xD;
      centrifuged quickly. The separated serum were placed in cryovials before frozen.&#xD;
