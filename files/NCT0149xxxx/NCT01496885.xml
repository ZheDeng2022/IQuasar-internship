    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Total Simplified-STroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement (S-STREAM) Score in Participants Obtained Between 24 and 48 Hours of a Non-hemorrhagic Ischemic Stroke</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 84 post non-hemorrhagic ischemic stroke</time_frame>
    <description>The S-STREAM is composed of 5 items each across 3 components (upper limb movements, lower limb movements, and mobility). Limb movements are scored on a scale ranging from 0 (unable to perform) to 2 (able to complete the movement comparable to the unaffected side). Basic mobility items are scored on a scale ranging from 0 (unable to perform) to 3 (able to complete the activity). All S-STREAM scores were transformed to a range of 0 to 100 via Rasch transformation since the S-STREAM fit the requirements of the Rasch model. The raw scores were Rasch transformed to achieve logits scores and then remapped from the logit score to a 0 to 100 scale, where 0 indicates worst outcome and 100 indicate best outcome.&#xD;
The mean change from baseline in S-STREAM Rasch-transformed score is being reported; higher S-STREAM scores indicate better outcomes.</description>

    <description>The S-STREAM is composed of 5 items each across 3 components (upper limb movements, lower limb movements, and mobility). Limb movements are scored on a 3-point integer scale ranging from 0 (unable to perform) to 2 (able to complete the movement comparable to the unaffected side). Basic mobility items are scored on a 4-point integer scale ranging from 0 (unable to perform) to 3 (able to complete the activity). All S-STREAM scores were transformed to a range of 0 to 100 via Rasch transformation since the S-STREAM has been shown to fit the requirements of the Rasch model. The raw scores were Rasch transformed to get the logits scores and then remapped from the logit score to a 0 to 100 scale, where 0 indicates worst outcome and 100 indicate best outcome.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants Obtained Between 24 and 48 Hours of a Non-hemorrhagic Ischemic Stroke With Total Simplified-STroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement (S-STREAM) Score, by Category</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 84 post non-hemorrhagic ischemic stroke</time_frame>
    <description>The S-STREAM is composed of 5 items each across 3 components (upper limb movements, lower limb movements, and mobility). The S-STREAM assessments are conducted in the order of the following positions: supine, sitting, and standing. Limb movements are scored on a 3-point integer scale ranging from 0 (unable to perform) to 2 (able to complete the movement comparable to the unaffected side). Basic mobility items are scored on a 4-point integer scale ranging from 0 (unable to perform) to 3 (able to complete the activity). Based on the point scales described, the maximum score for upper limb movements is 10, for lower limb movements is 10, and for mobility is 15; the maximum aggregate S-STREAM raw score is therefore 35. Higher S-STREAM scores indicated better outcome. Total S-STREAM scores were generated using Rasch transformations and subsequently scaled to scores between 0 and 100 for purposes of analysis with higher total S-STREAM scores indicating a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) Score in Participants Obtained Between 24 and 48 Hours of a Non-hemorrhagic Ischemic Stroke</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 84 post non-hemorrhagic ischemic stroke</time_frame>
    <description>The NIHSS is a stroke deficit assessment scale composed of 11 components, where a score of 0 is defined as normal while higher scores indicate increasing severity of impairment for each component. Components include level of consciousness (3 evaluations, 2 of which are scored 0 to 2 and 1 of which is scored 0 to 3), best gaze (scored 0 to 2), visual (scored 0 to 3), facial palsy (scored 0 to 3), motor arm (scored 0 to 4 in both arms), motor leg (scored 0 to 4 in both legs), limb ataxia (scored 0 to 2), sensory (scored 0 to 2), best language (scored 0 to 3), dysarthria (scored 0 to 2), and extinction and inattention (scored 0 to 2). The total NIHSS score is calculated by summing individual scores. The maximum total score on the NIHSS is 42 and the level of stroke severity ranges from 0 (normal, no stroke) to 42 (severe stroke). Higher NIHSS scores indicate worse outcome.&#xD;
The mean change from baseline is also being reported; the greater the negative value, the better the outcome.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female participants between 21 and 85 years, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants had no prior history of stroke (unless the stroke was silent or not&#xD;
             associated with a motor deficit) presented between 24 and 48 hours from onset with an&#xD;
             acute stroke with clinical assessments and imaging studies (conducted as part of the&#xD;
             standard of care procedures in stroke patients) indicating that the stroke was&#xD;
             ischemic, with no secondary hemorrhage large enough to exert a mass effect that would&#xD;
             contribute significantly to the neurological deficit (small punctate hemorrhages were&#xD;
             permitted), in the vascular distribution of the middle cerebral artery and not&#xD;
             classifiable as a lacunar stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants understood and agreed to comply with the requirements of the study and&#xD;
             they were willing to provide verbal/nonverbal informed consent indicating voluntary&#xD;
             consent to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants were to have scored at least 16 on the Mini Mental Status Examination&#xD;
             (MMSE) at screening. If the participant had an expressive aphasia and was unable to&#xD;
             qualify based on the MMSE, the participant may have been evaluated with a&#xD;
             language-modified form of the MMSE1 in conjunction with the investigator's clinical&#xD;
             assessment that the participant was cognitively able to complete study procedures and&#xD;
             stroke scales to determine eligibility. If the aphasia was too severe for the&#xD;
             participant to complete the language-modified MMSE, the participant was excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants had to have a total score between 20 and 85, inclusive, on the S-STREAM&#xD;
             administered between 24 and 48 hours after stroke onset&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of previous stroke; uncontrolled severe hypertension; dementia; advanced&#xD;
             Parkinson disease or other significant movement disorders; or other clinically&#xD;
             significant diseases which, in the opinion of the investigator, would have jeopardized&#xD;
             the safety of the participant or impacted the validity of the study results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Development of hemodynamic instability following the stroke as manifested by a&#xD;
             persistent post stroke systolic blood pressure less than 80 mm Hg (or was dependent on&#xD;
             medications to maintain a systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 80 mm Hg)&#xD;
             or greater than 190 mm Hg at the time of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of significant global or receptive aphasia that would have interfered with&#xD;
             the participant's ability to understand and comply with study procedures or complete&#xD;
             stroke assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal clinical laboratory values on routine clinical laboratory test values at&#xD;
             screening including alanine transaminase or aspartate transaminase greater than or&#xD;
             equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal, serum creatinine greater than or equal to&#xD;
             3.0 mg/dL, or hemoglobin less than or equal to 10 g/dL, or any other laboratory&#xD;
             investigation deemed by the investigator to be indicative of a clinically significant&#xD;
             illness that could have prevented the participant from complying with study procedures&#xD;
             or impacted on the outcome of the stroke scales&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of any surgery or presence of any medical condition that, in the judgment of&#xD;
             the investigator, may have affected the validity of the study results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current participation in another clinical study involving administration of an&#xD;
             investigational product or history of such participation within 30 days of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to complete baseline S-STREAM and NIHSS assessments within 48 hours of stroke&#xD;
             onset&#xD;

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Total Simplified-STroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement (S-STREAM) Score in Participants Obtained Between 24 and 48 Hours of a Non-hemorrhagic Ischemic Stroke</title>
        <description>The S-STREAM is composed of 5 items each across 3 components (upper limb movements, lower limb movements, and mobility). Limb movements are scored on a scale ranging from 0 (unable to perform) to 2 (able to complete the movement comparable to the unaffected side). Basic mobility items are scored on a scale ranging from 0 (unable to perform) to 3 (able to complete the activity). All S-STREAM scores were transformed to a range of 0 to 100 via Rasch transformation since the S-STREAM fit the requirements of the Rasch model. The raw scores were Rasch transformed to achieve logits scores and then remapped from the logit score to a 0 to 100 scale, where 0 indicates worst outcome and 100 indicate best outcome.&#xD;
The mean change from baseline in S-STREAM Rasch-transformed score is being reported; higher S-STREAM scores indicate better outcomes.</description>

        <title>Mean Percent Change From Baseline in Total Simplified-STroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement (S-STREAM) Score in Participants Obtained Between 24 and 48 Hours of a Non-hemorrhagic Ischemic Stroke</title>
        <description>The S-STREAM is composed of 5 items each across 3 components (upper limb movements, lower limb movements, and mobility). Limb movements are scored on a 3-point integer scale ranging from 0 (unable to perform) to 2 (able to complete the movement comparable to the unaffected side). Basic mobility items are scored on a 4-point integer scale ranging from 0 (unable to perform) to 3 (able to complete the activity). All S-STREAM scores were transformed to a range of 0 to 100 via Rasch transformation since the S-STREAM has been shown to fit the requirements of the Rasch model. The raw scores were Rasch transformed to get the logits scores and then remapped from the logit score to a 0 to 100 scale, where 0 indicates worst outcome and 100 indicate best outcome.&#xD;
The mean percent change from baseline in S-STREAM Rasch transformed score is being reported; higher S-STREAM scores indicate better outcomes.</description>

        <description>The S-STREAM is composed of 5 items each across 3 components (upper limb movements, lower limb movements, and mobility). The S-STREAM assessments are conducted in the order of the following positions: supine, sitting, and standing. Limb movements are scored on a 3-point integer scale ranging from 0 (unable to perform) to 2 (able to complete the movement comparable to the unaffected side). Basic mobility items are scored on a 4-point integer scale ranging from 0 (unable to perform) to 3 (able to complete the activity). Based on the point scales described, the maximum score for upper limb movements is 10, for lower limb movements is 10, and for mobility is 15; the maximum aggregate S-STREAM raw score is therefore 35. Higher S-STREAM scores indicated better outcome. Total S-STREAM scores were generated using Rasch transformations and subsequently scaled to scores between 0 and 100 for purposes of analysis with higher total S-STREAM scores indicating a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Subgroup Analysis of Total S-STREAM Score and Mean Change From Baseline to Day 84 in Participants Obtained Between 24 and 48 Hours of a Non-hemorrhagic Ischemic Stroke</title>
        <description>The S-STREAM is composed of 5 items each across 3 components (upper limb movements, lower limb movements, and mobility). Limb movements are scored on a 3-point integer scale ranging from 0 (unable to perform) to 2 (able to complete the movement comparable to the unaffected side). Basic mobility items are scored on a 4-point integer scale ranging from 0 (unable to perform) to 3 (able to complete the activity). All S-STREAM scores were transformed to a range of 0 to 100 via Rasch transformation since the S-STREAM has been shown to fit the requirements of the Rasch model. The raw scores were Rasch transformed to get the logits scores and then remapped from the logit score to a 0 to 100 scale, where 0 indicates worst outcome and 100 indicate best outcome.&#xD;
The mean change from baseline in S-STREAM Rasch-transformed score is being reported; higher S-STREAM scores indicate better outcomes.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) Score in Participants Obtained Between 24 and 48 Hours of a Non-hemorrhagic Ischemic Stroke</title>
        <description>The NIHSS is a stroke deficit assessment scale composed of 11 components, where a score of 0 is defined as normal while higher scores indicate increasing severity of impairment for each component. Components include level of consciousness (3 evaluations, 2 of which are scored 0 to 2 and 1 of which is scored 0 to 3), best gaze (scored 0 to 2), visual (scored 0 to 3), facial palsy (scored 0 to 3), motor arm (scored 0 to 4 in both arms), motor leg (scored 0 to 4 in both legs), limb ataxia (scored 0 to 2), sensory (scored 0 to 2), best language (scored 0 to 3), dysarthria (scored 0 to 2), and extinction and inattention (scored 0 to 2). The total NIHSS score is calculated by summing individual scores. The maximum total score on the NIHSS is 42 and the level of stroke severity ranges from 0 (normal, no stroke) to 42 (severe stroke). Higher NIHSS scores indicate worse outcome.&#xD;
The mean change from baseline is also being reported; the greater the negative value, the better the outcome.</description>
