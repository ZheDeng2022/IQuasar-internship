    <textblock>
      This trial will find the best dose of mifepristone when given together with nab-paclitaxel&#xD;
      (Abraxane) based on the side effects of the two drugs in patients with advanced breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to receive nab-paclitaxel with or without mifepristone during the&#xD;
      first treatment cycle. After the first cycle, all patients will receive nab-paclitaxel with&#xD;
      mifepristone until their disease worsens or they experience an unacceptable side effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test up to 4 doses of mifepristone in combination with nab-paclitaxel. The&#xD;
      study will first test the lowest dose in a small group of patients and if they do not have&#xD;
      bad side effects, higher doses will be tested.&#xD;
