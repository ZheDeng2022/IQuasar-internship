  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this proposed randomized study is to determine if surgery at the time of&#xD;
      diagnosis or rehabilitation +/- surgery (i.e. surgery only when rehabilitation fails) results&#xD;
      in shorter times to claim closure. The study will examine how often non-operative management&#xD;
      is successful in resolving symptoms and allowing subjects to return to work without surgery.&#xD;
      The investigators will also examine if there are subject, tear or work-related&#xD;
      characteristics that affect the outcome of rehabilitation or expedited surgery and predict&#xD;
      whether patients should be referred to operative or non-operative management at time of&#xD;
      assessment. At study completion, the investigators expect to be able to definitively state&#xD;
      the best management for subjects with these less serious RC tears.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific research questions to be addressed are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In WCB subjects with high grade partial thickness (&gt;50%) or small full thickness (≤ 1&#xD;
           cm.) rotator cuff tears, how does non-operative management (i.e. rehabilitation) or&#xD;
           expedited surgery affect time to claim closure?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Are there subject, tear or work-related characteristics that affect which patient&#xD;
           management approach will be most effective and efficient?&#xD;

      Design/Setting The present study will be a multi-center prospective, randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial examining WCB patients presenting to Orthopaedic specialists for RC pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients with an active WCB claim, presenting with a confirmed high-grade (&gt;50%)&#xD;
      partial-thickness or small (≤1cm) full-thickness RC tear, will be eligible for the study.&#xD;
      Informed consent will be attained from WCB patients attending orthopaedic clinics in the&#xD;
      Greater Edmonton and Greater Winnipeg areas. The complete list of inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria is as follows:&#xD;

        2. Patient has an active WCB Claim&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient has a high-grade (&gt;50%) partial-thickness or small (&lt;1cm) full-thickness tear of&#xD;
           the supraspinatus and/or infraspinatus, as confirmed by appropriate diagnostic imaging&#xD;
           (MRI, Arthrogram, Ultrasound)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
        7. Patient has evidence of significant cuff arthropathy (superior glenohumeral translation&#xD;
           and/or acromial erosion, as diagnosed by diagnostic imaging)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Patient has a psychiatric illness, cognitive impairment, or other health condition (i.e.&#xD;
           visual impairment) which precludes informed consent or renders the patient unable to&#xD;
           complete study questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Patient has a major medical illness where life expectancy is less than 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Patient does not speak/read/understand English&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Patient has no fixed address or means of contact&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Patient unwilling to complete necessary follow-ups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment Procedures Immediately following orthopedic consultation or consultation with a&#xD;
      screening physician, the patient will be introduced to the study. If the patient expresses&#xD;
      interest, the Research Coordinator will discuss the study in detail (goals, requirements of&#xD;
      patients, expected outcomes, benefits, risks) with the patient. Informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from interested patients. It is expected that the patient will see the orthopaedic&#xD;
      surgeon within three-six months of the initial presenting incident.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Evaluation Consented patients will undergo a pre-operative assessment by a study&#xD;
      physical therapist. The assessment will consist of 1) shoulder ROM, 2) shoulder strength&#xD;
      using a handheld myometer (microFET3, Hoggan Health Industries Inc., West Jordan, UT), 3)&#xD;
      demographic (age, gender, height, weight, handedness, smoking status, recreational sports,&#xD;
      date of injury, mechanism of injury) data, and 4) work-related questions (i.e. occupation,&#xD;
      employment status, type of work performed). The subject will also complete the Western&#xD;
      Ontario Rotator Cuff (WORC) Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Upon completion of the baseline assessment (to ensure blinding), patients will&#xD;
      randomized to one of two study groups. Randomization will be stratified by type of tear (full&#xD;
      vs. partial thickness), and by surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in Group A (non-operative) will be referred to physical therapy (PT). Patients in&#xD;
      Group B (expedited surgery) will be booked for surgery, to be completed as soon as possible&#xD;
      (within 3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Group A (non-operative) will complete a standardized PT regime. The therapy&#xD;
      program recommended by WCB in Winnipeg will be followed and compliance with the program will&#xD;
      be monitored. Typically, it will consist of ROM, strengthening, scapular stabilization and&#xD;
      functional exercises, as well as pain control modalities and manual therapy techniques, as&#xD;
      appropriate. Assessments will take place weekly by the treating therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If subjects show no sign of progression, the rehabilitation regimen will stop at 6 weeks and&#xD;
      subjects will return to the orthopaedic surgeon for a discussion of further treatment&#xD;
      options, including surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No progression will be determined by the following: the subject's total WORC score has&#xD;
      changed less than 10% from previous assessment(baseline) and the treating PT indicates that&#xD;
      the shoulder has not improved or worsened (using a global rating of change questionnaire -&#xD;
      See attached document).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If subjects have made progress in PT, treatment will continue for an additional 4-6 weeks&#xD;
      with weekly assessments of progress. PT can continue for as long as indicated, including&#xD;
      after subject's return to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If at any time, the subject is determined to have stopped progressing in PT (based on&#xD;
      comparison to previous visit) and require further evaluation, he/her will return the&#xD;
      orthopaedic surgeon for a discussion of further options including surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B (expedited surgery) will receive rotator cuff repair surgery. At the time of surgery,&#xD;
      the attending surgeon will record the RC defect and repair details using a standardized form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Evaluations Group A1- Effective Non-operative Management: Research re-assessments&#xD;
      will be conducted by a study physical therapist at 6 and 12 weeks, and again at 6 and 12&#xD;
      months after commencing PT. These re-assessments will repeat the measurements taken at the&#xD;
      baseline evaluation and will also include a form on return to work status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A2- Failed Non-operative Management: If the subjects in the non-operative group fail to&#xD;
      progress at any point in the PT program, they will return to the orthopaedic surgeon for&#xD;
      discussion of further treatment options, including surgery. Re-assessments will occur at the&#xD;
      same intervals as Group A1 until such time as they receive surgery (if within the initial&#xD;
      12-month follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If these candidates are deemed operative and undergo surgery, they will then be followed at&#xD;
      the same postoperative intervals as the expedited surgery group (namely 6 and 12weeks and&#xD;
      again at 6 and 12 months postoperatively) However, the postoperative follow-up on subjects&#xD;
      who cross over to the surgery group from the non-operative group may be less than 12 months&#xD;
      as the study will stop when the last expedited surgery subject has reached 12 months&#xD;
      postoperative to prevent delays in completing the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B- Expedited Surgery: Research re-assessments will be conducted by a study physical&#xD;
      therapist at 6 and 12 weeks, and again at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. At 6 and 12 weeks,&#xD;
      only ROM and the WORC score will be completed as well as their work status. At 6 and 12&#xD;
      months postoperatively, the re-assessments will repeat all measurements taken at the baseline&#xD;
      evaluation and will also include a form on return to work status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes The primary outcome in the present study will be time to return to final work&#xD;
      status. The secondary outcome will be time to return to any work status (i.e. modified&#xD;
      duties). Finally, we will also evaluate the characteristics (demographic, tear-, and&#xD;
      work-related, ROM and strength, self-efficacy) associated with a successful outcomes among&#xD;
      patients in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of the study is to determine whether PT followed by surgery or expedited&#xD;
      surgery result in a faster return to work after injury and which of these approaches are&#xD;
      associated with the best patient outcomes within 12-months. We also hope to identify if there&#xD;
      are sub-groups for which one approach is more effective than the other to allow optimal&#xD;
      delivery of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures Time to Return to Work To answer our primary research question, time to&#xD;
      return to work (in days) will be calculated. This will be defined as the interval from the&#xD;
      date of orthopedic consultation/screening to final return to work status. We will also&#xD;
      determine the time to any return to work status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics At each patient's pre-operative (baseline) assessment, a complete list of&#xD;
      demographic information will be recorded. These include the patient's contact information,&#xD;
      age, gender, height, weight, handedness, smoking status, date of injury, injury mechanism,&#xD;
      occupation, employment status, type of work performed, and any recreational sports&#xD;
      (type/frequency) competing in. Patients will also be asked about the particulars of any&#xD;
      previous physical therapy regimen (where, start/stop dates, how many sessions attended), as&#xD;
      well as any other non-operative treatments (cortisone, massage therapy, chiropractic,&#xD;
      acupuncture).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Range of Motion Range of motion (ROM) assessments will be conducted by the study physical&#xD;
      therapist and will performed for shoulder flexion, abduction, external rotation (neutral&#xD;
      abduction, 90° elbow flexion), external rotation (90° abduction, 90° elbow flexion), and&#xD;
      internal rotation (90° abduction, 90° elbow flexion). Active and passive ROM will be measured&#xD;
      for both the operative and unaffected shoulder. ROM values will be expressed as raw values,&#xD;
      as well as percentage of ROM compared to the unaffected shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strength Strength assessments will also be conducted by the study physical therapist at the&#xD;
      baseline, 6-month, and 12-month intervals. Isometric shoulder flexion, abduction, external&#xD;
      rotation and internal rotation will be measured with the patient's arm in neutral (neutral&#xD;
      abduction, 90° elbow flexion). Strength will be measured using a dynamometer. Peak values&#xD;
      will be recorded during each contraction, to be held for 3 seconds each. Strength values will&#xD;
      be expressed as raw values, as well as percentage of strength compared to the unaffected&#xD;
      shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WORC Index The Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC)[9] is a five-part (physical&#xD;
      symptoms, sports/recreation, work, lifestyle, emotions), 21-item, disease-specific&#xD;
      questionnaire which assesses quality of life among patients with RC pathology. This index has&#xD;
      been shown to be valid, reliable and responsive in the rotator cuff patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orebro Musculoskeletal Pain Questionnaire The Orebro Musculoskeletal Pain Questionnaire&#xD;
      (OMPQ) is a validated instrument that examines subject's ability to manage their pain during&#xD;
      daily life. It is predictive of the subject's ability to return to work following injury and&#xD;
      will be used at the initial assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation Currently, mean WCB claim duration for Albertan RC patients is&#xD;
      approximately 9 months (270 days) [8]. In order to have statistical power of 85% and to&#xD;
      detect a 10% difference in this outcome (deemed clinically important to the WCB and its&#xD;
      stakeholders) [8] between groups (s=49 days; a=0.05; b=0.15), 60 patients will be required&#xD;
      per group. In order to allow for subject attrition, patients who may not complete all&#xD;
      assessments due to early WCB claim closure, and to allow adequate power for subsequent&#xD;
      multivariate regression modeling, a 20% over-sample rate will be applied. Therefore, a total&#xD;
      of 132 patients will be recruited (66 per group) [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis All study data will come from primary sources (patient assessments, surgical&#xD;
      report forms, date of return to work at modified or full work status).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics (frequency, mean, standard deviation) will be calculated for all study&#xD;
      variables. Level of statistical significance will be set at α=0.05. All analyses will be&#xD;
      performed using Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 16.0 (SPSS Inc.;&#xD;
      Chicago, IL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three different analyses will take place. The first analysis, to address the primary research&#xD;
      question, will count the days from screening/orthopaedic surgeon consultation to return to&#xD;
      final work status (e.g can be either full or modified duties). In this analysis, subjects in&#xD;
      the non-operative group will be considered as 1 group regardless of whether or not they&#xD;
      eventually undergo surgery. If subjects have not yet returned to work when the study is&#xD;
      deemed completed, they will be given the maximum span of days in the study (i.e. from entry&#xD;
      to last date of study). This analysis will give the overall comparison of expedited surgery&#xD;
      vs. initial non-operative management +/- surgical intervention, (which reflects the current&#xD;
      standard of care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second analysis will look at what proportion of subjects 'fail' non-operative management.&#xD;
      In this analysis, we will also try to identify what characteristics are associated with&#xD;
      successful non-operative management vs. failed non-operative management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third analysis will examine outcomes amongst those who had successful non-operative&#xD;
      management, those who received expedited surgery and those who underwent initial&#xD;
      non-operative management followed by surgical intervention. This will allow us to determine&#xD;
      the impact of delaying surgery on subjects' final outcome and if surgery results in different&#xD;
      outcomes than non-operative management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the present project will assess human subjects, ethics approval will be obtained from the&#xD;
      institutional Research Ethics Boards (REB) at the University of Manitoba and University of&#xD;
      Alberta.&#xD;
