      OBJECTIVES: Main objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of plasma rich in growth factors&#xD;
      (PRGF) in the treatment of patients with venous ulcers. Secondary objective: To evaluate the&#xD;
      safety of plasma rich in growth factors in treating patients with venous ulcers. DESIGN:&#xD;
      Randomized, open clinical trial in parallel groups, controlled with conventional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE: Over age patients, of primary care centers of Vitoria, with at least one venous&#xD;
      ulcers of 6 or more weeks of evolution and 0.5-6 cm of diameter. INTERVENTION: 1-Experimental&#xD;
      group: Autologous PRGF administrated once a week (day 1) + conventional treatment&#xD;
      administrated twice a week (days 1 and 4)for 12 weeks of treatment, but in those cases where&#xD;
      there has been no complete healing in this period, patients will continue the same management&#xD;
      protocol to get it. 2-Control group: Conventional treatment twice a week (days 1 and 4)for 12&#xD;
      weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional treatment includes: Cleaning and debridement of the wound, the application of&#xD;
      corresponding dressing, and using of antibiotic if necessary in each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:The primary outcome analysis was done by logistic regression. The crude&#xD;
      model and the adjusted model (for confounding variables)will be built. The healing time of&#xD;
      ulcers (in days) were analyzed using the Kaplan Meier survival analysis and the corresponding&#xD;
      comparison using the log rank test.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An open, randomized, of parallel groups, and controlled clinical trial. Patients will be&#xD;
      allocated on first come to one of the two treatment groups using a block random sequence&#xD;
      generated by computer that will remain hidden from the researchers and patients until&#xD;
      allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group: PRGF together with the corresponding dressing according to annex IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: Corresponding dressing according to annex IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will be submitted to a cleaning, debridement, occlusive dressing and use of&#xD;
      antibiotic if necessary in each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing consent form, and previously of randomization, patients will be submitted to a&#xD;
      blood extraction where it will be determinate: Albumine (in g/dl), Hemoglobin (in g/dl),&#xD;
      Hematocrit (in %), Creatinine (in mg/dl). If patients have data collected through previous&#xD;
      analysis performed until 30 days before, it will not be necessary a new extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be also submitted to an initial valuation of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medical antecedents: history of chronic venous insufficiency, previous medical&#xD;
           treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  general state: dependence grade through Barthel index, mobility, ankle arm index.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ulcer characteristics:exudate, sing of location of ulcer, antiquity of ulcer,&#xD;
           tunneling,infection, pain through a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometric characteristics; Weight, height and Body Mass Index (BMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will go to the physician's consult every fours days (on Monday or Tuesday and&#xD;
      Thursday or Friday). When one ulcer is closed, patient will go to physician's consult to&#xD;
      confirm that it remains closed at seven and fifteen days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both intervention and control groups, the bad evolution of ulcer with deterioration at&#xD;
      least during four consecutive weeks, will obligate to ask a preferred inter-consultation with&#xD;
      Vascular Surgery Service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each visit the following variables will be measured:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wound surface (in cm2) measured through PUSH scale (Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing)&#xD;
           belonging to GNEAUPP group (National Group to study and advice about pressure ulcers and&#xD;
           chronic wounds). This variable will be measured in each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety variable: Pruritus (Yes/No), Pain (through VAS scale), Sings of infection&#xD;
           (Yes/No).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patient experience one adverse effect which according to judgment of nurse precludes its&#xD;
      continuation into the study, the nurse will communicate it to physician who will discharge&#xD;
      from study if it is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All this will be collected in Case Report Form (CRF).&#xD;
