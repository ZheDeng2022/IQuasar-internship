    <textblock>
      Our group wishes to test the novel hypothesis that intraoperative use of ketorolac in&#xD;
      pediatric patients undergoing tonsillectomy reduces post-operative nausea and vomiting,&#xD;
      postoperative pain scores, subsequent narcotic use, and length of hospital stay without&#xD;
      adversely affecting post-operative bleed risk, when compared to placebo, in a double-blind,&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Intraoperative analgesia has a tremendous theoretical potential to decrease postoperative&#xD;
      pain, and thus narcotic requirement and length of subsequent hospital stay. There is indeed a&#xD;
      dearth of evidence with respect to the clinical effectiveness of such analgesia.&#xD;
      Tonsillectomy lends itself particularly well to the use of intraoperative analgesia;&#xD;
      post-operative pain scores are high, and the majority of recipients are pediatric patients-a&#xD;
      population in which minimization of post-operative narcotic use is a priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of intraoperative analgesia for the preemptive management of postoperative&#xD;
      pain, nausea and vomiting in tonsillectomy remains controversial. Pre-emptive analgesia was&#xD;
      first conceptualized in 1983, with Woolf's work on a postulated central component of&#xD;
      postinjury pain hypersensitivity. Tissue injury is typified by post-stimulus sensory&#xD;
      disturbances that give rise to continuing pain, a hypersensitivity to further noxious&#xD;
      stimuli, as well as pain in response to otherwise innocuous stimuli. These features are&#xD;
      attributable to both a reduction in the threshold of skin nociceptors, as well as an increase&#xD;
      in the excitability of the central nervous system (CNS) to noxious stimuli. Much experimental&#xD;
      data has shown pre-injury analgesia as being superior to post-injury analgesia in terms of&#xD;
      minimizing subsequent CNS excitability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically, the effectiveness of such analgesia has shown to be highly variable with respect&#xD;
      to anatomical area, surgical type, as well as analgesic used and its route of administration.&#xD;
      A Meta-analysis by Cliff et al. reviewed 66 studies with respect to the primary outcomes of&#xD;
      pain intensity scores, supplemental analgesic consumption, and time to first analgesic&#xD;
      consumption, and demonstrated that preemptive administration of NSAIDs was superior to that&#xD;
      of epidural analgesia, local anesthetic wound infiltration, systemic NMDA receptor&#xD;
      antagonists, and systemic opiods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketorolac tromethamine (Toradol) is a parenteral, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that&#xD;
      has been used extensively to provide postoperative analgesia. In a prospective, randomized&#xD;
      double-blind study of 57 children undergoing outpatient adenotonsillectomy, Keidan et al.&#xD;
      found ketorolac to be comparable to fentanyl in terms of both post-operative nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting and pain scores. One study showed that intraoperative ketorolac (60 mg IV) with&#xD;
      fentanyl (2 micrograms/kg IV), compared to fentanyl and placebo, administered at the&#xD;
      induction of anesthesia resulted in significant opioid sparing, decreased pain scores, lower&#xD;
      incidence of nausea and vomiting and earlier discharge compared to fentanyl and placebo in&#xD;
      patients undergoing diagnostic laparoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a theoretical risk of post-operative bleeding with use of Toradol, on account of its&#xD;
      inhibition of platelet aggregation and prolonging of bleeding time. However, in a&#xD;
      meta-analysis of 13 trials comprising 955 children undergoing tonsillectomy, Cardwell et al.&#xD;
      found that postoperative NSAIDs did not significantly alter number of perioperative bleeding&#xD;
      events requiring surgical intervention. At present, it is common practice by some clinicians&#xD;
      at the Stollery Children's hospital for pediatric patients who are undergoing standard&#xD;
      electrocautery adenotonsillectomy to receive intraoperative ketorolac. Its role in improving&#xD;
      post-operative pain and possible risk of increasing post-operative bleeding remains&#xD;
      controversial.&#xD;
