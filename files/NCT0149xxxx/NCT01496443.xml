  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetics and safety of TAK-875, once&#xD;
      daily (QD), with and without glimepiride in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      (T2DM).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TAK-875 is being developed at Takeda Global Research and Development, Inc. as an adjunct to&#xD;
      diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in participants with T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will determine whether administration of glimepiride alters the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (PK) of TAK-875, and whether TAK-875 affects the PK of glimepiride.&#xD;
