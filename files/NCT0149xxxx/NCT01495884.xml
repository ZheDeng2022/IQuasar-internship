    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I/II open label, multi-centre trial. Patients with HER2+ve metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer, following disease progression during, or after, treatment with trastuzumab and&#xD;
      taxanes, will be treated with Lapatinib (Tyverb™ 500-1250 mg orally daily - depending on the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) determined in the Phase I part of the study) plus Myocet™, 50-60&#xD;
      mg/m2 i.v q3 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the Phase I part, doses are assigned at registration according to the dose escalation&#xD;
      scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose for the Phase II part of the trial will be based on the MTD established in the Phase&#xD;
      I part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and laboratory parameters will be assessed to evaluate disease response and toxicity&#xD;
      of study therapy. Safety assessments will be performed every 3 weeks for the first 24 weeks.&#xD;
      Efficacy assessments (radiological examination) will be performed on all patients every 8&#xD;
      weeks (± 7 days) for the first 24 weeks. Cardiotoxicity assessments will be performed at&#xD;
      weeks 6 and 12. From week 24, safety, efficacy and cardiotoxicity assessments will be&#xD;
      performed every 12 weeks and at the end of treatment (disease progression, unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity or patient withdraws consent).&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the optimal dose for lapatinib plus Myocet™, in combination, in patients&#xD;
           with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer following disease progression during, or&#xD;
           after, treatment with trastuzumab and taxanes (Phase I).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the 6 month progression-free survival of patients with HER2-positive&#xD;
           metastatic breast cancer, following disease progression during, or after, treatment with&#xD;
           trastuzumab and taxanes, who are treated with lapatinib plus Myocet™ (Phase II plus&#xD;
           patients treated at MTD in Phase I).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the overall survival time, duration of progression -free survival, time to&#xD;
           treatment failure, confirmed tumour response rate and duration of response in patients&#xD;
           treated with this regimen (Phase II plus patients treated at MTD in Phase I).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the incidence of cardiotoxicity in these patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
