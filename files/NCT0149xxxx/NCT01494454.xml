Evidence of bridging trabecular bone.&#xD;
No evidence of motion as defined by: a. No more than 3mm difference in translation on the lateral flexion/extension radiographs as determined by superimposing the two views, one upon the other; b. Less than 5° difference in angular motion between flexion and extension as seen on the lateral flexion/extension radiographs;&#xD;
Absence of radiolucent lines completely through the fusion mass.</description>

    <measure>Pain/Disability Status</measure>
    <time_frame>24 month</time_frame>
    <description>The self-administered Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire will be used.

    <measure>Neurological status</measure>
    <time_frame>24 month</time_frame>
    <description>Neurological status will be assessed preoperatively and postoperatively using a comprehensive neurological status scale. Neurological status is based on four types of measurements (sections): motor, sensory, reflexes and straight leg raise.</description>
