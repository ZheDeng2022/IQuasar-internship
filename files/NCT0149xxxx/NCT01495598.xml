    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Pomalidomide is a drug that can treat cancer through several mechanisms. It is taken by&#xD;
      mouth (orally). Pomalidomide can help treat cancer by blocking certain factors that promote&#xD;
      tumor growth or by stimulating the immune system to attack tumor cells. It also prevents the&#xD;
      growth of new blood vessels that help cancer grow. Researchers want to see if pomalidomide&#xD;
      can treat Kaposi sarcoma, a rare and potentially fatal skin cancer. Because Kaposi sarcoma&#xD;
      may be associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, researchers want to test&#xD;
      the drug in people with and without HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if pomalidomide is a safe and effective treatment for Kaposi sarcoma in people with&#xD;
      or without HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have Kaposi sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may or may not have HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Potential participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. Blood&#xD;
           and saliva samples will be taken and a chest X-ray will be performed. A skin biopsy of a&#xD;
           Kaposi sarcoma lesion may be performed if one has not already been done. Other imaging&#xD;
           studies may be performed if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take pomalidomide capsules every day for 3 weeks, followed by a 1-week&#xD;
           break. These 28 days are one cycle of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have up six cycles of treatment, unless the lesions completely resolve&#xD;
           sooner. If there are signs of improvement after six cycles but the lesions are not&#xD;
           completely gone, up to another six cycles of treatment may be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and other studies including&#xD;
           photograph and other imaging of skin lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have regular follow-up visits for 5 years after stopping treatment.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kaposi Sarcoma (KS) is an incurable, multicentric angioproliferative tumor that most&#xD;
      frequently involves the skin. It is seen most frequently in people with HIV or other forms of&#xD;
      immune compromise. Current therapies are limited by toxicities, including cumulative&#xD;
      cardiotoxicity, while effective oral agents, agents deliverable in resource-limited settings,&#xD;
      and agents deliverable long-term for relapsing disease are all lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of pomalidomide in subjects with Kaposi&#xD;
      sarcoma, whether HIV associated or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurable, pathologically confirmed KS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any HIV status; HIV-associated KS subjects must be receiving and able to comply with&#xD;
           HAART and have achieved an HIV viral load &lt;10,000 copies/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hematologic and biochemical parameters within prespecified limits at baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Willing to use effective birth control, as defined in the full protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For subjects enrolled in the anti-tumor activity assessment phase, if KS is&#xD;
           HIV-associated it must be increasing despite HAART and HIV suppression for greater than&#xD;
           or equal to 2 months, or stable despite HAART for greater than or equal to 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No symptomatic pulmonary or visceral KS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No specific KS therapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks if that therapy was bevacizumab)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neither pregnant nor breast feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label single agent phase I/II study of pomalidomide in patients with KS. In&#xD;
      the phase I portion, up to six subjects will initially be treated with pomalidomide 5mg daily&#xD;
      for 21 days of a 28 day cycle. Subject to toxicity evaluation, this dosage may be deescalated&#xD;
      to 3mg daily for 21 days of a 28 day cycle in a second cohort of up to six subjects. If&#xD;
      either dose proves tolerable, the study will proceed to the phase II portion, and additional&#xD;
      subjects to a goal of 15 HIV positive and 10 HIV negative subjects evaluable for response&#xD;
      will be added at the highest tolerable dose to gain preliminary information on activity.&#xD;
