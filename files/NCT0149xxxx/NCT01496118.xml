  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Relapsed/refractory Multiple Myeloma (MM) is an incurable disorder with a poor prognosis.&#xD;
      Carfilzomib is a novel proteasome inhibitor with activity in this setting. Panobinostat is a&#xD;
      pan-deacetylase inhibitor which has shown synergistic cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo with&#xD;
      proteasome inhibitors. The combination should enhance the activity of both agents against&#xD;
      myeloma cells. In Phase I, the optimal doses of the combination of carfilzomib and&#xD;
      panobinostat will be determined. Assuming this combination is feasible, the Phase II portion&#xD;
      will proceed using the doses determined in Phase I.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this open-label, non-randomized Phase I/II study, a maximum of 4 planned dose levels of&#xD;
      carfilzomib and panobinostat were evaluated to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) to&#xD;
      administer. The MTD was not reached so patients in Phase II received treatment at dose level&#xD;
      4 to further assess efficacy. Response to treatment was evaluated after each 4-week cycle.&#xD;
      Those having an objective response or stable disease are continuing treatment until disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the MTD in the 4 planned dose levels were not reached, a parallel Phase I study was&#xD;
      initiated to examine additional dose levels using a traditional 3+3 design. If these dose&#xD;
      levels are tolerable, then more patients will be recruited into an expansion cohort to assess&#xD;
      efficacy at the new dose level(s).&#xD;
