  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A standard treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer is standard photon radiation in&#xD;
      combination with the chemotherapy drug, capecitabine. In this research study the&#xD;
      investigators are using standard photon radiation or a different type of radiation therapy&#xD;
      called proton beam radiation and adding hydroxychloroquine to be used in combination with&#xD;
      capecitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are looking to determine if proton or photon beam&#xD;
      radiation in combination with hydroxychloroquine and capecitabine is effective in controlling&#xD;
      your cancer growth.&#xD;

      Subjects will be treated in cycles of 28 days. Hydroxychloroquine will be taken orally, daily&#xD;
      until the day before surgery and will resume after surgery until study end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capecitabine will be taken orally, daily. Proton or photon radiation treatment will start on&#xD;
      Week 2 and will be delivered daily (5 days in a row, but not weekends or holidays). Radiation&#xD;
      treatment will be give on an outpatient basis at the Francis H. Burr Proton Center or the&#xD;
      Clark Center for Radiation Oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following tests will be performed weekly: physical exam, routine blood tests, optional&#xD;
      blood tests and an eye exam every 3 months while taking hydroxychloroquine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have surgery (any time between Weeks 5 to 9) and after surgery resume taking&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine. Subjects will have a follow up visit every 3 months which will include:&#xD;
      physical exam, routine blood tests, eye exam, and tumor assessment by chest and&#xD;
      abdominal-pelvic CT scan or MRI (every 6 months for the first 2 years and yearly for years&#xD;
      3-5).&#xD;
