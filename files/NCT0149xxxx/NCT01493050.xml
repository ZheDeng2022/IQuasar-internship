  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if taking a medication can lower the amount of oxidants&#xD;
      from food that go into our body. Previous research shows that if the investigators lower the&#xD;
      oxidants from food in people with diabetes, this simple change lowers different risks for&#xD;
      heart disease and the worsening of kidney disease. The investigators focus on a specific type&#xD;
      of oxidant, advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). A previous, smaller study, conducted by&#xD;
      our group showed that a drug, already approved by the FDA, will lower AGEs in the&#xD;
      investigators compared Renvela® to Tums®. Both of these drugs have few side effects and have&#xD;
      been used for a long time in patients with diabetes and kidney disease. While our previous&#xD;
      study was interesting, it was just too small to be able to be sure that it will help all&#xD;
      people with diabetes, or if the good effects the investigators found were simply due to&#xD;
      chance. The investigators are doing this new study to confirm or deny the possibility that&#xD;
      Renvela® can really help people with diabetes and kidney disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) levels are elevated in diabetic patients and in&#xD;
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and may contribute to the excessive cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease in this population, by promoting oxidant stress and chronic vascular inflammation. It&#xD;
      has recently been recognized that AGEs in the body originate not only endogenously, but also&#xD;
      from the ingestion of preformed AGEs in the diet. We have shown that reduction of dietary AGE&#xD;
      intake leads to significant reductions of circulating AGEs and insulin levels as well as&#xD;
      levels of markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in both diabetic and CKD patients.&#xD;
      Thus, the increased inflammation and oxidative stress (Infl/OS) in stable diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      (DM) are largely due to advanced glycation end products (AGEs) from food, and restricting&#xD;
      AGEs-intake reduces these risk factors in DM. High circulating AGEs and TNFR1/2 have been&#xD;
      shown to be associated with progression in diabetic nephropathy. Ideally, a compound that&#xD;
      binds food AGEs within the lumen of the intestine should have the same effect as dietary&#xD;
      restriction of AGEs and could become an important therapeutic tool in the clinical care of&#xD;
      these patients. We found that Sevelamer binds AGEs in vitro in a pH dependent manner. This&#xD;
      led us to hypothesize that sevelamer carbonate, but not calcium carbonate, would sequester&#xD;
      AGEs in the gut and reduce Infl/OS, including circulating AGEs and TNFα, in T2DM with Stage&#xD;
      2-4 CKD. This hypothesis was tested in a Pilot Study (GCO-08-0976) we designed as a&#xD;
      proof-of-concept trial to determine if a larger and longer trial is indicated. We conducted a&#xD;
      randomized, open-label, intention-to-treat, two-month crossover study to compare stable&#xD;
      diabetic patients with stage 2-4 CKD treated with either Sevelamer carbonate or calcium&#xD;
      carbonate for 2 months, a 1 week wash-out, and then the opposite drug for 2 months. There&#xD;
      were no changes in medications and food intake. We found that urinary phosphate excretion was&#xD;
      decreased by both Sevelamer carbonate and calcium carbonate. Serum AGEs, lipids, HbA1c,&#xD;
      FGF23, and 8-isoprostanes were reduced by Sevelamer carbonate compared to calcium carbonate.&#xD;
      In addition, PMNC levels of AGER1, SIRT1 and TNFα were also decreased by Sevelamer carbonate,&#xD;
      compared to calcium carbonate. We concluded that Sevelamer carbonate reduces HbA1c, FGF23,&#xD;
      lipids, and TNFα via reduced inflammation and OS in stage 2-4 diabetic CKD. These changes&#xD;
      were not seen with calcium carbonate. Since we found that sevelamer carbonate bound AGE-BSA&#xD;
      (but not BSA) at pH 7.0, but not at pH 1.0 in vitro, we proposed that the mechanism action is&#xD;
      sequestration of dietary AGEs and GI elimination. Based on these data, we concluded that a&#xD;
      larger and longer trial is indicated to confirm these results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study proposes to confirm that Sevelamer Carbonate, an agent known to prevent the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal absorption of phosphates, is also able to block the absorption of AGEs and&#xD;
      improve certain aspects of diabetes and chronic renal disease in a larger group of patients&#xD;
      who will be followed for a longer period of time.&#xD;
