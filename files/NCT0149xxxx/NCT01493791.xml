    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - CDB-2914 is a hormone that blocks progesterone, which is necessary for maintaining&#xD;
      pregnancy. In women with fibroid tumors, CDB-2914 shrank the tumors. In many cases, menstrual&#xD;
      periods stopped during treatment. Because CDB-2914 decreased or stopped menstrual bleeding in&#xD;
      women with fibroids, it may be able to treat abnormal periods in women without fibroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see whether CDB-2914 can treat abnormal uterine bleeding in premenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Premenopausal women who have abnormal uterine bleeding that is not caused by fibroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also&#xD;
           have blood and urine tests. An ultrasound with fluid of the uterus will test for&#xD;
           fibroids. Uterine cells will be collected for biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the next three menstrual cycles, participants will take either CDB-2914 or a&#xD;
           placebo. Treatment will be studied with blood tests and symptom diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of the treatment, participants have three options. They can have surgery at&#xD;
           the Clinical Center or have another 3 months of CDB-2914. The third option is to stop&#xD;
           treatment at the Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery will be either uterine ablation or hysterectomy. Only women older than age 33&#xD;
           may have a hysterectomy. Blood and urine samples will be collected after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both surgery and further treatment participants will have followup exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will have a final followup exam 1 year after stopping treatment....&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abnormal uterine bleeding is the most common gynecologic complaint in reproductive aged&#xD;
      women. Medical treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding has high failure rates and surgical&#xD;
      management remains the primary, definitive therapy. Most women undergoing hysterectomy for&#xD;
      abnormal bleeding failed a therapeutic trial of medical management. Consequently, development&#xD;
      of an efficacious, new medical treatment for abnormal uterine bleeding is urgently needed.&#xD;
      Many of these reproductive aged women also need contraception. Ulipristal acetate (UPA), a&#xD;
      novel progesterone receptor modulator developed at the NIH, has promise as an effective&#xD;
      medical treatment for abnormal uterine bleeding and as a contraceptive agent. In women with&#xD;
      symptomatic fibroids, UPA significantly reduced fibroid size, stopped menstrual bleeding and&#xD;
      led to an increase in red blood cell hemoglobin. It also inhibited release of an egg from the&#xD;
      ovaries (ovulation) without reducing estrogen levels or causing hot flashes, making&#xD;
      contraception a potential future use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate UPA effects on estrogen production and ovulation, and will determine&#xD;
      whether it reduces bleeding in women who have abnormal uterine bleeding as assessed by the&#xD;
      Menorrhagia Impact Questionnaire (MIQ) and menstrual calendars. Women with an anatomic&#xD;
      abnormality of the uterus are not eligible to participate. Participants will take UPA (10 mg&#xD;
      daily by mouth) or a similar-appearing inactive pill (placebo) for approximately 90 days.&#xD;
      Women will be randomly assigned to receive daily UPA 10 mg, or a daily placebo tablet, during&#xD;
      the initial three-month period. The participants and the investigators will not be informed&#xD;
      of the treatment group. To understand the effects of UPA on the uterus and its lining&#xD;
      (endometrium), women will have studies before and at the end of UPA treatment, including&#xD;
      ultrasound imaging of the uterus after injection of a small amount of sterile saline into the&#xD;
      uterine cavity, and a biopsy of the endometrium to examine the tissue under the microscope.&#xD;
      Before and while taking study agent, women will record daily bleeding and complete the MIQ&#xD;
      monthly. During the treatment period, blood will be taken weekly to measure hormone levels&#xD;
      (to evaluate ovulation blockage), and monthly to evaluate safety. At the end of the&#xD;
      randomized study period, the research team will offer participants additional options of UPA&#xD;
      or surgical therapy. Women may choose surgical therapy at the NIH or may elect other&#xD;
      treatment options elsewhere.&#xD;
