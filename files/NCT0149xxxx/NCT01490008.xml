    <textblock>
      Investigation of systemic catechin exposure following topically administered Veregen® 15%&#xD;
      ointment in patients with external genital and perianal warts and following oral intake of a&#xD;
      standardized green tea beverage in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic parameters for the main catechin EGCg used as a marker of overall catechin&#xD;
      exposure following dermal administration in the patient group will only be calculated if&#xD;
      sufficiently consistent data can be obtained e.g. sufficient plasma catechin concentrations&#xD;
      to pharmacokinetically evaluate plasma profiles for plasma catechin concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If applicable, a safety margin for ointment use might need to be established with respect to&#xD;
      intolerable systemic exposures of catechins following application of Veregen® ointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In treatment arm 1, patients with anogenital warts will apply Veregen® 15% ointment 250 mg&#xD;
      three times daily: in the morning, at midday, and in the evening on the defined anogenital&#xD;
      administration area (total dose of 750 mg/d) for one week .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In treatment arm 2, healthy subjects will ingest 500 mL commercially available green tea&#xD;
      beverage (&quot;Lipton® Green Limone&quot; distributed by PepsiCo Deutschland GmbH, Neu-Isenburg,&#xD;
      Germany), three times daily in the morning, at midday, and in the evening (total dose of 1500&#xD;
      mL/d) for one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma samples will be collected to aim for a complete pharmacokinetic assessment (over 24&#xD;
      hours) on Days 1 and 2 at Visit 2 and on Days 7 and 8 at Visit 3 (one week after first&#xD;
      dosing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid any influence on overall systemic catechin exposure deriving from any other source&#xD;
      than Veregen® or Lipton Green Tea, all subjects participating in the trial (patients and&#xD;
      healthy volunteers) will be asked to follow a defined diet abstaining from food or beverages&#xD;
      known to containing catechins (a list of all prohibited and allowed foods and beverages will&#xD;
      be provided to all subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For concomitant medication, only paracetamol and oral contraceptives are allowed.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the systemic exposure, and, if possible, the plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetics of green tea catechin EGCg after topically applied Veregen® 15% ointment in patients with external genital warts and that following oral intake of commercially available green tea beverage by healthy subjects.&#xD;
On the sampling Days 1/2 and 7/8, blood samples of 3 mL each will be collected (non-fasting condition) at specified time points (see above)</description>
