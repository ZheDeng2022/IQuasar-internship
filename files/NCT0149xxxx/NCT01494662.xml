  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine how well neratinib works in treating&#xD;
      breast cancer that has spread to the brain. Neratinib is a recently discovered oral drug that&#xD;
      may stop breast cancer cells from growing abnormally by inhibiting (or blocking) members of a&#xD;
      family of proteins that include Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are looking to see how well neratinib works to&#xD;
      decrease the size of or stabilize breast cancer that has spread to the brain. The&#xD;
      investigators are also looking at how previous treatments have affected your thinking (or&#xD;
      cognition) and how much neratinib reaches the central nervous system.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive neratinib and a drug-dosing calendar for each treatment cycle. This&#xD;
      drug is given orally on a daily basis, continuously. Each treatment cycle will last for 4&#xD;
      weeks during which time the subject will be taking neratinib every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical Exams and vital signs: At the start of each cycle, you will have a physical&#xD;
           exam. You will be asked questions about your general health and specific questions about&#xD;
           any problems that you might be having and any medications you may be taking. You will&#xD;
           also have a neurological examination to assess for neurological symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scans (or Imaging tests): We will assess your tumor by brain MRI every 2 cycles ( 6 to 8&#xD;
           weeks) and then every 3 cycles (9 to 12 weeks). CT or MRI scans of your chest, abdomen,&#xD;
           and pelvis will be performed every other cycle, at the same time points as the brain&#xD;
           MRI. Your research doctor may ask you to have a bone scan at the same time points if&#xD;
           this is clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photographs: Photographs may be taken of your tumor to assess the response of your tumor&#xD;
           to the treatment. Care will be taken to ensure these do not reveal your identity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MUGA or Echo: You will have a MUGA or ECHO done every 12 weeks, so every 3 or 4&#xD;
           treatment cycles, depending on which cohort you are on.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests: You will have blood tests done at the beginning of each treatment cycle to&#xD;
           check your blood cell counts and how well your organs are functioning. In addition to&#xD;
           regular blood tests, we will be collecting 2-3 tablespoons of blood for research prior&#xD;
           to your study treatment start.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurocognitive Function: If you have previously received treatment for cancer that has&#xD;
           spread to your brain (prior to enrollment on this study), you will be asked to take a&#xD;
           battery of tests that assess your cognition (thinking) at the start of the study, after&#xD;
           2 cycles of treatment, and possibly at the end of the study. With these tests, we are&#xD;
           trying to better understand how your previous treatments and ongoing treatments affect&#xD;
           your memory, attention, learning, and other related skills. These tests will be&#xD;
           administered to you by a trained research assistant and may take 30-45 minutes to&#xD;
           complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For preoperative patients only: If you are a patient who is planning to have an&#xD;
           operation to remove the cancer in your brain, you will have your surgery between 7-21&#xD;
           days after starting neratinib. These tests will allow us to measure of how much drug&#xD;
           (neratinib) reaches the central nervous system and will help us understand how well&#xD;
           neratinib does this.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At surgery, a part of your tumor cerebrospinal fluid will be collected to test for&#xD;
           levels of neratinib. For the cerebrospinal fluid collection, this may require a lumbar&#xD;
           puncture just before your surgery begins (spinal tap) if your neurosurgeon feels he/she&#xD;
           cannot collect this fluid easily during your surgery. A lumbar puncture is a test often&#xD;
           used to detect tumor cells in your cerebrospinal fluid. In this case, we will collect&#xD;
           fluid for testing of cancer cells and will also examine the fluid for neratinib&#xD;
           concentrations. This will provide information on how much drug (neratinib) reaches the&#xD;
           central nervous system. There will be a separate consent form for this procedure given&#xD;
           to you by your neurosurgeon (when applicable). This procedure will be done while you are&#xD;
           already under general anesthesia for your surgery. If you have a contraindication to&#xD;
           having this procedure or if you wish to refuse to undergo this procedure, you may do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will also have a blood test on day of surgery to test for levels of neratinib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will then resume neratinib once you have recovered from your surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the final dose of the study drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a follow-up visit one month after coming off study treatment. During that&#xD;
      visit, you will have a physical examination, functional assessment, assessment of any&#xD;
      toxicities and current medications, and a neurological examination. If you continue to have&#xD;
      ongoing toxicity related to your study treatment, we will continue to follow you until this&#xD;
      toxicity resolves. In addition, we will collect about 5-6 tablespoons of blood for research&#xD;
      and to measure if a marker for your particular breast cancer exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like to keep track of your medical condition for up to two years after you stop the&#xD;
      study treatment. If you are not seen in follow-up at your participating center (where you&#xD;
      enrolled on the study), we would like to follow you by calling you on the telephone or by&#xD;
      sending you a letter once a year to see how you are doing. We may also contact your doctor&#xD;
      once every 6 months to see how you are doing. Keeping in touch with you and checking your&#xD;
      condition every year helps us look at the long-term effects of the research study. If you do&#xD;
      not wish to be contacted after you stop the study treatment, you must notify the research&#xD;
      study staff of your withdrawal of consent for follow-up&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients (men or women) must have histologically or cytologically confirmed invasive&#xD;
             breast cancer, with metastatic disease. Patients without pathologic or cytologic&#xD;
             confirmation of metastatic disease should have unequivocal evidence of metastasis by&#xD;
             physical exam or radiologic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Invasive primary tumor or metastatic tissue confirmation of HER2-positive status&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Over-expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) with score of 3+ (in &gt; 30% of invasive&#xD;
             tumor cells) AND/OR HER2 gene amplification (&gt; 6 HER2 gene copies per nucleus or a&#xD;
             FISH ratio [HER2 gene copies to chromosome 17 signals] of ≥ 2.0)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Note: Patients with a negative or equivocal overall result (FISH ratio of &lt; 2.0 or ≤&#xD;
             6.0 HER2 gene copies per nucleus) and IHC staining scores of 0, 1+, 2+ are not&#xD;
             eligible for enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No increase in corticosteroid dose in the week prior to baseline brain MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior trastuzumab and lapatinib therapy are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There is no limit to the number of previous lines of therapy (including chemotherapy,&#xD;
             trastuzumab, and endocrine therapies)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior therapy with neratinib is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 2 weeks washout period post chemotherapy, any prior protocol therapy,&#xD;
             lapatinib, other targeted or biologic therapy, or radiation therapy is required prior&#xD;
             to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No washout is required for hormonal therapy but concurrent hormonal therapy is not&#xD;
             allowed for patients on study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with progressive disease (Cohort 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For cohort 1, patients must have new or progressive CNS lesions, as assessed by the&#xD;
             patient's treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In cohort 1, patients must have measurable CNS disease, defined as at least one&#xD;
             parenchymal brain lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension&#xD;
             with longest dimension ≥10 mm by local radiology review. Note: measurable non-CNS&#xD;
             disease is NOT required for study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  It is anticipated that some patients may have multiple progressive CNS lesions, one or&#xD;
             several of which are treated with SRS or surgery with residual untreated lesions&#xD;
             remaining. Such patients are eligible for enrollment on this study providing that at&#xD;
             least one residual (i.e. non-SRS-treated or non-resected) lesion is measurable (≥10&#xD;
             mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had prior cranial surgery are eligible, provided that there is&#xD;
             evidence of measurable residual or progressive lesions, and at least 2 weeks have&#xD;
             passed since surgery. If a patient has surgical resection followed by WBRT, then there&#xD;
             must be evidence of progressive CNS disease after the completion of WBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had prior WBRT and/or SRS and then whose prior treated lesions have&#xD;
             progressed thereafter are also eligible. In this case, lesions which have been treated&#xD;
             with SRS may be considered as target lesions if there is unequivocal evidence, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the treating physician, of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with with operable disease (Cohort 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In cohort 2, eligible patients will include those who have CNS disease that is&#xD;
             amenable for surgery (typically &lt; 3 brain metastases and with planned resection by&#xD;
             neurosurgery). These patients may include those who have received or not received&#xD;
             previous treatment(s) for their CNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  It is anticipated that that patients who have intracranial disease amenable to surgery&#xD;
             will have measurable CNS disease prior to study entry and to resection. However, this&#xD;
             is not an eligibility requirement. Measurable disease is also not required to continue&#xD;
             on protocol subsequent to surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients who undergo surgery, postoperative whole brain radiation therapy will not&#xD;
             be allowed while patients are on study (concurrent neratinib and radiation therapy has&#xD;
             not been studied and toxicity of this is unknown). Patients will require&#xD;
             discontinuation of neratinib if radiation therapy will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient Cohort 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -In cohort 3, eligible patients must have measurable Central Nervous System disease. Cohort&#xD;
        3a will have participants with no prior lapatinib therapy. Cohort 3b will have had prior&#xD;
        lapatinib therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not pregnant or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy (including investigational&#xD;
