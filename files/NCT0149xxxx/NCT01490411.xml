  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if rBet v1-FV works to relieve Seasonal Allergic&#xD;
      Rhinitis symptoms compared to Placebo (an inactive substance that looks like rBet v1-FV and&#xD;
      also contains Aluminum Hydroxide but does not contain the experimental drug). rBet v1-FV is a&#xD;
      vaccine that works by exposing your immune system to something that resembles birch. This&#xD;
      vaccine may help to lessen your allergy symptoms during the natural birch season.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type I allergy is an immune-disorder which stems from the formation of IgE antibodies against&#xD;
      proteins and glycoproteins from plants, insects, animals and fungi, most of which are&#xD;
      normally considered harmless. The cross-linking of specific IgE antibodies on effector cells&#xD;
      by allergens activates an immunological cascade leading to the symptoms of Type I allergy&#xD;
      including rhinitis, conjunctivitis, asthma, and anaphylactic shock. Allergic Rhinitis is the&#xD;
      most common chronic atopic disease and is associated with considerable cost and co-morbidity.&#xD;
      Seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR), triggered by pollen from trees, grasses and weeds, is&#xD;
      characterized by sneezing, nasal congestion, nasal itching, rhinorrhea, and pruritic, watery,&#xD;
      red eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recombinant preparations offer various advantages over those based on natural allergen&#xD;
      extracts. Recombinant proteins can be produced in highly purified forms of pharmaceutical&#xD;
      quality; proteins are molecularly defined thus ensuring product consistency and minimising&#xD;
      problems related to allergen extract standardisation; preparations only include those&#xD;
      proteins that are considered relevant for specific immunotherapy; the risk of contamination&#xD;
      with other allergenic material is excluded; the whole production process can be designed to&#xD;
      exclude any risk factors for the introduction of infectious agents; the relative dosages of&#xD;
      individual components of a final preparation can be optimised to favour better clinical&#xD;
      efficacy. Allergy vaccination (AV) mediates the immune response to allergen exposure by&#xD;
      altering the TH2 response in favour of a TH1 T-cell response, increasing IgG production and&#xD;
      decreasing the production of inflammatory cytokines. rBet v1-FV is an AV designed to enhance&#xD;
      beneficial immune responses. The investigational product has demonstrated efficacy and good&#xD;
      tolerability in one previous pivotal Phase III and two previous Phase II studies.&#xD;
