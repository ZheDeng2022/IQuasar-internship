  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the rising incidence of obesity, much emphasis has been placed on identifying&#xD;
      mechanisms of increased energy intake. At this point, the mechanisms responsible for the&#xD;
      recent increase in obesity prevalence have not been thoroughly examined. Pre-ingestive&#xD;
      influences, such as cognitive factors, may play a larger role in creating an energy surplus&#xD;
      than previously thought. Expectations about the satiating effect of a food may override the&#xD;
      post-ingestive influences in dictating further consumption. In addition, obese individuals&#xD;
      may exhibit a decreased compensatory response to foods as compared to lean individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding the effects of energy content, food form, and learning on satiation, satiety,&#xD;
      and energy intake will allow for a greater understanding of the mechanisms of energy&#xD;
      imbalance as a whole. Food choice is dictated by sensory properties and post-ingestive&#xD;
      effects. By utilizing foods with similar sensory properties, the acquired knowledge derived&#xD;
      from ingesting these foods can be monitored by analyzing subsequent intake at the same meal&#xD;
      and at subsequent eating occurrences. It is hypothesized that the liquid food form will&#xD;
      elicit weaker dietary compensation; that is, energy intake at other eating events will not be&#xD;
      adjusted to compensate for that food. In addition, it is posited that the lower energy food&#xD;
      will cause lower compensation postprandially. By having participants consume the same test&#xD;
      food daily over a two week learning period, it is thought that they will show improved&#xD;
      dietary compensation when the initial testing is repeated due to learned associations between&#xD;
      food properties and metabolism.&#xD;
