  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an association between increased risk of oropharyngeal dysphagia and artificial&#xD;
      ventilation through endotracheal tube, followed by tracheostomy. The aim of the present study&#xD;
      is to analyze the outcomes of an early swallowing rehabilitation program of dysphagic&#xD;
      tracheostomized patients under mechanical ventilation at the intensive care unit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study will be conduct in seven intensive care units of the university public&#xD;
      hospital Inclusion criteria are: patients under mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy for&#xD;
      at least 48 hours, appropriate level of consciousness (Glasgow coma scale ≥ 11), hemodynamic&#xD;
      stability without need for vasoactive drugs; minimum mechanical ventilation parameters&#xD;
      characterized by: pressure support ventilation (PSV) ≤ 20 cm H2O, positive end-expiratory&#xD;
      pressure (PEEP) ≤ 8 cm H2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ≤ 50 and respiratory rate ≤ 30&#xD;
      inspirations per minute. Primary exclusion criteria are: patients who underwent surgery with&#xD;
      resection of structures of oral cavity, pharynx, larynx and/or esophagus; nasal fracture or&#xD;
      skull base fracture preventing otorhinolaryngological exam; possible surgical treatment after&#xD;
      ICU admission with no reasonable time for carrying out the planned intervention; degenerative&#xD;
      diseases characterized by outbreaks and remissions; past history of oropharyngeal dysphagia,&#xD;
      previous speech therapy, excessive amount of thick tracheal secretion requiring frequent&#xD;
      tracheal suctioning, end-stage of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tracheoesophageal&#xD;
      fistula, allergy to dyes, and low survival expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consist of three stages: (1) sample selection with a test of the speaking valve and&#xD;
      initial assessments, (2) swallowing rehabilitation and (3) post-treatment reassessments.&#xD;
      Clinical assessments will be performed by speech-pathologists and otorhinolaryngologists with&#xD;
      patients under mechanical ventilation. Subsequently, patients with dysphagia will be&#xD;
      submitted to a rehabilitation program with standardized intervention, followed by a new&#xD;
      assessment of abnormalities. The efficacy of swallowing treatment will be assessed by&#xD;
      comparing the scores before and after treatment. Paired Student's test or Wilcoxon-test will&#xD;
      be applied, according to data distribution. Categorical variables will be expressed as number&#xD;
      and percentage and analyzed through McNemar test. All p-values will be two-sided and a&#xD;
      p-value &lt; 0.05 considered statistically significant.&#xD;
