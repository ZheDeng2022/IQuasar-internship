  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nerve growth factor (NGF), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels in&#xD;
      urine were reported to increase in patients with overactive bladder (OAB). Also,&#xD;
      administration of the anti-muscarinic agent was reported to decrease urinary NGF and ATP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aimed to explore the value of the urinary NGF, PGE2 and ATP as biomarker&#xD;
      for predicting the treatment responsiveness and symptom relapse in OAB patients. So, the&#xD;
      patients can be categorized into responder or non- responder and relapse or non-relapse&#xD;
      groups. Ultimately, they can receive individualized treatments.&#xD;
