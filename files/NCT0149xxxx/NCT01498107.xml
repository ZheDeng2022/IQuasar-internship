      This pilot study investigates a new platform for supporting online interventions for common&#xD;
      mental health problems called SilverCloud. It was developed from insights into interactive&#xD;
      system design to address the problem of high attrition rates and poor engagement with online&#xD;
      interventions. Through a range of methods, the study considers the role of four design&#xD;
      strategies in engaging users in cognitive behavioural therapy. A service-based study, it&#xD;
      concentrates on a clinical population with mild or moderate depression. Clinical outcome&#xD;
      measures will be taken pre and post intervention use; demographic data of who did and did not&#xD;
      choose the intervention collected, patterns of usage will be extracted from the log data and&#xD;
      analysed; and qualitative interviews will be done to understand the relationship between&#xD;
      patterns of usage and levels of engagement. The findings will be used to inform further&#xD;
      developments of this and other online interventions and contribute to the development of&#xD;
      methods for assessing online interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the pilot study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate engagement with the online intervention in a realistic primary mental health&#xD;
           care setting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess engagement from multiple perspectives, including clinical efficacy and&#xD;
           interaction design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contribute to further development of the online intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Support preparation for a full-scale clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the online intervention decrease symptoms of depression?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Who chooses to use the online intervention?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What are the patterns of use of the online intervention?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How successful are the four design principles, personal, interactive, supportive and&#xD;
           social, in supporting engagement?&#xD;

      INTERVENTION DESCRIPTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      SilverCloud platform SilverCloud is a platform on which to quickly build online interventions&#xD;
      for common mental health problems. It utilises four design strategies that have been drawn&#xD;
      from research in human-computer interaction: personal, interactive, supportive and social.&#xD;
      SilverCloud is unusual among online interventions for its utilisation of current interactive&#xD;
      design approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personal: Users are encouraged to draw together all strands of the programme and build&#xD;
           their own plan or &quot;toolbox&quot; for staying well and managing current and future mood&#xD;
           difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interactive: Users can engage with the range of media, such as interactive quizzes,&#xD;
           video presentation, online exercises and activities, homework, and mobile diary-keeping.&#xD;
           These are meant to encourage reflection and personalization of the information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Supportive: Though mainly self-directed, each user in the programme will be assigned a&#xD;
           therapist who will support them and provide feedback at specified intervals throughout&#xD;
           the intervention on the activities that the user has chosen to share.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Social: Users can gain a sense of other people using the system be seeing how many&#xD;
           people liked an activity, or by sharing answers to an activity that are visible to all&#xD;
           after moderation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindbalance programme Mind Balance is a six-module programme built on the SilverCloud&#xD;
      platform, incorporating psycho-educational and therapeutic elements of managing difficulties&#xD;
      with low mood and depression. The programme draws primarily on the principles of cognitive&#xD;
      behavioural therapy (CBT) and incorporates elements of mindfulness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Service-based use The SilverCloud online intervention will be used as part of IAPT: Improving&#xD;
      Access to Psychological Therapies. IAPT is a recent, centrally-developed, nationally-&#xD;
      implemented, service model to implement National Institute for Clinical Excellent (NICE)&#xD;
      guidelines for common mental health problems in primary care in the UK. It provides high&#xD;
      throughput talking therapies at two levels of intensity to the adult population. The higher&#xD;
      level provides therapy with a clinical psychologist and the lower level, guided self-help&#xD;
      with a trained IAPT worker. The SilverCloud online intervention will be provided at the lower&#xD;
      level of intensity as an alternative to manual-based guided self-help. Participants will&#xD;
      receive up to eight reviews on a weekly or fortnightly basis as agreed with their IAPT worker&#xD;
      with the intervention running not more than three months.&#xD;
