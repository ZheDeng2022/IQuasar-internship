  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years hip resurfacing has become a very popular alternative treatment to total hip&#xD;
      replacement for the treatment of hip arthritis. This procedure has become particularly common&#xD;
      in the young patient with arthritis because of perceived benefits in terms of functional&#xD;
      outcome. However, it has recently become apparent that hip resurfacing is associated with a&#xD;
      range of adverse events, not typically seen in patients with conventional hip replacement.&#xD;
      These include hip fracture, and failure of bone to grow onto the fixation surfaces of the&#xD;
      implant. It has also become apparent that hip resurfacing results in the release of high&#xD;
      concentrations of dissolved metals in the bloodstream, such as cobalt and chromium. Whilst&#xD;
      small concentrations of these metals are essential for normal body functions, such as making&#xD;
      red blood cells, in high concentrations their effects can be toxic to many cells and organs&#xD;
      of the body, such as bone, the brain, heart, liver and kidneys, as well as disturbing&#xD;
      hormones and blood cholesterol levels. Whilst several studies have documented levels of these&#xD;
      metal ions of 440 times normal levels in hip resurfacing patients, there are no studies that&#xD;
      have examined whether these levels are having a toxic effect on the various organ systems of&#xD;
      the body (with the exception of renal function). In this study we plan to explore whether&#xD;
      there are differences in bone mineral density, accumulation of metal ions in the brain, and&#xD;
      other solid organs, heart and hormonal function between subjects who have had a hip&#xD;
      resurfacing 5 or more years previously compared to an individually matched group of subjects&#xD;
      after conventional hip replacement.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a cross sectional survey in patients who have had hip resurfacing (MOMHR) and&#xD;
      subjects who have received a conventional hip replacement (THA) using a metal on plastic or&#xD;
      ceramic bearing. Participants in this study will be identified by orthopaedic surgeons from&#xD;
      their operating database. An invitation letter will be sent out to the potential participants&#xD;
      with an accompanying information sheet and a reply slip. If there is no response then one&#xD;
      further letter will be sent out. Those patients who respond to say that they are interested&#xD;
      in taking part in the study will then be telephoned by the study team and screened for&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. If they are eligible and willing to take part after discussions&#xD;
      with the investigator, an appointment will be made for them to attend to give informed&#xD;
      consent. Participants will be requested not to eat or drink on the morning that they attend&#xD;
      for this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be an opportunity at this visit for further discussion and explanation of the&#xD;
      study requirements with the Investigator before consent is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once consent has been given, the following procedures will be carried out at this visit&#xD;
      (Visit 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Venous blood will be taken by venepuncture (60 mL, approx 4 tablespoons, will be taken)&#xD;
           after which the participant will be able to eat breakfast (which will be provided).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A urine based pregnancy test will be used in women of child bearing age to exclude&#xD;
           pregnant women&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participants will complete the Oxford Hip questionnaire, the EQ5D questionnaire and a&#xD;
           record of medical history and concomitant medicines under supervision of the student&#xD;
           investigator or an experienced research nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Whole body bone mineral density assessments will be made using an Hologic Discovery bone&#xD;
           densitometer. This will take approximately 10 minutes in total and will be carried out&#xD;
           by an experienced research bone density technician&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. An electrocardiogram and an echocardiogram will be performed by an experienced&#xD;
           cardiotechnician and later analysed by a Consultant Cardiologist&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Participants will be given a container and instructions to collect a 24 hour urine&#xD;
           sample. This will be returned at the second visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. An appointment will be made for the participant to attend for a second visit to the&#xD;
           Royal Hallamshire Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 2 the following procedures will be carried out:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Neuropsychological assessments and questionnaires and visual acuity measurement using a&#xD;
           Snellen chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain using a 3.0T Phillips Intera MRI scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. MRI of the liver spleen and kidneys using the 3.0T Phillips Intera MRI scanner. Clinical&#xD;
           reports will be prepared for all clinical investigations and normal findings will be&#xD;
           related to the patient by letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abnormal findings will be reported to the GP and patient with advice for any action as&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
