      In ASCOT study, lipid lowering with a statin provided additional beneficial effects in&#xD;
      hypertensive patients with average levels of serum total cholesterol. However, the underlying&#xD;
      mechanism of statins to improve clinical outcomes in hypertension is unclear and the effect&#xD;
      of statins on coronary flow reserve (CFR) has not been examined in hypertensive patients.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is clinically important and timely project to measure CFR non-invasively using&#xD;
      echocardiography and to elucidate the mechanism of clinical benefits of statins in&#xD;
      hypertensive patients with cardiovascular risk. The investigators try to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of rosuvastatin on CFR by measuring the change of CFR after 1 year treatment of rosuvastatin,&#xD;
      and to correlate CFR with LDL-cholesterol and CRP.&#xD;

      In hypertensive patients with high risk, lipid lowering with a statin provided additional&#xD;
      beneficial effects in hypertensive patients with average levels of serum total cholesterol.&#xD;
      However, the underlying mechanism of statins to improve clinical outcomes in hypertension is&#xD;
      unclear. In patients with hypercholesterolemia or coronary atherosclerosis, several studies&#xD;
      reported that level of LDL-cholesterol was inversely correlated with coronary blood flow&#xD;
      reserve and suggested that statin improved coronary blood flow. Although it is speculated&#xD;
      that statin may improve coronary blood flow by decreasing LDL cholesterol level and&#xD;
      stabilizing atherosclerotic plaque in coronary atherosclerosis, the effect of statins on&#xD;
      coronary flow reserve (CFR) has not been examined in hypertensive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LDL cholesterol is expected to significantly decrease when rosuvastatin 20mg is administered.&#xD;
      In addition to LDL-cholesterol lowering effect, the stabilization of atherosclerotic plaque&#xD;
      and the regression of atheroma are observed during rosuvastatin treatment. Because of these&#xD;
      beneficial effects of rosuvastatin, it may be expected that rosuvastatin will improve&#xD;
      coronary blood flow even in hypertensive patients without hypercholesterolemia and the&#xD;
      efficacy of rosuvastatin on CFR needs to be investigated in hypertensive patients with&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morphologic assessment for the measurement of coronary lumen in the invasive coronary&#xD;
      angiography is used as a gold standard to assess the stenosis in coronary diseases. However,&#xD;
      as decrease of myocardial blood flow due to coronary artery disease could not be exactly&#xD;
      evaluated by morphologic stenosis, the functional test was required to assess the&#xD;
      significance of coronary artery stenosis, and CFR could be directly measured using Doppler&#xD;
      guide wire since mid-1990s. Since the pathophysiological implication of coronary stenosis can&#xD;
      be assessed using CFR measurement, CFR value is widely used in clinical practice as a very&#xD;
      useful indicator to assess coronary stenosis severity in performing percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention. As a high frequency transducer with excellent resolution has been used,&#xD;
      coronary artery can be directly imaged, and coronary flow velocity can be measured using&#xD;
      echo-Doppler technique. As a result, CFR is easily measured in an echocardiography lab which&#xD;
      could be measured only in a cardiac catheterization lab using Doppler guide wire in the past.&#xD;
      It was confirmed that CFR values obtained by Doppler technique were same as those invasively&#xD;
      obtained in a cardiac catheterization lab. The clinical usefulness and accuracy of the&#xD;
      technique have been verified also in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it is clinically important and timely project to measure CFR non-invasively using&#xD;
      echocardiography and to elucidate the mechanism of clinical benefits of statins in&#xD;
      hypertensive patients with cardiovascular risk. We try to evaluate the effect of rosuvastatin&#xD;
      on CFR by measuring the change of CFR after 1 year treatment of rosuvastatin, and to&#xD;
      correlate CFR with LDL-cholesterol and CRP.&#xD;
