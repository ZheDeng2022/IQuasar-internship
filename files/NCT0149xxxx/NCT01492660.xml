    <textblock>
      Patients scheduled for total knee replacements and suitable for sciatic nerve block will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will have the nerve block performed using a standard Pajunk block needle under&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance and with electrical nerve stimulation (ENS), and have catheter placement&#xD;
      also guided by electrical nerve stimulation. Group 2 will have the block performed using a&#xD;
      Sonoplex echogenic block needle and have an echogenic catheter sited, all under ultrasound&#xD;
      (US) guidance. Group 2 will have needle location aided by ENS, but ENS will not be used for&#xD;
      catheter location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An observer blinded to the needle type will assess the quality of needle visualisation on a&#xD;
      recording of the US image taken during the procedure, along with adequacy of spread of local&#xD;
      anesthetic. The primary outcome will be needle visibility, and secondary outcomes will be&#xD;
      block success rate, block performance time, complication rate, number of needle passes per&#xD;
      block, and adequacy of spread of local anesthetic.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 70 patients with ASA physical status 1 to 4, scheduled for elective total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty and deemed suitable to receive a sciatic nerve block will be included in the&#xD;
      study. They will be randomised to one of two groups prior to the block procedure using a&#xD;
      closed envelope system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will take place in the preoperative clinic. All blocks will be performed in the&#xD;
      block room using standard monitoring, sterile precautions and titrated intravenous sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the sciatic nerve block a continuous femoral nerve block will be performed according&#xD;
      to standard procedure. Once this is complete the patient will be positioned for the sciatic&#xD;
      nerve block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A preprocedural scan will be done as per standard practice and skin will be infiltrated with&#xD;
      1% lidocaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anaesthetist performing the block will be aware of the study group allocation due to the&#xD;
      requirement for physically handling the block needles, and will proceed to position the&#xD;
      needle into the required location site to facilitate catheter insertion, with the aid of&#xD;
      electrical nerve stimulation via the needle. This will be recorded using the ultrasound&#xD;
      machines cineloop facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If after 6 passes the operator is unable either to contact the nerve according to the&#xD;
      ultrasound image or elicit a twitch response, the procedure will be abandoned and this will&#xD;
      be considered a failed block. In this case analgesia will be covered with periarticular&#xD;
      infiltration and opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During needle positioning, the observer will record the number of needle redirections&#xD;
      required to optimally locate the needle, each redirection being defined as every movement&#xD;
      which follows a withdrawal of more than 2cm. The observer will also record the number of skin&#xD;
      punctures required and any arterial or venous punctures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group E will have the block performed using the echogenic needle, and the echogenic catheter&#xD;
      will be placed using ultrasound guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The catheter will be inserted through the needle by a second anesthetist. This process will&#xD;
      be continuously recording using the cineloop feature of the ultrasound machine. Once the&#xD;
      catheter is deemed to be in an appropriate position, local anaesthetic will be injected by&#xD;
      the second anaesthetist while observing the disposition of the local anaesthetic perineurally&#xD;
      in short axis. This will be confirmed with a long axis view of the nerve (also recorded).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group S will have the block performed with a standard needle and catheter, guided by&#xD;
      electrical nerve stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptable muscle twitch response will be plantar- or dorsiflexion, inversion or eversion&#xD;
      with an initial nerve current strength of 0.5mA at a frequency of 2Hz. If a satisfactory&#xD;
      motor response cannot be elicited, current will be increased in stages to 1.5mA. If a&#xD;
      response still cannot be elicited this will be recorded but the catheter will still be used&#xD;
      if its position is deemed satisfactory using colour Doppler - a medley of colour adjacent to&#xD;
      the nerve with the injection of agitated dextrose 5%. Once the catheter is deemed to be in an&#xD;
      appropriate position, local anaesthetic will be injected by the second anaesthetist while&#xD;
      observing the disposition of the local anaesthetic perineurally in short axis. This will be&#xD;
      confirmed with a long axis view of the nerve (also recorded).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the catheter has been sited using the above techniques, a bolus of agitated 5% dextrose&#xD;
      will be injected through the catheter and Doppler ultrasound will be used to locate where in&#xD;
      the tissues the injected fluid is being deposited. This will also be recorded and&#xD;
      subsequently assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An assistant present during the block will time two aspects of the procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Time from first skin contact with needle to first muscle response to nerve stimulation.&#xD;
           This will be done only on the day of surgery during the block procedure until the&#xD;
           desired muscle twitch is elicited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Time from first skin contact to completion of catheter insertion (Block time).This is&#xD;
           done during the block procedure only on the day of surgery as noted above&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once catheter position has been assessed a total of 20 millilitres of 2% mepivacaine will be&#xD;
      injected via the catheter in both groups. Over the subsequent 30 minutes a second blinded&#xD;
      observer will take observations every 5 minutes to assess the degree of motor and sensory&#xD;
      block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The video recording of the block procedure will be sent along with the data collection form&#xD;
      to two of the co-investigators, who will independently assess the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At the time of nerve contact by the needle, assign a rating for visibility of the needle&#xD;
           shaft and tip according to the following scale:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. not visualised or poorly visualised - needle tip/shaft being isoechoic or only&#xD;
                slightly more echogenic than background parenchyma.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. tip or shaft visualised with some difficulty - tip/shaft readily identified as&#xD;
                being more echogenic than the background parenchyma but not seen in their entirety&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. excellent visibility shaft and tip strongly echogenic relative to tissue and&#xD;
                visualised in their entirety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assign the same rating after completion of injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Judge whether circumferential and longitudinal spread of local anaesthetic is either&#xD;
           adequate or inadequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the operation a standard infusion of 0.1% ropivacaine at 4cc/hr will be commenced&#xD;
      via the sciatic catheter. Post operative care will be as per the standard practice at this&#xD;
      institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One week post operatively the patient will be telephoned at home to check for persisting&#xD;
      neurological symptoms.&#xD;
