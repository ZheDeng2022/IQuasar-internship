  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies how well acetyl-L-carnitine hydrochloride works&#xD;
      compared to a placebo in preventing peripheral neuropathy in patients with recurrent ovarian&#xD;
      epithelial cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer undergoing&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Acetyl-L-carnitine hydrochloride may prevent or lessen peripheral neuropathy&#xD;
      caused by chemotherapy. It is not yet known whether acetyl-L-carnitine hydrochloride is more&#xD;
      effective compared to a placebo in preventing peripheral neuropathy caused by chemotherapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of acetyl-L-carnitine hydrochloride (ALC) in preventing&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) in patients with recurrent ovarian, primary&#xD;
      peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the effect of ALC on chemotherapy-induced fatigue based upon the Functional&#xD;
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Fatigue scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the effect of ALC on sensory peripheral neuropathy as measured with the first 4&#xD;
      items of the FACT/Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG)-Neurotoxicity (Ntx) subscale&#xD;
      (FACT/GOG-Ntx_4 subscale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate the effect of ALC on the health-related quality of life as measured by the&#xD;
      FACT-Ovarian (O) trial outcome index (TOI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to planned dosage of&#xD;
      paclitaxel (&lt; 150 mg/m^2 vs ≥ 150 mg/m^2), and age (&lt; 60 years of age vs ≥ 6 years of age).&#xD;
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive acetyl-L-carnitine hydrochloride (ALC) orally (PO) twice daily (BID)&#xD;
      on days 1-21 (during chemotherapy treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID on days 1-21 (during chemotherapy treatment) (maximum&#xD;
      of 8 courses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients also complete questionnaires comprising the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy&#xD;
      (FACT)-Fatigue scale, the FACT-Gynecologic Oncology Group Neurotoxicity subscale&#xD;
      (FACT/GOG-Ntx_4 subscale), and the FACT-Ovarian trial outcome index (FACT-O TOI) at baseline,&#xD;
      prior to courses 3 and 5, within 4 weeks after completion of treatment, and then at 3 months&#xD;
      after completion of treatment.&#xD;
