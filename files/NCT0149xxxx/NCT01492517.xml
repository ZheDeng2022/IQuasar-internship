      Purpose: The purpose of this protocol is to compare the genetic and epigenetic effects&#xD;
      between diesel exhaust and ozone exposure in healthy individuals and in mild/moderate&#xD;
      asthmatics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: The investigators will recruit up to 30 mild to moderate asthmatics and up to&#xD;
      50 healthy adults to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): Subjects will be exposed to clean air, to 300 µg/m3 of diesel exhaust&#xD;
      for 2 hours and to 0.3 ppm of ozone for 2 hours with intermittent exercise in a controlled&#xD;
      environment chamber. Primary endpoints will include spirometry and lung cell changes&#xD;
      post-exposure. Secondary endpoints will include analysis of blood clotting/coagulation&#xD;
      factors, Holter monitoring of cardiac parameters, analysis of soluble factors present in&#xD;
      plasma and bronchial lavage and analysis of intracellular factors present in lung tissue&#xD;
      obtained from a brush biopsy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will compare the epigenetic responses of healthy adults and adults with mild&#xD;
      asthma to diesel exhaust and ozone exposures. Up to fifty subjects will be recruited into the&#xD;
      healthy adult group and up to thirty subjects into the mild to moderate asthmatic group. Both&#xD;
      the normal healthy group and the asthmatic group will be randomly exposed to clean air,&#xD;
      diesel exhaust and ozone with exposures separated by a minimum of two weeks followed by a&#xD;
      bronchoscopy procedure 18-24 h post-exposure. Additionally, the healthy group will&#xD;
      participate in a second arm of the study in which they will be randomly exposed to clean air&#xD;
      and ozone only separated by a minimum of 2 weeks followed by a bronchoscopy procedure 1 h&#xD;
      post-exposure. Responses of primary interest will include: 1) genetic and epigenetic changes&#xD;
      2) FEV1 as measured by spirometry, and 3) lung inflammation and cell changes as evaluated by&#xD;
      bronchoalveolar lavage. The performance of these tests and procedures are considered&#xD;
      essential to conducting the study. Exploratory endpoints will include: blood CBC and&#xD;
      differential, fibrinogen and platelets, changes in IL 6 and IL 8 comparing pre-exposure with&#xD;
      post-exposure values. Safety endpoints will include comparison of temperature, telemetry,&#xD;
      respiratory rate, O2 saturation and symptoms scores for pre- and post-exposure, and at 18-24&#xD;
      hours post-exposure. All medical procedures will be performed by study personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to an additional 15 healthy subjects will be recruited specifically to be exposed to ozone&#xD;
      generated using the heavy non-radioactive isotope of oxygen (18O). There is no risk to the&#xD;
      subject of inhaling this isotope, which is naturally occurring in small concentrations. We&#xD;
      have previously used 18Ozone in a study approved by the UNC IRB in 1993. The purpose of these&#xD;
      exposures is to measure the amount of 18O label attached to airway epithelial cells removed&#xD;
      during bronchoscopy and thus calculate the dose of ozone these cells received. We will draw a&#xD;
      small blood sample but no other tests will be performed on these subjects other than routine&#xD;
      spirometry to ensure they are not at risk for bronchoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Examination Day:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to recruitment into the study, subjects will undergo a physical exam. During this&#xD;
      visit, a short review of the subject's history will be performed and vital signs, height and&#xD;
      weight will be assessed (temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, and blood pressure), to&#xD;
      determine whether the individual meets any major exclusion criteria for the study. Up to 50&#xD;
      ml of blood may be collected for a CBC/ differential, chemistry and lipid panels. At this&#xD;
      time the subject may undergo a physical examination for bronchoscopy or may be scheduled for&#xD;
      one at another time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to participate in this study, subjects will be asked to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Avoid smoke and fumes for 24 hours before all visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Avoid drinking alcohol 24 hours before all visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Avoid strenuous exercise for 24 hours prior to and after all visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No caffeine for 12 hours prior to all study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eat a normal breakfast prior to the exposures where the bronchoscopy is being performed&#xD;
           ~24 h post-exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not eat or drink anything after midnight the night before the bronchoscopy. This&#xD;
           includes not eating or drinking prior to the exposures in which the bronchoscopy is&#xD;
           being performed 1 h post-exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training Day&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Eligible subjects will report to the research lab for an approximate 2-hour training&#xD;
           session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Informed consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assessment of vital signs (temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, and blood pressure),&#xD;
           oxygen saturation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pregnancy tests will be administered to any women who may have child-bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Subjects will be trained on the cycle ergometer and the work load to elicit a minute&#xD;
           ventilation normalized for body surface of 25L/m2/BSA will be determined. In most&#xD;
           subjects this will be about 50 L/minute (IE. VO2 of approximately 2.0 L/m). A cycle&#xD;
           ergometer work setting of 75 to 100 watts will usually achieve such a physiological&#xD;
           response&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Subjects will perform spirometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Subjects will be shown chamber where exposures will take place. Study Arm 1 -&#xD;
           Bronchoscopy ~24 h Post-Exposure (Healthy &amp; Asthmatic Subjects)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be exposed to ozone, diesel exhaust and clean air on three separate&#xD;
      occasions, with the exposures separated by a minimum of two weeks (these will be 2-visit&#xD;
      exposure sessions). Subjects receiving 18Ozone, will only be exposed to ozone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects will be asked to arrive at the study site no sooner than 8 AM and will undergo&#xD;
           assessment of vital signs (temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, and blood pressure),&#xD;
           oxygen saturation, and symptom score assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pregnancy tests will be administered to any women who may have child-bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A telemetry unit will be attached for cardiac monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Subject will be fitted with a Holter monitor and the subject will be asked to recline in&#xD;
           a quiet dark place for 30 minutes. After approximately 20 minutes a time marker will be&#xD;
           activated so that heart rate variability frequency readings can be taken over the next&#xD;
           10 minutes. The subject will wear the Holter monitor for the next 24 hrs. Subjects&#xD;
           exposed to 18Ozone will not be fitted with a Holter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Venipuncture: Up to 80 ml of blood will be collected for a CBC/ differential, and may be&#xD;
           used for assessment of coagulation function and markers, phagocytic function,&#xD;
           inflammation, and cell surface markers. A portion of the sample may be used for RNA&#xD;
           isolation for microarray analysis and for DNA isolation for genotyping purposes.&#xD;
           Pre-exposure blood will not be taken from subjects being exposed to 18Ozone&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Baseline Spirometry&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Exposure sessions: Exposure to ozone, diesel exhaust or clean air will be conducted in&#xD;
           an exposure chamber at the EPA Human Studies Facility on the UNC campus. Each subject&#xD;
           will be exposed up to 0.3ppm ozone, diesel exhaust (up to 300 ug/m3) or clean air for 2&#xD;
           hours. Subjects will begin exercising on an exercise bike. Each exercise session will&#xD;
           consist of a 15 minute exercise interval at a level of up to 25 L/m2/BSA followed by a&#xD;
           15 minute rest period. Minute ventilation may be measured during each exercise period.&#xD;
           Continuous heart rate and rhythm, and oxygen saturation, will be monitored using&#xD;
           telemetry and pulse oximetry respectively. Blood pressure may be monitored&#xD;
           intermittently. Subjects will be asked to refrain but not prohibited from using inhaled&#xD;
           bronchodilator during exposures; if medication use is necessary subjects will be&#xD;
           instructed to maintain consistent medication use across the two exposures. The subjects&#xD;
           will be able to end their exposure and exit the chamber at any time. Indications for&#xD;
           terminating the exposure include significant respiratory distress or dyspnea, chest or&#xD;
           angina-like pain, significant cardiac arrhythmias, pallor, ataxia, or a greater than 5&#xD;
           point drop in saturated oxygen (or a drop to lower than 89%). They will be monitored&#xD;
           continuously by trained personnel and a physician is on call whenever a subject is&#xD;
           undergoing a procedure at the facility. A detailed description of the physical&#xD;
           facilities in the Human Studies Division of the U.S. EPA Health Effects Research&#xD;
           Laboratory located on the UNC-CH campus have been published as U.S. Government&#xD;
           Publication EPA-600/1-78-064, and is on file in the office of the UNC Committee on the&#xD;
           Protection of the Rights of Human Subjects. The medical station of the Human Studies&#xD;
           Division includes a fully-equipped medical examination room, a cardiac/respiratory&#xD;
           emergency cart, a subject recovery room, a nurse's station, a waiting room and&#xD;
           conference rooms. The facility is staffed by qualified RNs, and an on-site physician is&#xD;
           available to respond to a medical emergency in a timely manner. The exposure atmosphere&#xD;
           will be at approximately 40 + 10% RH and approximately 22 + 2 oC. The DE will be&#xD;
           generated from a diesel generator used to power a load bank that is located outside the&#xD;
           Human Studies Facility, and subsequently introduced into the exposure chamber after&#xD;
           different dilutions with clean HEPA and charcoal filtered and humidified air to give a&#xD;
           chamber concentration of up to 300 μg/m3. The monitoring analyzer registers a&#xD;
           concentration in real time. Exposures will be terminated at values ≥ 400 µg/m3 during&#xD;
           runs in which the exposure targets 300 µg/m3 DE. This safety limit will prevent an&#xD;
           inhalational exposure greater than 1080 µg, which assumes that the subject will inhale&#xD;
           2.7 m3 during the 120 min exposure. Levels of carbon monoxide (CO), and oxides of&#xD;
           nitrogen (NOx; mainly NO, and some NO2), will be kept under 10 ppm CO, 15 ppm NO, and&#xD;
           2.5 ppm NO2 or the exposure will be terminated. [The OSHA 8 hr time-weighted average&#xD;
           (TWA) for these substances are: CO=50 ppm; NO=25 ppm; NO2=5 ppm; Diesel fuel used for&#xD;
           the study will be purchased as a commercial ultra low sulfur fuel. Subjects will enter&#xD;
           the exposure chamber (about 6 ft x 6 ft x 8 ft ). Particle mass will be measured in real&#xD;
           time. Particle size distribution may not be determined during each subject exposure but&#xD;
           at regular intervals (e.g., monthly) to show that the size distribution does not change&#xD;
           radically. Filter samples will also be analyzed for chemical composition of particles.&#xD;
           Ozone exposures will be conducted in a (6 ft x 6 ft x 8 ft) stainless steel chamber with&#xD;
           a continuous supply of exposure medium. Ozone will be monitored continuously.&#xD;
           Immediately post exposure, subjects will again undergo spirometry, Holter monitor&#xD;
           frequency reading, symptom scoring and assessment of vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Then, up to 80 ml of blood will be collected for a CBC/ differential, assessment of&#xD;
           coagulation function, blood leukocyte phagocytic function, cytokines, cell surface&#xD;
           markers and RNA isolation for microarray analysis. Subjects exposed to 18Ozone will have&#xD;
           only 20 mls of blood removed for analysis of 18O tag present on blood cells and have&#xD;
           post exposure Spirometry measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Subjects exposed to 18Ozone will have bronchoscopy performed about 1 hr post-exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exposure to 18Ozone and undergoing a bronchoscopy approximately one hour later should&#xD;
           not increase the risk to the subjects. We have completed two earlier studies in which&#xD;
           subjects underwent bronchoscopy following exposure to concentrations of ozone higher&#xD;
           than used in this study, and encountered no problems. Others have also published studies&#xD;
           in which subjects were exposed to ozone followed by bronchoscopy one hour later&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Subjects will then be assessed and discharged by the nursing staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure Day 2 (approximately 24 hours after exposure) Subjects being exposed to 18O will not&#xD;
      be returning for a Day 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will arrive at the U.S. EPA HSF for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Vital sign monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Symptom scoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Venipuncture: up to 80 ml of blood will be collected for a CBC/ differential,&#xD;
           coagulation function, assessment of blood monocyte phagocytic function, inflammation,&#xD;
           and cell surface markers, and RNA isolation for microarray analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Holter monitor frequency reading and removal&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Spirometry&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Bronchoscopy. Subjects will have undergone a physical examination including assessment&#xD;
           for suitability for transnasal fiberoptic bronchoscopy at the Human Studies Facility by&#xD;
           a board certified or board eligible pulmonologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the procedure, subjects will perform spirometry (as above); bronchoscopy will not be&#xD;
      performed if lung function does not meet the recommended performance level (NIH guidelines;&#xD;
      FEV1≥ 60 % predicted). Prior to bronchoscopy, a small tube (IV) will be placed in a vein for&#xD;
      potential use in administering fluids. Subjects will receive inhaled albuterol prior to the&#xD;
      bronchoscopy at the discretion of the pulmonary physician performing the procedure.&#xD;
      Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and brush biopsy will be performed by a licensed&#xD;
      physician who is Board certified or board eligible in pulmonary medicine and is experienced&#xD;
      in fiberoptic bronchoscopy. The physician will be assisted by at least one R.N experienced in&#xD;
      bronchoscopy. The subjects will be monitored closely throughout the procedure in the&#xD;
      following manner: 1) Chest electrodes for continuous electrocardiogram, 2) Pulse oximetry of&#xD;
      arterial blood, and 3) blood pressure monitoring using an electronic sphygmomanometer.&#xD;
      Subjects may be premedicated with IV atropine (0.6 mg) to prevent bradycardia and hypotension&#xD;
      that could result from vagal stimulation provoked by passing the bronchoscope through the&#xD;
      subject's larynx and to minimize the amount of airways secretions. Nasal oxygen will be&#xD;
      administered during the procedure. No sedatives and/or narcotics are administered at any time&#xD;
      during bronchoscopy. We have found that premedication with sedatives (midazolam) or with&#xD;
      opiates (demerol) is not required for research bronchoscopy subjects. Avoidance of these&#xD;
      drugs reduces procedure risk and markedly shortens post-procedure recovery time.&#xD;
      Neosynephrine will be used to decongest nasal passages, followed by gargling with a lidocaine&#xD;
      solution for a few seconds to anesthetize the throat. The subject will then sniff (snort) a&#xD;
      small amount of lidocaine jelly through one nostril to anesthetize the nose and the back of&#xD;
      throat. A Q-tip with lidocaine jelly will be gently inserted into the nose to ensure that it&#xD;
      is completely numb before the bronchoscope is inserted. Topical lidocaine anesthesia will be&#xD;
      administered to the larynx and lower airways through the bronchoscope for subject comfort and&#xD;
      to prevent cough, with a maximum dose of 15 ml of 2% lidocaine solution (360 mg lidocaine) Up&#xD;
      to 8 endobronchial brush biopsies will be obtained from the lower trachea and right and left&#xD;
      mainstem bronchi. A cytology brush (Bronchoscope Cytology Brush; Bard, Tewksbury, MA) is&#xD;
      applied to the region under direct visualization. For a single brushing, six passes, each&#xD;
      with a linear excursion of approximately 2-5 cm, are made with the brush along the&#xD;
      endobronchial surface. Bronchoalveolar lavage will be performed in the right middle lobe&#xD;
      using a total volume of up to 250 cc of sterile 0.9% saline; from one to 5 aliquots of 50 cc&#xD;
      each will be injected and immediately aspirated through the channel in the bronchoscope using&#xD;
      a syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are observed and monitored for a minimum of 1 to 2 hours after the procedure in the&#xD;
      on-site medical station by a registered nurse with physician supervision. At discharge&#xD;
      subjects will be symptom-free. At least 2 physicians, including the responsible&#xD;
      bronchoscopist, will be available (24 hours daily) to subjects who develop any symptoms after&#xD;
      discharge. The subject is discharged by a physician and is provided with the names and&#xD;
      telephone numbers of the bronchoscopist and one other physician. The subject is contacted 24&#xD;
      hours post-bronchoscopy to ask about any untoward effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return to the U.S. EPA HSF for an additional exposure sessions and post&#xD;
      exposure bronchoscopies (air control, ozone or diesel exhaust) after a minimum time interval&#xD;
      of two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Arm 2 - Bronchoscopy 1 h Post-Exposure (Healthy Subjects ONLY)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be exposed to ozone and clean air on two separate occasions, with the&#xD;
      exposures separated by a minimum of two weeks (these will be 1-visit exposure sessions).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects will be asked to arrive at the study site no sooner than 8 AM and will undergo&#xD;
           assessment of vital signs (temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, and blood pressure),&#xD;
           and oxygen saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pregnancy tests will be administered to any women who may have child-bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A telemetry unit will be attached for cardiac monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Baseline Spirometry&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A saline lock will be placed in the subject's arm in preparation for IV fluids to be&#xD;
           administered post-exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Exposure sessions: Exposure to ozone or clean air will be conducted in an exposure&#xD;
           chamber at the EPA Human Studies Facility on the UNC campus. Each subject will be&#xD;
           exposed up to 0.3ppm ozone or clean air for 2 hours. Subjects will begin exercising on&#xD;
           an exercise bike. Each exercise session will consist of a 15 minute exercise interval at&#xD;
           a level of up to 25 L/m2/BSA followed by a 15 minute rest period. Minute ventilation may&#xD;
           be measured during each exercise period. Continuous heart rate and rhythm, and oxygen&#xD;
           saturation, will be monitored using telemetry and pulse oximetry respectively. Blood&#xD;
           pressure may be monitored intermittently. The subjects will be able to end their&#xD;
           exposure and exit the chamber at any time. Indications for terminating the exposure&#xD;
           include significant respiratory distress or dyspnea, chest or angina-like pain,&#xD;
           significant cardiac arrhythmias, pallor, ataxia, or a greater than 5 point drop in&#xD;
           saturated oxygen (or a drop to lower than 89%). They will be monitored continuously by&#xD;
           trained personnel and a physician is on call whenever a subject is undergoing a&#xD;
           procedure at the facility. A detailed description of the physical facilities in the&#xD;
           Human Studies Division of the U.S. EPA Health Effects Research Laboratory located on the&#xD;
           UNC-CH campus have been published as U.S. Government Publication EPA-600/1-78-064, and&#xD;
           is on file in the office of the UNC Committee on the Protection of the Rights of Human&#xD;
           Subjects. The medical station of the Human Studies Division includes a fully-equipped&#xD;
           medical examination room, a cardiac/respiratory emergency cart, a subject recovery room,&#xD;
           a nurse's station, a waiting room and conference rooms. The facility is staffed by&#xD;
           qualified RNs, and an on-site physician is available to respond to a medical emergency&#xD;
           in a timely manner. The exposure atmosphere will be at approximately 40 + 10% RH and&#xD;
           approximately 22 + 2 oC. Ozone exposures will be conducted in a (6 ft x 6 ft x 8 ft)&#xD;
           stainless steel chamber with a continuous supply of exposure medium. Ozone will be&#xD;
           monitored continuously. Immediately post exposure, subjects will again undergo&#xD;
           spirometry and assessment of vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. IV fluids will be administered prior to the bronchoscopy to ensure proper hydration of&#xD;
           the subject&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Subjects will have bronchoscopy performed about 1 hr post-exposure. Undergoing a&#xD;
           bronchoscopy approximately one hour post-exposure should not increase the risk to the&#xD;
           subjects. We have completed two earlier studies in which subjects underwent bronchoscopy&#xD;
           following exposure to concentrations of ozone higher than used in this study, and&#xD;
           encountered no problems. Others have also published studies in which subjects were&#xD;
           exposed to ozone followed by bronchoscopy one hour later.&#xD;

      lavage and brush biopsy will be performed by a licensed physician who is Board certified or&#xD;
      board eligible in pulmonary medicine and is experienced in fiberoptic bronchoscopy. The&#xD;
      physician will be assisted by at least one R.N experienced in bronchoscopy. The subjects will&#xD;
      be monitored closely throughout the procedure in the following manner: 1) Chest electrodes&#xD;
      for continuous electrocardiogram, 2) Pulse oximetry of arterial blood, and 3) blood pressure&#xD;
      monitoring using an electronic sphygmomanometer. Subjects may be premedicated with IV&#xD;
      atropine (0.6 mg) to prevent bradycardia and hypotension that could result from vagal&#xD;
      stimulation provoked by passing the bronchoscope through the subject's larynx and to minimize&#xD;
      the amount of airways secretions. Nasal oxygen will be administered during the procedure. No&#xD;
      sedatives and/or narcotics are administered at any time during bronchoscopy. We have found&#xD;
      that premedication with sedatives (midazolam) or with opiates (demerol) is not required for&#xD;
      research bronchoscopy subjects. Avoidance of these drugs reduces procedure risk and markedly&#xD;
      shortens post-procedure recovery time. Neosynephrine will be used to decongest nasal&#xD;
      passages, followed by gargling with a lidocaine solution for a few seconds to anesthetize the&#xD;
      throat. The subject will then sniff (snort) a small amount of lidocaine jelly through one&#xD;
      nostril to anesthetize the nose and the back of throat. A Q-tip with lidocaine jelly will be&#xD;
      gently inserted into the nose to ensure that it is completely numb before the bronchoscope is&#xD;
      inserted. Topical lidocaine anesthesia will be administered to the larynx and lower airways&#xD;
      through the bronchoscope for subject comfort and to prevent cough, with a maximum dose of 15&#xD;
      ml of 2% lidocaine solution (360 mg lidocaine) Up to 8 endobronchial brush biopsies will be&#xD;
      obtained from the lower trachea and right and left mainstem bronchi. A cytology brush&#xD;
      (Bronchoscope Cytology Brush; Bard, Tewksbury, MA) is applied to the region under direct&#xD;
      visualization. For a single brushing, six passes, each with a linear excursion of&#xD;
      approximately 2-5 cm, are made with the brush along the endobronchial surface.&#xD;
      Bronchoalveolar lavage will be performed in the right middle lobe using a total volume of up&#xD;
      to 250 cc of sterile 0.9% saline; from one to 5 aliquots of 50 cc each will be injected and&#xD;
      immediately aspirated through the channel in the bronchoscope using a syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are observed and monitored for a minimum of 1 to 2 hours after the procedure in the&#xD;
      on-site medical station by a registered nurse with physician supervision. At discharge&#xD;
      subjects will be symptom-free and able to void urine. At least 2 physicians, including the&#xD;
      responsible bronchoscopist, will be available (24 hours daily) to subjects who develop any&#xD;
      symptoms after discharge. The subject is discharged by a physician and is provided with the&#xD;
      names and telephone numbers of the bronchoscopist and one other physician. The subject is&#xD;
      contacted 24 hours post-bronchoscopy to ask about any untoward effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return to the U.S. EPA HSF for an additional exposure sessions and post&#xD;
      exposure bronchoscopies (air control or ozone) after a minimum time interval of two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate performing several clinical procedures during the course of this study which&#xD;
      include primary, secondary and exploratory endpoints. However, it is possible that not all&#xD;
      procedures will be performed on every subject. If we are unable to perform a procedure,&#xD;
      because of a investigator problem (such as but not limited too building/equipment failures,&#xD;
      weather delays, or staffing issues), then the patient will be compensated for said&#xD;
      procedure(s) and time on that day and may be rescheduled.&#xD;
