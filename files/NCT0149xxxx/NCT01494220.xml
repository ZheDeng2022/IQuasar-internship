    <textblock>
      Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring during living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) may be&#xD;
      influenced with several factors rather than the depth of anesthesia such as bradycardia,&#xD;
      hypotension, hypothermia, and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2). The investigators tested&#xD;
      the validity and the independent factors which may alter of BIS readings during LDLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to the investigators best knowledge, the independent predictors for BIS monitoring were&#xD;
      not identified yet during the three phases of liver transplantation.&#xD;

      Forty two American Society of Anesthesiologists physical class III-IV patients aged 20-50&#xD;
      years with severe liver dysfunction (Child-Pugh Class C) due to liver cirrhosis undergoing&#xD;
      living donor liver transplantation in the Mansoura University Liver Transplantation Program&#xD;
      from 2007 to 2010 were included in this prospective, observational study after obtaining&#xD;
      approval of the local ethical committee and an informed written consent from all&#xD;
      participants. The etiology of liver cirrhosis was hepatitis C, Budd Chiari syndrome,&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma and autoimmune in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic technique was standardized for all patients. All patients received preoperative&#xD;
      intravenous 40 mg of pantoprazole. Patients were monitored with three leads&#xD;
      electrocardiography, pulse oximeter, and noninvasive blood pressure. BIS recording electrodes&#xD;
      (Aspect Medical Systems. Inc., One Upland Road, Norwood, MA 02062 USA) were applied to the&#xD;
      forehead of each patient according to the manufacturer recommendations. The BIS monitor was&#xD;
      masked with opaque sheet and BIS data was recorded prior to induction of general anesthesia&#xD;
      then continued throughout the procedure. All information obtained from the BIS monitor was&#xD;
      continuously downloaded to a computer for offline analysis. The patient's management was not&#xD;
      guided by the changes in BIS readings. Before induction of anesthesia, all patients were&#xD;
      premedicated with 1-2 mg of intravenous midazolam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent anesthetists, who were not involved in the collection and analysis of the&#xD;
      patient's data, provided the perioperative anesthetic management. After preoxygenation,&#xD;
      anesthesia was induced with lidocaine 0.75 mg/kg, propofol 1.5-2.0 mg/kg and fentanyl 2µg/kg.&#xD;
      Rocuronium 1-1.2 mg/kg was given to suppress the first response on the train-of-four (TOF)&#xD;
      stimulations of the ulnar nerve. After tracheal intubation, the lungs were ventilated with an&#xD;
      inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO2) of 0.4 to maintain an arterial carbon dioxide tension at&#xD;
      35-45 mm Hg and monitoring of end-tidal carbon dioxide and sevoflurane concentration, direct&#xD;
      arterial pressure monitoring through a radial artery catheter and a tympanic membrane&#xD;
      temperature were implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 7.5 Fr continuous thermodilution fiberoptic pulmonary artery catheter (CCO/SvO2) Edwards&#xD;
      Life Science, Irvine, CA, USA) was floated through the right internal jugular vein to the&#xD;
      right pulmonary artery using waveform and fluoroscopic guidance to measure cardiac output&#xD;
      using Angstrom AS5 Monitor (Datex - Ohmeda AS5, Microvitec Display LTD, Bolling Road,&#xD;
      Bradford, UK). The final position was confirmed by fluoroscopy and when PAOP less than&#xD;
      pulmonary artery diastolic pressure (PADP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia was maintained with 0.5-1.5 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane&#xD;
      and continuous intravenous infusion of fentanyl (1-3 µg/kg/h) titrated to maintain the mean&#xD;
      arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) within 20% of their baseline values.&#xD;
      Rocuronium 0.1-0.3 mg/kg/h was used to maintain suppression of the second twitch in the TOF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normothermia was maintained using intravenous infusions of warm fluid and blood products and&#xD;
      water-filled thermal mattress according to the authors' protocol. Fluid boluses were given in&#xD;
      250 ml aliquots of either 5% hydroxyethyl Starch 130/0.4 (Voluven® 6%, Fresenius Kabi, Bad&#xD;
      Hombourg, Germany) as needed to maintain the CVP and/or PAOP between 5 and 7 mm Hg and the&#xD;
      stroke volume (SV) within 20% of its baseline value. Albumin 5% was given as needed to treat&#xD;
      hypoalbuminemia. Transfusion of salvaged blood from the cell saver and packed red blood cells&#xD;
      was administered as clinically indicated to maintain a hemoglobin level ≥7 g/dL.&#xD;
      Intraoperative changes in electrolyte levels and acid-base balance were regularly monitored&#xD;
      and treated as appropriate. Hemodynamic control was standardized according to the authors'&#xD;
      center protocol. Hypotension (MAP decreased &lt; 20% from the mean baseline and SVR &lt; 600&#xD;
      dyne.sec-1.cm-5) was treated with boluses of fluids, ephedrine 5 mg, or epinephrine 5 µg, as&#xD;
      needed. Norepinephrine infusion was used for persistent hypotension with low SVR. Dobutamine&#xD;
      or epinephrine infusion was administered if the MAP was ≥ 70 mm Hg, CVP and/or PAOP ≥ 7 mm Hg&#xD;
      and the cardiac output was &lt; 4.0 L. min-1. Hypertension (MAP increased &gt; 20% from the mean&#xD;
      baseline) was treated with deepening of anesthesia, bolus doses of nitroglycerin 0.05 mg or&#xD;
      labetalol 20 mg. Tachycardia (HR &gt; 20% from the baseline values) was treated with boluses of&#xD;
      esmolol 20 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All operations were performed by the same surgeons using the piggyback technique. After&#xD;
      portal vein clamping, infusion rates of fentanyl and rocuronium were reduced by approximately&#xD;
      50%. Fentanyl and rocuronium infusions were discontinued after peritoneal closure. After&#xD;
      completion of skin closure, sevoflurane was discontinued. The patients were transferred to&#xD;
      the ICU immediately after surgery, while intubated and postoperative analgesia was achieved&#xD;
      with rescue boluses of fentanyl 0.5 µg/kg when needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extubation criteria included cooperative, alertness, train-of-four ratio ≥ 0.9, spontaneous&#xD;
      breathing with tidal volume &gt; 5 mL/kg, respiratory rate &gt; 10 and &lt; 28 breaths/min, maximum&#xD;
      inspiratory pressure ≤ -20 cm H2O, stable hemodynamics, minimal bleeding, core temperature &gt;&#xD;
      35.5°C, urine output &gt; 0.5 mL/Kg/h, arterial carbon dioxide tension ≤ 45 mm Hg, arterial&#xD;
      oxygen tension &gt; 100 mm Hg and FiO2 &lt; 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the second postoperative day, the patients were asked about perioperative awareness and&#xD;
      recall by asking three simple questions using standard interview &quot;What was the last thing you&#xD;
      remembered happening before you went to sleep? What is the first thing you remember happening&#xD;
      on waking? Did you dream or have any other experiences whilst you were asleep?&quot; Another&#xD;
      investigator, who was not involved in the patient's management, collected the saved patients'&#xD;
      data. Preoperative MELD score, durations of warm ischemia and anhepatic phase, intraoperative&#xD;
      blood loss and fentanyl consumption were collected. Preoperatively (baseline) absolute values&#xD;
      and intraoperative average values for BIS, Et-Sevo, heart rate (HR), MAP, CVP, MPAP, CO,&#xD;
      PAOP, SVR, PVR, core temperature, pH, PaCO2, PaO2, SaO2 SvO2, and PvO2 were recorded during&#xD;
      hepatic dissection, anhepatic, and neohepatic phases and during surgical closure.&#xD;
      Postoperative total bilirubin, albumin level, liver enzymes (AST, ALT, GGT, and alkaline&#xD;
      phosphatase), PT, factors V and VII, time to extubation, ICU and hospital length of stays,&#xD;
      neurological complication, encephalopathy and 3 months-mortality were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were tested for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Repeated-measures analysis&#xD;
      of variance was used for analysis of serial changes in the patients' data at different times.&#xD;
      Fisher exact test was used for categorical data. Postulated independent predictors of BIS&#xD;
      readings included age, gender, MELD score, durations of surgical phases and warm ischemia,&#xD;
      Et-Sevo, average of intraoperative hemodynamic, temperature, oxygenation and acid base&#xD;
      variables, intraoperative blood loss and fentanyl consumption, were examined in a stepwise&#xD;
      manner into a multiple regression model, with entry and retention set at a significance level&#xD;
      of P &lt; 0.05 and removal set at P ≥ 0.1. Moreover, multivariate logistic regression was done&#xD;
      to identify the correlations between BIS values and blood loss, time to tracheal extubation,&#xD;
      postoperative liver function and coagulation variables, ICU length of stay, and 3&#xD;
      months-mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the accuracy of BIS in predicting survival rate after liver transplantation,&#xD;
      receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to describe the performance&#xD;
      characteristics of the BIS readings during different phases of surgery in predicting the&#xD;
      survival outcome. An ROC area of 1.0 is characteristic of an ideal model, whereas an area of&#xD;
      0.5 indicates a model of no diagnostic value. Cutoff values for mortality with the best&#xD;
      diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were derived from the ROC curve analyses. Unweighted&#xD;
      accuracy ((sensitivity + specificity) / 2) was also reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studied patients were further divided according to their outcome variables into survivors&#xD;
      (n = 32) and non-survivors (n = 10) subgroups. Independent Student-t- and Mann Whitney tests&#xD;
      were used as appropriate. Data were expressed as mean (standard deviation), number (%), or&#xD;
      median [range]. A value of P &lt; 0.05 was considered to represent statistical significance.&#xD;
