      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Family-based approaches to reduce disease risk and promote healthy behaviors may be better&#xD;
      than targeting individuals. Risk assessments based on family health history may help educate&#xD;
      families on disease risks and encourage them to change physical activity and food choices.&#xD;
      Specifically, researchers want to better understand the role of mothers in teaching healthy&#xD;
      behaviors to their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine mothers influence on diet and health-related behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study an intervention tool that connects family health history and disease risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - 18 years of age who have at least one child living at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete a survey over the phone. The survey will take 30 to 40&#xD;
           minutes to complete. The survey will collect family health history on heart disease,&#xD;
           diabetes, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will give participants a Family Health Package (FHP). The FHP will provide&#xD;
           information on family health history and disease risk. It will also recommend behaviors&#xD;
           that can reduce health risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two weeks after sending the FHP, participants will complete a phone survey about the FHP&#xD;
           materials and their social networks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some participants will be invited to focus groups. The focus groups will explore diet&#xD;
           and health behavior. They will look at food purchasing and preparation and meal sharing.&#xD;
           The groups will also discuss attitudes toward healthy eating and physical activity. Each&#xD;
           focus group will last 1 to 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to complete an electronic survey regarding participants&#xD;
           health status, causal health beliefs, risk perceptions, and intentions to communicate&#xD;
           health information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then, participants will have the opportunity to use the electronic version of the FHP,&#xD;
           which will assess family health history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After using the FHeP, participants will complete a short electronic survey to identify&#xD;
           knowledge and understanding gained from the use of the application, changes in&#xD;
           communication intentions, and suggestions for improvements to the application.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upon completion of the electronic portion of the study, a study team member will conduct&#xD;
           a semi-structured interview to allow the participants to qualitatively evaluate their&#xD;
           user experience, including satisfaction and usefulness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study process will take approximately 60-90 minutes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lifestyle behaviors, such as diet and physical activity, have been linked to the development&#xD;
      of a number of diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. Adopting a healthy&#xD;
      diet and other preventive health practices are effective ways to reduce associated diseases.&#xD;
      However, cancer, diabetes, and heart disease are etiologically complex with multiple risk&#xD;
      factors (e.g., genetic, environmental, lifestyle) that tend to cluster in families. Thus,&#xD;
      families are an important social context for intervention and lifestyle-focused disease&#xD;
      prevention. Our previous research indicates that intergenerational encouragement can motivate&#xD;
      behavior change and parents and women tend to be natural encouragers of health behaviors.&#xD;
      Therefore, a mixed-method pilot study will be conducted to explore how dietary habits and&#xD;
      healthy behaviors are transmitted across family generations and the motivational influence of&#xD;
      family health history regarding diseases associated with overweight and diet on improving&#xD;
      health behaviors. This pilot study will also assess participants comprehension of an&#xD;
      intervention tool outlining family health history and disease risk assessment that will be&#xD;
      used in a larger intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants for the paper-based Family Health Package (FHP) Evaluation Phase will be&#xD;
      recruited from an existing database developed by the Immersive Virtual Environment Testing&#xD;
      Area (IVETA) within the Social and Behavioral Research Branch, NHGRI, consisting of mothers&#xD;
      in the Washington, DC area, and through local advertisement and posting on&#xD;
      clinicaltrials.gov. Participants will complete a survey interview, providing us with a&#xD;
      detailed family health history. From this information, we will create a paper-based FHP that&#xD;
      will be sent to participants, consisting of a pedigree, disease risk algorithms, and health&#xD;
      guidelines. Participants will be invited to complete a follow-up survey interview, and focus&#xD;
      groups will be conducted with a subset of participants. Two initial focus groups will provide&#xD;
      feedback on the feasibility and acceptability of the FHP materials. After incorporating&#xD;
      revisions, an additional focus group will evaluate the FHP materials. All of the focus groups&#xD;
      will also explore diet and health behavior through semi-structured questions. Thematic&#xD;
      analysis will identify factors such as influences on health behaviors across generations and&#xD;
      the potential impact parents have on initiating and maintaining food choices within their&#xD;
      household and the influence of their family of origin on these choices. We have completed an&#xD;
      evaluation of the FHP within a predominantly under-resourced, African American community.&#xD;
      While the FHP was well received, participants suggested a need for an in-person,&#xD;
      community-based, family history health education program centered around concepts presented&#xD;
      in the FHP. To that end, we will develop and pilot test a health education program to&#xD;
      introduce the FHP to the community. Additional evaluations may be conducted, as necessary, to&#xD;
      improve the FHP and reach diverse populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The paper-based version of the FHP will be translated into an electronic version, the Family&#xD;
      Health ePortal (FHeP). Participants for the electronic Family Health ePortal (FHeP)&#xD;
      Evaluation Phase will be recruited from the general population through local advertisement&#xD;
      and posting on clinicaltrials.gov. Eligible participants will be consented and invited to&#xD;
      access the FHeP. The initial FHeP Evaluation Phase participants will access the FHeP&#xD;
      individually to provide feedback on the feasibility and acceptability of the FHeP materials&#xD;
      through surveys and a semi-structured interview. After incorporating revisions, subsequent&#xD;
      participants will be asked to invite their family members to access the FHeP and evaluate the&#xD;
      FHeP materials. FHeP participants will provide demographic, diet, and health behavior&#xD;
      information through pre- and post-test surveys as well as survey items within the FHeP.&#xD;
      Additional evaluation waves may be conducted, as necessary, to improve the FHeP and increase&#xD;
      reach to diverse populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate that the outcomes of these evaluations will 1) provide us with an effective&#xD;
      intervention tool for health education and minimizing disease risk within the family, and 2)&#xD;
      inform future intervention research. Further study can be directed toward providing family&#xD;
      members with appropriate tools to act as family genetic health educators in order to&#xD;
      disseminate disease risk information and encourage health promoting behaviors.&#xD;

        Recruitment strategies vary depending upon the substudy in which we are seeking&#xD;
        participation. For example, participants may be recruited from the general population. We&#xD;
        also seek to enroll members of under-resourced communities. A database that will assist&#xD;
        with recruitment in one substudy includes mothers with young children in the Washington, DC&#xD;
        area.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        FHP Evaluation Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligible participants for the FHP Evaluation Phase will be invited to participate in the&#xD;
        study if they meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. be able to read and speak English&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. age &gt;= 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. indicate a willingness to participate in a focus group/discussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The urban FHP evaluation phase (Washington, DC Metro area) also requires&#xD;
                  participants to have at least one child. (The rural FHP evaluation, Southeastern&#xD;
                  US, does not.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        This information will be gauged from the IVETA database and/or through the initial&#xD;
        recruitment discussion. This inclusion criteria has been established as we are interested&#xD;
        in examining health behaviors across generations in an efficient and timely manner through&#xD;
        surveys and focus groups. Focus group participants will be recruited from the larger sample&#xD;
        of participants completing surveys. Therefore, participants will be required to read and&#xD;
        speak English as the focus&#xD;
&#xD;
        groups will be conducted in English. As this is a pilot study, it is not feasible to&#xD;
        recruit large numbers of participants in order to do the focus groups and provide versions&#xD;
        of the survey in alternate languages.&#xD;
