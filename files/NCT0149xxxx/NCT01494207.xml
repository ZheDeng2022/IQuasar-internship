      The main aim of this study is to measure the effectiveness of a worksite health promotion&#xD;
      programme on improving physical activity behaviour and associated biological risk factors for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease among South African employees at increased risk for cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases. Additionally, the investigators will conduct an economic evaluation to determine&#xD;
      the associated cost- effectiveness of these health related interventions offered at South&#xD;
      African companies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that employees who receive the intervention counseling will&#xD;
      have increased levels of physical activity and reduced risk for cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      compared to those in the control group.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Working on Wellness - WOW&quot; is a randomised controlled trial in South African worksites with&#xD;
      a 12 month follow-up. Randomisation will take place at the company level, where participating&#xD;
      companies will be assigned to either the intervention or the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population and Recruitment The study will be conducted in cooperation with a major&#xD;
      national health insurer. Large companies (&gt;300 employees) that are clients of this insurer,&#xD;
      offering health and wellness days from August 2009 to February 2010 and that are based in&#xD;
      Cape Town and Johannesburg will be approached to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereafter, over the course of two months all employees from these companies will be invited&#xD;
      to participate in the wellness day(s) of their company. The invitation will take place as&#xD;
      part of the feedback session at the wellness day and comprehensive information will be&#xD;
      provided about the study. Employees agreeing to participate will be asked to sign an informed&#xD;
      consent and to provide their email address and contact details. Participants will receive a&#xD;
      small incentive at the start of the research study, and again upon completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because all the companies hosting wellness days in this research study are clients of a major&#xD;
      national health insurer, we will be able to access data for employees who do not volunteer&#xD;
      for the screening activities. The data for the employees who choose not to participate will&#xD;
      be sent to the researchers without any personal identifiers, thus ensuring employee&#xD;
      confidentially. Being able to describe the non-responders is one of the strengths of this&#xD;
      study design, and the insured population with whom we are working, providing insight into the&#xD;
      problem of selection bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group The employees in the control group will receive usual care. This comprises of&#xD;
      feedback at the health and wellness day, referring employees to their physician if needed,&#xD;
      and encouraging them to increase their level of physical activity and to improve nutrition in&#xD;
      a generic way. They will receive general health promotion material detailing the risks for&#xD;
      CVD and with advice on improving lifestyle behaviour. The participants from the control&#xD;
      companies will also participate in follow up measurements at 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Group Individuals in the intervention group will receive the same advice and&#xD;
      health promotion materials as those in the control group. Additionally, they will be offered&#xD;
      an individually tailored intervention that consists of one-on-one counselling and educational&#xD;
      materials. The counselling sessions will incorporate motivational interviewing techniques, to&#xD;
      help the employee identify goals and strategies to improve their lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intervention mapping (IM) approach will be conducted at the start of the research study&#xD;
      13. This IM process will further inform the type and nature of intervention, including&#xD;
      variables such as the optimal number of face-to face contacts and telephone contacts. Based&#xD;
      on the research study by Groeneveld et al. it is envisaged that approximately two face to&#xD;
      face and four telephone contacts will be required 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health Risk Appraisal (HRA) Questionnaire The HRA is comprised of demographic, health and&#xD;
      lifestyle factors, as well as questions related to stages of change for the various risk&#xD;
      behaviours. The demographic variables include age and gender; while the lifestyle measures&#xD;
      include smoking status, fruit and vegetable intake, habitual alcohol consumption and habitual&#xD;
      physical activity. For smoking, fruit and vegetable intake and habitual physical activity,&#xD;
      the participant also reports on readiness to change or improve these behaviours. The&#xD;
      questions on readiness to change are based on the Transtheoretical Model stages of change 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Global Physical Activity Questionnaire Habitual physical activity will be measured using the&#xD;
      'Global Physical Activity Questionnaire' (GPAQ) 14. This is a self administered questionnaire&#xD;
      that includes questions on habitual levels of light, moderate and vigorous activity.&#xD;
      Furthermore, a sub sample of employees will be randomly selected to wear a pedometer for 4&#xD;
      consecutive days to measure the number of steps taken per day 15. This will provide a more&#xD;
      objective measure of physical activity at baseline, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary Habits Habitual dietary fat intake will be measured using the Short Fat Questionnaire&#xD;
      16. In addition, participants will complete a food frequency questionnaire where they will&#xD;
      record the type and amount of food consumed in an average week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presenteeism and Absenteeism The Healthy Days Questionnaire devised and tested by the US&#xD;
      Centers for Disease control, will be used to measure health-related quality of life. Healthy&#xD;
      days are calculated using a series of 4 questions, focusing on general perceived health,&#xD;
      self-rated physical and mental health and the extent to which physical and/or mental health&#xD;
      may have limited activity within the past 30 days 17. Absenteeism data will be obtained from&#xD;
      the company's Human Resource office, in addition to the participant keeping a log book.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Measures All screening will conducted by qualified, trained staff, provided by the&#xD;
      health insurer and will form part of their wellness day which is offered to their corporate&#xD;
      clients. The following clinical measures will be performed at the wellness days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cholesterol screening will be conducted using finger-prick capillary blood samples (Accutrend&#xD;
      Â® GC analysers, Roche Diagnostics) to measure total serum cholesterol concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure will be measured twice per person using an automated sphygmomanometer.&#xD;
      Employees will be instructed to sit quietly for approximately three minutes before being&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standing height (cm) will be measured to the nearest 0.1 cm, using a stadiometer. Body weight&#xD;
      will be measured using a portable calibrated scale and recorded to the nearest 0.1 kg. Body&#xD;
      Mass Index (BMI) will be calculated as body mass (kg) divided by height (m) squared (kg/m2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process Evaluation A process evaluation will be conducted to determine if the intervention&#xD;
      was implemented as intended. The counselors and participants' will be required to critically&#xD;
      appraise the various components of the intervention and to grade their experience. Fidelity&#xD;
      intervention will be measured by the research team, using the MITI software to monitor&#xD;
      contents and quality of interviews having taken place, attendance and number of missed and&#xD;
      re-scheduled appointments).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-effectiveness analysis The cost-effectiveness of the intervention programme will be&#xD;
      determined from the societal perspective. The two main outcomes are the change in habitual&#xD;
      physical activity levels and CVD risk profile to be determined by SCORE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention costs that will be included in models include the cost of the wellness days&#xD;
      for NCD risk screening, training of counsellors, employment costs of counsellors, opportunity&#xD;
      cost that may be lost if employee's sessions are during working hours, health promotion&#xD;
      material, incentives, travel and telephone calls. Direct health care costs will be based on&#xD;
      health-related claims data that will be obtained from the medical insurer. Indirect costs&#xD;
      include costs for sickness absenteeism and costs for presenteeism. In addition, participants&#xD;
      will keep a medical costs and absenteeism diary every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses STATISTICA software package was used for all the analyses (Stasoft, Inc.&#xD;
      184-199, Tulsa OK, SA) and intention to treat analysis will be performed for each of the&#xD;
      outcomes. Mean, standard deviation and standard error will be calculated for the continuous&#xD;
      variables. Frequency tables will be used to determine the percentage of individuals at risk,&#xD;
      and also for the stages of change data. Chi squared analysis will be done to compare the&#xD;
      percentage of employees meeting physical activity recommendations before and after the&#xD;
      intervention. An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) will be performed to determine whether there&#xD;
      were significant changes in physical activity habits and nutrition in the intervention and&#xD;
      control groups at 6 and 12 months. Logistic regression analyses will be completed, both&#xD;
      before and after adjusting for confounders such as age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the economic evaluation, cost effective ratio's will be calculated by dividing the&#xD;
      difference between the mean total costs of the intervention and usual care groups, by the&#xD;
      difference in the means effects (such as change in physical activity). The confidence&#xD;
      intervals of all the ratios will be determined using the bootstrapping technique.&#xD;
      Furthermore, each of the cost effective ratios will be graphically presented on a cost&#xD;
      effectiveness plane.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Employees identified to be at 'increased' or 'high' risk for CVD are eligible to take part&#xD;
        in the research study. Risk status will be determined by using the (Euro) SCORE 12,&#xD;
        together with their habitual physical activity levels, and Body Mass Index. SCORE&#xD;
        incorporates age, total cholesterol, blood pressure and smoking status. This score ranks&#xD;
        individuals according to their level of risk, ranging from very low to very high 10-year&#xD;
        risk of fatal CVD (Appendix 1). Those with a risk of 5% or higher will be considered&#xD;
        eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Independent of the risk score, employees who are inactive (i.e., who do not comply with at&#xD;
        least 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity on at least 5 days per week), or who&#xD;
        smoke, and employees who are overweight (i.e., Body Mass Index â¥ 25 kg/m2) also will be&#xD;
        eligible to take part in the study. Other inclusion criteria include being older than 18&#xD;
        years and having a contract with employer until end of 12-month measurement period&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Employees will be excluded for the following reasons: pregnancy, diagnosis or&#xD;
             treatment of cancer, any other disorder that makes physical activity impossible.&#xD;
             Contract workers whose employ with the company will end before the 12 month follow up&#xD;
             measurement, will also be excluded from the study.&#xD;
