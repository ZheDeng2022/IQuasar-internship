  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be receiving a stem cell transplant as treatment for their disease. As part of&#xD;
      the stem cell transplant, patients will be given very strong doses of chemotherapy, which&#xD;
      will kill all their existing stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A close relative of the patient will be identified, whose stem cells are not a perfect match&#xD;
      for the patient's, but can be used. This type of transplant is called &quot;allogeneic&quot;, meaning&#xD;
      that the cells are from a donor. With this type of donor who is not a perfect match, there is&#xD;
      typically an increased risk of developing GvHD, and a longer delay in the recovery of the&#xD;
      immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GvHD is a serious and sometimes fatal side-effect of stem cell transplant. GvHD occurs when&#xD;
      the new donor cells (graft) recognize that the body tissues of the patient (host) are&#xD;
      different from those of the donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, investigators are trying to see whether they can make special T cells in the&#xD;
      laboratory that can be given to the patient to help their immune system recover faster. As a&#xD;
      safety measure, we want to &quot;program&quot; the T cells so that if, after they have been given to&#xD;
      the patient, they start to cause GvHD, we can destroy them (&quot;suicide gene&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will obtain T cells from a donor, culture them in the laboratory, and then&#xD;
      introduce the &quot;suicide gene&quot; which makes the cells sensitive to a specific drug called&#xD;
      AP1903. If the specially modified T cells begin to cause GvHD, the investigators can kill the&#xD;
      cells by administering AP1903 to the patient. We have had encouraging results in a previous&#xD;
      study regarding the effective elimination of T cells causing GvHD, while sparing a sufficient&#xD;
      number of T cells to fight infection and potentially cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More specifically, T cells made to carry a gene called iCasp9 can be killed when they&#xD;
      encounter the drug AP1903. To get the iCasp9 gene into T cells, we insert it using a virus&#xD;
      called a retrovirus that has been made for this study. The AP1903 that will be used to&#xD;
      &quot;activate&quot; the iCasp9 is an experimental drug that has been tested in a study in normal&#xD;
      donors with no bad side-effects. We hope we can use this drug to kill the T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major purpose of this study is to find a safe and effective dose of &quot;iCasp9&quot; T cells that&#xD;
      can be given to patients who receive an allogeneic stem cell transplant. Another important&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to find out whether these special T cells can help the patient's&#xD;
      immune system recover faster after the transplant than they would have otherwise.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If the patient is doing well after the stem cell transplant, and does not have severe GvHD,&#xD;
      s/he will be eligible to receive the special &quot;iCasp9&quot; T cells from Day 30 to 90 after&#xD;
      transplant. The specially selected and treated T cells will be given by vein (IV) once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a dose escalation study. This means that at the beginning, patients will be started&#xD;
      on the lowest dose (1 of 5 different levels) of T cells. Once that dose schedule proves safe,&#xD;
      the next group of patients will be started at a higher dose. This process will continue until&#xD;
      all 5 dose levels are studied. If the side-effects are too severe, the dose will be lowered&#xD;
      or the T cell injections will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient develops GvHD after being given the specially treated T cells, we will&#xD;
      prescribe AP1903, which has been shown to kill cells carrying the iCasp9 gene. This drug will&#xD;
      be given as a 2-hour IV infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will continue to follow the patient weekly in the bone marrow transplant clinic for the&#xD;
      first month after the infusion, to check for side-effects of the treatment and for GvHD. The&#xD;
      patient will have the standard tests performed that all patients have after transplant, even&#xD;
      when not receiving special T cells.&#xD;
