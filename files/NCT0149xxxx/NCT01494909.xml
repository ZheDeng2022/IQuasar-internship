  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is a significant problem in children and adults with Cystic fibrosis (CF). An&#xD;
      impaired intestinal digestion and absorption capacity is one of the main factors responsible&#xD;
      for the malnutrition in CF. This impairment starts early in life, leading to malnutrition,&#xD;
      muscle weakness, impaired immune and lung function associated with poor prognosis. As low BMI&#xD;
      and body weight is strongly associated with morbidity and mortality, a reduction in weight&#xD;
      loss in CF and its manifestations would save the healthcare system substantially per year.&#xD;
      Simple methods to measure the digested portions and utilization of nutrients and the&#xD;
      effectiveness of pancreatic enzyme preparations and medications in CF are not available.&#xD;
      Developing a panel of methods to accurately measure gut digestion, absorption and function&#xD;
      will lead to studies optimizing nutritional regimen and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy&#xD;
      in CF. Furthermore, it will provide detailed insight in the disease and age related&#xD;
      mechanisms of gut dysfunction in CF. Finally, it will provide required information that will&#xD;
      lead to implement new strategies to improve gut health in order to enhance nutritional&#xD;
      status, quality of life and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that intestinal macronutrient digestion, absorption and function in CF can&#xD;
      be quantified by an innovative panel of methods using stable isotopes. With this panel of&#xD;
      methods, information can be obtained on the effect of disease progression on lipid, protein&#xD;
      and glucose digestion and absorption and on gut function in CF as well as in other diseases&#xD;
      and conditions characterized by a compromised gut. Furthermore, the optimal nutritional&#xD;
      regimen and pancreatic enzyme therapy if applicable can be evaluated in these diseases. In&#xD;
      the present study the investigators will study: 1. Pediatric patients with CF at Arkansas&#xD;
      Children's Hospital; 2. Adult patients with CF at University of Arkansas for Medical&#xD;
      Sciences. 3. Healthy control subjects. Diagnosis of CF is made based on universal diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria. All CF patients are characterized by abnormal lipid digestion based on clinical and&#xD;
      or laboratory (72 hour fat analysis or fecal elastase measurement) diagnosis, and requiring&#xD;
      pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, and no presence of unstable metabolic diseases.&#xD;
      Additional criteria for the CF pediatric inpatients are: admitted to ACH for treatment of&#xD;
      exacerbations of CF disease, clinically stable. The CF outpatients are stable outpatients&#xD;
      with pancreatic insufficiency.&#xD;
