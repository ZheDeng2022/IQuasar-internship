      Dexmedetomidine is a sedative drug that has many benefits when given to children under&#xD;
      anesthesia, such as improved pain relief and reduced agitation following their surgery. It is&#xD;
      usually given as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes, to avoid the changes in heart rate&#xD;
      and blood pressure that are occasionally seen when it is administered more quickly. However,&#xD;
      this is often infeasible and usually inconvenient. The investigators aim to determine the&#xD;
      dose of dexmedetomidine that can be given rapidly (over 5 seconds) without causing&#xD;
      significant changes in heart rate and blood pressure. This will be the only study specific&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

      Purpose This study is being conducted to determine the dose of dexmedetomidine that can be&#xD;
      given as a rapid bolus (over 5 seconds) following induction of anesthesia and insertion of a&#xD;
      laryngeal mask airway (LMA) without causing significant hemodynamic compromise in healthy&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis We hypothesize that a rapid bolus of dexmedetomidine does not cause significant&#xD;
      hemodynamic effects in healthy children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification Dexmedetomidine given in a single peri-operative bolus without subsequent&#xD;
      infusion has been shown to be beneficial. It would be arguably more practical to administer&#xD;
      the dose as a rapid bolus. The hemodynamic effects of this have not been previously studied&#xD;
      in healthy ASA I-II children (aged 5-10 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The objective of this study is to determine the dose of dexmedetomidine that can&#xD;
      be given as a rapid bolus in healthy children following induction of total intravenous&#xD;
      anesthesia (TIVA) without causing significant hemodynamic compromise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method This is a prospective, sequential design study using the up-and-down method&#xD;
      (UDM) to determine the dose of dexmedetomidine that will prevent hemodynamic compromise&#xD;
      following a rapid bolus in healthy children. The only study specific intervention will be a&#xD;
      bolus of dexmedetomidine following induction of TIVA and insertion of an LMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operatively Heart rate (HR), non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), respiratory rate (RR)&#xD;
      and oxygen saturation (SpO2) will be obtained in the SDCU. Topical local anesthesia will be&#xD;
      applied to potential cannulation sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-operatively Following establishment of intravenous access, induction of anesthesia will&#xD;
      proceed with lidocaine 1 mg/kg, propofol 4 mg/kg and remifentanil 2 mcg/kg, administered as a&#xD;
      bolus over 5 seconds. Bag mask ventilation with 100% oxygen will then be administered whilst&#xD;
      SpO2, electrocardiogram (ECG), NIBP and Bispectral Index (BIS) monitoring is attached.&#xD;
      Maintenance of anesthesia will be commenced after 30 seconds, with total intravenous&#xD;
      anesthesia (TIVA) prepared as a combined infusion of a fixed concentration of propofol 10&#xD;
      mg/ml and remifentanil 5 mcg/ml (PR5) at a dose of propofol 200 mcg/kg/min and remifentanil&#xD;
      0.1 mcg/kg/min, as is the routine practice at BCCH. If further anesthesia is required, rescue&#xD;
      doses of PR5 will be administered as propofol 0.5 mg/kg combined with remifentanil 0.25&#xD;
      mcg/kg until a satisfactory level of anesthesia is reached. Any rescue doses given will be&#xD;
      documented. After the maintenance infusion is commenced, a NIBP will be recorded. A&#xD;
      pre-programmed bolus dose of 10 ml/kg 0.9% saline will simultaneously be delivered (over 10&#xD;
      minutes) when the maintenance TIVA infusion is commenced. Following this, the intravenous&#xD;
      fluid infusion will be programmed to run at maintenance rates according to the weight of the&#xD;
      child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One minute after induction, an LMA will be inserted and secured in place (T0). Positive&#xD;
      pressure ventilation will be commenced, or the patient allowed to breathe spontaneously, as&#xD;
      appropriate. Supplemental oxygen will be administered as needed to maintain SpO2 â‰¥ 96%. If&#xD;
      further anesthesia is required, rescue doses of PR5 will be administered and documented, as&#xD;
      above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One minute after successful LMA insertion (T1), a NIBP recording will be taken, along with a&#xD;
      baseline HR that will be being monitored continuously. This will constitute the baseline NIBP&#xD;
      and HR (pre-study drug intervention) and will be used to define changes in hemodynamics of&#xD;
      systolic, mean, diastolic blood pressure (SBP, MAP and DBP, respectively) and HR following&#xD;
      the study drug intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One minute after the baseline NIBP is recorded, a bolus dose of dexmedetomidine will be&#xD;
      administered over 5 seconds (T2). The dose will be dictated by the UDM study design, with a&#xD;
      starting dose of 0.5 mcg/kg. The dexmedetomidine will be diluted in 0.9% saline to achieve&#xD;
      the required concentration of 4 mcg/ml prior to administration. NIBP readings will be&#xD;
      recorded every minute following the bolus, for a period of 10 minutes (T3-12). After this&#xD;
      time period, the study will be complete. A BIS value will be recorded before and after the&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine bolus. The maintenance rate of TIVA will then be adjusted and further opioid&#xD;
      given as per the anesthesiologist's preference, prior to and during surgery. NIBP readings&#xD;
      will be recorded every 5 minutes throughout surgery and every 15 minutes in Post Anesthetic&#xD;
      Care Unit (PACU), in addition to continuous ECG, HR and SpO2 monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis The turning point estimator of Choi will be used to estimate the target&#xD;
      dose. This describes how values of pairs at the crossover points are averaged. It is a form&#xD;
      of target dose estimation that is frequently used in anesthesia UDM research.&#xD;
