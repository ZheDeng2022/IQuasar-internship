    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of multiple doses of isavuconazole on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine in healthy adult subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be enrolled to receive a single dose of cyclosporine on Day 1 followed by a&#xD;
      10-day wash-out period (time from cyclosporine dosing to isavuconazole dosing). On Days 11&#xD;
      and 12, isavuconazole will be dosed three times daily (TID). On Days 13 through 18,&#xD;
      isavuconazole will be administered once daily (QD). All subjects will be administered a&#xD;
      single dose of cyclosporine on Day 15. Subjects will be confined in the study center from Day&#xD;
      -1 until Day 5 and from Day 10 until Day 19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow up visit will be scheduled approximately 7 ± 2 days after final dosing of&#xD;
      isavuconazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine samples will be taken at various times during the study.&#xD;
