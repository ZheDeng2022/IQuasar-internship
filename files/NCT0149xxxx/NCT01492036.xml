  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to collect information about the long-term safety&#xD;
      of gene transfer therapy. This study is also designed to create a database of medical&#xD;
      information about patients who have received gene transfer therapy, in order for researchers&#xD;
      to track and review the long-term safety and any effects (good or bad) of gene transfer&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

      Study Procedures for Years 1-5:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will come to the clinic for study visits once a&#xD;
      year during Years 1-5. It is your choice whether to visit your regular local doctor or your&#xD;
      study doctor at MD Anderson. (If you visit your regular local doctor, you will need to have&#xD;
      your test results and blood samples mailed to the study staff.) You will receive a reminder&#xD;
      phone call once a year, when it is time to schedule these visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At these visits, the following procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-4 tablespoons each time) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs (blood&#xD;
           pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will fill out a questionnaire that asks about your medical history (your general&#xD;
           health, the status of any medical conditions, and any illnesses or hospitalizations that&#xD;
           may have occurred). It should take about 15-30 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked if there have been any changes in your contact information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If necessary to check the status of the disease, you will have scans (x-rays and/or&#xD;
           computed tomography [CT] scans) and/or additional routine blood tests (about 1-2&#xD;
           tablespoons).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures for Years 6-15:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a year during Years 6-15, the research staff will contact you. Either over the phone, by&#xD;
      email, or by mail (but usually by mail, with an enclosed questionnaire), you will be asked&#xD;
      about your medical history (including if you have had any children since the infusion) and&#xD;
      whether there have been any changes in your contact information. The phone calls and&#xD;
      questionnaires should take about 15-30 minutes each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of Study Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any of the tests that are performed in this study suggest that you may have a medical&#xD;
      condition and/or side effect that is likely to be related to the gene transfer therapy, the&#xD;
      study doctor will contact you. You will receive a referral in case you would like to seek&#xD;
      medical care for the condition and/or side effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You and/or your insurance provider will be responsible for the costs of any CT scans and&#xD;
      x-rays that may be needed for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Database:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your medical information that is collected for this study will be stored in a research&#xD;
      database at MD Anderson for use in future research related to the safety and effects of gene&#xD;
      transfer therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your data will be given a code number. No identifying information will be directly linked to&#xD;
      your data. Only the researcher or authorized personnel in charge of the database will have&#xD;
      access to the code numbers and be able to link the data to you. This is to allow medical&#xD;
      information related to your data to be updated as needed. Other researchers using your data&#xD;
      will not be able to link this data to you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in Parent/Guardian Contact:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are younger than 18 years old when joining this study but turn 18 during this study,&#xD;
      starting then, the research staff will contact you directly for this study instead of your&#xD;
      parent/guardian. However, if you would prefer for your parent/guardian to still be the main&#xD;
      contact person, please tell the study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 15 years, your participation in this study will be over unless the FDA decides that&#xD;
      follow-up must continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 130 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

    <description>First 5 years following infusion of vector or vector-treated cells: Participants evaluated on annual basis. Years 6 to 15 following infusion of vector or vector-treated cells: Participants mailed questionnaires. Participants in retroviral studies: Up to 60 mL (max 1 mL/kg) blood will be obtained to check for replication-competent retrovirus (RCR) every 3 months during the first year, and then blood archived annually thereafter. Replication competent vector testing performed when there is a clinical indication or when requested by the FDA.</description>
