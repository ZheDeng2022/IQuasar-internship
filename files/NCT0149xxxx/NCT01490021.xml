  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Episodic and working memory processes are the most affected cognitive domains in Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Disease (AD) and its early stage, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Transcranial Magnetic&#xD;
      Stimulation (TMS) is a unique tool to interfere with cognitive processes by inducing &quot;virtual&#xD;
      and transient lesions&quot;, mimicking those observed in MCI. It has proven repeatedly its&#xD;
      capacity to interfere with encoding-retrieval memory task. However, to date, only few imaging&#xD;
      data exist on the cerebral pathways involved in encoding memory task. Moreover, the stability&#xD;
      of TMS effects over time remains to be investigated. If proven to be a stable interfering&#xD;
      challenge, TMS could be used to investigate the potential restoring effect of new medication&#xD;
      in AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is the pilot study of a larger clinical trial which aims to prove the utility of&#xD;
      rTMS as a potential model for prediction of clinical efficacy using a combination of&#xD;
      cognitive and neuroimaging endpoints.&#xD;

      in AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is the pilot study of a larger clinical trial which aims to prove the utility of&#xD;
      rTMS as a potential model for prediction of clinical efficacy using a combination of&#xD;
      cognitive and neuroimaging endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study specifically aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine the cerebral region to stimulate using functional neuronavigation,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate the effects of rTMS on behavioral and functional imaging data (functional&#xD;
           Magnetic Resonance Imaging, fMRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to investigate the stability of the TMS interfering effects by replicating the&#xD;
           experimental day up to 4 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is composed of two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part A: on Day 1, the subjects will perform the episodic memory task in the MRI scanner&#xD;
           to determine individual main activations. The mean activation peak obtained by a group&#xD;
           analysis will be used as the target coordinates during the part B. Two weeks later, on&#xD;
           Day 2, the subjects will repeat the episodic memory task in the MRI scanner. The BOLD&#xD;
           signal changes will be compared between Day 1 and Day 2 to investigate the stability of&#xD;
           the activations elicited by the memory task.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part B: subjects will randomly be assigned to Group 1 or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  GROUP 1: The subjects will come on 4 different days. On each day, the subjects will&#xD;
                perform the episodic memory task while being actively stimulated using rTMS over&#xD;
                L-DLPFC and Vertex (control region) in random order and will undergo an fMRI&#xD;
                session on Day 1 and Day 2. Later, they will undergo another set of behavioral&#xD;
                tasks from the CANTAB battery and will be stimulated by rTMS using a placebo coil.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  GROUP 2: The subjects will come on 4 different days. On each day, the subjects will&#xD;
                perform the episodic memory task while being actively stimulated using rTMS over&#xD;
                L-DLPFC and Vertex (control region) in random order and will undergo an fMRI&#xD;
                session on Day 1 and Day 2. Later, they will undergo another set of behavioral&#xD;
                tasks from the CANTAB battery and will be stimulated by rTMS using an active coil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total expected number of subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      34 subjects for the Parts A and B PART A: 10 subjects PART B: 24 subjects (12 per group)&#xD;
