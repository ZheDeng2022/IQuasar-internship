      The purpose of this study is to identify the number of persons in Denmark with the diagnose&#xD;
      hypoparathyroidism, autosomal dominant hypocalcaemia or pseudohypoparathyroidism. Also the&#xD;
      investigators want to identify the causes and symptoms of these patients and their prognosis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) is a relatively rare disease, where the level of parathyroid&#xD;
      hormone (parat hormone [PTH]) cannot maintain a physiologically sufficient concentration of&#xD;
      plasma calcium (P-Ca). This may be due to neck surgery (most frequently), congenital HypoPT,&#xD;
      auto-immune destruction of the parathyroid gland, peripheral resistance to PTH, pseudoHypoPT&#xD;
      or magnesium deficiency, by which PTH cannot be released from parathyroid gland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low plasma levels of P-Ca are registered by the calcium-sensing-receptors (CaSR) located e.g.&#xD;
      in the gld. Parathyroid cell membranes and in the renal tubules, by which the flow of PTH&#xD;
      into plasma increases, with normalization of P-Ca and decreasing P-phosphate to follow. By&#xD;
      lack of PTH the renal synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol is dismissed, with decreased&#xD;
      bone turnover as a consequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Congenital causes of HypoPT are very rare and seen either sporadic or hereditary. The&#xD;
      hereditary forms are more frequent in some areas of the world: founder-effect and familial&#xD;
      marriages. Autoimmune HypoPT caused by mutations in the AIRE gene results in lack of negative&#xD;
      selection of the T-cells in thymus. Autosomal dominant hypocalcaemia is caused by&#xD;
      gain-of-function mutations in the G-protein receptor CaRS in the main cells in the&#xD;
      parathyroid gland and kidney tubules. PseudoHypoPT is due to resistance in the target organs,&#xD;
      despite high concentrations of PTH. The symptoms are shown by Albrights's hereditary&#xD;
      osteodystrophy, (AOH), (maternal allel). PseudopseudoHypoPT is characterized by AOH, but&#xD;
      without the typical biochemical findings (paternal allel).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical manifestations of HypoPT depend on whether it occurs acute or chronic. The&#xD;
      affected systems are the neuromuscular, ectodermal, ocular, cardia and neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      system and manifest by increased neuromuscular irritability including weakness, muscle&#xD;
      cramps, paresthesias of the lips, tongue, fingers and feet, memory loss, cardiac arrhythmias&#xD;
      and heart insufficient headaches, and uncontrollable cramping muscle movements of the wrists&#xD;
      and feet (carpopedal spasms) and possibly dry and scaling skin. In severe cases there may be&#xD;
      cataract. In children symptoms may include malformations of the teeth. Due to high blood&#xD;
      phosphorous levels, intracranial calcifications (basal ganglia), renal stones, and renal&#xD;
      failure may develop. Studies have shown that HypoPT patients have reduced quality of life&#xD;
      compared to a control group; more often have anxiety, depression and feel somatic.&#xD;
      Furthermore, they have more physical symptoms like fatigue, ache, pain in the extremists and&#xD;
      heart complaints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of PTH decreases during pregnancy, while the level of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol&#xD;
      almost double due to placental and increased renal expression of 1Î±-hydroxylase with&#xD;
      increased intestinal calcium absorption to follow, This improves maters calcium homeostasis&#xD;
      why pregnant women should be monitored closely to prevent complications for the fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard therapy includes treatment with calcium and 1alfa-hydroxylated forms of vitamin D&#xD;
      (e.g. calcitriol or alphacalcidol) in order to relieve the symptoms associated with&#xD;
      hypocalcaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The aim of the project is to identify the number of people in Denmark with HypoPT incl.&#xD;
      autosomal dominant hypocalcaemia and pseudohypoparathyroidism (case-finding-study), identify&#xD;
      possible complications, especially the prevalence of kidney disease, cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric disease, fertility, hospitalization required hypo- or hypercalcaemia,&#xD;
      overall number of hospitalizations and mortality (case-control study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design The study is primarily conducted as a case finding study where patients with possible&#xD;
      hypoparathyroidism are identified through registry extracts with subsequent validation of the&#xD;
      diagnose (case-status) by reviewing their medical charts. Secondary there are preformed a&#xD;
      case-control-study and a clinical characterization of patients with idiopathic&#xD;
      hypoparathyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition (verification) of hypoparathyroidism: A patient is considered to have verified&#xD;
      HypoPT when a person in question has been diagnosed with hypoparathyroid hypocalcaemia witch&#xD;
      has made it necessary to treat with drug from pharmaceutical group A11CC (vitamin D), whom&#xD;
      the person in question has redeemed a prescription for at least 2 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient materials The participants are selected through two registry studies (search&#xD;
      strategies) see flowcharts. The first register study is via the National Patient Register,&#xD;
      while the second search is based on the Medicine Database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data extraction: For individuals identified through one of the two search strategies the&#xD;
      following information are requested through the National Patient Registry, the Registry of&#xD;
      Abortion, the Death Registry and the CPR Registry. All diagnose codes (from 1977-today),&#xD;
      vital status, information about fertility and in case of death, the cause of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data processing: All patients who have been identified though one of the above-mentioned data&#xD;
      extraction will have copy of their journals, discharge summary and blood samples required&#xD;
      concerning verification of the diagnose. In case of doubt the general practitioner can be&#xD;
      contacted. For patients with a verified diagnose sex, birth data, time of onset and the cause&#xD;
      of the disease will be registered. For patients with idiopathic HypoPT data about the&#xD;
      examinations conducted to clarify the possible causes of the disease are also recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To clarify the possible complications (comorbidity) to HypoPT, including the diseases&#xD;
      influence on the patient's life expectancy a matched control population is requested from the&#xD;
      CPR Registry. For each case with verified HypoPT 3 random control person matched on sex and&#xD;
      age are withdrawn. For the control group a data extraction corresponding to the extraction on&#xD;
      the patients with HypoPT are made. For both the patients with HypoPT and the control group&#xD;
      the diagnoses are verified through review of journals and medical summaries. In case of doubt&#xD;
      the general practitioner can be contacted. Besides clarifying the overall mortality and&#xD;
      co-morbidity a stratified analysis of co-morbidity is conducted separated on ATC-groups with&#xD;
      focusing on the cardiovascular, renal and neuropsychiatric complications. Stratification will&#xD;
      also be conducted on reasons for developing HypoPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research biobank The withdrawn blood samples will be stored in a research biobank for 15&#xD;
      years. The participants will be asked to give consent for this purpose. In addition they will&#xD;
      be requested to give consent so the biological material can be used for further research upon&#xD;
      specific approval by the local ethical committee. The biobank will be notified to the Danish&#xD;
      Data Protection Agency under applicable law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistic There will be calculated prevalence and incidence with corresponding 95 %&#xD;
      confidence interval, CI, and mortality. Since the presence of HypoPT in Denmark and worldwide&#xD;
      is unknown, it is not possible to perform power calculations for the case-control study.&#xD;
