  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part study. Part A is a three-period study in approximately 24 healthy male&#xD;
      Japanese and Caucasian subjects. Period 1 and Period 2 will be an open label study to&#xD;
      investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single ascending intravenous&#xD;
      doses of GSK2251052. Period 3 is a single blind, placebo controlled, repeat fixed dose design&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of multiple intravenous doses of&#xD;
      GSK2251052 for 12 days. The selection of the repeat IV dose will be based on the results from&#xD;
      Periods 1 and 2. Japanese subjects will be stratified based on their metabolic genotype,&#xD;
      polymorphic or wild-type for ADH and ALDH. Caucasian subjects are not anticipated to have&#xD;
      these enzyme polymorphisms and therefore will not be stratified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B is a two cohort, single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-rising, repeat&#xD;
      dose study in approximately 24 healthy male and female subjects to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of supratherapeutic IV doses of GSK2251052 for 10 days.&#xD;
      Cohort 1 subjects will be randomized to receive 2250 mg of GSK2251052 or placebo and Cohort 2&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized to receive 3000 mg GSK2251052 or placebo. The decision to conduct&#xD;
      Cohort 2 of Part B will be based on the available toxicology cover results from ongoing&#xD;
      preclinical toxicity studies.&#xD;

             physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical&#xD;
             examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical&#xD;
             abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the population&#xD;
             being studied may be included only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor&#xD;
             agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not&#xD;
             interfere with the study procedures. Subjects with coagulation, reticulocyte, or Hgb&#xD;
             values outside the normal range should always be excluded from enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Japanese defined as being born in Japan, having four ethnic Japanese grandparents,&#xD;
             holding a Japanese passport or identity papers and being able to speak Japanese.&#xD;
             Japanese subjects should also have lived outside Japan for less than 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The following genetic variants of ADH and ALDH will be acceptable: Group 1 Japanese:&#xD;
             ADH1B (*/1*1), ADH1B (*1/*2), ADH1B (*2/*2); ALDH2 (*1/*1). Group 2 Japanese: ADH1B&#xD;

             ADH1B (*2/*2); ALDH2 (*2/*2). Group 3 Caucasian: ADH1B (*/1*1); ALDH2 (*1/*1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Part A: Japanese or Caucasian Male between 20 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the&#xD;
             time of signing the informed consent. Part B: Males or Females between 18 and 55 years&#xD;
             of age inclusive, at the time of signing the consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of&#xD;
             the contraception methods listed in the protocol. This criterion must be followed from&#xD;
             the time of the first dose of study medication until 21 days after the final dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of&#xD;
             non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant),&#xD;
             including any female who: Has had a hysterectomy or Has had a bilateral oophorectomy&#xD;
             (removal of the ovaries) or Has had a bilateral tubal ligation or Is post-menopausal&#xD;
             (a demonstration of total cessation of menses for ≥ 1 year from the date of screening&#xD;
             visit). A follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level will be performed to confirm a&#xD;
             post-menopausal state. For this study FSH levels ≥ 40mIU/mL are consistent with&#xD;
             menopause. If a subject is on estrogen replacement and menopausal status is&#xD;
             questionable, estrogen replacement should be discontinued for 2 weeks and then the&#xD;
             subject rescreened, as estrogen replacement can suppress FSH.&#xD;
