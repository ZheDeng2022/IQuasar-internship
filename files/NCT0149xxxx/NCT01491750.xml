  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this mixed methods pilot study is to produce preliminary data for a&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled trial testing a biobehavioral model of the effects of guided&#xD;
      imagery on outcomes of total knee replacement surgery.&#xD;

      The study uses a mixed-method design (quantitative experimental pilot study with qualitative&#xD;
      descriptive and multiple case study methods) to address the study aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: Generate estimates of effect sizes and assess feasibility of procedures for a future&#xD;
      RCT testing a model of a standardized, prerecorded guided imagery intervention on functional&#xD;
      outcomes of TKR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: Elucidate the GI responder mechanism through analysis of the effect of imaging ability&#xD;
      and other potential moderators on guided imagery's effects on TKR outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 3: Analyze the effect of guided imagery on outcome expectancy, psychological distress,&#xD;
      rehabilitation commitment and neuroimmune activation as mediators on TKR functional outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 4: Identify patients' perspectives related to receiving, and participating in a study of,&#xD;
      guided imagery intervention for total knee replacement surgery (TKR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN The proposed study is a modified sequential explanatory mixed methods design&#xD;
      consisting of a Phase I RCT combined with a Phase II qualitative descriptive and case study.&#xD;
      Mixed-methods research is an ideal strategy for rigorous development of interventions such as&#xD;
      GI for further clinical testing. By systematically combining quantitative and qualitative&#xD;
      approaches, the method is uniquely able to produce information for evaluating an&#xD;
      intervention's context, its interactions with participant characteristics, and the link&#xD;
      between the intervention and the outcomes. A variety of mixed methods designs have been&#xD;
      developed, each with a different emphasis on (denoted as UPPER CASE LETTERS), and sequence of&#xD;
      (denoted as order of listing), qualitative (qual) and quantitative (quan) approaches. The&#xD;
      sequential explanatory design (QUAN/qual), which is primarily quantitatively oriented, uses&#xD;
      qualitative methods to further describe and explain within- and between-subject variation on&#xD;
      quantitative outcomes in experimental studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial quantitative (QUAN) data collection and analysis, criterion sampling will&#xD;
      be used to identify average and extreme cases on values of the quantitative outcome variables&#xD;
      in treatment groups. Qualitative (qual) data collection and analysis of these cases can&#xD;
      provide additional information about the application, operation, and outcome of the&#xD;
      intervention beyond statistical findings, and test the validity of conceptual links between&#xD;
      the intervention and outcome. Qualitative methods permit fuller exploration of subjective&#xD;
      processes as they evolve during a major health care experience and uncover the complex and&#xD;
      dynamic nature of these processes, and are particularly suited for gaining description and&#xD;
      insight regarding responses to alternative therapies. The sequential explanatory method is&#xD;
      thus well-suited for a study of the effects of a CAM intervention. The mixed method design&#xD;
      also helps to clarify participants' views of the actual nature of an intervention, including&#xD;
      the burden of treatment, and to reveal unanticipated situational constraints and enhancements&#xD;
      to its execution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS In accord with the sequential explanatory design, the project will involve three&#xD;
      phases: Phase I (QUAN): Quantitative data collection and analysis; Phase II (qual):&#xD;
      Qualitative inquiry to amplify the quantitative findings; and Phase III: Final integration of&#xD;
      findings to address the study aims and inform development of a subsequent RCT.&#xD;
