    <textblock>
      For centuries, light has been a well-known and effective healing method. In the beginning of&#xD;
      the 20th century there was a first attempt to condense light energy and distribute it in&#xD;
      higher levels, a use that was successfully applied on many soldiers wounded in the Second&#xD;
      World War. The laser, which is based on the quantum phenomenon of stimulated emission, was&#xD;
      first demonstrated in the beginning of the 1960s and immediately received many applications&#xD;
      in all areas of medicine.Many different studies were carried out in the past decade trying to&#xD;
      assess the effect of laser therapy on properties of healing wounds. This study aim to assess&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) in the treatment of non-healing&#xD;
      diabetic foot ulcers.&#xD;

    <description>All treatments will be carried out by trained study caregivers that will give standard treatment to all the participants under their care.&#xD;
Every treatment will consist of the following steps:&#xD;
A thorough rinse with an antiseptic soap (Septal scrub) with a stream of warm water.&#xD;
Drying of the foot with an absorbable disposable paper towel. Using clean latex gloves the caregiver will beam the ulcer with LLLT 808, B-cure laser machine in the following method.</description>

    <description>From the day of entering the study, ulcers will be treated twice daily regardless of the treatment that was used until then.&#xD;
All treatments will be carried out by trained study caregivers that will give standard treatment to all the participants under their care.&#xD;
Every treatment will consist of the following steps:&#xD;
A thorough rinse with an antiseptic soap (Septal scrub) with a stream of warm water.&#xD;
Drying of the foot with an absorbable disposable paper towel. Using clean latex gloves the caregiver will beam the ulcer with LLLT 808, B-cure laser machine in the following method.&#xD;
The part of the laser machine from which the laser beam is radiating - the beam guard, will be cleaned with a disposable swab of 70% alcohol. The cleaning will be performed while the machine is pointing downwards.</description>
