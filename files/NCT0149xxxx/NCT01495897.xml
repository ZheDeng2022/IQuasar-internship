      Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary, sustained, often repetitive&#xD;
      muscle contractions of opposite muscles that lead to abnormal twisting movements or odd&#xD;
      postures. Essential tremor is a slowly progressive neurologic disorder characterized by the&#xD;
      appearance of a tremor during the voluntary movement. The pathophysiology of dystonia or&#xD;
      essential tremor is not fully elucidated. Dystonia and essential tremor are associated with&#xD;
      dysfunction of the sensorimotor basal ganglia-cortical network and involvement of the&#xD;
      cerebellum and cerebellar pathways has also been recently suggested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to study 30 patients having a primary dystonia (15 DYT11&#xD;
      genetically documented), 15 patients having an essential tremor without deep brain&#xD;
      stimulation and 15 patients having an essential tremor with deep brain stimulation.A group of&#xD;
      30 healthy volunteers will be recruited and tested according to the same modalities. They&#xD;
      will be paired in sex and age. 30 patients having a Parkinson disease will be also tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eye position will be sampled with a video-based monocular eye tracker (SMI, Germany) before&#xD;
      and immediately after an adaptation task. Saccade adaptation is evaluated as the percentage&#xD;
      change in the mean saccade amplitude between pre-test and post-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  no or fewer alteration of the performance to the adaptation task in the Parkinson group&#xD;
           than in the Essential Tremor group/ dystonia group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  abnormal reactive saccade backward adaptation in the Dystonia group and Essential Tremor&#xD;
           group, providing further neurophysiological evidence of cerebellar dysfunction.&#xD;

      Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary, sustained, often repetitive&#xD;
      muscle contractions of opposite muscles that lead to abnormal twisting movements or odd&#xD;
      postures. Essential tremor is a slowly progressive neurologic disorder characterized by the&#xD;
      appearance of a tremor during the voluntary movement. High frequency stimulation of the&#xD;
      ventral intermedius nucleus (Vim) of the thalamus, relay for the cerebellar output, is&#xD;
      successfully used for the treatment of severe essential tremor. It occasionally induces&#xD;
      adverse event such as balance disorders or cerebellar symptoms. The pathophysiology of&#xD;
      dystonia or essential tremor is not fully elucidated. Dystonia and essential tremor are&#xD;
      associated with dysfunction of the sensorimotor basal ganglia-cortical network and&#xD;
      involvement of the cerebellum and cerebellar pathways has also been recently suggested. It&#xD;
      seems that dystonia and essential tremor could be the result of basal ganglia or cerebellar&#xD;
      dysfunction, or from dysfunction of structures controlled at the same time by the cerebellum&#xD;
      and the basal ganglia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      methodology: We propose to study 30 patients having a primary dystonia (15 DYT11 genetically&#xD;
      documented), 15 patients having an essential tremor without deep brain stimulation and 15&#xD;
      patients having an essential tremor with deep brain stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of 30 healthy volunteers will be recruited and tested according to the same&#xD;
      modalities. They will be paired in sex and age. 30 patients having a Parkinson disease will&#xD;
      be also tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be seated in darkness facing a screen located 60 cm before their eyes,&#xD;
      their chin on a chin strap and their forehead placed against a frontal support. Eye position&#xD;
      is sampled at 500 Hz with a video-based monocular eye tracker (SMI, Germany). Each recording&#xD;
      session start with a calibration test in which the subjects looked at nine consecutive&#xD;
      targets covering the entire visual field, as used during the oculomotor paradigms: four&#xD;
      experimental conditions: a visually guided saccade task, a pre-test, a backward adaptation&#xD;
      task, and a post-test. The pre-test and post-test (40 trials each) are performed before and&#xD;
      immediately after the backward adaptation task, in the same conditions, except that the&#xD;
      target was extinguished when the velocity threshold (150°/s for 10 ms) is reached, instead of&#xD;
      jumping to a new location. This avoided any post-saccadic visual feedback that would&#xD;
      counteract the adaptive mechanism. Saccade adaptation is evaluated as the percentage change&#xD;
      in the mean saccade amplitude between the pre-test and post-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  no or fewer alteration of the performance to the adaptation task in the Parkinson group&#xD;
           than in the Essential Tremor group/ dystonia group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  abnormal reactive saccade backward adaptation in the Dystonia group and Essential Tremor&#xD;
           group, providing further neurophysiological evidence of cerebellar dysfunction.&#xD;
