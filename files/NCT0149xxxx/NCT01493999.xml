      MAIN AIM: To compare the pharmacological potency of administering adjusted 600 mg clopidogrel&#xD;
      loading doses and 60 mg prasugrel in patients with high on-clopidogrel platelet reactivity&#xD;
      (HPR) after PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: To define the optimal maintenance dose with both prasugrel (5 mg vs. 10&#xD;
      mg) and clopidogrel (75 mg vs. 150 mg) in patients with HPR for chronic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: Prospective, Randomized, Open-label, Single-center trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY ENDPOINT: Platelet reactivity measured with Multiplate between clopidogrel and&#xD;
      prasugrel arm at day 4.&#xD;

      Study rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After coronary stent implantation, aspirin plus thienopyridine therapy has been proven to be&#xD;
      superior to aspirin alone or aspirin plus warfarin in reducing adverse thrombotic events. Due&#xD;
      to the lower rate of haematopoietic side effects, once daily administration and faster onset&#xD;
      of action, clopidogrel has replaced ticlopidine as the thienopyridine of choice in patients&#xD;
      after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However,&#xD;
      clopidogrel has many known limitations that might carry important clinical consequences.&#xD;
      First, the onset of action of clopidogrel is relatively slow; even a loading dose of 600 mg&#xD;
      requires 4-6 hours to achieve the full antiplatelet effect. Second, the antiplatelet potency&#xD;
      of clopidogrel is moderate, and platelet reactivity after clopidogrel treatment shows wide&#xD;
      inter-patient variability. As a result, a substantial proportion (25-30%) of patients is not&#xD;
      receiving proper ADP-receptor inhibition after a fixed-dose clopidogrel regimen and high&#xD;
      on-clopidogrel platelet reactivity (HPR) might persist despite clopidogrel administration. In&#xD;
      a meta-analysis comprising 20 studies and more than 9,100 patients, those with HPR had a&#xD;
      3.4-fold risk for cardiovascular death, 3-fold risk for myocardial infarction (MI), and&#xD;
      4-fold risk for definite/probable stent thrombosis. According to our current knowledge, the&#xD;
      development of HPR is multifactorial: clinical conditions (diabetes, acute coronary syndrome,&#xD;
      renal insufficiency, low ejection fraction), laboratory parameters (platelet count, baseline&#xD;
      platelet reactivity), patient compliance and genetic predisposition might contribute to the&#xD;
      evolution of HPR. (13) Out of these factors, the clinical importance of genetic interaction&#xD;
      in clopidogrel-treated subjects was recently emphasized by multiple studies and by a&#xD;
      black-boxed warning of the FDA. (14) Based on these, not all clopidogrel-treated patients get&#xD;
      the full clinical benefit from clopidogrel therapy and those carrying a loss-of-function&#xD;
      allele (LOF: *2 and *3) in the CYP2C19 gene have higher risk to adverse thrombotic events.&#xD;
      All these evidences highlight that the currently recommended, fixed-dose clopidogrel&#xD;
      treatment is insufficient to prevent the development of HPR and thrombotic events in a&#xD;
      significant proportion of patients after PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to now, there is limited information on the optimal strategy to overcome HPR. Increasing&#xD;
      the maintenance dose of clopidogrel to 150 mg might decrease to rate of HPR; however, it&#xD;
      might help in less than 50% of the patients. In one study, the administration of repeated&#xD;
      loading doses of 600 mg clopidogrel - based on the results of the vasodilator stimulated&#xD;
      phosphoprotein phosphorylation (VASP) assessment - was successful to overcome HPR in 86% of&#xD;
      the patients. Importantly, this was the first and only strategy with clopidogrel that was&#xD;
      associated with an improvement in the clinical outcome among patients with non-ST segment&#xD;
      elevation MI, as the reloaded group had significantly lower rate of major adverse cardiac&#xD;
      events compared to conventional fixed dose clopidogrel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beyond clopidogrel, there are newer antiplatelet agents that might also be attractive&#xD;
      candidates to overcome HPR. Prasugrel is a novel, third-generation thienopyridine that can&#xD;
      eliminate many drawbacks of clopidogrel. Compared to clopidogrel, prasugrel leads to a more&#xD;
      rapid and greater formation of its active metabolite after absorption as it is not&#xD;
      inactivated by the non-specific estherases in the portal circulation. These features result&#xD;
      in a more rapid, more uniform and more potent platelet inhibition both after the loading dose&#xD;
      and during the maintenance phase with prasugrel compared to even a high-dose of clopidogrel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is no direct comparison in platelet inhibition between a strategy of&#xD;
      administering repeated loading doses of clopidogrel and prasugrel in patients with HPR.&#xD;
      Moreover, the optimal maintenance doses of clopidogrel and prasugrel to maintain proper&#xD;
      platelet inhibition during the chronic phase of antiplatelet therapy is also unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereby, we aim to compare the achievable platelet inhibition after 60 mg prasugrel with&#xD;
      adjusted loading doses of 600 mg clopidogrel tailored according to a platelet function&#xD;
      assessment in patients after PCI. Moreover, we aim to compare the antiplatelet potency of&#xD;
      different clopidogrel (75 vs. 150 mg) and prasugrel (5 mg vs. 10 mg) maintenance doses during&#xD;
      the chronic phase of PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous work:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research team in the University of PÃ©cs, Hungary has been involved in platelet function&#xD;
      experiments since more than five years. We described the large inter-individual variability&#xD;
      in response to clopidogrel and demonstrated that high on-treatment ADP reactivity is&#xD;
      associated with recurrent ischemic events after PCI. We performed a meta-analysis to&#xD;
      summarize the clinical significance of high platelet reactivity and described that these&#xD;
      patients have 3-fold risk to MI, 4-fold risk to stent thrombosis and 3,4-fold risk for CV&#xD;
      death. We also tried to determine the efficacy of 150 mg clopidogrel among patients with high&#xD;
      platelet reactivity, together with the clinical and laboratory predictors of good response to&#xD;
      the higher maintenance dose. We compared more sophisticated methods of platelet aggregation&#xD;
      to light transmission aggregometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesise that prasugrel will provide more rapid and more potent platelet aggregation&#xD;
      inhibition compared to repeated loading doses of clopidogrel in patients with HPR after PCI.&#xD;
      We also test the efficacy of 5 mg and 10 mg prasugrel as well as 75 and 150 mg clopidogrel in&#xD;
      sustaining platelet inhibition in the maintenance phase.&#xD;
