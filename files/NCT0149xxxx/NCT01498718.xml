  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, randomized study in healthy younger (18-50 years) and older (51-70 years)&#xD;
      adults to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a prime-boost vaccination&#xD;
      regimen with an investigational plasmid DNA vaccine directed towards the 2011/12 influenza&#xD;
      vaccine strains as a prime followed 36 weeks later by the 2012/13 influenza trivalent&#xD;
      inactivated vaccine (TIV) as the booster injection, as compared to placebo prime followed by&#xD;
      the 2012/13 seasonal TIV. The hypothesis is that the DNA vaccine will be safe for human&#xD;
      administration and that the DNA vaccine prime-TIV boost schedule will elicit a better immune&#xD;
      response than the seasonal TIV alone.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vaccines are an effective way of preventing influenza infection and transmission in humans.&#xD;
      Although licensed influenza vaccines are available, ways to improve influenza vaccines&#xD;
      continue to be studied. Annually, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S FDA make&#xD;
      recommendations on the composition of the seasonal influenza vaccine, with recommendations&#xD;
      for the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and for the Southern Hemisphere (SH) considered at different&#xD;
      times based on epidemiology data. The annually licensed influenza vaccines consist of 3&#xD;
      components: an Influenza A (H1N1) strain, an Influenza A (H3N2) strain, and an influenza B&#xD;
      strain. The current U.S. FDA-licensed influenza vaccines depend upon labor-intensive methods&#xD;
      that limit manufacturing capacity and which do not induce broad immune responses to various&#xD;
      strains of influenza. The vaccine composition requires frequent adjustment for emerging&#xD;
      influenza strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for influenza vaccines that are more immunogenic and able to induce a more universal&#xD;
      immune response against a broad spectrum of influenza strains is well recognized. Earlier&#xD;
      laboratory and clinical studies together suggest that an investigational DNA vaccine encoding&#xD;
      for the influenza hemagglutinin protein(HA DNA vaccine) administered as a prime, followed by&#xD;
      a boost with a traditional inactivated influenza vaccine, may induce a stronger immune&#xD;
      response against various influenza strains and with improved durability. The interval of time&#xD;
      between the prime vaccination and the boost vaccination is important for the strength of the&#xD;
      immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability and immune responses to the&#xD;
      investigational HA DNA vaccine prime-TIV boost schedule compared to a placebo prime-TIV boost&#xD;
      schedule when the time between the prime and boost is 36 weeks.&#xD;
