  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diets rich in fruit and vegetables reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks, however the&#xD;
      exact cause of this beneficial effect is uncertain. Evidence suggests that certain&#xD;
      vegetables, including beetroot and the green leafy vegetables, possess high inorganic nitrate&#xD;
      concentrations. The investigators recent evidence suggests that inorganic nitrate provides a&#xD;
      source of gas called nitric oxide in the body that exerts a number of beneficial effects upon&#xD;
      the heart and blood vessels . The investigators have previously shown that beetroot juice&#xD;
      ingestion improves blood vessel (vascular endothelial) and platelet function in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. Studies by the investigators show that these effects are due to conversion of&#xD;
      nitrate to nitrite by symbiotic (helpful) bacteria (located on the tongue) and subsequent&#xD;
      conversion of nitrite to nitric oxide in blood vessels. The investigators now wish to explore&#xD;
      whether dietary nitrate, via its beneficial effects on platelets and blood vessels, might&#xD;
      improve indices of atherosclerotic disease progression in high risk individuals&#xD;
      (hypercholesterolemics). Recruits will have high cholesterol and no known atherosclerosis and&#xD;
      will not yet be on any anti-cholesterol medications. Volunteers will consume a daily dose of&#xD;
      beetroot juice or placebo nitrate-free juice for six weeks. Vascular function will be&#xD;
      assessed using non-invasive techniques at the beginning and at the end of the study using&#xD;
      ultrasound measurement of flow mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery in the arm&#xD;
      and pulse wave analysis (PWA) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) to measure arterial compliance.&#xD;
      To assess impact on platelet function, blood samples will also be taken at the start and at&#xD;
      the end of the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants will be between 18-80 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. They will be largely newly diagnosed patients with hypercholesterolemia (total serum&#xD;
             cholesterol&gt;6.0mmol/L or any elevation of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol or&#xD;
             triglycerides with a QRISK 2 score &gt;15%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. We will include patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. These patients in general&#xD;
             will either be managed in primary care alone or will attend the clinic following&#xD;
             referral from general practitioners for further investigation following routine health&#xD;
             tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. In addition, patients who have been referred due to inability to tolerate statin&#xD;
             treatment will be included.&#xD;
