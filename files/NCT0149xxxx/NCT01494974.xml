      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drainage implants have become an important alternative in the treatment of pediatric&#xD;
      glaucoma refractory to angular and filtration surgery or medical therapy (1). Such implants&#xD;
      drain the aqueous humor from the anterior chamber of the eye to a plate positioned above the&#xD;
      sclera, between the rectus muscles. The aqueous humor goes through the pseudocyst that forms&#xD;
      around the plate by passive diffusion and is drained by the venous capillaries and lymphatic&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ahmed drainage implant (New World Medical, Inc., Rancho Cucamonga, CA, USA) is a device&#xD;
      with flow restrictors, which decreases the incidence of postoperative complications such as&#xD;
      hypotony (2-3). It is made of silicone and comes in two sizes. The FP7 model has a surface of&#xD;
      184 mm2, 13mm wide and 16mm long. The FP8 model presents 96mm2 surface, 9.6 mm wide and 10mm&#xD;
      long.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in animals and adult humans suggest that the surface area of the implant plate is&#xD;
      directly related to the amount of aqueous fluid drained through the same (4-7). In contrast,&#xD;
      a very large implant can result in the extrusion of the same, uncontrolled intraocular&#xD;
      pressure, corneal injury by endothelial touch, patient discomfort and ocular motility&#xD;
      problems. The use of pediatric size implants in small eyes can avoid such complications. A&#xD;
      high rate (34.8%) of anterior plate of the tubes in children under 2 years of age has been&#xD;
      reported (8-9). On the other hand, the use of pediatric implante may affect the control of&#xD;
      intraocular pressure (IOP) due to reduced drainage area (10), especially in eyes with&#xD;
      increasing axial diameter, a result of increased eye pressure that happens in children with&#xD;
      glaucoma. However, there is no study in the literature comparing different sizes of drainage&#xD;
      implants in pediatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study to compare the success rates and complications between FP7 and FP8 models is&#xD;
      essential in order to standardize a conduct in choosing the type of implant. Currently, the&#xD;
      choice of the drainage implant model to be used in every child lies on the free choice and&#xD;
      personal preference of the surgeon. There is no standard procedure, based on scientific&#xD;
      evidence for this choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compare the success rates and complications of two models of Ahmed drainage implant (FP7 and&#xD;
      FP8) in patients with pediatric glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial is a prospective, randomized, masked to the evaluator to be held at the&#xD;
      Department of Ophthalmology, Federal University of Sao Paulo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will be included children between 0 and 10 years of age with glaucoma and surgical indication&#xD;
      for glaucoma drainage implant. Surgical indication for implantation of Ahmed drainage occurs&#xD;
      in some situations: 1) children with primary congenital glaucoma that undergone angular&#xD;
      surgery (goniotomy and / or trabeculotomy) who did not respond satisfactorily to surgery, 2)&#xD;
      children with glaucoma secondary to aphakia who have the primary indication for implantation&#xD;
      of Ahmed drainage, 3) children with glaucoma secondary to other eye disorders where medical&#xD;
      treatment is not satisfactory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A term of consent will be obtained from parents or legal guardians of the child, in which all&#xD;
      the risks inherent to the surgical procedure will be clarified. Such risks are proper to&#xD;
      antiglaucomatous surgery are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Early: hypotony, hyphema, tube endothelial touch, choroidal detachment, leakage of&#xD;
           aqueous, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, loss of light perception&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. late: uncontrolled intraocular pressure, persistent hypotony, scleral patch resorption,&#xD;
           extrusion of the tube, retinal detachment, loss of light perception (11-18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering that the selected patient has already the surgical indication for Ahmed drainage&#xD;
      implant, the inclusion of this child in the study does not bring additional risks or&#xD;
      discomforts to the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The model of the drainage implant will be chosen through allocation from a computer-generated&#xD;
      random table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children enrolled in the study will be divided into two groups (one group will receive the&#xD;
      model FP7 and another group will receive the model FP8) with the number of 20 participants in&#xD;
      each group, totaling 40 children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgeries will be performed by experienced surgeons from Glaucoma Sector from Department&#xD;
      of Ophthalmology, Federal University of Sao Paulo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plate of the Ahmed drainage implant will be placed in one of the quadrants selected from&#xD;
      the extraocular muscles between 8 and 10 mm away from the corneal limbus. The tube will have&#xD;
      its distal portion inserted 2-3mm into the anterior chamber of the eye in the iris plane. The&#xD;
      exposed portion of the tube is covered with donor sclera.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children included in the study will be examined before surgery, which will be measured&#xD;
      your visual acuity, biomicroscopy, IOP, Retinography and axial length of the eye. Immediately&#xD;
      after surgery, with a compass we will measure the distance between the plate of drainage&#xD;
      implant and corneal limbus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be examined again after 6 months and 1 year of surgery. We will perform the&#xD;
      measurement of visual acuity, biomicroscopy, IOP, Retinography, axial length and measurement&#xD;
      of the distance from the plate of the implant and corneal limbus. Post-operative examinations&#xD;
      will be performed under narcosis, in hospitals (when it is impossible to take measures in an&#xD;
      outpatient setting due to lack of cooperation of the child), by a doctor from congenital&#xD;
      glaucoma sector who were not involved in the surgical procedure. The examination under&#xD;
      narcosis involves risk to the child, which include cough, nausea, vomiting, laryngospasm,&#xD;
      bronchospasm, apnea, bradycardia, tachycardia, hypertension, anxiety (19-21).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two types of outcome will be considered in this study. The primary endpoint is to evaluate&#xD;
      the position of the drainage implant plate and if the plate is positioned at a distance ≥ 8&#xD;
      mm from the corneal limbus after 1 year of surgery, considered successful. If the dish drain&#xD;
      implant is positioned at a distance &lt;8 mm from the corneal limbus, we have a failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a secondary outcome, we evaluate the variation in IOP preoperative and postoperative. We&#xD;
      will use as a criterion of success an IOP ≤ 21 mm Hg and&gt; 5 mmHg and a 30% reduction of&#xD;
      preoperative IOP. If the patient meets these criteria, without the use of eyedrop, classified&#xD;
      as complete success. If the use of eyedrop is necessary to meet the criteria, a qualified&#xD;
      success will be defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For failure criterion is assumed: IOP ≤ 5 mmHg or &gt; 21 mm Hg, even with the use of eye drops,&#xD;
      need for further surgery, and / or loss of light perception.&#xD;
