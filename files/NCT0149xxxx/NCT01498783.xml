  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study to investigate the safety and pharmacokinetics of weekly&#xD;
      5-fluorouracil (5-FU) administered as a bolus dose in children and young adults with&#xD;
      recurrent or refractory ependymoma. The results from this study will inform a subsequent&#xD;
      phase II St. Jude investigator-initiated trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The initial 5-FU dosage will be 500 mg/m^2 administered on day 1 of course 1. We plan to&#xD;
      treat a maximum of 3 cohorts of research participants (dosage levels - 0, 1, and 2) with&#xD;
      escalating doses of 5-FU. A cycle is defined as 42 days. The first 6 weeks of therapy will&#xD;
      constitute the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the safety and pharmacokinetics (plasma and cerebrospinal fluid) of&#xD;
           weekly bolus dose 5-FU in children and young adults with recurrent/refractory ependymoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the safety of 500 mg/m^2 weekly bolus dose 5-FU in less-heavily pre-treated&#xD;
           children and young adults with recurrent/refractory ependymoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document and describe toxicities associated with 5-FU administered on a weekly bolus&#xD;
           schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document preliminary antitumor activity in participants with recurrent or refractory&#xD;
           ependymoma treated with 5-FU&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the feasibility of measuring expression level of Thymidylate Synthetase (TYMS)&#xD;
           in formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor samples using the Quantigene assay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the association between specific genetic polymorphisms (e.g., DPYD) and the&#xD;
           pharmacokinetics of 5-FU&#xD;

             that would compromise the participant's ability to tolerate therapy, impair the&#xD;
             evaluation of side effects related to this treatment, or alter drug metabolism&#xD;

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test&#xD;
