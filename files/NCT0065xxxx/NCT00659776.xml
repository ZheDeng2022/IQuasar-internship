  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to address safety and efficiency of a new iron particle contrast&#xD;
      agent, ferumoxytol. This product may be more useful in viewing the vessels of the brain and&#xD;
      areas in the brain on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or magnetic resonance angiography&#xD;
      (MRA), than the standard substance, gadolinium, injected during MRI and MRA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other ways in which ferumoxytol may help include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ferumoxytol may provide the ability to better see inflammatory lesions on magnetic&#xD;
           resonance imaging (MRI) scans&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ferumoxytol may be useful in its ability to cross blood vessels into inflammatory&#xD;
           processes, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ferumoxytol, because of its size and ability to get into the area next to your&#xD;
           inflammatory lesion and could assist in the treatment of inflammatory lesions&#xD;
           association with cardiac surgery or CNS vascular surgery.&#xD;

      Subjects are recruited as patients in one of the neurology, neurosurgery, neuro-oncology,&#xD;
      Multiple Sclerosis Clinic or cardiothoracic surgery clinics at OHSU. Eligible subjects will&#xD;
      be enrolled in different groups based on their disease (MS, cardiac surgery or CNS vascular&#xD;
      surgery, stroke). Subsequently a MRI and MRA of the brain using the standard contrast agent&#xD;
      (Gadolinium) will be obtained; this study will be compared with the ferumoxytol-contrasted&#xD;
      MRA and MRIs performed the next day(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: the subjects are enrolled and distributed in their corresponding group; also basic&#xD;
      laboratory studies are obtained as well as a Gadolinium contrasted MRI and MRA of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Groups 1 and 2 (MS and Stroke):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Ferumoxytol will be injected as an i.v. bolus. The total dose over 2 hours will not&#xD;
      exceed 510mg, and can be divided into multiple smaller doses such as 1 mg Fe/kg to optimize&#xD;
      MRA imaging and may be diluted up to 4 fold in normal saline to reduce T2* effects in the MR&#xD;
      angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: 24 hours after the second visit an MRI with the standard contrast agent will be&#xD;
      done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Last visit: 1 month after Ferumoxytol administration, the subject will be reassessed with&#xD;
      physical and laboratory exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Groups 3 and 4 (Cardiac surgery or CNS vascular surgery):&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the screening visit (Visit 1) and baseline MRI and MRA you will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      one of two groups. These groups are very similar but there are slight differences in the&#xD;
      schedule of events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3a and 4a: ferumoxytol infusion (Visit 2) before surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3b and 4b: ferumoxytol infusion (Visit 2) after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Ferumoxytol will be injected as an i.v. bolus. The total dose over 2 hours will not&#xD;
      exceed 510mg, and can be divided into multiple smaller doses such as 1 mg Fe/kg to optimize&#xD;
      MRA imaging and may be diluted up to 4 fold in normal saline to reduce T2* effects in the MR&#xD;
      angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: 24-72 hours after the second visit an MRI with the standard contrast agent will be&#xD;
      done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Last visit: 1 month after Ferumoxytol administration, the subject will be reassessed with&#xD;
      physical and laboratory exams.&#xD;
