    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if consumption of whey protein, compared with soy&#xD;
      protein or a carbohydrate food decreases blood pressure along with reducing risk factors for&#xD;
      heart disease.&#xD;

      Several lines of evidence suggest that consumption of dairy foods, and specifically whey&#xD;
      protein, may reduce blood pressure. This proposed study is designed investigate the effect of&#xD;
      whey protein compared to another protein source.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since blood pressure is a recognized risk factor for cardiovascular disease, if there is&#xD;
      clear evidence that whey protein reduces blood pressure, dietary recommendations may be made&#xD;
      regarding whey protein intake. However, dietary recommendations to consume whey protein as a&#xD;
      means to improve health status must be science-based. Results from this study will provide a&#xD;
      scientific basis for dietary recommendations regarding whey protein intake.&#xD;
