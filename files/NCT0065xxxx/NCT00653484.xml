      RATIONALE: Calories and physical exercise may affect the risk of developing cancer. It is not&#xD;
      yet known whether a low-calorie diet and/or physical activity program is effective in&#xD;
      preventing cancer in participants at increased risk of developing colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying diet and physical activity in healthy&#xD;
      overweight, obese, or inactive participants at risk of developing colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare four 12-week energy-balance interventions comprising a physical activity&#xD;
           intervention (+2,000 kcal/wk), a dietary energy restriction intervention (DER)(-2,000&#xD;
           kcal/wk), or a combined physical activity and DER intervention (+1,000/-1,000 kcal/wk)&#xD;
           vs no intervention in healthy, overweight, or moderately obese participants at increased&#xD;
           risk for developing colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To quantify changes in circulating biomarkers (e.g., insulin, IGF-1, leptin, c-reactive&#xD;
           protein, or isoprostanes) proposed to mediate the anticarcinogenic effects of DER in&#xD;
           these participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This study consists of a 2-week run-in period (baseline) followed by a 12-week&#xD;
      intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo three study visits at Vanderbilt University General Clinical Research&#xD;
      Center (GCRC). Beginning at study visit 1, participants undergo a 2-week run-in period to&#xD;
      obtain baseline measures of body composition (via dual x-ray absorptiometry),&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness (via treadmill testing), physical activity, dietary intake, energy&#xD;
      expenditure, and metabolic activity. Dietary assessments using 24-hour dietary recalls are&#xD;
      conducted by the GCRC dietitian during the run-in period. GCRC dietitians complete three&#xD;
      24-hour recalls on randomly selected days during the 2-week assessment period to provide an&#xD;
      estimate of the participant's habitual food intake at baseline. Baseline energy needs are&#xD;
      assessed during activity monitored run-in period to obtain measures of the participant's&#xD;
      resting energy expenditure and total daily energy expenditure. Participants are also assessed&#xD;
      using a brief psychological profile that is used to individualize the study intervention for&#xD;
      each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 10-14 days after the initial visit and after all baseline assessments have been&#xD;
      completed, participants undergo a second study visit. Participants are randomized to 1 of 4&#xD;
      intervention arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (physical activity): Participants undergo an in-person, 30- to 60-minute&#xD;
           counseling visit, followed by five brief 10- to 15-minute telephone-counseling calls&#xD;
           over 12 weeks. During the initial counseling session, participants learn about goal&#xD;
           setting and how to develop a personalized plan for meeting their intervention goals.&#xD;
           Participants are instructed about wearing proper shoes and about monitoring their&#xD;
           exercise duration and intensity. Participants are also given pedometers to help track&#xD;
           their activity patterns and to monitor their progress in meeting program objectives.&#xD;
           Participants must wear the pedometers for 7 days at baseline and again at 12 weeks. The&#xD;
           information provided is used to estimate overall physical activity energy expenditure&#xD;
           (PAEE), steps per day, and time spent in different levels of activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are monitored periodically for adherence to the exercise program through&#xD;
      behavioral counseling and self-reported logs of daily exercise and pedometer steps. Dietary&#xD;
      intake is measured periodically using multiple 24-hour dietary recalls to carefully assess&#xD;
      possible changes in energy intake and dietary quality over the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II (dietary energy restriction [DER]): Based on the initial estimate of energy needs&#xD;
           determined during the run-in period, participants receive a reduced-calorie, food&#xD;
           exchange-based diet for 12 weeks. Each diet is individualized to achieve the desired&#xD;
           daily energy deficit of 300 calories per day based on physical activity levels. All&#xD;
           meals are prepared by the GCRC metabolic kitchen. Participants receive one multivitamin&#xD;
           per day and no other nutritional supplements. Fluids including coffee, water, and other&#xD;
           drinks are allowed at the pre-study level. Each week, participants meet with the&#xD;
           dietitian to discuss the participant's progress, submit daily reports of food intake,&#xD;
           return uneaten food items, and to provide urine samples for assessment of urinary&#xD;
           biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence to the diet is monitored by compliance with food pick-up, dietary records, and&#xD;
      measures of urinary metabolites. Participants are also provided with individual instruction,&#xD;
      counseling, and assessment by the study dietitian.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm III (physical activity and DER): Participants undergo a 12-week DER and&#xD;
           physical-activity program, as described in arms I and II, with the exception that the&#xD;
           dose of PAEE and DER in the combined intervention (i.e., +1,000/-1,000 kcal/week) is&#xD;
           half that of each individual intervention (+2,000 kcal/week for arm I and -2,000&#xD;
           kcal/week for arm II). Participants in arm III receive an individualized reduced-calorie&#xD;
           diet designed to achieve a desired daily energy deficit of 150 calories per day based on&#xD;
           participant physical activity levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm IV (wait-list control): Participants are followed periodically. At study visit 3,&#xD;
           after completion of the 12-week study interventions, participants undergo repeat&#xD;
           assessment of body composition, fitness, diet, and activity measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo blood and urine sample collection at baseline and at 12 weeks for&#xD;
      correlative laboratory studies. Blood samples are assessed for circulating biomarkers that&#xD;
      are involved in energy homeostasis and metabolic control (e.g., insulin, IGF, and leptin) and&#xD;
      inflammation and oxidative stress (e.g., c-reactive protein, PGE-2, and isoprostanes). Urine&#xD;
      samples are examined for biomarkers of dietary protein intake (i.e., nitrogen content),&#xD;
      dietary sodium, and potassium intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants complete the Community Health Activities Model Program for Seniors Physical&#xD;
      Activity Questionnaire at baseline and at 12 weeks for assessment of PAEE through&#xD;
      non-occupational activities, including social activities, recreation, hobbies, housework,&#xD;
      walking, jogging, and 14 other types of exercise.&#xD;
