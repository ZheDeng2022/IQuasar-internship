  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will allow National Eye Institute (NEI) doctors the opportunity to examine people&#xD;
      with eye disease, whether the diagnosis is known or not, to determine if they are eligible&#xD;
      for other NEI research studies. No treatment is offered in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People of all ages with various eye conditions, including genetic conditions, eye movement&#xD;
      disorders, inflammatory eye diseases, retinal diseases and external eye diseases, may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo various tests and procedures to diagnose or evaluate their eye disease.&#xD;
      The procedures may include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personal and family medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination and blood tests, including genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye examination with dilation to measure visual acuity and eye pressure and to examine&#xD;
           the front and back parts of the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire about vision and daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conjunctival swab or lacrimal bland biopsy, or both: A sample of cells from the eyes is&#xD;
           collected by swabbing the surface of the eye or by surgically removing a small sample of&#xD;
           the surface of the eye or tear gland.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electroretinogram to examine retinal function: The subject sits in the dark with his or&#xD;
           her eyes patched for 30 minutes. The patches are removed, the surface of the eyes is&#xD;
           numbed, and contact lenses that can sense signals from the retina are placed on the&#xD;
           eyes. The subject then watches flashing lights.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluorescein angiography to examine the blood vessels in the eye: A dye is injected into&#xD;
           a vein in the arm. The dye travels through the veins to the blood vessels in the eyes. A&#xD;
           camera takes pictures of the dye as it flows through the blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optical coherence tomography to measure retinal thickness: A machine used to examine the&#xD;
           eyes produces cross-sectional pictures of the retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Microperimetry to test how sensitive different parts of the retina are to changing&#xD;
           levels of light. The subject sits in front of a computer and presses a button when he or&#xD;
           she sees a light on the screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oculography to record eye movements: Eye movements are measured by contact lenses or&#xD;
           goggles that the subject wears while watching a series of spots on a computer screen.&#xD;

      This protocol is designed for the screening of potential research participants with or&#xD;
      without a defined diagnosis. This protocol will serve as a point of entry for individuals who&#xD;
      may be eligible and wish to participate in the National Eye Institute (NEI) clinical research&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are referred or self-referred will be screened and evaluated during the&#xD;
      screening process to determine whether they are suitable participants for any of the ongoing&#xD;
      NEI research studies. The screening process may include past and current medical history, a&#xD;
      physical examination, diagnostic procedures, and required testing used to establish a patient&#xD;
      s diagnosis and determine his/her potential eligibility for research participation. Once the&#xD;
      screening process is complete, patients will be informed of their options to participate in&#xD;
      one or more of the NEI's current clinical research protocols or natural history studies. If&#xD;
      no appropriate research protocol is available for their participation, the patient may&#xD;
      receive potential treatment recommendations, which will be shared with the patient s primary&#xD;
      provider and referring physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol's secondary aim is to collect and store human biospecimens and health&#xD;
      information for basic science laboratory research and to generate and test hypotheses.&#xD;
      Through such studies, research investigators hope to find possible new ways to detect, treat,&#xD;
      and even prevent or cure ophthalmological diseases. Genetic and genomic testing, and&#xD;
      biospecimen samples such as blood, body fluid (e.g., urine), and tissue (e.g., skin) may be&#xD;
      collected from affected or unaffected adult participants. Biospecimen samples can be obtained&#xD;
      at the time of screening or any time after screening. These samples, combined with other&#xD;
      clinical data, may be used for basic science laboratory research or stored and used in future&#xD;
      research studies. Biospecimen sample collection is voluntary for all participants.&#xD;
