      The purpose of this study is to determine if fluvoxamine or sertraline reduce the fequency or&#xD;
      severity of aggressive behaviour, obsessive symptoms, or anxiety in young children with&#xD;
      autism. The within-patient variability in this patient population using standard&#xD;
      neuropsychological instruments will also be determined and a predictor model for SSRI&#xD;
      responsitivity based on baseline neuropsychological testing will be developed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism is a neuropsychiatric disorder diagnosed in early childhood. Approximately 10 Canadian&#xD;
      children per 10 000 live births suffer from the disorder, which is three to four times more&#xD;
      common in males than in females. It is characterized by social and and communicative deficits&#xD;
      and restricted, repetitive interests and behaviours. Most autistic children are delayed in&#xD;
      the acquisition of both verbal and non-verbal communication skills and many never develop&#xD;
      useful language. Three-quarters of autistic children have mild to severe mental retardation&#xD;
      and a quarter develop seizures during later childhood or adolescence. Its etiology is&#xD;
      heterogenous and there is no cure. Although behaviour therapy is an important tool in&#xD;
      management, pharmacotherapy remains a necessity for many children. Current therapy is limited&#xD;
      to antipsychotic drugs that can carry an unacceptable risk of chronic neurotoxicity (tardive&#xD;
      dyskinesia) or tricyclic antidepressants that have undesireble cardiovascular effects. This&#xD;
      study proposes to evaluate the potential benefit of selective seratonin reuptake inhibitors&#xD;
      (SSRIs) in autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All autistic children whose symptoms are not currently well controlled will be offered entry&#xD;
      into the trial. Each child will randomized to eight weeks of fluvooxamine, sertraline, or&#xD;
      placebo. If they do not improve on their initial dose, they may have a dose increase and&#xD;
      continue in the study for a further eight weeks. Due to the significant amount of within- and&#xD;
      between- patient variability, multiple baseline evaluations will be completed prior to the&#xD;
      initiation of drug therapy. Parents may choose to continue therapy that was effective for&#xD;
      their child; if their child was randomized to placebo, parents may choose to try an SSRI for&#xD;
      a period of 8 weeks to assess effectiveness.&#xD;
