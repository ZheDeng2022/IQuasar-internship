      We hypothesize that hand-assisted laparoscopy will overcome technical difficulties related to&#xD;
      pure laparoscopic rectal surgery and allow surgeons to expand application of laparoscopic&#xD;
      techniques to treating patients with rectal cancer. In this study, we plan to randomly assign&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with rectal cancer to undergo either &quot;standard&quot; laparoscopic surgery or&#xD;
      hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery. We will then compare both peri-operative and long-term&#xD;
      outcomes of patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Compared to traditional open surgery, laparoscopic surgery for colon cancer results in&#xD;
      short-term benefits such as less pain, shorter length of stay, and faster return of bowel&#xD;
      function while maintaining equivalent oncologic outcomes. For this reason, increasing numbers&#xD;
      of colon cancer patients are undergoing laparoscopic surgery.1-3 Similarly, there are many&#xD;
      potential benefits to performing rectal surgery laparoscopically. Although not well&#xD;
      documented, laparoscopic rectal surgery is under active study and may result in the usual&#xD;
      short-term benefits associated with laparoscopic surgery. In addition, compared to open&#xD;
      surgery, laparoscopy can provide unprecedented, unobstructed views of the rectal dissection&#xD;
      planes even in a patient with narrow pelvis, not only for the surgeon but to the entire&#xD;
      surgical team. Magnified views of the surgical planes allow precise and sharp dissection. The&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum can also help open the planes for mobilization of the mesorectum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these potential advantages, adoption of laparoscopic rectal surgery has been limited&#xD;
      for many reasons. Although there are now several prospective randomized trials demonstrating&#xD;
      safety and benefits associated with laparoscopic colon cancer surgery, the same benefits have&#xD;
      not yet been clearly demonstrated for laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery.1-3 In addition,&#xD;
      concerns about inadequate oncologic rectal dissection, anastomotic complications, and&#xD;
      technical challenges have limited wide adaptation of laparoscopic rectal surgery.4,5 In&#xD;
      efforts to retain the benefits of laparoscopic surgery while not compromising oncologic&#xD;
      rectal dissection, others have advocated performing hybrid procedures in which colonic&#xD;
      portion of the surgery is performed using the &quot;pure&quot; laparoscopic technique and rectal&#xD;
      dissection is performed open through a limited low midline or Pfannestiel (low transverse)&#xD;
      incision.6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery is a technique in which the surgeon places a hand into the&#xD;
      abdomen through an airtight access device while performing laparoscopic surgery. By placing a&#xD;
      hand into the abdomen during laparoscopy, surgeons retain their abilities to manually&#xD;
      retract, expose, and manually dissect, which are lost in pure laparoscopic surgery. Retention&#xD;
      of these abilities can significantly expedite the operation. In fact, several studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that hand-assisted laparoscopic colon surgery results in significantly shorter&#xD;
      operative time and less conversion to open surgery while maintain similar short-term outcomes&#xD;
      compared to &quot;pure&quot; laparoscopic technique.7-9 In rectal surgery for cancer, sigmoid colon,&#xD;
      left colon, and splenic flexure need to be mobilized in order to allow tension free&#xD;
      anastomosis between the colon and the residual rectum. In laparoscopic proctectomy, HALS&#xD;
      compared to SLS technique may therefore, result in shorter operative time based on colonic&#xD;
      portion of the operation alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the technical hurdles in performing laparoscopic rectal dissection is exposure and&#xD;
      retraction of the rectum. As one dissects down to the distal rectum, especially in patients&#xD;
      with narrow pelvis, crowding and clashing of instruments can result in poor exposure and&#xD;
      dissection. The only prospective randomized trial comparing results of open vs. laparoscopic&#xD;
      surgery to include rectal cancer is CLASICC trial.3 It reported an increased&#xD;
      circumferentially positive margin of cancer following laparoscopic rectal resection with&#xD;
      twice as many patients in the laparoscopic group (12 %) having an involved margin as in the&#xD;
      open group (6 %). This increased radial margin may be related to difficulty in retraction and&#xD;
      exposure. In HALS, rectal exposure and dissection can be either performed directly through&#xD;
      the incision using the open techniques or laparoscopically with manual assistance. This may&#xD;
      result in equivalent oncologic outcomes as the open surgery but with shorter operative time&#xD;
      compared to SLS technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A further challenge in laparoscopic rectal surgery is localization of the tumor, which is&#xD;
      less of an issue in colon cancer where the tumor is easily visible or tattooed&#xD;
      preoperatively. This is not possible for rectal cancer, which can pose a problem in both&#xD;
      dissection and safe division of the rectum. Without tactile sensation it can be difficult to&#xD;
      be sure that the stapler is below the tumor. Hand assisted laparoscopic surgery allows&#xD;
      preservation of tactile sensation and therefore circumvent the above problem. The next step&#xD;
      following mobilization of the rectum is division of the rectum and anastomosis. This poses a&#xD;
      challenge for the laparoscopic surgeon for several reasons. The current laparoscopic stapling&#xD;
      devices angulate to a maximum of 65 o making horizontal division of the rectum difficult.&#xD;
      Morin et al reported a leak rate of 17 % below 12 cm from the anal verge and as high as 25 %&#xD;
      in those who were not diverted following laparoscopic rectal surgery.4 Leroy et al reported a&#xD;
      similar leak rate of 20 % in cancers below 15 cm following laparoscopic rectal surgery.5&#xD;
      Comparatively higher leak rates after laparoscopic rectal surgery may be related to&#xD;
      limitations in currently available laparoscopic surgical staplers. By performing distal&#xD;
      rectal division through the incision by using the open surgical staplers, hand-assisted&#xD;
      laparoscopic rectal surgery may result in lower anastomotic leakage rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that hand-assisted laparoscopy may result in shorter operative time while&#xD;
      retaining the benefits associated with laparoscopic surgery. In this study, we plan to&#xD;
      randomly assign patients diagnosed with rectal cancer to undergo either &quot;standard&quot;&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery or hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery. We will then compare both&#xD;
      peri-operative and long-term outcomes of patients. If our hypothesis is true, hand assisted&#xD;
      laparoscopic approach to rectal surgery may be preferable to standard laparoscopic surgery.&#xD;
