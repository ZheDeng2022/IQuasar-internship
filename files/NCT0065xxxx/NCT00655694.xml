  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic disease characterized by&#xD;
      progressive airflow obstruction, chronic cough and dyspnoea in advanced stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope to develop a better understanding of lung disease. Information from these studies&#xD;
      will only be used for research purposes, to help develop safer and more effective treatments&#xD;
      for asthma and COPD.&#xD;

      Techniques such as genomics, proteomics and metabonomics, Technologies that aim to identify&#xD;
      and quantify the dynamic set of all small molecules and metabolites present in an organism or&#xD;
      a biological sample, offer the prospect of efficiently distinguishing individuals with&#xD;
      particular diseases. The advantages of proteomics and metabonomics is that it can be carried&#xD;
      out on a standard preparation of serum, plasma or urine, circumventing the need for&#xD;
      specialist preparation of cellular mRNA required for genomics This methodology is based on&#xD;
      mass spectrometry (MS), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and nuclear magnetic&#xD;
      resonance (NMR) to analyze metabolites. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) may&#xD;
      also be applied. Several peak alignment algorithms have been developed to match the&#xD;
      chromatograms before applying pattern recognition. Based on the pattern recognition, several&#xD;
      potential biomarkers may be found and further identified by MS.. Finally, a number of&#xD;
      potential biomarkers will be identified for distinguishing asthma and COPD.&#xD;
