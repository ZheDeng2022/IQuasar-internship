  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sirtuin activators may prove useful in treating age-related diseases and extending lifespan&#xD;
      in humans. Resveratrol (RSV), a polyphenol found in red wine, has been shown in vitro to&#xD;
      enhance SIRT1 activity. RSV is associated with some of the beneficial effects of red wine or&#xD;
      the &quot;French Paradox&quot;. Recently RSV has been associated with increasing lifespan in mice on a&#xD;
      high calorie diet and improved metabolic profile and activity levels. The effect of this&#xD;
      small molecule in humans is unknown. Preclinical observations suggest that RSV is safe and&#xD;
      has enormous potential in the treatment of obesity and insulin resistance in humans. This&#xD;
      pilot study will examine the effect of RSV on improving the metabolic profile of adults with&#xD;
      insulin resistance. Specifically, this randomized double blind placebo controlled study will&#xD;
      examine the effects of 4 weeks of supplementation with RSV 5.0 grams daily, compared to&#xD;
      placebo control (PC) on the metabolic profile of 36 men and women over the age of 50 with&#xD;
      insulin resistance (IR) consuming a typical western diet consisting of at least 40% calories&#xD;
      from fat.&#xD;

      Hypotheses for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 weeks of supplementation with RSV 5.0 grams daily compared to placebo control in&#xD;
      individuals with insulin resistance will: 1) Increase insulin sensitivity (assessed by the&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity index as derived from glucose and insulin levels obtained during a 2 hour&#xD;
      oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)and insulin growth factor (IGF)-1 levels) 2) Improve&#xD;
      cholesterol metabolism (lower LDL, raise HDL and lower triglyceride (TG) levels); and 3)&#xD;
      physical activity levels measured by pedometer and 7 day physical activity recall (PAR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypotheses are: Treatment with RSV 5.0 grams daily in individuals with IR will&#xD;
      result in: 1)No change in energy intake as measured by food intake by 3 day food diary; 2)No&#xD;
      change in body fat mass or distribution (via dual x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio; and 3)Improved Quality of life as assessed by SF-36,&#xD;
      compared to PC group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also examine self-reported appetite and satiety as well as biomarkers leptin and&#xD;
      adiponectin in the RSV versus PC group. Finally, we will examine the effects of RSV on&#xD;
      hepatic (serum Ala aminotransferase, asp aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline&#xD;
      phosphatase, bilirubin, albumin), pancreatic (serum amylase) and renal (BUN and creatinine),&#xD;
      function and red blood cell count (CBC with differential) in the IR compared to the PC group.&#xD;
