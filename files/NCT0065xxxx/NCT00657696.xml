  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Within every primary care clinic is a small team of people who provide care to a group of&#xD;
      patients who consider this clinic to be their medical home. Rapid advances in medical&#xD;
      knowledge and technology require that these teams constantly adapt so that they can provide&#xD;
      the best care to their patients. The goal of this study is to examine how people in these&#xD;
      primary care teams learn and relate to each other as they change an adapt. This will be done&#xD;
      by observing and interviewing people who work in these teams and by giving them and their&#xD;
      patients a survey to fill out. We will then look at the performance of these clinics to see&#xD;
      if it is related to how they learn and the quality of their relationships. Our ultimate goal&#xD;
      is to design effective interventions that will improve the quality and outcomes of care&#xD;
      received by Veterans in primary care outpatient clinics within the VHA.&#xD;

      Anticipated Impacts on Veterans Healthcare: Our ultimate goal is to improve the health of&#xD;
      veterans by designing interventions at the clinical microsystem level that will facilitate&#xD;
      the integration of KM-SD roles in primary care through improving relationships and learning.&#xD;
      We anticipate that such a cross-cutting intervention has the potential to improve clinical&#xD;
      performance as well as staff and patient satisfaction. If we are successful, this could be a&#xD;
      breakthrough in the efficiency of VA organizational change. Project Background: The way in&#xD;
      which we conceptualize the basic nature of the primary care clinic (PCC) greatly influences&#xD;
      our beliefs and ideas about what should work to improve its operations. If we view it as a&#xD;
      production line, then we design our improvement efforts using systems engineering techniques&#xD;
      aimed at standardizing, reducing variation, and improving efficiency. If instead we view the&#xD;
      PCC as an organic and complex social system, then we might design our improvement efforts&#xD;
      using methods designed to embrace rather than eliminate surprise (which is inevitable in&#xD;
      health care settings), to enhance the connections and communication between the individuals&#xD;
      in the PCC rather than focusing on improving the skill sets of the individuals, and to use&#xD;
      feedback and time for reflection as part of a strategy for the PCC to make sense of their own&#xD;
      operations and behaviors in relation to their mission and goals. For the purpose of this&#xD;
      proposal, this latter approach will be denoted by the term knowledge management techniques.&#xD;
      We propose to study whether PCC performance correlates with the presence of higher levels of&#xD;
      use of knowledge management techniques within PCCs. The VA has been in the forefront of&#xD;
      implementing some knowledge management practices, such as sue of performance data systems and&#xD;
      integrated health records, but has not yet paid sufficient attention to other such as&#xD;
      relationship management, increasing diversity in decision making, active learning, and&#xD;
      sense-making. Project Objectives: Describe the range of knowledge management techniques,&#xD;
      including relationship management and active learning) currently employed by 15 VA and 5 VA&#xD;
      contract PCCs. 2. Analyze the relationship between the nature and roles of relationships and&#xD;
      learning in PCCs and their performance across multiple outcomes including clinical&#xD;
      performance measures, worker satisfaction and turnover, and patient satisfaction. Our&#xD;
      research propositions are: (1) High performing PCCs exhibit higher quality relationships and&#xD;
      more active learning than low performing clinics; (2) The quality of relationship within PCCs&#xD;
      will have the largest effects on worker and patient satisfaction. Research Propositions: 1.&#xD;
      High performing VA and VA contract primary care clinics will exhibit higher quality&#xD;
      relationships and more active learning than low performing clinics. 2.a. Variation in&#xD;
      temporal change in both relationships and learning among the 20 clinics over the 30 months&#xD;
      will be observed. 2.b. The temporal change in relationships (such as stable, improving or&#xD;
      deteriorating between adjacent years) will be associated with a similar temporal change in&#xD;
      patient and employee satisfaction.2 c. The temporal change in learning (such as stable,&#xD;
      improving or deteriorating between adjacent years) will be associated with a similar temporal&#xD;
      change in process of care quality indicators and with intermediate clinical outcomes. Project&#xD;
      Methods: Descriptive, iterative study of 15 VA and 5 VA contract primary care clinics within&#xD;
      VISN 17. Using ethnographic, qualitative and quantitative data collection methods, each&#xD;
      clinic will be profiled on the nature of relationships between staff and between staff and&#xD;
      patients and the nature of learning. Clinical outcomes (patient functional status, BP,&#xD;
      cholesterol, HgA1c, preventable admissions), patient satisfaction, employee satisfaction and&#xD;
      turnover will serve as outcomes. The association of these outcomes with the nature of&#xD;
      relationships and learning will be explored qualitatively and quantitatively. Stability of&#xD;
      these profiles will be evaluated in two subsequent waves of data collection.&#xD;
