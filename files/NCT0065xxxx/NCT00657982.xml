      The mechanisms responsible for the development of hormonal refractory prostate cancer (HRPC)&#xD;
      have been elusive. Genetic inactivation/loss of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene occurs in&#xD;
      30-60% of advanced prostate cancers and in 20% of the localized form. Researchers hypothesize&#xD;
      that PTEN loss is a landmark genetic event in prostate cancer progression into the fatal HRPC&#xD;
      form. One consequence of PTEN loss is activation of the oncogenic Akt and phosphorylation of&#xD;
      downstream Akt targets including mTOR. mTOR controls many important cellular processes&#xD;
      including cell cycle regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to evaluate pharmacodynamic assessments of the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 in&#xD;
      intermediate and high risk prostate cancer patients in the neoadjuvant setting. Patients will&#xD;
      be admitted to 6 weeks treatment with RAD001 10 mg/day followed by either radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy or radiotherapy combined with hormonal treatment. Immunohistochemistry with&#xD;
      antibodies for phosphorylated p70S6K , pS6, Akt as well as antibodies for VEGF, BCL2 and PTEN&#xD;
      in prostate cancer tissues before and after 6 weeks RAD001 treatment will be performed.&#xD;
      Additionally, Patients will be evaluated by FDG-PET scan before (as baseline) and after&#xD;
      RAD001 treatment. A link between mTOR signaling and glycolysis regulation was established and&#xD;
      may provide a mechanism to assess drug-target interaction of RAD001 in prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoint of the trial will be to determine the response proportion to RAD001&#xD;
      treatment by assessing time to biochemical failure followed by radiation therapy or radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy. The data will be compared to a matched cohort of high and intermediate-risk&#xD;
      prostate cancer patients admitted to the same treatments modalities without receiving RAD001.&#xD;

      Newly diagnosed patients with prostate cancer, with localized untreated disease must be at&#xD;
      intermediate or high risk for disease relapse based on their PSA, Gleason score, and clinical&#xD;
      stage. Before starting treatment, a baseline radiographic evaluation with FDG-PET and&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be performed. Biopsies will also be performed to obtain&#xD;
      fresh tissue for molecular and gene expression assays. In patients with a positive FDG-PET&#xD;
      scan at baseline, Treatment Day 1-14 will be with RAD001 10 mg/day alone. After performing&#xD;
      post-RAD001 FDG-PET evaluation, treatment Day 15 will be equivalent of Treatment Day 1 of the&#xD;
      trial in patients with negative FDG-PET scan at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with a negative FDG-PET scan at baseline, Treatment Day 1 is the beginning of the&#xD;
      Phase II trial of RAD001 combined with androgen ablation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with RAD001 10 mg per day combined with androgen ablation therapy&#xD;
      for 8 weeks depending on their ability to tolerate the drug. Radiographic and biologic assays&#xD;
      will be repeated after 8 weeks, at which time patients will undergo prostatectomy or external&#xD;
      beam radiation therapy (ERT). Second biopsy will be performed in patients admitted to ERT&#xD;
      They will receive RAD001 up to the day of surgery or ERT to ascertain better tissue&#xD;
      concentration of the drug. Gene expression profiling will also be evaluated at that time. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint of this study is pharmacodynamic assessments of the effects of RAD001 in&#xD;
      prostate cancer. However, the secondary endpoints of this study will define its true success.&#xD;
      Specifically, the study will evaluate pharmacodynamic assessments of the effects of RAD001 in&#xD;
      prostate cancer using novel applications of radiology, molecular biology, and genomics. These&#xD;
      novel endpoints will be correlated with more established pathologic measures, such as&#xD;
      microvessel density, apoptotic indexes, PTEN, phospho-AKT and phospho-p70S6K. MRI and&#xD;
      3-dimensional. PSA effects will also be assessed. Prostate cancer tissues from high risk&#xD;
      prostate cancer patients admitted to neoadjuvant androgen ablation without RAD001 will serve&#xD;
      as controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ambitious aspect of this project is to examine gene expression alterations that occur in&#xD;
      these patients. It will be technically challenging to get enough tissue by needle biopsies&#xD;
      for gene array analysis. However, clearly, obtaining this information might be very useful in&#xD;
      describing the full effects of RAD001 therapy in this patient population.&#xD;
