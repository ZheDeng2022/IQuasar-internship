    <textblock>
      This study will assess whether the daily co-administration of ezetimibe 10 mg with ongoing&#xD;
      treatment of simvastatin 20 mg will be more effective than treatment with simvastatin 20 mg&#xD;
      alone in further reducing LDL-C concentrations.&#xD;

             (160 mg/dL) using the Friedewald calculation available at the time of randomization&#xD;
             Visit 3 (Baseline Visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have triglyceride concentrations of &lt; 3.99 mmol/L (350 mg/dL) at Visit 3&#xD;
             (Baseline Visit).&#xD;
&#xD;

             without stent placement); symptomatic peripheral vascular disease (claudication);&#xD;
             documented history of atherothrombotic cerebrovascular disease; and/or documented&#xD;
             history of unstable angina or non-Q wave myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must be currently taking simvastatin 20 mg daily and by history has taken 80%&#xD;

             Visit 3 (Baseline Visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical laboratory tests (CBC, blood chemistries, urinalysis) must be within normal&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be free of any clinically significant diseases other than hyperlipidemia&#xD;
             or coronary heart disease that would interfere with study evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must understand and be able to adhere to the dosing and visit schedules, and&#xD;
             must agree to remain on their cholesterol-lowering diet and their exercise regimen for&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
