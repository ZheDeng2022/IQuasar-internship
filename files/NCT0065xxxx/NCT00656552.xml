      Safety and Efficacy of Escitalopram in the Treatment of Premature Ejaculation A Double-Blind,&#xD;
      Placebo-Controlled, Fixed-Dose, Randomized controlled Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      From an epidemiological perspective, premature ejaculation (PE) has been reported as the most&#xD;
      common male sexual dysfunction with overall prevalence rates estimated at around 30%&#xD;
      .(Laumann et al., 1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PE is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders(revision IV)&#xD;
      (DSM-IV-TR) as 'the persistent or recurrent ejaculation with minimal stimulation before, on,&#xD;
      or shortly after penetration and before the person wishes it'. (American Psychiatric&#xD;
      Association, 1994).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ISSM Definition of Premature Ejaculation is a male sexual dysfunction characterized by&#xD;
      ejaculation which always or nearly always occurs prior to or within about one minute of&#xD;
      vaginal penetration; and inability to delay ejaculation on all or nearly all vaginal&#xD;
      penetrations; and negative personal consequences, such as distress, bother, frustration&#xD;
      and/or the avoidance of sexual intimacy (www.issm.info).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premature ejaculation has been associated with erosion in sexual self-confidence and low&#xD;
      sexual satisfaction in men and their female partners.( Byers &amp; Grenier ; 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral therapy and psychological counseling are the historically initial approaches in&#xD;
      the treatment of PE.However There is no evidence that non-drug therapy is able to guarantee&#xD;
      long-term cure or improvement of PE. (Rosen, 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These techniques require active involvement of the patients and their partners and the&#xD;
      benefits are generally short-lived, and patients usually relapse. In addition, these&#xD;
      therapies may not be applicable for some cultural and socioeconomic groups. Therefore, some&#xD;
      pharmacological agents have been proposed for the treatment of PE(Rosen, 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The serotoninergic system has an inhibitory effect on the ejaculatory reflex. Selective&#xD;
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram) are&#xD;
      reported to be effective for treating PE (Rosen, 2004; Safarinejad &amp; Hosseini, 2006).&#xD;
      Psychopharmacological studies suggest that PE might be due to decreased serotonergic&#xD;
      neurotransmission through pathways that control ejaculation (Waldinger et al., 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ejaculation delay induced by SSRIs is due to alterations in specific serotonin receptors in&#xD;
      the central nervous system. The ejaculation-retarding effect of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT,&#xD;
      serotonin) has been attributed to the activation of 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C receptors. By contrast,&#xD;
      stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors has a facilitator effect on ejaculation (Giuliano, 2007). The&#xD;
      net effect of acute SSRI administration is only a mild increase of 5-HT neurotransmission and&#xD;
      mild stimulation of the various post-synaptic serotonin receptors (Waldinger et al., 2005).&#xD;
      In contrast, chronic SSRI administration is associated with more 5-HT (serotonin) release&#xD;
      into the synapse, stronger increase of 5-HT neurotransmission, and as a result durable&#xD;
      activation of post-synaptic 5-HT receptors (Blier et al., 1988).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Escitalopram has been claimed to have the highest selectivity for the human serotonin&#xD;
      transporter relative to the noradrenaline or dopamine transporters.(Owens et al; 2001) This&#xD;
      might be associated with greater clinical efficacy. Most adverse events reported by&#xD;
      escitalopram-treated patients are mild and transient (Lepola et al; 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we compare escitalopram with placebo in the treatment of PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the present trial is to assess the safety &amp; efficacy of Escitalopram in the&#xD;
      treatment of premature ejaculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Fixed-Dose, Randomized Controlled Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outpatient clinic of sexual health Kasr El-Einy (Cairo University Hospital), Cairo,&#xD;
      Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred married patients seek medical help for what they consider premature ejaculation&#xD;
      with possible sexual intercourse equal or greater than 1 per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and Allocation Concealment Randomization will be performed using allocation&#xD;
      concealment random assignment schedule for each patient. It will be accomplished using&#xD;
      numbered cards in closed envelopes that assured an equal number of patients in the two&#xD;
      treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Chronic psychiatric or physical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alcohol or substance abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of psychotropic and antidepressant medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient with prostatitis&#xD;

&#xD;
      Assessment of patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. History taking.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        3. Local genital examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Self administration of IIEF (Arabic version)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Pretreatment IELT(Intravaginal Ejaculatory Latency Time) measured at least 3 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient undergo a double- blind therapy of Escitalopram (10 mg) orally daily during breakfast&#xD;
      (n=50) or placebo (n=50) for four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: change in geometric mean IELT from baseline to four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome: changes in the intercourse satisfaction domain values of IIEF(Arabic&#xD;
