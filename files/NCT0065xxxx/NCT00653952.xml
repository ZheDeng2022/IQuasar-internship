      The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of CAELYX versus Paclitaxel&#xD;
      HCl in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma following failure of first-line,&#xD;
      platinum-based chemotherapy. The primary endpoint is time to progression (TTP) following&#xD;
      treatment with either CAELYX or Paclitaxel HCl; the secondary endpoints are response rates,&#xD;
      time to response, duration of response,quality of life assessment, and survival following&#xD;
      treatment with either CAELYX or Paclitaxel HCl. Up to a total of 438 protocol-eligible&#xD;
      patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma following failure of first-line, platinum-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy will be enrolled in order to obtain 350 evaluable patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, comparative study of CAELYX versus Paclitaxel HCl in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma following failure of first line&#xD;
      chemotherapy with a platinum-based regimen. Patients entering the trial will be stratified&#xD;
      prospectively for platinum-sensitivity and bulky disease and analyzed retrospectively for&#xD;
      prior anthracycline therapy. Protocol-eligible patients, with measurable disease, who have&#xD;
      received no more than one prior regimen, which was platinum-based, will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either a one-hour intravenous infusion of CAELYX, 50 mg/m2 every 28 days, or&#xD;
      Paclitaxel HCl, 175 mg/m2 as a 3 hour infusion every 21 days. Patients will be treated for up&#xD;
      to one year. It is suggested that responding patients receive at least 6 cycles of treatment.&#xD;
      Patients with ongoing clinical benefit may continue study drug upon approval of the sponsor&#xD;
      as long as it is in the patient's interest and in the absence of severe toxicity. It is&#xD;
      suggested that patients exhibiting a complete response (CR) receive 2 subsequent cycles of&#xD;
      treatment. Patients exhibiting partial response (PR) may continue to receive study drug as&#xD;
      long as therapeutic benefit is being derived but it is suggested that they receive at least 3&#xD;
      subsequent cycles of study drug. Patients will undergo appropriate radiological imaging&#xD;
      (x-ray, CT scan, MRI) to document baseline disease, as well as a chest x-ray and an&#xD;
      assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by MUGA scan within 30 days prior to&#xD;
      the first dose of study drug. Patients will be followed weekly for hematological toxicities.&#xD;
      Radiological imaging will be repeated every 7-8 weeks to assess disease status. Patients who&#xD;
      achieve complete or partial response will be reevaluated 4 weeks later to confirm the initial&#xD;
      observation of response. All patients will be followed for a minimum of one year for disease&#xD;
      progression and survival. LVEF will be assessed by MUGA scan at baseline, when the cumulative&#xD;
      anthracycline dose reaches 300 mg/m2 (500 mg/m2 epirubicin), and after every 2 cycles of&#xD;
      CAELYX thereafter. Endomyocardial biopsy is recommended for patients who have received &gt; 400&#xD;
      mg/m2 of CAELYX alone or a cumulative anthracycline dose of &gt; 550 mg/m2 (including CAELYX;&#xD;
      900 mg/m2 if epirubicin). [NOTE: This study was initiated on 7-May-1997. Due to poor accrual,&#xD;
      the study enrollment was terminated on 31-Aug-1999. Patients were followed until study&#xD;
      completion on 12-Apr-2000. During the preparation of the study report (beginning in May&#xD;
      2003), the sites were re-queried for clarification of safety and survival data.]&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOXIL, dose of 50 mg/m2 by i.v. infusion over 1 hour every 28 days for up to 1 year.&#xD;
      Paclitaxel, dose of 175 mg/m2 by i.v. infusion over 3 hours starting on Day 1 of a 21-day&#xD;
