      Head &amp; Neck squamous cell carcinomas are the commonest cancers afflicting the developing&#xD;
      countries. Traditionally surgery or radiotherapy alone in the early stages and surgery with&#xD;
      postoperative radiotherapy in advanced stages have been the mainstay of treatment. Of late&#xD;
      there has been a paradigm shift in the management of these cancers, particularly those of the&#xD;
      oropharynx and laryngopharynx, where chemoradiation has been advocated as part of organ&#xD;
      preservation protocol with good outcomes. Conventional radiotherapy involves the use of 2 or&#xD;
      3 field technique with or without compensators to encompass the volume at risk to radical&#xD;
      doses of 66-70 Gy typically needed to sterilize gross disease. This strategy however is&#xD;
      associated with considerable acute morbidity (mucositis, dysphagia, dermatitis) and&#xD;
      debilitating late toxicity (xerostomia). Three dimensional conformal radiation therapy&#xD;
      (3D-CRT) and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) have the potential to improve the&#xD;
      dose distribution, with increased doses to the target volumes and reduced doses to&#xD;

      1.0 Introduction: Head &amp; Neck squamous cell carcinomas are the commonest cancers afflicting&#xD;
      the developing countries. Traditionally surgery or radiotherapy alone in the early stages and&#xD;
      surgery with postoperative radiotherapy in advanced stages have been the mainstay of&#xD;
      treatment. Of late there has been a paradigm shift in the management of these cancers,&#xD;
      particularly those of the oropharynx and laryngopharynx, where chemoradiation has been&#xD;
      advocated as part of organ preservation protocol with good outcomes. Conventional&#xD;
      radiotherapy involves the use of 2 or 3 field technique with or without compensators to&#xD;
      encompass the volume at risk to radical doses of 66-70 Gy typically needed to sterilize gross&#xD;
      disease. This strategy however is associated with considerable acute morbidity (mucositis,&#xD;
      dysphagia, dermatitis) and debilitating late toxicity (xerostomia). Three dimensional&#xD;
      conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) have&#xD;
      the potential to improve the dose distribution, with increased doses to the target volumes&#xD;
      and reduced doses to surrounding normal structures, thereby improving the therapeutic ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 Objectives: 2.1 To compare the major salivary gland sparing by 3-D CRT vis-Ã -vis IMRT and&#xD;
      assess the adequacy of target volume coverage with these conformal techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 To determine the pattern of local and loco-regional recurrence. 2.3 To determine Disease&#xD;
      Free Survival (DFS) &amp; Overall Survival (OAS) 2.4 To study the quality of life of these&#xD;
      patients 2.5 To assess the reduction in dose with IMRT to the normal larynx &amp; normal&#xD;
      pharyngeal constrictors in oropharyngeal cancers, uninvolved oral mucosa and middle &amp; inner&#xD;
      ear apparatus in both oropharyngeal &amp; laryngopharyngeal cancers&#xD;

      complete the following prior to start of therapy: 4.1.1 Complete history and physical&#xD;
      examination including weight and height. 4.1.2. Complete diagrammatic and descriptive&#xD;
      documentation of the extent of disease, both primary and regional following appropriate&#xD;
      endoscopic procedures. 4.1.3 Complete dental and nutritional evaluation. All dental repair to&#xD;
      be done at least one week prior to starting therapy. 4.1.4 Completion of the following&#xD;
      laboratory investigations: CBC, LFT, RFT, TFT, baseline speech assessment and audiometric&#xD;
      assessment. 4.1.5 Completion of the following radiological investigations: CXR, CT/MRI of the&#xD;
      head &amp; neck with volumetric assessments, Planning scan with contrast (unless otherwise&#xD;

      or a CT-PET hybrid scan may be done at the discretion of the treating physician (Appendix&#xD;
      III). Bone scan and liver scan as per clinical indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1.6 Salivary scintigraphy for the parotid glands. 4.1.7 A baseline QOL questionnaire&#xD;
      (Appendix IV) will be filled in for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.0 Radiation therapy: 5.1 Treatment planning, imaging &amp; localization requirements. 5.1.1&#xD;
      Immobilization: In supine position with a customized thermoplastic device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.2 Planning scan: Contrast enhanced planning CT scan of the area of interest with 3mm&#xD;
      slices on CT-simulator that is networked to the treatment planning system (Cadplan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.3 Target delineation: Planning target volumes (GTV and CTV) and organ at risk volumes&#xD;
      (spinal cord and both the parotids) to be contoured on each slice. Other organs such as&#xD;
      uninvolved oral mucosa, middle &amp; inner ear and normal larynx &amp; pharyngeal constrictors in&#xD;
      oropharyngeal cancers also to be contoured on each slice. An isometric margin of 5mm to be&#xD;
      provided to the CTV for final PTV and 3mm to organs at risk for planning organ at risk volume&#xD;
      (PORV). The GTV will include only the primary and involved neck nodes. The delineation of the&#xD;
      various volumes will be as per consensus guidelines. The priorities and constraints for IMRT&#xD;
      plan will also be decided on a case to case basis (see appendix V for details).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.4 Prescription: The goal of the treatment plan would be to encompass the PTV subclinical&#xD;
      disease with a dose of 60-54 Gy conventional fractionation equivalent and the GTV with 70 Gy&#xD;
      equivalent while sparing as much of the aforesaid critical structures as possible without&#xD;
      compromising on the GTV. Primary target (gross disease with margins) dose will be 70 Gy&#xD;
      conventional fractionation equivalent (70 Gy/35#/7 weeks with 3-D CRT ad 66 Gy/30#/6 weeks&#xD;
      with IMRT). The secondary target (sub-clinical disease) dose will be 50-54 Gy conventional&#xD;
      fractionation equivalent (50-54 Gy/28-30#/5.5-6 weeks with 3-D CRT and 54 Gy/30#/6 weeks with&#xD;
      IMRT). An optional secondary target area may be defines as area of high risk disease (e.g.&#xD;
      first echelon nodes). This shall receive 60 Gy/30#/6 weeks with both 3-D CRT and IMRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum permissible point doses to the spinal cord will be limited to 40 Gy. All patients&#xD;
      to be planned with both 3-D CRT as well as IMRT, irrespective of the final treatment&#xD;
      protocol. 3-D CRT planning to be done on Cadplan/Eclipse (Varian, USA) using multileaf&#xD;
      collimators (MLCs) for beam shaping. IMRT planning to be done using Helios inverse planning&#xD;
      module of Cadplan/Eclipse. Treatment to be delivered on a Varian LINAC (2100 CD or 6 Ex)&#xD;
      using dynamic MLCs (sliding window technique).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.5 Plan evaluation: Comparative evaluation of the bease 3-D CRT and IMRT plan for the&#xD;
      individual patient to be done. Cumulative dose volume histograms (DVHs) to be computed for&#xD;
      PTV and each PORV to assist in plan evaluation. Plans to be compared with respect to&#xD;
      conformal avoidance of organs at risk, conformity index, homogeneity index and DVHs. An in&#xD;
      detail evaluation of the quality assurance (Appendix VI) and dosimetric methods involved in&#xD;
      the procedure would also be carried out and will be correlated with final outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.0 Other therapy: 6.1 Chemotherapy: Concurrent platinum based chemotherapy to be considered&#xD;
      for all patients with T3 or N+ disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Cytoprotectors: Use of amifostine or pilocarpine is not allowed. 7.0 Patient assessments:&#xD;
      7.1 Patients assessments table (see Appendix VII for details). 7.2 Evaluation 7.2.1 Every&#xD;
      follow up visit: All patients require to follow up 6weeks and 12 weeks from end of&#xD;
      radiotherapy, Thereafter follow up visits would be scheduled three monthly for the first two&#xD;
      years and annually thereafter. Routine head &amp; neck examination, including endoscopic&#xD;
      examination will be performed at the first follow-up and thereafter as and when needed,&#xD;
      performance status, weight, toxicity and QOL documentation will be carried out at each&#xD;
      follow-up. Salivary scintigraphy, swallowing status, speech assessment, thyroid function test&#xD;
      and audiometry will be done at first follow-up post treatment and six monthly thereafter.&#xD;
      Follow-up PET scan to be done at the discretion of the treating physician. Dental care to be&#xD;
      provided as and when needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.2.2 Other studies: CXR for persistent cough, hemoptysis or chest pain; skeletal survey or&#xD;
      bone scan in case of any bone pains and biopsy of any suspicious lesion in the upper&#xD;
      aero-digestive tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.2.3 Objective response criteria (see Appendix VIII). 7.3 Criteria for removal from&#xD;
      treatment 7.3.1 Progression of disease while on treatment 7.3.2 Withdrawal of consent by&#xD;
      patient 7.3.3 Severe radiation morbidity resulting in a break of 2 weeks or more. 8.0 Data&#xD;
      Collection: 8.1 Summary of data submission ITEM DUE Demographic form Within 2 weeks of study&#xD;
      entry Initial Evaluation form 1 week before RT start Diagnostic Pathology Report Before RT&#xD;
      start Baseline QOL assessment 1 week before start of treatment Radiotherapy form Within 1&#xD;
      week of end of RT Adverse Event form (see appendix IX for details) Initial follow-up form At&#xD;
      6 weeks from end of RT Follow-up forms At 3, 6 &amp; 12 Months from end of RT Long term follow-up&#xD;
      forms Yearly after 5 years Autopsy report If needed&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.2 Summary of RT QA requirements (see Appendix VI for details): Preliminary Dosimetric&#xD;
      Information Within 1 week of start of RT Simulation &amp; Port films Every week Final Dosimetric&#xD;
      Information Within 1 week of end of RT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hard copy of isodoses and DVH for total plan including any charges&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.0 Statistical consideration: 9.1.1 The primary end point is acute salivary gland toxicity&#xD;
      (&gt; = Gr 2) as per the RTOG toxicity criteria (see Appendix X &amp; XI). This is also to be&#xD;
      assessed by salivary scintigraphy and subjectively by patient self-assessment. As a surrogate&#xD;
      dose volume histogram shall be used for assessment for major salivary gland sparing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.1.2 Secondary endpoints include: a) Local &amp; Loco-regional control b) DFS &amp; c) OAS 9.2&#xD;
      Patient accrual, sample size &amp; analysis: 60 patients. 9.2.1 Approximately 85% of patients&#xD;
      with conventional techniques or 3-D CRT would develop acute salivary gland toxicity of grade&#xD;
      2 or more. With IMRT, it is hypothesized that this could be reduced to 50%. The total number&#xD;
      of patients needed would be fifty-four assuming alpha error 0.05 and beta error 0.20 (one&#xD;
      tailed test). The projected 3 year locoregional control rate for this group is 70%. Ensuring&#xD;
      that the salivary gland sparing should not be at the expense of loco-regional control, the&#xD;
      upper limit for locoregional failure rate is set at 45% as per Fleming's one step multiple&#xD;
      testing procedure. In case this is exceeded anytime during the interim analysis, the entire&#xD;
      protocol shall be re-examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.2.2 Sixty patients to be accrued over a 24 month period from date of start 9.2.3 Interim&#xD;
      analysis of toxicity and accrual data planned every six months. Initial results of treatment&#xD;
      to be reported when all patients have completed at least 6 months on follow-up. Final results&#xD;
      to be reported at a minimum of 2 year follow-up on all patients.&#xD;
