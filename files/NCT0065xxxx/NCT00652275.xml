      This study will be the fourth time that the candidate malaria vaccine Merozoite Surface&#xD;
      Protein - long synthetic chain, will be tested in malaria endemic populations.in the&#xD;
      past,once tested in adults and twice in children proved to be safe in all three occasions for&#xD;
      this phase IIb study in children to proceed. This study will include children who will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to either receive the malaria vaccine adjuvanted with Aluminium Hydroxide&#xD;
      or the Verorab control. Each participant will receive 3 immunizations, without the clinical&#xD;
      investigators or the participants themselves knowing what has been given. They will then be&#xD;
      followed-up for immediate reactions to vaccination, extended safety profile and immunological&#xD;
      response associated with protection from malaria. These children will be followed up for over&#xD;
      a longer term of two years. Blood will be taken to evaluate the biological safety parameters&#xD;
      and also the immune responses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase IIb study to evaluate the&#xD;
      immunogenicity, efficacy and safety of Plasmodium falciparum vaccine candidate, Merozoite&#xD;
      Surface Protein-3 Long synthetic peptide (MSP3) adjuvanted in aluminium hydroxide versus&#xD;
      Verorab control in healthy children aged 12-48 months in Mali&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phase Ib trial is currently ongoing in Burkina Faso as well as in Tanzania and its interim&#xD;
      results inform on the best dose/adjuvant combination to be safely extended in younger&#xD;
      children. The trial is evaluating immunogenicity,efficacy and safety of 3 doses of 30 µg MSP3&#xD;
      adjuvanted in aluminium hydroxide&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the efficacy of MSP3-LSP:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the efficacy of MSP3-LSP in children aged 12-48 months against all clinical&#xD;
           malaria episodes (Axillary temperature of ≥ 37.5ºC with P. falciparum parasitemia)&#xD;
           occurring during the consecutive malaria transmission season after the third vaccination&#xD;
           (six months after the third vaccination).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and reactogenicity of 3 doses of 30 µg MSP3 adjuvanted in aluminum&#xD;
           hydroxide given at D0, D28 and D56 in healthy children aged 12-48 months old in Mali.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess IgG ability to recognize the native protein on Merozoite by using Western Blot&#xD;
           (WB) method, and measure efficacy among the subgroup of individuals able to react with&#xD;
           parasite proteins in WB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the humoral immune response to the vaccine antigen using ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the efficacy of MSP3 in children aged 12-48 months against first clinical&#xD;
           malaria episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the efficacy of MSP3-LSP in children aged 12-48 months against all clinical&#xD;
           malaria episodes occurring during the ensuing TWO years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further characterize the MSP3 vaccine efficacy by measuring:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relationship between efficacy and serological responses induced by the vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of protection over the period of two years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaccine efficacy against disease defined by various parasite thresholds [500, 2500,&#xD;
           5000, 10,000 and 20,000/µL]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaccine efficacy against severe malaria disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaccine efficacy against anaemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate functionality of IgG by using the ADCI technique&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the cellular T-helper type 1 immune responses to the vaccine antigens by&#xD;
           Elispot, and their persistence over 24 months of follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary evaluation will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Solicited adverse events measured from day 0 to day 7 after each dose; Unsolicited adverse&#xD;
      events measured up to one month after each dose; Serious Adverse Event (SAE) measured during&#xD;
      the 12 months of study duration. Passive and active case detection will be used to capture&#xD;
      all adverse events including clinical malaria episodes. After third dose. All participants&#xD;
      will go through the scheduled clinic visits on days 84, 168, 365, 540 and 730 for clinical&#xD;
      assessment. Children will be followed for two years following the first vaccination. During&#xD;
      scheduled visits malaria smear and hemoglobin will be done systematically on days 0, 28, 56,&#xD;
      84, 168, 365, 540 and 730. The humoral immune response to the vaccine antigen will be&#xD;
      assessed using ELISA on days 0, 28, 56, 84, 168, 365, 540 and 730. Cellular immune response&#xD;
      to the vaccine antigens will be assessed on days 0, 56, 84, 168, 540 and 730 using Elispot to&#xD;
      MSP3-LSP. The functionality of the induced immune responses using Western Blot (WB) method&#xD;
      and ADCI technique will be evaluated on days 0, 84, 168, 365, 540 and 730.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological safety: two and four weeks after each vaccination, and thereafter every 12 weeks,&#xD;
      in reference with the baseline before the first dose, by measuring the following RBC,&#xD;
      hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, WBC with differential counts, ASAT, ALAT, total bilirubin,&#xD;
      alkaline phosphatase, γGT, creatinin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive methods shall be employed to evaluate the above criteria.&#xD;
