      RATIONALE: Everolimus and vatalanib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of&#xD;
      the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving everolimus&#xD;
      together with vatalanib may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of everolimus and&#xD;
      vatalanib in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of RAD001&#xD;
      and once daily PTK787 when given in combination. (Cohort IA) II. To describe the toxicities&#xD;
      associated with the combination of RAD001 and once daily PTK787. (Cohort IA) III. To evaluate&#xD;
      the therapeutic antitumor activity of the combination of once daily PTK787 with RAD001.&#xD;
      (Cohort IA) IV. To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximally tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) of RAD001 and twice daily PTK787 when given in combination. (Cohort IB) V. To describe&#xD;
      the toxicities associated with the combination of RAD001 and twice daily PTK787. (Cohort IB)&#xD;
      VI. To evaluate the therapeutic antitumor activity of the combination of twice daily PTK787&#xD;
      with RAD001. (Cohort IB) VII. To determine the MTD-Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) based on&#xD;
      the MTD for Cohorts IA and IB. (Cohorts IA &amp; IB) VIII. To investigate the biological activity&#xD;
      of the combination of PTK787 with RAD001 at the MTD-RP2D. (Cohort II) IX. To evaluate the&#xD;
      therapeutic antitumor activity of the combination of PTK787 with RAD001 at the MTD-RP2D.&#xD;
      (Cohort II) X. To evaluate pharmacogenetic, metabolic and clinical markers that may predict&#xD;
      for hypertension induced by anti-VEGF therapy. (Cohort II) XI. To obtain pilot data on&#xD;
      efficacy outcomes in patients with metastatic kidney cancer, neuroendocrine cancer, NSCLC or&#xD;
      melanoma. (Cohort II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 cohorts, according to their disease (cohort IA, IB, or IIA&#xD;
      [any histopathologic diagnosis] vs cohort IIB [metastatic kidney cancer, neuroendocrine&#xD;
      cancer, melanoma, or non-small cell lung cancer). Patients are initially enrolled into&#xD;
      cohorts IA and IB until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D)&#xD;
      are determined. Once the MTD/RP2D of everolimus and vatalanib are determined, subsequent&#xD;
      patients are enrolled and treated in expansion cohorts IIA or IIB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts 1A or 1B (dose escalation cohorts; closed to enrollment as of 12/6/06): Patients&#xD;
      receive oral vatalanib once (cohort 1A) or twice (cohort 1B) daily on days 1-28 and oral&#xD;
      everolimus once daily on days 15-28 of course 1. For all subsequent courses, patients receive&#xD;
      oral vatalanib once (cohort 1A) or twice (cohort 1B) daily and oral everolimus once daily on&#xD;
      days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort IIA (expansion cohort treated at the MTD/RP2D): Patients receive oral everolimus once&#xD;
      daily for 14 days followed by a 7-day rest period. Patients then receive oral vatalanib twice&#xD;
      daily on days 1-28 and oral everolimus once daily on days 15-28 of course 1. For all&#xD;
      subsequent courses, patients receive oral vatalanib twice daily and oral everolimus once&#xD;
      daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort IIB (expansion cohort treated at the MTD/RP2D): Patients receive oral vatalanib twice&#xD;
      daily on days 1-28 and oral everolimus once daily on days 15-28 of course 1. For all&#xD;
      subsequent courses, patients receive oral vatalanib twice daily and oral everolimus once&#xD;
      daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3 months.&#xD;
