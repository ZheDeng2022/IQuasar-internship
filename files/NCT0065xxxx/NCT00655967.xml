  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol abuse and dependence are very prevalent and result in significant morbidity,&#xD;
      mortality and cost to society (Harwood 2000). Pharmacotherapies to assist with alcohol&#xD;
      dependence consist of disulfiram, naltrexone and acamprosate. Of these, acamprosate is unique&#xD;
      in that it is not metabolized by the liver, but rather completely excreted renally. In&#xD;
      contrast, naltrexone is metabolized by the CYP450 system of the liver and less than 2% is&#xD;
      excreted unchanged and can cause liver damage (PDR 2005). Multiple cases of hepatitis,&#xD;
      including both cholestatic and fulminant hepatitis, as well as hepatic failure resulting in&#xD;
      transplantation or death, have been reported with administration of disulfiram (PDR 2005).&#xD;
      The incidence of liver disease among alcoholics is high and increases with age and years of&#xD;
      drinking and this may preclude the use of antabuse or naltrexone to help alcohol dependent&#xD;
      patients with liver disease or that are elderly . Thus acamprosate has a unique safety&#xD;
      profile that would make it ideally suited for treating alcohol dependence in the elderly,&#xD;
      even in the presence of hepatic impairment. The current study is to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      profile of acamprosate in elderly patients with alcohol dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acamprosate, calcium acetyl homotaurinate, has been approved in most European countries and&#xD;
      the U.S. for the maintenance of abstinence in recently detoxified alcoholics. The mechanism&#xD;
      of action involves primarily the restoration of a normal N-methyl- D -aspartate (NMDA)&#xD;
      receptor tone in glutamatergic systems (Rammes et al 2001). Several trials of acamprosate&#xD;
      confirm its efficacy in the maintenance of abstinence in alcohol dependence (Lesch et al.&#xD;
      2001; Slattery et al. 2003; Mann et al. 2004; Verheul et al. 2004). It also reduces the&#xD;
      severity of relapse in alcoholics in abstinence based treatment programs (Chick et al. 2003).&#xD;
      There is limited data on the safety of acamprosate in the elderly (PDR 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purposes of this study, elderly will be defined as 60 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the short-term safety of Acamprosate in the treatment of&#xD;
      alcohol dependence in the elderly.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN: This trial will be conducted as an open-label, fixed dose design for safety of&#xD;
      Acamprosate in the elderly. Subjects will receive Acamprosate for 12 weeks. The schedule of&#xD;
      visits will include screening, baseline and three monthly follow-up visits at days 30, 60 and&#xD;
      90. We will recruit 25 subjects in the total study period of 15 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the number of subjects, chi-squared analysis of the total number of side effects&#xD;
      (61%, i.e. 1230 out of 2018 subjects in prior studies) and the possible number of subjects in&#xD;
      the study with side effects (from 0 to 25), indicates that a significant (alpha=0.05)&#xD;
      difference from the previously observed rate would occur if less than 11 (p&lt;=0.05) or more&#xD;
      than 20 (p&lt;=0.025) subjects report side effects. Side effects in 11 to 20 subjects would be&#xD;
      nonsignificantly different from the previously published rates. Thus 25 subjects are&#xD;
      sufficient to detect significant deviation in frequency of overall side effects in this&#xD;
      sample compared to the subjects in prior studies. Total number of side effects was used for&#xD;
      this calculation because there is no single common or significant side effect that would lend&#xD;
      itself as an appropriate surrogate for the side effects overall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of the study subjects will be supplied with 333mg tablets of Acamprosate&#xD;
      provided by the Sponsor. The study medication will be administered at a dose of 666mg (=two&#xD;
      tablets) three times a day for subjects with a creatinine clearance &gt;50. The dose will be&#xD;
      333mg three times a day for subjects with a creatinine clearance in the range of 30-50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be monitored by subject's report of adverse events at all treatment visits&#xD;
      throughout both, open label and double blind phases of the Trial. The report of adverse&#xD;
      events or new symptoms by the subject will be reviewed and summarized. This may also include&#xD;
      any clinically significant changes in the vital signs (blood pressure and pulse readings,&#xD;
      weight, temperature), physical examinations, laboratory evaluations (blood chemistry,&#xD;
      hematology, urinalysis, EKG) and recording of concomitant treatment. A DSMB plan has been set&#xD;
      up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment compliance will be monitored by counts of returned medication, and subjects are to&#xD;
      be counseled if they do not adhere, or if they are thought to be at risk for not adhering to&#xD;
      the medication regimen.&#xD;
