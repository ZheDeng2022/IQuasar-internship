    <textblock>
      Therapeutical trial in patients with idiopathic polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) is&#xD;
      proposed. The study will investigate the safety and efficacy of combined methotrexate (MTX) +&#xD;
      glucocorticoids (GC) treatment compared with GC alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomised, open-label, assessor-blind, international multicenter trial,&#xD;
      performed in several European centres interested in research on inflammatory myopathies&#xD;
      (IIM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total number of 50 patients with PM/DM will be randomised into two groups (1: MTX+ GC and&#xD;
      2: GC only). Patients will be equally distributed between the two groups providing 25&#xD;
      patients per treatment arm. The randomisation will be based on random numbers generated by a&#xD;
      computer program. After being enrolled in the study, the patients will receive 12 months of&#xD;
      therapy followed by a 12-month follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the total dose of GC ( in mg/kg weight), which will be administered&#xD;
      for 12 months between baseline and the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several of secondary objectives, which will be pursued during and after the trial.&#xD;
      Disease activity and damage will be prospectively assessed by tools for myositis disease&#xD;
      activity (MYOACT and MITAX) and for myositis damage (MYODAM and MDI), global assessment of&#xD;
      activity and damage by patients and by physician, muscle endurance, muscle strength by manual&#xD;
      muscle testing, enzyme levels, GC related side effects, functional ability measured by HAQ,&#xD;
      quality of life by SF-36, and number of patients with treatment failures. The other aims will&#xD;
      also include (i) search for reliable prognostic parameters in the further prognosis of&#xD;
      patients with PM/DM and (ii) studies on the pathogenic aspects of IIM. The investigations of&#xD;
      serum, lymphocytes, muscle tissue and MRI will be organized. DNA and RNA will be stored for&#xD;
      future genetic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with definite or probable PM or DM diagnosed according to diagnostic criteria will&#xD;
      be enrolled. They will have disease activity that according to physician's own judgement&#xD;
      requires high dose immunosuppressive treatment (based on clinical assessment of weakness,&#xD;
      elevation of muscle enzymes and, if available, on magnetic resonance imaging findings).&#xD;
      Patients should be previously untreated with the exception of GC treatment up to 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with other than primary idiopathic PM or DM, such as drug-induced myositis, myositis&#xD;
      in association with other connective tissue disease, inclusion body myositis, malignancy&#xD;
      related myositis, and juvenile DM will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will start with prednisone 1 mg/kg/day and the dose will be tapered if patients&#xD;
      meet definition of improvement, which has been proposed by IMACS group. MTX will be&#xD;
      administered orally, once weekly, with a starting dose 10 mg. This will be increased&#xD;
      gradually to 25 mg/week if tolerated by week 5. Patients will be first assessed after 2 weeks&#xD;
      and than monthly for a period of 48 weeks. There will be a follow-up after a further 1 year&#xD;
      in order to find out the impact of the early treatment on the long-term disease outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All efficacy analyses will be performed using intention-to-treat population (ITT). In&#xD;
      addition, the primary and secondary variables will be analysed using the per-protocol&#xD;
      population, which will contain all patients in the ITT population, who also reached Week 48&#xD;
      without any major protocol violations. The safety population, which will contain any patient&#xD;
      who received at least one dose of study drug, will be used for all safety analyses.&#xD;

      Clinical trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, randomized, assessor- blind, multicenter study of safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      combined treatment of methotrexate and glucocorticoids versus glucocorticoids alone in&#xD;
      patients with polymyositis and dermatomyositis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tested investigational medicinal product: Methotrexate (Methotrexatum dinatricum 2,5 mg&#xD;
      tbl.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanism of Action: Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolic acid reductase. Dihydrofolates must&#xD;
      be reduced to tetrahydrofolates by this enzyme before they can be utilized as carriers of&#xD;
      one-carbon groups in the synthesis of purine nucleotides and thymidylate. Therefore,&#xD;
      methotrexate interferes with DNA synthesis, repair, and cellular replication. Actively&#xD;
      proliferating tissues such as malignant cells, bone marrow, fetal cells, buccal and&#xD;
      intestinal mucosa, and cells of the urinary bladder are in general more sensitive to this&#xD;
      effect of methotrexate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparator : Prednison (Prednisonum 20 mg tbl.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanism of Action: Glucocorticoids are naturally occurring hormones that prevent or&#xD;
      suppress inflammation and immune responses when administered at pharmacological doses. At a&#xD;
      molecular level, unbound glucocorticoids readily cross cell membranes and bind with high&#xD;
      affinity to specific cytoplasmic receptors. This binding induces a response by modifying&#xD;
      transcription and, ultimately protein synthesis to achieve the steroid's intended action.&#xD;
      Such actions may include: inhibition of leukocyte infiltration at the site of inflammation,&#xD;
      interference in the function of mediators of inflammatory response, and suppression of&#xD;
      humoral immune responses. Some of the net effects include reduction in edema or scar tissue,&#xD;
      as well as a general suppression in immune response. The degree of clinical effect is&#xD;
      normally related to the dose administered. The antiinflammatory actions of corticosteroids&#xD;
      are thought to involve phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins.&#xD;
      Lipocortins, in turn, control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as&#xD;
      prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of the precursor molecule&#xD;
      arachidonic acid. Likewise, the numerous adverse effects related to corticosteroid use are&#xD;
      usually related to the dose administered and the duration of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients in the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total 50&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In this centre: 10&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to determine the safety and efficacy of adding methotrexate (MTX) to&#xD;
      glucocorticoids (GC) compared with glucocorticoid treatment alone in patients with&#xD;
      inflammatory myopathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. PM and DM are usually treated with glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive drugs. However,&#xD;
           such treatment has not yet been studied thoroughly and properly evaluated in a&#xD;
           randomized controlled trial. There are only few controlled studies of PM/DM management&#xD;
           and all of them have been performed in small groups of patients. This will be the first&#xD;
           randomized controlled trial with MTX&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. This clinical trial will assess efficacy MTX in patients with early PM/DM&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Also long- term effect of treatment (MTX and glucocorticoids versus glucocorticoids)&#xD;
           will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Inclusion criteria allow to follow up the consistent group of PM/DM patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. In this trial the of newly developed tools for myositis disease activity will be used&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The secondary objectives is to study pathogenic aspects of inflammatory myopathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The serum, DNA and RNA will be stored for future genetic studies and to study&#xD;
           autoantibodies to search for prognostic markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety and efficacy of adding&#xD;
      methotrexate (MTX) to glucocorticoids (GC) compared with glucocorticoid treatment alone in&#xD;
      patients with inflammatory myopathies. The primary endpoint that will be measured is the&#xD;
      total dose of glucocorticoids (in mg/kg weight) administered between baseline and the end of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assessment of disease activity and damage [with the use of newly developed tools for&#xD;
           myositis disease activity (MYOACT and MITAX) and myositis damage (MYODAM and MDI), as&#xD;
           well as by global assessment of activity and damage by patients and by physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Muscle strength by manual muscle testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Muscle endurance&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Muscle enzyme levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Glucocorticoid related side-effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Final glucocorticoid dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Disability index by HAQ&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Quality of life by SF-36&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Number of patients with treatment failures&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Search for reliable prognostic parameters in the further prognosis of patients with&#xD;
           inflammatory myopathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study of the pathogenic aspects of inflammatory myopathies. Therefore investigations of&#xD;
      serum, lymphocytes, muscle tissue and MRI will be organized. DNA and RNA will be stored for&#xD;
      future genetic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized, assessor-blinded, multicenter, international study. After being&#xD;
      enrolled in the study, the patients will receive 48 weeks of therapy followed by a 12-month&#xD;
      follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total number of 50 patients with polymyositis/dermatomyositis are planned to be randomized.&#xD;
      These will be equally distributed between the two groups providing 25 patients per treatment&#xD;
      arm. Patients will be randomized on the basis of random numbers generated by a computer&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of active polymyositis and dermatomyositis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy. The efficacy will be assessed by fulfillment of definition of improvement at every&#xD;
      visit and treatment taper with glucocorticoids. Overall efficacy will be assessed by&#xD;
      measurement of disease activity (MITAX, MYOACT), disease damage (MDI, MYODAM), global&#xD;
      patient's and physician's assessments, manual muscle strength test, functional muscle test2,&#xD;
      health assessment questionnaire (HAQ), and SF36.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety will be assessed at every visit by clinical and laboratory examinations.&#xD;
      Specifically, clinical assessment will include physical examination, vital signs, muscle&#xD;
      function index, manual muscle strength test, MYOACT, MITAX, MYODAM, MDI, HAQ and global&#xD;
      assessment of activity and damage by physician and patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory assessments will include complete blood count, blood chemistry including SGOT&#xD;
      (AST), SGPT (ALT), Na, K, creatinine, LDH, CK, CRP and urine pregnancy test if required by&#xD;
      local practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with pulmonary alveolitis or interstitial fibrosis at the start of the study -&#xD;
      HRCT should be performed. If significant progress of pulmonary infiltrate will occur, this is&#xD;
      considered to be treatment failure and patient will be treated according to standard&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary toxicity from methotrexate can be suspected in patients with sudden onset of&#xD;
      nonproductive cough with dyspnea. HRCT should be performed. If there are no other obvious&#xD;
      reasons for these symptoms methotrexate should be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If nausea after methotrexate occurs, try to divide the dose or give antinauseous drug. If&#xD;
      there are still unacceptable gastrointestinal side effects, parenteral methotrexate&#xD;
      administration can be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;

      (i.m.)), once weekly for 48 weeks. There will be a clinically oriented dose escalation&#xD;
      starting from 10 up to 20-25 mg of MTX. Five to ten mg of folic acid will be given 24 hours&#xD;
      after each methotrexate dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prednisone will be administered orally, initially at 1.0 mg/kg/day dosage and then tapered&#xD;
      gradually equally in the two arms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant medication and treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recommended medication- Five to ten mg of folic acid will be given 24 hours after each&#xD;
      methotrexate dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prohibited medication: Other immunosuppressive agents are not allowed. All other medication&#xD;
      is allowed at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study flowchart Controls and visits will be organized: Day 0 (Baseline), in the 2.week, in&#xD;
      the 1.,2., 3. 4., 5., 6., 7., 8., 9. 10. 11. and 12.month (Termination visit), than one year&#xD;
      Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary statistics of the baseline characteristics will be tabulated by treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main population for evaluation will be the ITT (intent- to-treat) population. Summary&#xD;
      statistics (N, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum) will be presented for&#xD;
      each treatment group by visit for the continuous variables. For the categorical variables N&#xD;
      and % will be presented for each treatment group at endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total number of 50 patients with polymyositis/dermatomyositis are planned to be randomized.&#xD;
      These will be equally distributed between the two groups providing 25 patients per treatment&#xD;
      arm. Two-sided tests at the 5% level of significance The primary endpoint that will be&#xD;
      measured is the total dose of glucocorticoids (in mg/kg weight) administered between baseline&#xD;
      and end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between treatment differences will be tested using parametric (t-test) and non-parametric&#xD;
      tests (Mann-Whitney test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary efficacy variables are disease activity and damage measures, which will be&#xD;
      assessed by myositis disease activity assessment tools (MYOACT and MITAX), myositis damage&#xD;
      tools (MYODAM, MDI), and global assessment of activity and damage by patients and by&#xD;
      physician The continuous secondary variables at endpoint will be tested for treatment&#xD;
      differences using parametric (t-test, ANOVA) and non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney test,&#xD;
      Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that at the time of statistical analysis any of the model assumptions are not&#xD;
      met data transformations or alternative methods of analysis will be performed as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The categorical secondary efficacy variables will be tested for treatment differences using&#xD;
      Fischer's exact test.&#xD;
