    <textblock>
      Hip and knee replacement arthroplasty are profoundly successful operative interventions,&#xD;
      however, some joint replacements do fail and the life expectancy of a hip or knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty is finite. This fact has largely been responsible for the continued development&#xD;
      of new devices and techniques for joint arthroplasty surgery. Unfortunately, the introduction&#xD;
      of new technologies and devices is not a benign process, and even subtle changes to existing&#xD;
      implants can have a disastrous effect on patient outcome. The fact that new technologies and&#xD;
      devices can lead to poor results has led some authors to advocate a phased introduction of&#xD;
      new technologies. A key component of the phased introduction approach advocates the use of&#xD;
      roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis (RSA) early in the testing process. RSA is a highly&#xD;
      accurate radiographic technique developed in Lund, Sweden and has for some time been the gold&#xD;
      standard in Europe for assessing the stability of implants within bone. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to utilize RSA to elucidate the migration patterns of the foam metal backed Advance&#xD;
      Knee Arthroplasty components during the first 2 years postoperatively and to determine in&#xD;
      what proportion of cases adequate fixation is achieved. In addition outcome measures will be&#xD;
      recorded to quantify changes in functional status of subjects after surgery and bone mineral&#xD;
      density will be monitored to quantify bone in-growth around the implant. Migration patterns&#xD;
      will be compared to results obtained from previous studies of uncemented and cemented total&#xD;
      knee arthroplasty components conducted at this centre.&#xD;

      Hip and knee replacement arthroplasty are profoundly successful operative interventions,&#xD;
      however, some joint replacements do fail and the life expectancy of a hip or knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty is finite. This fact has largely been responsible for the continued development&#xD;
      of new devices and techniques for joint arthroplasty surgery. Unfortunately, the introduction&#xD;
      of new technologies and devices is not a benign process, and even subtle changes to existing&#xD;
      implants can have a disastrous effect on patient outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fact that new technologies and devices can lead to poor results has led some authors to&#xD;
      advocate a phased introduction of new technologies. A key component of the phased&#xD;
      introduction approach advocates the use of roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis (RSA)&#xD;
      early in the testing process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RSA is a highly accurate radiographic technique developed in Lund, Sweden and has for some&#xD;
      time been the gold standard in Europe for assessing the stability of implants within bone. It&#xD;
      is at least ten times more accurate than conventional radiography. RSA involves the insertion&#xD;
      of small tantalum markers (0.8mm) into the bone and prosthesis at the time of surgery. By&#xD;
      using a calibrated cage with additional markers and simultaneous bi-planar x-rays,&#xD;
      micromotion at the prosthesis-bone interface can be very precisely determined. Two types of&#xD;
      micromotion can be investigated: migration, i.e. gradual motion over time, and inducible&#xD;
      displacement, i.e. instant motion in response to external forces. The pattern of micromotion&#xD;
      exhibited by various prostheses and fixation techniques within the first post-operative year&#xD;
      has been shown to be predictive of the long-term fixation of the component to bone,&#xD;
      especially when considering the tibial prosthesis-bone interface. The value of this precise&#xD;
      radiographic technique is that new technologies and techniques can be introduced in vivo&#xD;
      while limiting their exposure to as few patients as possible. RSA is a proven, safe and&#xD;
      invaluable method for assessing methods of knee component fixation as well as different&#xD;
      design concepts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEXA bone densitometry has been demonstrated as a reliable method for determination bone&#xD;
      mineral density about knee and hip implants. This technique provides further detail about the&#xD;
      quality of fixation of knee and hip prostheses and implant induced bone remodeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The foam metal backed Advance Knee Arthroplasty components utilize a porous titanium coating&#xD;
      on the non-articulating surface of the components to enhance the implant-bone interface. This&#xD;
      3-dimensional scaffold should promote bone in-growth that may provide a more robust&#xD;
      bone-implant interface. The high coefficient of friction provides initial fixation negating&#xD;
      the need for bone cement which should reduce duration of surgery. There is also a version of&#xD;
      the Biofoam Advance that incorporates screwed fixation that allows for augmented fixation&#xD;
      with up to four titanium screws, however, it is not clear that this augmentation is&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implant is based on previous proven designs from Wright Medical such as the Whiteside and&#xD;
      Advance Medial Pivot. It incorporates the polyethylene, tibial tray and stem design from the&#xD;
      Advance Medial Pivot and four stabilizing pegs on the underside of the tibial component that&#xD;
      were used in the Whiteside. Of particular interest is the modularity of the Biofoam design,&#xD;
      both the polyethylene and the tibial stem are attached to the tibial tray intraoperatively&#xD;
      with the stem held in place with a morse taper, potentially providing the surgeon more sizing&#xD;
      and positioning options during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective The purpose of this study is to utilize RSA to elucidate the migration&#xD;
      patterns of the foam metal backed Advance Knee Arthroplasty components during the first 2&#xD;
      years postoperatively and to determine in what proportion of cases adequate fixation is&#xD;
      achieved. In addition outcome measures will be recorded to quantify changes in functional&#xD;
      status of subjects after surgery and bone mineral density will be monitored to quantify bone&#xD;
      in-growth around the implant. Migration patterns will be compared to results obtained from&#xD;
      previous studies of uncemented and cemented total knee arthroplasty components conducted at&#xD;
      this centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is a consecutive sample randomized control trial of patients undergoing&#xD;
      total knee arthroplasty with the foam metal backed Advance Biofoam Knee Arthroplasty system&#xD;
      (Wright Medical Inc.) with and without screws utilizing RSA to identify the migration&#xD;
      patterns of the tibial and femoral components of the implant. DEXA scanning will also be&#xD;
      conducted to determine changes in the bone mineral density adjacent to the implant. Health&#xD;
      status and functional outcome measures will be recorded to quantify functional status of&#xD;
      subjects before surgery and at each follow-up interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statement of research questions Question 1: Is there a difference in fixation to the proximal&#xD;
      tibia between tibial components fixed with screws and those without screws?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no significant difference in micromotion patterns of the foam metal backed&#xD;
      arthroplasty components fixed with screws and those fixed without.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are significant differences in micromotion patterns between the tibial components fixed&#xD;
      with screws and those fixed without.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Question 2: Do the screwed components achieve adequate fixation to the underlying bone?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no significant continuous migration at 2 years with the screwed components&#xD;
      indicating adequate long-term fixation at the implant - bone interface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is significant continuous migration at 2 years with the screwed components indicating&#xD;
      inadequate fixation at the implant - bone interface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Question 3: Do the unscrewed components achieve adequate fixation to the underlying bone?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no significant continuous migration at 2 years with the unscrewed components&#xD;
      indicating adequate long-term fixation at the implant - bone interface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative Hypothesis: There is significant continuous migration at 2 years with the&#xD;
      unscrewed components indicating inadequate fixation at the implant - bone interface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Question 4: What are the migration patterns (translations and rotations) of the foam metal&#xD;
      backed arthroplasty components during the first two years postoperatively and how do they&#xD;
      compare between those fixed with screws and those fixed without screws?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Question 5: For what proportion of implants in each group does migration continue to increase&#xD;
      during the two year follow-up?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Question 6: Is there a significant difference in health status and functional outcome before&#xD;
      and after total knee arthroplasty using foam metal backed arthroplasty components?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Question 7: Are there significant difference in bone mineral density between the operative&#xD;
      knee (distal femur and proximal tibia) and other body sites over time?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects n= 21 per group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allowing for 20% lost to follow-up a total sample size of 50 (25 per group) will be&#xD;
      sufficient to elucidate a significant difference in micromotion (clinically significant&#xD;
      motion defined as ≥ 0.2 mm) between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened consecutively and enrolled from clinic after informed consent has&#xD;
      been obtained. Their vital information and co-morbidities will be recorded from the chart and&#xD;
      functional status will be assessed using the KSCRS, SF-36, WOMAC, Oxford 12 knee score, UCLA&#xD;
      Activity Level, Self-Administered Comorbidity Questionnaire (SCQ), the Pain and&#xD;
      Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) and visual analogue scales for pain and health status. All&#xD;
      information will be kept strictly confidential.&#xD;
