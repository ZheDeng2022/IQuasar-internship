  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that there are no clinically relevant&#xD;
      additive inhibitory effects on the HPA-axis when ciclesonide nasal spray is concomitantly&#xD;
      administered with orally inhaled HFA-BDP. The secondary objectives are to evaluate safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of the combined dosing regimen of orally inhaled HFA-BDP and ciclesonide nasal&#xD;
      spray.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female, 18 - 60 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. General good health, and free of any concomitant conditions or treatment that could&#xD;
             interfere with study conduct, influence the interpretation of study&#xD;
             observations/results, or put the patient at increased risk during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A history of PAR for a minimum of one year immediately preceding the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A demonstrated sensitivity to at least one allergen known to induce PAR through a&#xD;
             standard prick or intradermal test. A positive test is defined as a wheal diameter at&#xD;
             least 3 mm larger than the control wheal for the prick test, and 7 mm or greater than&#xD;
             the control for the intradermal test. Documentation of a positive result within 12&#xD;
             months prior to the Screening Visit is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Females of child-bearing potential are currently taking and will continue to use a&#xD;
             medically reliable method of contraception for the entire study duration (e.g. oral,&#xD;
             injectable, trans-cutaneous or implantable contraceptives or intrauterine devices or&#xD;
             double-barrier protection). Women of childbearing potential, or less than 1 year&#xD;
             postmenopausal, will require a negative plasma pregnancy test at the Screening Visit&#xD;
             as well as at last on-treatment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Capable of understanding the requirements, risks, and benefits of study participation,&#xD;
             and, as judged by the investigator, capable of giving informed consent and compliance&#xD;
             with all study requirements (visits, record keeping, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Normal body weight as evidenced by a Body Mass Index (BMI) between ³ 18 and 31 kg/m²,&#xD;
             and a body weight &gt; 45 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnancy, nursing, or plans to become pregnant or donate gametes (ova or sperm) for&#xD;
             in vitro fertilization during the study period or for 30 days following the study&#xD;
             period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History or physical findings of nasal pathology, including nasal polyps (within the&#xD;
             last 60 days) or other clinically significant respiratory tract malformations, recent&#xD;
             nasal biopsy (within the last 60 days), nasal trauma, or surgery and atrophic rhinitis&#xD;
             or rhinitis medicamentosa (within the last 60 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participation in any investigational drug trial within the 30 days preceding the&#xD;
             Screening Visit (S0).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A known hypersensitivity to any corticosteroid or any of the excipients in the&#xD;
             formulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History or current evidence of clinically relevant allergies or idiosyncrasy to drugs&#xD;
             or food.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of alcohol or drug abuse within the preceding two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of a positive test for HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Use of any prohibited concomitant medications within the prescribed (per protocol)&#xD;
             withdrawal periods prior to the Screening Visit (S0) and during entire study duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Previous participation in an intranasal ciclesonide study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Non-vaccinated exposure to or active infection with, chickenpox or measles within the&#xD;
             21 days preceding the Screening Visit (S0).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Exposure to corticosteroids for any indication, chronic or intermittent (e.g.: asthma,&#xD;
             contact dermatitis), during the past 2 months, or presence of an underlying condition&#xD;
             that can reasonably be expected to require treatment with corticosteroids during the&#xD;
             course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Use of topical corticosteroids in concentrations in excess of the equivalent of 1%&#xD;
             hydrocortisone for dermatological conditions during the past 1 month, or presence of&#xD;
             an underlying condition that can reasonably be expected to require treatment with such&#xD;
             preparations during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Clinically relevant abnormalities in clinical chemical, hematological or any other&#xD;
             laboratory variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Chronic or clinically relevant acute infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Vegetarian diet or other unusual dietary habits that would preclude the subject's&#xD;
             acceptance of standardized meals.&#xD;
&#xD;

             during the daylight hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Active asthma requiring treatment with inhaled or systemic corticosteroids;&#xD;
             intermittent use of beta agonists is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. History of a respiratory infection or disorder [including, but not limited to&#xD;
             bronchitis, pneumonia, the common cold, acute or chronic sinusitis, flu, severe acute&#xD;
             respiratory syndrome (SARS)] within the 14 days preceding the Screening Visit (S0), or&#xD;
             development of a respiratory infection during the Run-in Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Use of antibiotic therapy for acute conditions within 14 days prior to the Screening&#xD;
             Visit (S0). Low doses of antibiotics taken for prophylaxis are permitted if the&#xD;
             therapy was started prior to the Screening Visit (S0) AND is expected to continue&#xD;
             throughout the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Initiation of immunotherapy during the study period or dose escalation during the&#xD;
             study period. However, initiation of immunotherapy 90 days or more prior to the&#xD;
             Screening Visit (S0) AND use of a stable (maintenance) dose (30 days or more) may be&#xD;
             considered for inclusion.&#xD;
