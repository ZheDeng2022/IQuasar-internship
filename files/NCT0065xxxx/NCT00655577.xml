      The significance of this population-based study is in producing new information for planning&#xD;
      interventions and rehabilitation programs for the elderly, planning education of health care&#xD;
      personnel and planning national health education programs for different age groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of an epidemiological cross-sectional study and a randomized controlled&#xD;
      intervention study. The study population consisted of all the 1689 home-dwelling women born&#xD;
      during 1924-1927 residing in Oulu, Northern Finland, who were asked to a screening visit&#xD;
      including bone mineral density (BMD) measurement of the distal radius in 1997. 1222 women&#xD;
      attended the clinic and were afterwards mailed a postal questionnaire focusing on lifelong&#xD;
      risk factors for osteoporosis, e.g. the amount of physical activity at work and during&#xD;
      leisure time, daily intake of calcium and use of alcohol and cigarettes. Those with BMD value&#xD;
      more than 20% lower than the reference value, underwent a densitometry of the hip. All women&#xD;
      with femoral neck BMD more than 20% below the reference value (n=160) were randomly selected&#xD;
      to either exercise (n=84) or control (n=76) group. At baseline and after that annually during&#xD;
      the 30-month intervention, balance, muscle strength, aerobic capacity, walking speed,&#xD;
      cognitive functions and mood are measured from all the participants. Hip BMD will be measured&#xD;
      annually. The exercise group participates in a supervised training program with weekly&#xD;
      sessions from the beginning of October to the end of April. In addition to the supervised&#xD;
      sessions the participants train daily at home. From April to October the exercises are&#xD;
      performed purely at home. The training regimen consists of balance, strength and impact&#xD;
      exercises. The intervention group keeps diary of their daily physical activity. The number&#xD;
      and severity of falls are recorded from both the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to identify factors accounting for low BMD in elderly home-dwelling women with severe&#xD;
           osteopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to evaluate how supervised regular weight-bearing exercise program affects BMD in&#xD;
           elderly home-dwelling women with severe osteopenia&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to evaluate how supervised regular balance and muscle training affects balance and&#xD;
           muscle strength in elderly home-dwelling women with severe osteopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In addition the aim is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. study how regular supervised exercise affects the incidence and severity of falls, mood&#xD;
           and cognitive functions in women with severe osteopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and research methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis is that long-term supervised, mainly home- based regular impact-type and&#xD;
      balance and muscle exercises can improve balance and muscle strength of lower extremities and&#xD;
      maintain bone mass in elderly women. We also hypothesize that the incidence of falls is lower&#xD;
      in the exercise group than in the controls and that the falls are more injurious in the&#xD;
      control group than in the intervention group during the follow-up period&#xD;
