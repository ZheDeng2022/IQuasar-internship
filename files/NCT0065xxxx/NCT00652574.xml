  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn how dasatinib affects biomarker levels&#xD;
      in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma that may be able to be removed by surgery.&#xD;
      The safety and effectiveness of this drug will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is financially supported by the United States Department of Defense.&#xD;

      The Study Drug Dasatinib is designed to decrease the activity of one or more proteins that&#xD;
      are responsible for the uncontrolled growth of tumor cells. This may cause the tumor cells to&#xD;
      die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take 2 dasatinib tablets&#xD;
      by mouth 2 times a day for the 4 weeks before surgery (in the morning and 12 hours later).&#xD;
      Dasatinib may be taken with or without food, but should be swallowed with at least 1 cup (8&#xD;
      ounces) of water. A light meal is not required, but may help you avoid getting a stomach ache&#xD;
      when you take your dose. Tablets must be swallowed whole and may not be broken. If vomiting&#xD;
      occurs within 30 minutes of swallowing the tablet(s), you can take another dose. If you miss&#xD;
      a dose of dasatinib, take it as soon as you remember on the same day. If you miss taking your&#xD;
      dose for 12 hours, take your regular dose the next scheduled day (do not take double your&#xD;
      regular dose to make up for the missed dose). You will be given a &quot;pill diary&quot; to write down&#xD;
      when you take the study drug. You will be shown how to fill it out and asked to bring the&#xD;
      diary with you to each clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 21 and 28, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will also have a test to check the amount of oxygen in your blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a performance status evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check your how well your blood clots.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a PET scan to check the status of the disease. This PET scan will be&#xD;
           before your surgery, the study doctor will tell you when this will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you have taken dasatinib for 28 days, you will have surgery to remove the tumor. You&#xD;
      will continue to take the dasatinib until midnight the night before the surgery. Depending on&#xD;
      the status of the disease, you will have either a pleurectomy or extrapleural pneumonectomy.&#xD;
      You will be given a separate consent for these procedures, which will describe the surgery&#xD;
      and any risks in detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pleurectomy is the surgical procedure to remove the parietal pleura (the outermost lining&#xD;
      around the lungs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An extrapleural pneumonectomy is a surgical procedure that removes portions of the lung, the&#xD;
      parietal pleura (the lining of the lung), the pericardium (the lining of the heart), and the&#xD;
      diaphragm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During surgery, 5-6 core biopsies, if possible, will be taken from different areas of the&#xD;
      tumor for biomarker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the CT-guided core biopsy of the lung, a tissue sample is withdrawn from an organ or&#xD;
      suspected tumor mass using a very thin needle and a syringe. The needle is guided while being&#xD;
      viewed by the physician on a CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, your doctor will decide the type of treatment you should receive for your&#xD;
      condition. If the disease responded well to the 4 weeks of dasatinib, you may be eligible to&#xD;
      continue taking dasatinib once a day starting 4-6 weeks after your surgery. The doctor may&#xD;
      also decide that you can take dasatinib once a day starting 4-6 weeks after receiving&#xD;
      radiation therapy. You may continue to take dasatinib as long as you are benefitting. You&#xD;
      will be taken off study if intolerable side effects occur or the disease gets worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you continue to receive the study drug after surgery, you will have a physical exam and a&#xD;
      PET or CT scan every 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are taken off study for any reason, you will continue to be followed by the study team&#xD;
      to see how you are doing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Dasatinib is an investigational agent and ongoing clinical&#xD;
      trials are using this drug in malignant mesothelioma. However, these studies have only&#xD;
      recently started, and there is no information so far that shows the drug is effective in&#xD;
      malignant mesothelioma. Dasatinib is FDA approved and commercially available for the&#xD;
      treatment of acute lymphoid and chronic myeloid leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, its use in this research study is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 60 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
