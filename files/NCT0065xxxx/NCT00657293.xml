    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic lung disease often report shortness of breath when they use their arms&#xD;
      for simple activities of daily living such as dressing, lifting, shaving, bathing and&#xD;
      brushing their hair and teeth. The best type of arm training for these patients is still&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  develop a feasible and safe arm training program (ATP) for these patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  examine the effects of this ATP on quality of life, arm function, arm exercise capacity&#xD;
           and symptoms during activities of daily living;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  examine the effects of ATP on breathing responses during arm exercises.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common condition throughout Canada and the&#xD;
      rest of the world. Patients with COPD often describe of breathlessness that makes it&#xD;
      difficult for them to participate in physical activity. Specifically, patients often report&#xD;
      shortness of breath when they use their arms for simple activities of daily living such as&#xD;
      dressing, lifting and bathing. Exercise training has been shown to reduce breathlessness in&#xD;
      people with COPD. Compared with studies that have looked at the effects of exercise using the&#xD;
      leg muscles, studies that focus on training the arm muscles in people with COPD are sparse.&#xD;
      Although earlier work shows that arm training increases arm exercise capacity, the effects on&#xD;
      other measures such as breathlessness are not clear. Therefore, the objectives of this study&#xD;
      are; (i) to develop a feasible and safe arm training program (ATP) for patients with COPD&#xD;
      based on the best available evidence, (ii) to examine the effectiveness of this ATP on&#xD;
      breathlessness during activities of daily living, health-related quality of life, arm&#xD;
      function and arm exercise capacity, (iii) to examine the physiological mechanisms&#xD;
      underpinning any change in these outcomes in response to the ATP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with COPD will be assigned by chance to either a treatment or control group. All&#xD;
      patients in both groups will complete the 6-week pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program that&#xD;
      is well-established at our centre (West Park). During this program all patients will complete&#xD;
      leg exercises, such as walking or cycling, and receive education about how to best manage&#xD;
      their disease. In addition to this PR program, the treatment group will complete a specific&#xD;
      ATP involving overhead arm exercises and free weights. The control group will undergo a&#xD;
      &quot;sham&quot; ATP consisting of finger exercises. Before and after the ATP we will collect measures&#xD;
      of; (i) breathlessness during activities of daily living, fatigue and quality of life, (ii)&#xD;
      arm exercise capacity, (iii) arm function and, (iv) arm muscle force. During the tests of arm&#xD;
      exercise capacity a special machine (breathing-gas analysis system) will be worn.&#xD;
      Measurements will be compared between the treatment and control groups before, immediately&#xD;
      after the ATP and also 3 months after completing the ATP.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will undergo a specific arm training program (ATP) three times a week for the duration of the 6 week program. The ATP will consist predominantly of resistance exercises. Muscle groups targeted during the ATP will include deltoid, biceps and triceps, pectoralis and latissimus. Subjects will train using multi station gym equipment and free weights.</description>

    <intervention_name>Purdue pegboard test (sham)</intervention_name>
    <description>In an attempt to make the groups comparable in terms of attention, the control group will perform the purdue pegboard test of finger dexterity. The tasks will be performed in a sitting position with the arms supported on a table. This test will consist of 4 timed tasks where as many pins as possible will be placed on a pegboard in a given time. Performance of the pegboard test is likely to improve with practice which may serve to motivate the patients to continue practicing over the 6-week period. Subjects will perform this activity 3 times per week with supervision provided by a physiotherapist.</description>
