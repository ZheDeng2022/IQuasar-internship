  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ascent to altitude lowers oxygen saturation. In addition, sleep lowers oxygen saturation at&#xD;
      any altitude. In a prior study, we observed that sleep at 8000 feet resulted in pronounced&#xD;
      reduction in oxygen saturation, but did not result in reduced post sleep neurobehavioral&#xD;
      performance or impaired sleep quality or quantity. We plan to do a more sophisticated&#xD;
      physiological evaluation of the respiratory mechanisms responsible for the reduced oxygen&#xD;
      saturation and determine if there are any adverse consequences to this level of intermittent&#xD;
      hypoxia. We anticipate that central respiratory apnea is the physiologic mechanism, and that&#xD;
      there will not be persistent changes in autonomic nervous activity measured by heart rate&#xD;
      variability.&#xD;

      This study has 6 primary objectives/hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Replicate findings of earlier study in which no effects of altitude were observed on&#xD;
           post sleep neurobehavioral performance, sleep quantity or quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine if sleep at 6000 feet has effects similar to sleep at 8000 feet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identify if central or obstructive apnea is responsible for the reduction in oxygen&#xD;
           saturation observed during sleep at 8000 feet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine if respiratory abnormalities observed at 6000 feet are similar but less severe&#xD;
           than at 8000 feet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Determine if there are individual differences in respiratory physiology at sea level&#xD;
           that enable prediction of pronounced respiratory disturbances during sleep at altitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Determine if changes in autonomic nervous activity, measured by heart rate variability,&#xD;
           occur, and if so, do they persist for 8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty healthy males between 30 and 60 years of age whose baseline apnea-hypopnea index is&#xD;
      less than 15/hour will be recruited from the general population surrounding Burnaby, British&#xD;
      Columbia, Canada. Women are excluded because of the changes in sleep structure associated&#xD;
      with the menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be involved in the blinded crossover study for a 14 day period during which&#xD;
      time they will monitor their sleep by actigraphy and sleep diaries, will spend 2 nights an&#xD;
      altitude chamber at Simon Fraser University at ambient barometric pressure to become adapted&#xD;
      to sleeping in that environment, then spend 3 study nights, each followed by 2 rest nights,&#xD;
      sleeping at barometric pressures equivalent to sea level, 6000 feet, and 8000 feet. The order&#xD;
      of exposures will be randomly balanced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre study physiologic measures will include hypoxic ventilatory response, hypercapnic&#xD;
      ventilatory response, and during one of the adaptation nights, apnea hypoxia index. Study&#xD;
      sessions will consist of a 4 hour presleep period, a 6 hour sleep period, and a 1 hour post&#xD;
      sleep period at the study barometric pressure. During the study sessions, heart rate, SpO2,&#xD;
      polysomnographic measures, nasal air flow rates, and chest motion will be monitored and&#xD;
      recorded. Psychomotor Vigilance Task response time will be measured before and after the&#xD;
      sleep period. Heart rate will be recorded by ambulatory recording equipment for 8 hours&#xD;
      following return to ambient barometric pressure conditions. This will be analyzed to&#xD;
      determine if changes in heart rate variability are persistent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes of primary interest will include total sleep time, duration of sleep stages, oxygen&#xD;
      saturation, heart rate and heart rate variability, respiratory rates, air flow, and chest&#xD;
      motion to assess if central or obstructive apnea is temporally related to reductions in&#xD;
      oxygen saturation.&#xD;
