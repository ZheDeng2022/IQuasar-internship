  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical research study of an experimental new medication, Menadione Topical Lotion&#xD;
      (MTL). The study lotion is experimental and has not been approved for public use. Hana&#xD;
      Biosciences, Inc., the company that is developing MTL, is the sponsor of this study. EGFR&#xD;
      inhibitors are used to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), pancreatic cancer,&#xD;
      colorectal cancer, breast cancer and head and neck cancer. One of the side effects of EFGR&#xD;
      inhibitors is skin toxicities including an acneform skin rash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a Phase 1 study. The main purposes of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of Menadione Topical Lotion as an emergent and&#xD;
           pre-emergent treatment for EGFR inhibitor-associated rash&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the systemic absorption and bioavailability of Menadione Topical Lotion as an&#xD;
           emergent and pre-emergent treatment for EGFR inhibitor-associated rash&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned that up to 24 patients undergoing EGFR inhibitor therapy will take part in this&#xD;
      study at multiple clinical centers.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria are not eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A skin examination reveals the presence of any active disease (e.g., eczema), tattoos&#xD;
             or other problems, such as open lesions, that could make the application site&#xD;
             unacceptable for study drug lotion application, located on the face/neck and/or upper&#xD;
             chest that, in the Investigator's opinion, could confound the evaluation of the rash;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any clinically significant safety laboratory or diagnostic results that, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the Investigator, would place the subject at undue risk if the subject were&#xD;

             the subject at undue risk if the subject were to participate in the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Undergoing any current treatment for cancer other than the prescribed EGFRI that in&#xD;
             the opinion of the Investigator, would place the subject at undue risk if the subject&#xD;
             were to participate in the study;&#xD;
