  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use an eye imaging test called high speed indocyanine green angiography&#xD;
      (HS-ICG), which examines leaky vessels in the eye, to try to find out why individuals respond&#xD;
      differently to ranibizumab (Lucentis) treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration&#xD;
      (AMD). The drug was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat this&#xD;
      disease, but the response to the treatment varies markedly among individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 50 years of age and older with wet AMD and vision that meets the research protocol&#xD;
      criteria may be eligible for this study. Participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ranibizumab injections in the study eye once a month for 4 months. Additional injections are&#xD;
      given only if the study eye shows signs of bleeding or leaking fluid. The eye is numbed&#xD;
      before the injection and the eye area is cleaned with an antiseptic. Antibiotic drops are&#xD;
      used for 3 days following the injection to prevent infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic visits once a month for 2 years for evaluations to monitor the response to treatment.&#xD;
      The evaluations may include the following examinations and tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye examination with dilation, optical coherence tomography and photography: The&#xD;
           examination measures visual acuity, thickness of your retina (the back of the eye)&#xD;
           andeye pressure. Bright lights will also be used so that the doctor can see the back of&#xD;
           your eye. Photographs of the eye may be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluorescein angiography to examine the blood vessels in the eye: A dye called&#xD;
           fluorescein is injected into a vein in the arm. The dye travels through the veins to the&#xD;
           blood vessels in the eyes. A camera takes pictures of the dye as it flows through the&#xD;
           blood vessels. This test is done eight times during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indocyanine green angiography to examine the blood vessels in the eye: The procedure is&#xD;
           the same as for fluorescein angiography, but it uses a dye called indocyanine green.&#xD;
           This test is done once a month for the first year of the study and then every 3 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness among&#xD;
      elderly in the United States.1 Ranibizumab, an inhibitor of all forms of vascular endothelial&#xD;
      growth factor (VEGF), is the first FDA-approved treatment for AMD that significantly improves&#xD;
      vision in a quarter to a third of patients and maintains or improves vision in greater than&#xD;
      90% of patients. Ranibizumab decreases the vasopermeability as measured by decreased leakage&#xD;
      and fluid on fluorescein (FA) and optical coherence tomography. However, the effect of&#xD;
      ranibizumab on the structure and hemodynamics of the choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in&#xD;
      AMD, as measured with high-speed indocyanine green angiography (HS-ICG), is not known. The&#xD;
      effect or lack of effect on the physical structure of the CNV may help explain the&#xD;
      variability of injection frequencies and visual responses among different patients. Since&#xD;
      anti-VEGF therapy is designed to inhibit exudative CNV, it is clinically important to develop&#xD;
      a standard reproducible method to assess HS-ICG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this observational study, our primary objective is to assess whether induction/pro re nata&#xD;
      (Induction/PRN) 0.5 mg intravitreal ranibizumab-based treatment for neovascular AMD decreases&#xD;
      the size and pattern of the CNV as measured on HS-ICG, as opposed to simply decreasing&#xD;
      leakage and fluid as seen on FA and OCT. Although combination therapy is likely the standard&#xD;
      treatment for AMD in the future, participants will not be allowed to receive other AMD&#xD;
      experimental agents (e.g., immunosuppressive drugs) for either the study or fellow eye while&#xD;
      on this study. In consultation with various reading centers, we will attempt to develop a&#xD;
      reproducible schema for evaluation of HS-ICG by reviewing pre-treatment and post-treatment&#xD;
      HS-ICGs. The grading system development is a secondary objective to achieve a better&#xD;
      understanding of anatomical and functional results and an important task for future research.&#xD;
      In this study, the first 10 cases will be used to attempt to develop a reproducible grading&#xD;
      system. The NEI retina group will review these ICGs and attempt to identify gradable aspects&#xD;
      of the lesions that are consistently present on the ICGs. During this time we will continue&#xD;
      to collect additional cases for evaluation. The grading system proposed from the first 10&#xD;
      cases will be implemented in the next 10 cases. There will be two independent gradings for&#xD;
      each ICG. The results of this dual grading will then be reviewed and problematic areas of&#xD;
      grading will be identified. The grading system will be modified based on this experience and&#xD;
      reproducibility of the modified grading system will be assessed by re-grading the images in a&#xD;
      masked fashion. The modified grading system will be utilized in the next 10 cases. This&#xD;
      iterative process will be continued until we have either developed a reproducible and useful&#xD;
      grading system or completed the full participant analysis. Another important secondary&#xD;
      objective is to examine whether an increased dose of 1 mg of intravitreal ranibizumab-based&#xD;
      treatment (administered as 1 mg monthly or 0.5 mg bi-monthly) will decrease leakage and fluid&#xD;
      as seen on FA and OCT and/or decrease the size and pattern of CNV on HS-ICG for participants&#xD;
      not becoming fluid-free on the standard dose.&#xD;
