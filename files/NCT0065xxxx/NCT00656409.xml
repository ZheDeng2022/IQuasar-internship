  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT) is an autosomal recessive inherited condition caused by mutations&#xD;
      in the ATM gene1. Patients suffer from neuro-degenerative problems, usually commencing in the&#xD;
      second year of life, and affecting predominantly the cerebellum. They also develop the&#xD;
      characteristic superficial telangiectases. Between 60 and 80% of affected children are&#xD;
      immunodeficient. This is associated with deficiency of immunoglobulin A (IgA ) 2, of IgG23&#xD;
      and of antibody responses to pneumococcal polysaccharides4. Patients suffer recurrent&#xD;
      sino-pulmonary infections but a recent study suggests poor correlation between immune status&#xD;
      and immunological parameters5. If uncontrolled, recurrent pulmonary infections can contribute&#xD;
      to the development of chronic lung disease and bronchiectasis. Preventative management&#xD;
      includes continuous prophylactic antibiotic treatment in some with the need for replacement&#xD;
      immunoglobulin therapy in only a small proportion of cases. Antibiotics have been reasonably&#xD;
      effective in this situation but the emergence of resistance amongst community acquired&#xD;
      pneumococcal isolates is a cause for concern. Appropriate immunisation strategies may also&#xD;
      have a role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to look at antibody responses in a one versus two dose regimen in a&#xD;
      cohort of AT patients recruited through the AT Society a national charitable organisation&#xD;
      involved in providing support to families with this condition and in fostering education and&#xD;
      research in the field.&#xD;
