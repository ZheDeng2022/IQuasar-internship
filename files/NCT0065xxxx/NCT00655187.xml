  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Rotarix™ vaccine in the general population&#xD;
      in Singapore by monitoring the overall reduction in RV SGE and also by assessing the direct&#xD;
      protection offered by the vaccine in hospitalised infants through a case-control study.&#xD;

        Children less than 5 years of age, hospitalised with acute GE, living in Singapore served&#xD;
        by the hospital participating in the study (KK Hospital) and whose parents/ guardians are&#xD;
        willing to provide informed consent, will be considered as cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cases will be limited to those subjects who are born after 1 November 2005, aged at least&#xD;
        16 weeks and whose stool samples have been tested positive for rotavirus (RV).&#xD;
&#xD;
        For each case, two controls hospitalised for acute disease with non-GE causes in the same&#xD;
        hospital during the same period, will be included in the study after matching them by date&#xD;
        of birth.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria for surveillance subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A male or female child aged &lt; 60 months at the time of admission (a child becomes&#xD;
             ineligible on the day of its fifth birthday).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject admitted with acute GE as an inpatient to the study site during the study&#xD;
             period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent obtained from the parent or guardian of the subject.&#xD;
             Selection criteria for cases&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cases will be limited to those surveillance subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  who are born after 1 November 2005 (date of availability of Rotarix™ vaccination in&#xD;
             Singapore),&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  who are aged at least 16 weeks at the time of hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  whose stool samples are tested positive for RV. Selection criteria for controls&#xD;
&#xD;
        All controls must satisfy the following criteria at study entry:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Admitted for acute disease with non-GE causes in the same hospital as the case , with&#xD;
             the closest admission date to the cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aged at least 16 weeks at the time of hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Born within a range of ± 2 weeks from the date of birth of cases. In case there is no&#xD;
             suitable match, then the range would be extended to ± 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject's parents/guardians.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        For enrolment of surveillance subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following criteria should be checked at the time of study entry. If any apply, the&#xD;
        subject must not be included in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The diagnoses at admission to the study site do not include acute GE.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children for whom stool samples are not available up to 48 hours after admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The onset of GE is after 48 hours of admission to the hospital (i.e. nosocomial GE).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children with a history of chronic and genetic diseases. For selection of cases&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition to the exclusion criteria for surveillance subjects, cases will not be selected&#xD;
        if the following criterion applies:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who had a previous episode of acute GE less than a week back i.e. recurrent&#xD;
             GE episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have been already enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects whose vaccination history could not be ascertained. For selection of controls&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following criteria should be checked at the time of study entry. If any apply, the&#xD;
        controls must not be included in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child who has symptoms of GE on the day of interview of his/her parent or guardian or&#xD;
             had an episode of GE within 14 days prior to the day of interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child who has been already enrolled in the study as case or control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The onset of GE occurs after admission at the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child whose vaccination history could not be ascertained.&#xD;
