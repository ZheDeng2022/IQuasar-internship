  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of PROBE is to evaluate the feasibility and potential utility of three&#xD;
      markers (alpha-synuclein, transcriptomic profiles and olfactory function) to determine the&#xD;
      risk or prognosis of PD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PROBE will test three biomarkers in PD subjects and controls to determine their feasibility&#xD;
      and potential utility as markers of risk and prognosis for PD. This is a case control study,&#xD;
      in which PD subjects will be compared to neurologically healthy controls and disease controls&#xD;
      (MSA and PSP). The blood biomarker samples will be drawn once to evaluate blood&#xD;
      alpha-synuclein levels as well as collection of lymphocyte mass for array analysis. Olfaction&#xD;
      will be measured using the UPSIT for all subjects. The UPSIT will be conducted as part of&#xD;
      PostCEPT for PD subjects and will only be repeated in this study for PD subjects in not done&#xD;
      within 6 months. Control subjects may also choose to submit a blood specimen for processing&#xD;
      and storage at the Coriell Institute for Medical Research, a research resource supported by&#xD;
      the NINDS Human Genetics Resource Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up of the PD population over a 3-year period will allow us to evaluate the prognosis&#xD;
      for important motor aspects of PD that will occur frequently in this cohort. These&#xD;
      complications of PD include motor complications, postural instability, and non-motor&#xD;
      impairment such as cognitive decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy and disease control subjects may give permission at the Baseline visit to be&#xD;
      contacted and followed in the previously established PSG FOUND study using mail and telephone&#xD;
      contact to assess clinical status. Participation in the FOUND study provides another&#xD;
      mechanism to maintain contact with subjects and collect supplemental data beyond that&#xD;
      collected at the PROBE Baseline visit.&#xD;
