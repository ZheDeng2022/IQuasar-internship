  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) is consistently over expressed in most fibrotic&#xD;
      diseases and displays a variety of profibrotic effects in fibroblasts. Activation of TGF-β&#xD;
      receptors induces the activation of several kinase signalling cascades leading to the&#xD;
      phosphorylation of SMAD proteins as well as to the activation of SMAD-independent kinases&#xD;
      that collectively activate ECM synthesis and fibroblast growth and differentiation into&#xD;
      myofibroblasts. TGF-β1 is one of the main mediators in the fibrotic process, associated to&#xD;
      both scarring and a long list of pathologies related to chronic inflammation and which affect&#xD;
      all type of organs and tissues. An increase in TGF-β1 mRNA and protein levels has been&#xD;
      described in these processes. Peptide 144 (P144) is the acetic salt of a 14mer peptide from&#xD;
      human TGF-β1 type III receptor (betaglycan). P144 TGF-β1-inhibitor has been specifically&#xD;
      designed to block the interaction between TGF-β1 and TGF-β1 type III receptor, thus blocking&#xD;
      its biological effects. P144 has shown significant antifibrotic activity in mice receiving&#xD;
      repeated subcutaneous injections of bleomycin, a widely accepted animal model of human&#xD;
      scleroderma, and could contribute to the development. The purpose of this study is to assess&#xD;
      the tolerability and safety of topical application of P144 in healthy volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three different formulations of DIGNA P144 cream (containing 100 μg/mL, 200 μg/mL and 300&#xD;
      μg/mL) will be tested in healthy volunteers. Tolerability evaluation is performed through the&#xD;
      specific cutaneous tolerability visual scale of Frosch and Kligman. Safety assessment is&#xD;
      carried out by studying vital signs, physical examination, by performing laboratory tests,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram and reporting any adverse events experienced. This is the first time that&#xD;
      P144 will be administered in humans. The topical route has been chosen since the indication&#xD;
      for which P144 is going to be clinically developed will be cutaneous sclerosis associated to&#xD;
      scleroderma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic sclerosis or scleroderma is a multisystemic disorder characterized by the excessive&#xD;
      synthesis and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins that result in the fibrosis of skin&#xD;
      and visceral organs (including gastrointestinal tract, lungs, heart and kidneys).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of scleroderma is complex and still poorly understood, but major pathways&#xD;
      involved in the development of the condition are microvascular and immunological&#xD;
      abnormalities, as well as dysregulation of fibroblast activity. One of the key molecules&#xD;
      involved in the pathogenesis of skin fibrosis is the TGF-β1; TGF-β1 is a cytokine directly&#xD;
      responsible for fibroblasts proliferation and collagen and extracellular matrix&#xD;
      overproduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The affected skin of patients with systemic sclerosis gradually becomes firm, thickened and&#xD;
      eventually tightly bound to underlying subcutaneous tissue (indurative phase). It loses hair,&#xD;
      oil, and sweat glands becoming dry and coarse. Changes begin distally in the extremities and&#xD;
      advance proximally. Lesions develop over a period of time varying from months to a few years.&#xD;
      In patients with limited scleroderma, only the skin of fingers, hands, face and lower arms&#xD;
      and legs is affected. On the contrary, patients with the diffuse cutaneous disease, skin&#xD;
      changes will become generalized, involving initially the extremities and followed by the face&#xD;
      and trunk. Rapid progression of these changes over a 2 to 3 year period is usually associated&#xD;
      with a greater risk of visceral disease. After several years of disease, the skin may soften&#xD;
      and return to normal thickness or become thin and atrophic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no approved specific treatment for skin fibrosis in systemic sclerosis&#xD;
      neither in the European Union nor the United States of America. P144 belongs to a peptide&#xD;
      family that is able to inhibit TGF-β1 in both in vitro and in vivo models characterized by&#xD;
      excessive TGF-β1 function. Topical application of P144 exerts a preventive effect precluding&#xD;
      the induction of skin fibrosis and the accumulation of collagen in these animals and also has&#xD;
      shown its therapeutic properties reducing the skin fibrosis and soluble collagen content in&#xD;
      mice with established fibrosis.&#xD;
