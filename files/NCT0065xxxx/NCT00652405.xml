    <textblock>
      Moderate alcohol consumption has consistently been associated with lowered risk of developing&#xD;
      type two diabetes mellitus compared to abstainers and heavy drinkers. However, the underlying&#xD;
      mechanism for the lower risk of type two diabetes is not clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: moderate alcohol consumption for four weeks changes gene expression pathways of&#xD;
      inflammatory status, insulin sensitivity and lipid and carbohydrate metabolism in adipose&#xD;
      tissue in both lean and obese postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Oral sensory stimulation by means of alcohol in the oral cavity will induce a&#xD;
      cephalic phase reflex as indicated by increased autonomic &amp; endocrine responses in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Moderate alcohol consumption has consistently been associated with lowered risk of developing&#xD;
      type two diabetes mellitus compared to abstainers and heavy drinkers. However, the&#xD;
      physiological mechanism for this is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two potential mechanisms will be investigated in this study to explain the findings from&#xD;
      observational studies: One concerning more acute changes upon alcohol consumption (cephalic&#xD;
      phase reflex) which could explain the observed improvement in postprandial glycemia after&#xD;
      alcohol consumption; the other has to do with metabolic changes after more prolonged moderate&#xD;
      alcohol consumption in gene expression of adipose tissue which might lead to improved insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity. Both mechanisms will be discussed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cephalic phase reflex Mere exposure to smell, sight, taste and textural attributes of foods&#xD;
      elicits myriad digestive, endocrinologic, thermogenic, cardiovascular and renal responses.&#xD;
      These responses are rapid (generally occurring in minutes of sensory stimulation), small&#xD;
      (relative to the magnitude achieved when food is actually being metabolized) and transient&#xD;
      (retuning to baseline levels within minutes). They are termed pre-absorptive or cephalic&#xD;
      phase reflexes/responses (CPR) and refer to a set of food intake-associated autonomic and&#xD;
      endocrine responses to the stimulation of sensory systems mainly located in the oropharyngeal&#xD;
      cavity. Their function may be essential adaptive, preparing the digestive system for the&#xD;
      reception, digestion and absorption of ingested nutrients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The release of cephalic phase hormones occurs through activation of vagal efferent fibers in&#xD;
      response to food-related sensory stimuli. Pancreatic polypeptide (PP) is a hormone almost&#xD;
      exclusively under vagal control increases. Thus, the cephalic phase PP response is a&#xD;
      sensitive indicator of vagal activation to food stimuli. PP levels rise up to 100% above&#xD;
      baseline when individuals taste, chew and expectorate food while the magnitude of cephalic&#xD;
      phase insulin release is relatively small (25% above baseline). The cephalic phase is by some&#xD;
      considered as a reflex rather then a response as it is dependent on neural rather than&#xD;
      nutrient-induced stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physiological significance of the cephalic phase hormonal responses is demonstrated by&#xD;
      experimental manipulations which inhibit or bypass cephalic phase insulin release. Under&#xD;
      these circumstances, hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia are evident.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alcohol consumption lowers postprandial glucose concentrations and improves insulin&#xD;
      secretion. Furthermore, alcohol consumption increases postprandial diet-induced&#xD;
      thermogenesis, heart rate and causes diuresis presumably resulting from inhibition of&#xD;
      vasopressin. Since in the postprandial state, almost all cephalic phase responses are&#xD;
      affected by alcohol, it seems plausible that the human body might exhibit a CPR upon oral&#xD;
      sensory stimulation by alcohol-containing beverages. This study therefore investigates for&#xD;
      the first time if and to what extent alcohol triggers CPR which may account for the improved&#xD;
      postprandial glycemia seen after alcohol consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gene expression in adipose tissue Application of transcriptomics technology, via gene&#xD;
      expression profiling, with the use of microarrays is a powerful but expensive tool for&#xD;
      identifying molecular pathways responsible for metabolic regulation. Gene expression&#xD;
      profiling in human intervention studies, allows for genome wide screening of the effects of&#xD;
      specific diets or nutrients and results in biomarker profiles. Recently, it has been used to&#xD;
      detect new important signaling pathways involved in glucose and lipid metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adipose tissue has important metabolic and endocrine functions. Changes in these functions&#xD;
      are associated with an increased low-grade inflammatory state and with chronic diseases such&#xD;
      as obesity and diabetes. Furthermore, changes in gene expression profiles of subcutaneous&#xD;
      adipose tissue can be observed after nutritional interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important hormone almost exclusively and abundantly secreted by adipose tissue is&#xD;
      adiponectin. Circulating adiponectin levels in lean persons are far above any other hormone.&#xD;
      It is believed that these high levels of adiponectin protect lean persons while its decrease&#xD;
      in obesity is associated with a low grade inflammation and the development of insulin&#xD;
      resistance and diabetes. Research by our group has shown that moderate alcohol consumption&#xD;
      increases both plasma levels and mRNA adiponectin levels. This suggests that moderate alcohol&#xD;
      consumption, directly or indirectly, exerts effects on adipose tissue gene expression. Since&#xD;
      adiponectin is associated with inflammatory status, lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity,&#xD;
      changes in gene expression of these pathways are expected after alcohol consumption to be&#xD;
      reflected in adipose gene expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beneficial effects of moderate alcohol consumption might be more apparent in lean then in&#xD;
      overweight persons. Compared to overweight men, lean men have stronger increases in&#xD;
      adiponectin and in the 'good' HDL cholesterol after moderate alcohol consumption.&#xD;
      Furthermore, liver enzymes of obese subjects are elevated after moderate alcohol consumption&#xD;
      indicating a less favorable response to moderate alcohol consumption among overweight&#xD;
      persons. Since the current rise in the obesity pandemic, different responses between lean and&#xD;
      obese subjects after alcohol consumption are of great importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, investigating alcohol-induced changes in gene expression of adipose tissue in both lean&#xD;
      and overweight subjects could not only be highly valuable for the identification of new&#xD;
      biomarkers but could also be of pivotal importance to identify specific physiological&#xD;
      mechanisms leading to improved insulin sensitivity and reduced inflammatory status. This&#xD;
      eventually could help in the general understanding of the development of diet-related chronic&#xD;
      disorders such as obesity and type two diabetes.&#xD;
