    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this project is to develop the first longitudinal registry of&#xD;
      combat-exposed men and women with PTSD. This registry will provide essential data on the&#xD;
      natural history, including progression and remission, and outcomes associated with PTSD in&#xD;
      military service men and women who have utilized the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)&#xD;
      health care system. Additional goals of this project are to determine risk factors for PTSD&#xD;
      among combat-exposed service men and women (by incorporating a combat-exposed non-PTSD group&#xD;
      of veterans into analyses), and to assess the joint effects of combat exposure and PTSD on a&#xD;
      broad range of outcome measures (by incorporating a non-combat-exposed group of veterans into&#xD;
      analyses). Thus, the registry will allow an evaluation of current theoretical models of&#xD;
      symptom development and progression in a large sample of service men and women who utilize&#xD;
      the VA medical system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the PTSD registry, we will collect information on two comparison groups of&#xD;
      OIF/OEF-era veterans to conduct nested case control studies within the general VA health care&#xD;
      utilization database. First, a comparison group of combat veterans who are high utilizers of&#xD;
      VA medical care, but who have not received a diagnosis of PTSD will be identified. This group&#xD;
      will be used in analyses to identify risk factors for PTSD. Additionally, the rate of PTSD&#xD;
      symptoms will be evaluated in this comparison group to estimate the prevalence of missed PTSD&#xD;
      diagnoses among combat veterans with high rates of service utilization, and the resulting&#xD;
      impact on utilization and outcomes. A second comparison group will consist of veterans with&#xD;
      similar service record and demographic backgrounds, who were not deployed to the OIF/OEF war&#xD;
      zones. Thus, the proposed project will create a PTSD registry from the VA database to assess&#xD;
      the natural history and progression of PTSD in combat veterans from OIF/OEF and also to&#xD;
      conduct case-control studies nested within the VA database. The case-control comparisons will&#xD;
      be used to evaluate key hypotheses related to the specific aims of the overall project.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project will be designed to address a range of research questions within the registry&#xD;
      itself, as well as in the comparisons with non-registry groups. Specific aims of this project&#xD;
      can be divided into the following major research areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Epidemiology of PTSD Aim 1. To evaluate the natural history of PTSD, including&#xD;
           progression and remission of symptoms over time, and the long-term psychosocial, medical&#xD;
           and quality of life outcomes associated with the disorder Aim 2. To identify predictors&#xD;
           of recovery or remission from PTSD, including treatment utilization, psychiatric and&#xD;
           medical comorbidities, and sociodemographic factors Aim 3. To identify clinical&#xD;
           characteristics, risk factors and comorbidities of PTSD, including disparities by&#xD;
           gender, race/ethnicity, social support, and socioeconomic status, by comparing PTSD&#xD;
           patients to a &quot;control&quot; group of veterans without PTSD&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PTSD Treatment and Outcomes Aim 4. To identify current treatment approaches and outcomes&#xD;
           of treatment through time, particularly among service members who are often excluded&#xD;
           from clinical trials due to comorbidities and therefore remain unexamined and possibly&#xD;
           under-treated Aim 5. To estimate the joint effects of combat exposure and PTSD on&#xD;
           long-term psychosocial well-being and quality of life measures, by comparing PTSD&#xD;
           patients to a &quot;control&quot; group of veterans who were not deployed to combat/war zones&#xD;
           during the same time period&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Health Services Research Aim 6. To establish the prevalence of PTSD in a comparison&#xD;
           group of service men and women who had not received the PTSD diagnosis in their patient&#xD;
           record but are high utilizers of the VA medical system, and to identify risk factors for&#xD;
           missed PTSD diagnoses Aim 7. To provide data that are immediately useful for determining&#xD;
           future health services policy, costs, and needs for upcoming research, manpower and&#xD;
           training, by assessing current referral and utilization patterns. Both direct and&#xD;
           indirect (e.g., productivity loss, pharmacological burden) costs of treatment will be&#xD;
           assessed Aim 8. To develop a large database of servicemen and women with PTSD and&#xD;
           network of treatment sites that are potentially available for further observational and&#xD;
           interventional studies, as well as concurrent ancillary studies, such as qualitative&#xD;
           studies on caregiver/family burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project will be conducted in three phases over three years using both existing&#xD;
      data from the VA medical record database and prospective data to be collected by a structured&#xD;
      interview in the third phase of the study, as well as periodic data transfers from the&#xD;
      medical records. During the first phase (months 1-9), the data de-identification procedures&#xD;
      for the study will be pre-tested (months 1-2), the data will be prepared for abstraction&#xD;
      (months 2-4), and the study protocol and research interview will be reviewed and finalized&#xD;
      (months 6-9). During Phase II (months 4-12), the preliminary PTSD database will be created by&#xD;
      data transfer (month 4), query reports/resolutions (month 5). Also during this phase,&#xD;
      analyses of existing data extracted from the VA medical record system will be conducted&#xD;
      (months 10-12) and target cohorts for follow-up assessment will be identified. Phase III&#xD;
      (months 12-36) will include subject recruitment for the PTSD registry and two comparison&#xD;
      groups, and the structured telephone interviews will be conducted in all three groups (months&#xD;
      12-24). Data collected in the telephone interview will be coded, de-identified and merged&#xD;
      with the overall study database. Analyses will be conducted during this phase (months 24-36)&#xD;
      related to the Specific Aims of the study. The PTSD registry database will be updated as new&#xD;
      VA electronic medical records for registry participants appear during the course of this&#xD;
      project, thereby capturing the trajectory of PTSD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and Sampling Strategy The source of participants will be the VA in/outpatient&#xD;
      electronic medical records of all new utilizers of the VA medical system from FY 2002 through&#xD;
      2007. According to data from the DOD Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) received by the VA&#xD;
      Environmental Epidemiology Service (EES) on April 17, 2007, from FY 2002 through February&#xD;
      2007, there had been a total of 717,196 unique OIF/OEF veterans (excluding 3,303 who died in&#xD;
      theater) who had been separated from active duty following deployment, and were therefore&#xD;
      eligible for VA benefits. Of these, 252,095 (35%) had obtained VA health care by March 2007.&#xD;
      More recent healthcare data through September 2007 indicate that 263,909 individuals have&#xD;
      accessed VA health care. The VA health administrative database rigorously records all&#xD;
      in-patient and out-patient visits, and includes basic information regarding each visit, such&#xD;
      as the patient name, SSN, DOB, gender, and ICD-9 diagnostic codes to describe the purpose of&#xD;
      the visit (EES database).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching objective of this project-the creation of a PTSD registry-will be&#xD;
      accomplished by identifying male and female OIF/OEF veterans from the entire VA medical&#xD;
      records database of new utilizers with a diagnosis of PTSD (as defined by ICD-9 code 309.81)&#xD;
      in the electronic medical record. We will sample from the VA database to recruit participants&#xD;
      for a structured telephone interview to obtain details on exposures and outcomes of interest&#xD;
      that are not captured in the existing database. A sample of 800 PTSD patients with OIF/OEF&#xD;
      war zone experience, 400 patients without the PTSD diagnosis but with OIF/OEF experience and&#xD;
      high utilization of VA services, and 400 individuals matched by age, gender, race/ethnicity,&#xD;
      and year of entry into the VA EES database, who were not sent to the war zones of OIF/OEF&#xD;
      will be recruited to participate in the telephone interview. To be representative of all&#xD;
      veterans from the OIF/OEF era, the sampling will be stratified by year of entry into the VA&#xD;
      database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creation of the PTSD Registry Database Patient registries, as defined by the AHRQ and World&#xD;
      Health Organization, are organized systems containing information about individual persons,42&#xD;
      and the patient registry database is defined as a file (or files) derived from the registry.&#xD;
      A patient-based database is necessary to allow direct access to information on diagnoses of&#xD;
      interest and treatment outcomes, as well as to longitudinally track follow-up visits,&#xD;
      progress, and treatment courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast to these criteria, the current database of utilizers of the VA healthcare system&#xD;
      is structured by chronological in-patient and out-patient visits, rather than unique patient&#xD;
      identifiers or diagnoses. Thus, with the existing database, there is no readily accessible&#xD;
      way to identify unique patients with PTSD or to assess their longitudinal outcomes and&#xD;
      utilization of VA healthcare. Therefore, a fundamental objective of this proposal is to&#xD;
      establish a registry of patients with PTSD from the existing VA utilization database.&#xD;
      Electronic medical records such as those in the VA database are increasingly important&#xD;
      sources of data, but data must be extracted, transformed into registry format, and loaded&#xD;
      into the registry, where they will reside in the registry database, together with&#xD;
      registry-specific data that is imported from other sources. The other sources of data for the&#xD;
      PTSD registry will be the OIF/OEF veteran roster (particularly for military specific data,&#xD;
      e.g., branch, rank, deployment dates, etc.) and, in Phase III, the proposed telephone&#xD;
      interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phase I of this project, a cumulative roster of unique OIF/OEF veterans who have been&#xD;
      separated from active duty following deployment and who have become eligible for VA&#xD;
      healthcare will be matched with VA inpatient (PTF) and outpatient (OPC) databases for fiscal&#xD;
      year (FY) 2004 through FY 2007. For identification of a potential PTSD patient, any veteran&#xD;
      patient with a diagnosis of ICD-9 CM, 308.81 will be selected. The PTSD registry will&#xD;
      encompass utilizers of the VA medical system. Each unique patient with a visit record&#xD;
      indicating a PTSD diagnosis will be included. The registry creation will involve a multi-step&#xD;
      process, including steps to identify all PTSD diagnoses, to identify unique patients within&#xD;
      the PTSD diagnoses, and to identify each additional visit made by each PTSD patient. For&#xD;
      identification of OIF/OEF veteran non-PTSD patients who are high VA healthcare users (sample&#xD;
      #2), we will review in/outpatient records of OIF/OEF veteran patients and identify those who&#xD;
      have been hospitalized or treated as outpatients more than 11 times during the post&#xD;
      deployment period. A similar step will be taken to identify a non-combat comparison group of&#xD;
      patients (sample #3). All veteran patients for three groups will be stratified by year of&#xD;
      first entry to VA healthcare data bases (FY 2004-2007) and equal number of veteran patients&#xD;
      will be randomly selected for each fiscal year for sample #1 and sample #2. For sample #3,&#xD;
      additional matching variables such as age, gender, and ethnicity/race will be used in&#xD;
      addition to the year of entry to VA healthcare databases. Ultimately, during Phase II, all&#xD;
      existing VA medical utilization data and OIF/OEF veterans' roster data for each veteran&#xD;
      patient will be merged and de-identified to ensure privacy and confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phase III, data obtained from a telephone interview will be merged with the existing&#xD;
      data in the PTSD registry database. The PTSD registry will continue to be updated at 6-month&#xD;
      intervals during the course of this project as new or updated electronic medical records are&#xD;
      entered into the VA in/outpatient healthcare database for registry participants.&#xD;
