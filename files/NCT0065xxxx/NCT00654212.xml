      Objective: Whether temporary endoscopic decompression by Self-expanding metal stents (SEMS)&#xD;
      could allow these patients to undergo successful laparoscopic resection (endo-laparoscopic&#xD;
      approach) has never been previously studied. This randomized trial aims to compare this&#xD;
      approach with emergency open surgery in the management of obstructing left-sided colon&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First reported in 1991, laparoscopic assisted colectomy is increasingly practised world-wide.&#xD;
      Abundant evidence exists in the literature suggesting laparoscopic assisted colectomy, when&#xD;
      compared with its open counterpart, is associated with more favourable short-term outcomes,&#xD;
      better cosmesis, and better patient's satisfaction. Moreover, recent reports from large-scale&#xD;
      randomized trials support the use of this minimally invasive technique in the treatment of&#xD;
      colorectal cancer, a malignant condition common in many parts of the world. However, around&#xD;
      8-29% of patients with colorectal cancer present as acute large bowel obstruction, a&#xD;
      condition used to be considered as a contraindication to laparoscopic surgery due to poor&#xD;
      exposure and potential hazard of injury to the distended bowel. Thus, most cases of malignant&#xD;
      large bowel obstruction mandate an emergency open surgery to relieve the obstruction and&#xD;
      resect the tumour, with many patients, especially those with obstructing left-sided colon&#xD;
      cancer, ending up with temporary or permanent stoma which can adversely affect their&#xD;
      health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) was first described by Dohmoto in 1991 as an endoscopic&#xD;
      palliative alternative for treating inoperable colon cancer. Three years later, Tejero et al.&#xD;
      published a preliminary report of using SEMS as a 'bridge' to surgery in two patients with&#xD;
      colonic obstruction 13. Since then, a number of publications as well as systemic review have&#xD;
      shown that endoluminal stenting is a relatively simple and safe alternative to standard&#xD;
      surgical management of acute malignant obstruction of the left colon, thereby obviating the&#xD;
      need of emergency surgery or colostomy. However, whether temporary endoscopic bowel&#xD;
      decompression by SEMS could allow patients with malignant left colonic obstruction to undergo&#xD;
      successful laparoscopic resection (endo-laparoscopic approach) has never been studied in&#xD;
      detail before. We therefore conducted the current trial to study the outcomes of this&#xD;
      endo-laparoscopic approach in patients with obstructing left-sided colon cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the outcomes of the&#xD;
      endo-laparoscopic approach for patients with obstructing left-sided colon cancer, using&#xD;
      patients undergoing emergency open surgery as controls. Only patients with obstructing&#xD;
      left-sided colon cancer were studied because of the reported high incidence of stoma creation&#xD;
      in this condition10,11, and because a homogeneous group of patients could be ensured to&#xD;
      facilitate comparison of the two different approaches. A single surgical team consisting of&#xD;
      two surgeons (C.C.C. and M.K.W.L.) and one camera assistant in the case of laparoscopic&#xD;
      resection performed all operations with the patient under general anesthesia. The study was&#xD;
      approved by the hospital ethical committee and was not supported by any commercial funds or&#xD;
      sponsorship.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consecutive adult patients (aged 18 or above) presenting with clinical features of&#xD;
             left colonic obstruction were potential candidates.&#xD;

          -  In the absence of peritonitis, right lower quadrant tenderness or grossly distended&#xD;
             caecum (10cm or above in maximal dimension) on plain abdominal radiograph, an urgent&#xD;
             water-soluble single contrast enema was performed to determine the level of&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients were recruited if the lower border of an obstructing tumour was found between&#xD;
             the splenic flexure and rectosigmoid junction.&#xD;
&#xD;
