  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effects of treatment for hepatitis C on atherosclerosis, or&#xD;
      hardening of the arteries. Hepatitis C is a disease of the liver caused by a virus that can&#xD;
      cause permanent damage to that organ. Treatment can clear the virus in at least half of&#xD;
      patients and reduce the risk of serious complications of the disease. Atherosclerosis is an&#xD;
      accumulation of cholesterol and fat in the arteries that can narrow blood vessels, leading to&#xD;
      chest pain, heart attack or stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the liver controls cholesterol and fat levels in the blood, hepatitis C infection may&#xD;
      be a risk factor for atherosclerosis by increasing cholesterol and fat in blood vessels.&#xD;
      Treatment of the hepatitis C may reduce the risk of atherosclerosis and its consequences.&#xD;
      This study will determine what effect hepatitis C treatment has on the rate of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis and narrowing of blood vessels and on the risk of heart attack or stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 30 years of age and older with current or past infection with hepatitis C may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires regarding risk factors for heart disease and stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of blood pressure, heart rate, weight, height, waist and hips&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT scans and ultrasound tests to measure the degree of blood vessel hardening and&#xD;
           narrowing in the heart and neck region&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with changes in lipid metabolism in the liver&#xD;
      and the peripheral blood. Patients with chronic hepatitis C infection tend to have low levels&#xD;
      of cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol. These levels increase in many patients after treatment&#xD;
      and successful eradication of the virus. However, it is not known whether this increase is&#xD;
      associated with increased cardiovascular risk and thus may increase their risk for&#xD;
      atherosclerotic disease. To determine whether eradication of HCV affects atherosclerosis&#xD;
      progression, we propose to examine up to 200 patients with chronic hepatitis C for markers of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis and the risk of its complications. Up to 100 patients who have cleared HCV&#xD;
      and recovered will be matched and compared to patients who failed to respond and continue to&#xD;
      have chronic hepatitis C. The atherosclerosis assessment will include careful history for&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors, a battery of blood tests for lipid levels and relevant&#xD;
      biomarkers followed by specialized imaging tests of the carotid and coronary arteries,&#xD;
      including ultrasound imaging of intima-media thickness of the carotid arteries and&#xD;
      computerized axial tomography of the heart and coronary arteries. The primary end point in&#xD;
      the assessment will be differences in maximal carotid intima media thickness and secondary&#xD;
      end points will include differences in coronary artery calcium score, Framingham risk scores&#xD;
      and other measurements or atherosclerosis. This cross-sectional study will set the stage for&#xD;
      a more formal prospective assessment of cardiovascular risk factors and evidence of coronary&#xD;
      and cerebrovascular disease among patients being treated with antiviral agents.&#xD;
