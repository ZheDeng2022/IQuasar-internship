    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 clinical trial designed to evaluate increasing durations of MLN8054 oral&#xD;
      dosing in patients with advanced malignancies. MLN8054 will be given once daily for 4 to 7&#xD;
      consecutive days per week for 2 to 3 weeks. Following the 2- to 3-week treatment period there&#xD;
      will be a 2 week recovery period.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Each patient must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic and/or advanced malignancy&#xD;
             (including lymphomas but excluding malignancies with extensive bone marrow involvement&#xD;
             such as leukemias and multiple myeloma) for which standard treatment does not offer&#xD;
             curative or life-prolonging potential&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aged 18 years or more&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Expected survival longer than 3 months from enrollment in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiographically or clinically evaluable tumor; however, measurable disease is not&#xD;
             required for participation in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suitable venous access for the conduct of blood sampling for determination of MLN8054&#xD;
             plasma concentrations&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to have serial skin punch biopsies obtained and, if feasible, to have&#xD;
             serial biopsies of tumor tissue obtained before and following the first dose of&#xD;
             MLN8054 Note: Once the relationship between drug exposure and inhibition of Aurora A&#xD;
             kinase activity has been established, patients subsequently enrolled in the study will&#xD;
             not be required to undergo either tumor or skin biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Recovered from the reversible effects of prior antineoplastic therapy with at least&#xD;
             4 weeks elapsed since the last exposure to cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy and&#xD;
             at least 6 weeks elapsed since exposure to nitrosoureas or mitomycin C. Patients&#xD;
             treated with fully human monoclonal antibodies must not have received treatment with&#xD;
             such antibodies for at least 6 weeks, and those treated with chimeric monoclonal&#xD;
             antibodies must not have received treatment with such antibodies for at least 4 weeks.&#xD;
             Patients treated with noncytotoxic small molecule drugs (eg, tyrosine kinase&#xD;
             inhibitors such as Tarceva and hormonal agents such as Femara®) must not have received&#xD;
             treatment with these drugs for at least 2 weeks before the first dose of MLN8054 is&#xD;
             given.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male patients must use an appropriate method of barrier contraception (ie, condoms)&#xD;
             and inform any sexual partner that she must also use a reliable method of&#xD;
             contraception (eg, a hormonal contraceptive, an intrauterine device, or diaphragm with&#xD;
             spermicide) during the study and for 3 months after the last dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients must be postmenopausal, surgically sterilized, or willing to use&#xD;
             reliable methods of birth control (eg, a hormonal contraceptive, an intrauterine&#xD;
             device, diaphragm with spermicide, or abstinence) during the study and for 3 months&#xD;
             after the last dose of study treatment. They should inform any male sexual partner to&#xD;
             use an appropriate method of barrier contraception (ie, condoms) as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to give informed consent before the conduct of any study-related procedure not&#xD;
             part of normal medical care and able to comply with the protocol&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients meeting any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Life-threatening illness unrelated to cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing nausea or vomiting greater than Grade 1 in severity. Patients who require&#xD;
             ongoing treatment with metoclopramide to control nausea or vomiting, to the point that&#xD;
             it is Grade 1 or less in severity, are allowed to participate in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diarrhea greater than Grade 1 in severity. Patients who require ongoing therapy with&#xD;
             an antimotility agent to control diarrhea to a Grade 1 or lower level are not allowed&#xD;
             to participate in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;

             used as adjuvant or neo-adjuvant therapies. There is no limit on the number of&#xD;
             noncytotoxic therapies (eg, hormonal and immunologic) that patients may have received.&#xD;
             Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (eg, Tarceva and Iressa®) are considered noncytotoxic&#xD;
             compounds.&#xD;

             of peripheral blood or bone marrow stem cell support for hematopoietic reconstitution&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with radiation therapy involving greater than or equal to 25% of the&#xD;
             hematopoietically active bone marrow&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical and/or radiographic evidence of cerebral metastases. However, patients who&#xD;
             have a history of CNS metastasis but have no radiographic or clinical evidence of&#xD;
             residual tumor (eg, following complete surgical resection) are not excluded from&#xD;
             participation in this study.&#xD;

             aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;2 times the ULN, and alkaline&#xD;
             phosphatase (ALP) &gt;2 times the ULN. Both the AST and ALP may be elevated up to 5 times&#xD;
             the ULN if their elevation can be reasonably ascribed to the presence of metastatic&#xD;
             disease to liver and/or to bone; however, the ALT must in all circumstances be &lt;2&#xD;
             times the ULN.&#xD;

             antigen-positive status or known or suspected active hepatitis C infection&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Inclusion in a trial of an investigational drug in the previous 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Admission of alcohol abuse or an inability to restrict consumption of alcohol to no&#xD;
             more than 1 standard unit of alcohol per day during the study and for 21 days from the&#xD;

             1.5 oz of 80 proof alcohol, or one 6 oz glass of wine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: criteria 22, 23, and 24 apply only to patients in whom biopsy of tumor tissue is&#xD;
        planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  aPTT and/or PT exceeding the ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known bleeding diathesis or history of abnormal bleeding&#xD;
