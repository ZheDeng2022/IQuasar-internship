             having a Body Mass Index (BMI) between 19 to 32, inclusive. BMI = weight (kg)/height&#xD;
             (m^2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects' clinical laboratory tests (CBC, blood chemistry, and urinalysis) must be&#xD;
             within normal limits or clinically acceptable to the investigator/sponsor. Subject's&#xD;
             liver function test results (AST, ALT, and GGT) must not be elevated above normal&#xD;
             limits at Screening and on Day-1. Subjects' CPK test results must not be elevated more&#xD;
             than 1.25 times the upper limit of normal, at Screening and on Day -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be free of any clinically significant disease that would interfere with&#xD;
             the study evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Screening ECG conduction intervals must be within gender specific normal range (QTc&#xD;
             males &lt;=430 msec and females &lt;=450 msec).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vital sign measurements (taken after ~3 minutes in a seated position) must be within&#xD;
             the following ranges:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  systolic blood pressure, 90 to 140 mm Hg&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  diastolic blood pressure, 45 to 90 mm Hg&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  pulse rate, 40 to 100 bpm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             (beta-hCG) at Screening and have a negative urine pregnancy test upon each admission&#xD;
             to the study center.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential must agree to use medically accepted methods of&#xD;
             contraception prior to screening, while receiving protocol-specified medication, and&#xD;

                  must agree and consent to use one of the above-mentioned methods should they&#xD;
                  become sexually active while participating in the study.&#xD;
