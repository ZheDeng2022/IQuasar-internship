  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the safety of three dose levels of&#xD;
      ciclesonide administered as an intranasal spray for six weeks, 200µg, 100µg or 25µg, once&#xD;
      daily, in pediatric patients (ages 2-5 years) with PAR. The secondary objective is to measure&#xD;
      serum concentrations of ciclesonide and its active metabolite under steady state conditions&#xD;
      at three time points corresponding to the presumed peak and trough exposure after six weeks&#xD;
      of administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, reflective (24-hour) total nasal symptom score (TNSS) over the six weeks of&#xD;
      treatment at various timepoints and a physician assessment of nasal symptoms at endpoint were&#xD;
      summarized.&#xD;

             interfere with study conduct, influence the interpretation of study&#xD;
             observations/results, or put the patient at increased risk during the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A demonstrated sensitivity to at least one allergen known to induce PAR through a&#xD;
             standard prick skin test within one year of study start. A positive test is defined as&#xD;
             a wheal diameter at least 3mm larger than the control wheal for th eprick test&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Parent or legal guardian is capable of understanding the requirements, risks, and&#xD;

          5. A history of PAR for a minimum of 3 months preceding the study screening visit (B0).&#xD;
             The PAR must have been of sufficient severity to require treatment (either continuous&#xD;
             or intermittent) in the past and in the investigators judgment is expected to continue&#xD;
             to require treatment for the study duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of physical findings of nasal pathology, including nasal polyps (within the&#xD;
             last 60 days) or other clinically significant respiratory tract malformations, recent&#xD;
             nasal biopsy (within the last 60 days), nasal trauma, or surgery and atrophic rhinitis&#xD;
             or rhinitis medicamentosa (within the last 60 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participation in any investigational drug trial within the 30 days preceding the&#xD;
             Screening Visit (B0) or at any time during the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A known hypersensitivity to any corticosteroid or any of the excipients in the&#xD;
             formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of a respiratory infection or disorder [including, but not limited to&#xD;
             bronchitis, pneumonia, the common cold, acute or chronic sinusitis, flu, severe acute&#xD;
             respiratory syndrome (SARS)] within the 14 days preceding the Screening Visit, or&#xD;
             development of a respiratory infection during the Screening Visit (B0)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of a positive test for HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Active asthma requiring treatment with inhaled or systemic corticosteroids and/or&#xD;
             routine use of b-agonists and any controller drugs (e.g. theophylline, leukotrienes,&#xD;
             etc.) intermittent use of b-agonists is acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Use of any prohibited concomitant medications within the prescribed (per protocol)&#xD;
             withdrawal periods prior to the screening visit (B0) and during the entire screening&#xD;
             period and treatment duration&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Use of antibiotic therapy for acute conditions within 14 days prior to the Screening&#xD;
             Visit (B0).&#xD;
&#xD;

             study period. However, initiation of immunotherapy 90 days or more prior to the&#xD;
             Screening Visit AND use of a stable (maintenance) dose (30 days or more) may be&#xD;
             considered for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Non-vaccinated exposure to, or infection with, chickenpox or measles within the 21&#xD;
             days preceding the Screening Visit (B0).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Exposure to systemic corticosteroids for any indication, chronic or intermittent&#xD;
             (e.g.: contact dermatitis), during the past 2 months, or presence of an underlying&#xD;
             condition that can reasonably be expected to require treatment with corticosteroids&#xD;
             during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Use of topical corticosteroids in concentrations in excess of 1% hydrocortisone for&#xD;
             dermatological conditions during the past 1 month, or presence of an underlying&#xD;
             condition that can reasonably be expected to require treatment with such preparations&#xD;
             during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Intraocular pressure at the screening visit (B0) of 21 mm Hg or greater or failed&#xD;
