      The purpose of this trial is to assess the clinical effect of CH-1504 at doses of 0.25, 0.5&#xD;
      and 1.0 mg per day in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis by determining the proportion&#xD;
      of patients achieving an American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20% improvement response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown cause that leads to&#xD;
      pain, stiffness, swelling and limitation of joint function. If left untreated, RA produces&#xD;
      serious destruction of joints that frequently leads to permanent disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methotrexate (MTX) is currently the most commonly prescribed first-line disease modifying&#xD;
      anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) because of its early onset of action, good efficacy, and ease of&#xD;
      administration. In addition, MTX can be combined with other FDA approved DMARDs, including&#xD;
      gold compounds, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, TNF inhibitors, anakinra and leflunomide.&#xD;
      However, the administration of MTX has been associated with serious side effects such as skin&#xD;
      reactions, pneumonitis, gastrointestinal disturbances including diarrhea, ulcerative&#xD;
      stomatitis and hemorrhagic enteritis, hepatotoxicity and renal toxicity. Overall it is&#xD;
      estimated that up to 30% of all patients discontinue MTX therapy due to side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MTX enters cells via the Reduced Folate Carrier (RFC) system. Once inside cells, it is&#xD;
      converted enzymatically to polyglutamylated derivatives. These metabolites cannot be readily&#xD;
      effluxed and are retained in tissues. The accumulation of polyglutamyl metabolites of MTX for&#xD;
      prolonged periods may play a significant role in both the efficacy and the toxicity of this&#xD;
      compound. Methotrexate in its parent form only has activity against dihydrofolate reductase&#xD;
      (DHFR). In order for it to have significant activity against other enzymes (i.e. Thymidylate&#xD;
      Synthase (TS)) it must be polyglutamylated. However by being polyglutamylated the MTX&#xD;
      metabolite is retained in the cell and may potentiate the cytotoxicity of MTX. In addition to&#xD;
      polyglutamylation metabolism, MTX is also hydroxylated in the liver to a metabolite known as&#xD;
      7-hydroxymethotrexate, which is also subject to polyglutamylation and cell retention. This&#xD;
      metabolite has been implicated in liver and kidney toxicity of the parent compound, while&#xD;
      contributing no role in efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CH-1504 has been shown in vitro to be a nonpolyglutamylatable and nonhydroxylatable&#xD;
      antifolate that is more efficiently taken up into cells by the reduced folate carrier (RFC)&#xD;
      system than is MTX. CH-1504 has significant activity on both DHFR and TS enzymes without the&#xD;
      need for polyglutamylation. The lack of hydroxylation potentially leads to enhanced levels of&#xD;
      the active drug in the cell. Furthermore, the glutamyl moiety is not susceptible to being&#xD;
      cleaved by carboxypeptidase. Thus CH-1504 may be referred to as a metabolically stable&#xD;
      antifolate. It is our hypothesis that in the clinical setting CH-1504 will demonstrate the&#xD;
      efficacy of classical antifolates (via folate enzyme inhibition) but will be devoid of the&#xD;
      toxicity secondary to the formation of the polyglutamylated and hydroxylated metabolites,&#xD;
      providing a significantly improved therapeutic index compared to classical antifolates, such&#xD;
      as MTX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, methotrexate controlled study to assess the&#xD;
      clinical effect of CH-1504 in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis by determining the&#xD;
      proportion of patients achieving an ACR20 response after 12 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the clinical efficacy of CH-1504 by proportion of patients achieving ACR50 and&#xD;
           ACR70 responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the clinical efficacy of CH-1504 using EULAR &quot;good&quot; and &quot;moderate&quot; response&#xD;
           criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the clinical efficacy of CH-1504 using the difference from baseline of ACR core&#xD;
           set and DAS28 of measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of CH-1504 in RA patients as determined by the&#xD;
           frequency and severity of adverse events, laboratory abnormalities, and dropouts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the dose response relationship of CH-1504&#xD;
