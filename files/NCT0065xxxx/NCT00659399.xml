      The purpose of this study is to assess feasibility and safety of using once daily&#xD;
      Fondaparinux Sodium (ARIXTRA®) in patients with ovarian cancer who are in 'clinical&#xD;
      remission' (no clinical evidence of disease) after chemotherapy but at high risk of ovarian&#xD;
      cancer recurrence.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large body of work supports the association of abnormal coagulation (blood clot formation)&#xD;
      and malignancy. A coagulation enzyme thrombin is able to 1) enhance cancer cell adhesion to&#xD;
      platelets and endothelial cells 2) stimulate tumor cell growth, 3) increase metastasis and 4)&#xD;
      stimulate tumor angiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thrombin inhibition has anti-metastatic and anti-tumor activity in mouse models. Recent&#xD;
      meta-analysis of 4 major randomized clinical trials that have evaluated the effect of&#xD;
      anticoagulants on overall survival in cancer patients comparing low molecular weight heparin&#xD;
      (LMWH) to placebo demonstrates a 13% risk reduction in mortality at 1 year and 10% risk&#xD;
      reduction at 2 years, which is statistically significant and independent of the potential&#xD;
      confounding effect of anticoagulation in the prevention of venous thromboembolic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fondaparinux sodium (ARIXTRA® ) is a highly effective newer anticoagulant that is a fully&#xD;
      synthetic pentasaccharide. Arixtra binds to antithrombin III and subsequently inhibits Factor&#xD;
      Xa and hence thrombin generation. Arixtra has an excellent safety profile in clinical trials&#xD;
      of over 10,000 patients. When compared to LMWHs, ARIXTRA® has a potential pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      advantage based on its longer half-life of 16-17 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis to be tested is whether the completion of 8 weeks of ARIXTRA® in patients with&#xD;
      ovarian cancer who are in 'clinical remission' (no clinical evidence of disease) after&#xD;
      chemotherapy but at high risk of ovarian cancer recurrence is feasible and safe and if the&#xD;
      inhibition of thrombin generation by ARIXTRA® in ovarian cancer will result in decrease&#xD;
      ovarian cancer recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A concise description of the methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be a prospective open-label cohort feasibility study of giving 2 months of&#xD;
      ARIXTRA® in patients at high risk of recurrence of ovarian cancer. The planned accrual is 15&#xD;
      patients. Patients will be treated with a fixed dose of ARIXTRA® 2.5 mg by subcutaneous&#xD;
      injection once daily. Treatment will continue for 2 months or until disease recurrence or&#xD;
      grade 3 adverse events or patient refusal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, all patients will be followed for survival and recurrence.&#xD;
