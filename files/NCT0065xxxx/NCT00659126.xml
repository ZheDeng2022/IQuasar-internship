      This phase II trial studies how well magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using contrast imaging&#xD;
      agent ferumoxytol works in comparison to standard imaging agent gadolinium in measuring&#xD;
      tumors in patients undergoing treatment for brain tumors or other tumors that have spread to&#xD;
      the brain. Diagnostic procedures, such as MRI, may help find and diagnose disease and find&#xD;
      out how far the disease has spread. MRI scans use radio waves and a powerful magnet linked to&#xD;
      a computer to create detailed pictures of areas inside the body. The contrast imaging agent&#xD;
      ferumoxytol consists of small iron particles taken by the blood stream to the brain and to&#xD;
      the area of the tumor. It is highly visible on the MRI, and may help visualize the blood flow&#xD;
      going through the tumor better than gadolinium can. Using a more sensitive and faster 7 Tesla&#xD;
      (7T) magnet MRI in conjunction with a contrast imaging agent may provide a better way to&#xD;
      measure tumors than the 3 Tesla (3T) magnet MRI in patients with brain tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare quantitative blood brain barrier permeability measurements (derived transfer&#xD;
      coefficient [Ktrans]) of a standard gadolinium (Gd) MRI contrast agent at 3T and 7T using&#xD;
      dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) based perfusion measures at 3T and 7T.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the blood brain barrier permeability to ferumoxytol (ferumoxytol&#xD;
      non-stoichiometric magnetite) and to a standard gadolinium-based MRI contrast agent using&#xD;
      signal intensity changes as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe cerebral blood volume (CBV) measurements obtained using a standard gadolinium&#xD;
      MRI contrast agent and ferumoxytol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate tumor microvascularity on susceptibility-weighted images (SWI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To describe the microscopic distribution of ferumoxytol particles in tissue removed from&#xD;
      subjects undergoing surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 3T or 7T magnet within the subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive gadolinium intravenously (IV) on day 1 and ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric&#xD;
      magnetite IV on day 2. Patients undergo anatomical MRI sequences with 3T or 7T at baseline&#xD;
      and on days 1-3. Patients also undergo DSC MRI and DCE MRI on days 1-2. Day 1 and day 2&#xD;
      imaging sessions may be separated by up to 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up at approximately 4-6 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Paired sample t-tests will be used for primary descriptive comparisons. Secondary analyses will use a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) model to compare 3T and 7T while adjusting for other factors including tumor type, prior therapy, and, potentially, important baseline factors that differ between the subjects assigned to the two field strengths. Normality will be assessed graphically and, if needed, a transformation (e.g. the logarithmic transform) will be applied.</description>
