      Background/rationale: Ertapenem is an innovative antimicrobial agent, which is approved in&#xD;
      the European Union for diabetic foot infections of the skin and soft tissue. Although its&#xD;
      antimicrobial spectrum and activity against ESBL-strains are promising to treat infected&#xD;
      ulcers associated with diabetes, there is a lack of data on tissue pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      ertapenem in this patient population. However, for antimicrobial efficacy it is important to&#xD;
      show that the antibiotic achieves sufficient concentrations at the site of infection, i.e. in&#xD;
      tissue. A recent clinical study by Burkhardt et al. (Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy,&#xD;
      2006) using the microdialysis technique showed that the free tissue concentrations after a&#xD;
      single dose of 1 g ertapenem are sufficient and adequate to kill most relevant bacteria,&#xD;
      suggesting efficacy of ertapenem for soft tissue infections. It is well known that there is&#xD;
      no accumulation of ertapenem in plasma after multiple doses of 1 g every 24 h in patients&#xD;
      without significantly impaired renal function. The single dose study by Burkhardt et al. also&#xD;
      suggests that only negligible drug accumulation can be expected in soft tissues of healthy&#xD;
      young volunteers after multiple doses. However, it was shown for other antibiotics that&#xD;
      tissue PK may be significantly different under pathologic conditions, leading to impaired&#xD;
      penetration, but subsequent accumulation after multiple doses due to a longer tissue half&#xD;
      life than in healthy volunteers. Since the properties of inflamed tissue may diverge from&#xD;
      those of healthy tissue it is important to evaluate which concentrations of ertapenem are&#xD;
      reached in inflamed tissue after multiple doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical study: In the present study we will measure the concentrations of ertapenem over&#xD;
      time in plasma and infected tissue of 10 diabetes patients after multiple doses. The&#xD;
      microdialysis technique will be used. The ertapenem concentrations will be measured in&#xD;
      inflamed tissue and in non-inflamed subcutaneous tissue to identify the effect of&#xD;
      inflammation on pharmacokinetics. The findings of the present study will help to confirm the&#xD;
      efficacy of ertapenem for the indication of diabetic soft tissue infections.&#xD;
