  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 1.1 million people a year suffer a mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), or&#xD;
      concussion, in the United States. Although most MTBI patients fully recover, as many as 28%&#xD;
      have physical, cognitive, and/or emotional symptoms up to 6 months post-injury. When symptoms&#xD;
      persist past three months, it is known as post-concussion syndrome (PCS). The cause of PCS is&#xD;
      unknown, as structural neuroimaging and neuropsychological (NP) testing results are often&#xD;
      normal. However, recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research in concussed&#xD;
      adults showed differences in brain activity compared to controls on working memory tasks,&#xD;
      despite normal structural MRI and neuropsychological findings. We propose improving this&#xD;
      research by assessing brain activation patterns during simple versus complex attention and&#xD;
      working memory tasks in 10 concussed adults via fMRI. This will be the first study to examine&#xD;
      brain activation patterns associated with the degree of effort applied to testing, a factor&#xD;
      known to confound interpretation of NP test performance. Validated computerized measures of&#xD;
      selective attention (Modified Stroop Interference Task), working memory (n-back), and effort&#xD;
      (Green's Medical Symptom Validity Test; MSVT) will be used. Ten paid controls will be used&#xD;
      for comparative purposes. We hypothesize that concussed patients will show less brain&#xD;
      activation than controls on complex versus simple working memory tasks and that activation&#xD;
      patterns in concussed patients will generally be lower in those with suboptimal effort. We&#xD;
      will also characterize self-reported emotional and physical symptoms in the PCS patients,&#xD;
      which has not been done in prior fMRI research with this population.&#xD;
