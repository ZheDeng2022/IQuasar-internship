  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complex metabolic disorder characterized by abnormal insulin&#xD;
      secretion and glucose homeostasis, resulting from impaired pancreatic beta-cell function and&#xD;
      insulin resistance in target tissues. The worldwide prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is&#xD;
      reaching epidemic proportions, and the total number of cases is expected to reach 221 million&#xD;
      by 2010. The high incidence of the disease and its associated complications places a&#xD;
      significant burden on healthcare systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus is obesity and its&#xD;
      associated insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is characterized by an impaired response to&#xD;
      the physiologic effects of insulin and leads to decreased cellular glucose uptake, increased&#xD;
      hepatic gluconeogenesis, and a compensatory increase in insulin secretion that contributes to&#xD;
      beta-cell exhaustion. Therefore in the insulin-resistant state, blood glucose and insulin&#xD;
      levels are increased. The relationship between improved glycemic control in patients with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus and the delay or prevention of comorbidities has been reported in&#xD;
      the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes&#xD;
      Study. Therefore, reduction of persistent hyperglycemia is the highest priority in treating&#xD;
      this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diet and exercise are important and effective measures for maintaining glycemic control in&#xD;
      individuals with insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, and type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus, particularly in the early stages of disease progression. In cases where diet and&#xD;
      exercise alone fail to adequately maintain glycemic control, oral antidiabetic drugs are&#xD;
      typically used. Combination oral therapy and eventually insulin are usually required to&#xD;
      maintain lower blood glucose levels but can result in adverse effects including hypoglycemia&#xD;
      and weight gain. Therefore, novel safe and effective antidiabetic therapies are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 is a ubiquitous aminopeptidase that is widely expressed in many&#xD;
      tissues; it is thought to be primarily responsible for the in vivo degradation of at least&#xD;
      two gut-derived incretin hormones, namely glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent&#xD;
      insulinotropic peptide, which are both released in response to nutrient ingestion.&#xD;
      Glucagon-like peptide-1 has been demonstrated to augment glucose-dependent insulin secretion;&#xD;
      suppress glucagon release and hepatic gluconeogenesis; inhibit gastric emptying, and reduce&#xD;
      appetite and food intake. Glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic&#xD;
      peptide also have been shown to promote insulin biosynthesis and stimulate beta cell&#xD;
      proliferation and survival. Orally available inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 activity&#xD;
      have been developed that increase intact postprandial glucagon-like peptide-1 levels after&#xD;
      oral administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SYR-472 is a selective inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 in development to improve glycemic&#xD;
      control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      SYR-472 in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have not previously achieved adequate&#xD;
      glycemic control with lifestyle modification (diet/exercise) or metformin antidiabetic&#xD;
      monotherapy. Study participation is anticipated to be up to 14 weeks.&#xD;
