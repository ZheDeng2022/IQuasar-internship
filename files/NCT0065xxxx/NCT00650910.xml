    <textblock>
      This is a two part study looking at the effect of lapatinib on concentrations of digoxin in&#xD;
      the blood when both drugs are dosed together in Part 1; and looking at the safety and&#xD;
      antitumor effect of lapatinib when used together with possible additional anticancer therapy&#xD;
      as chosen at the doctor's discretion.&#xD;
