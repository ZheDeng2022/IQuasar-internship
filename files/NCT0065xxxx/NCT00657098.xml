  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Angiogenesis inhibitors and EGFR inhibitors not only have anti tumor activity but also modify&#xD;
      physiological processes. This study evaluates effects on vascular function, endocrine&#xD;
      function and metabolism. Changes in these parameters will be analysed for predictive value&#xD;
      for treatment efficacy.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, multiple new agents have been developed that inhibit angiogenesis and the&#xD;
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cell signalling routes that are inhibited by these agents however are not only active in&#xD;
      tumour formation but are also involved in physiological processes in normal tissue and&#xD;
      organs. This means that these drugs do not only have an anti tumour effect but also modify&#xD;
      several physiological processes that lead to side effects. Little is known about these side&#xD;
      effects that generally are less severe than side effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy, but&#xD;
      because targeted therapy is often administered for prolonged periods of time, these side&#xD;
      effects can seriously affect quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine the characteristics, frequency and severity of vascular, metabolic and&#xD;
      hormonal side effects of angiogenesis and EGFR inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate if steroid profile, indol profile, concentrations of catecholamines and&#xD;
           metanephrines or thyroid antibodies change during treatment with angiogenesis and EGFR&#xD;
           inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate if known biomarkers change during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate whether vascular function changes during treatment with angiogenesis and&#xD;
           EGFR inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine if changes in skin autofluorescence and development of AGE's occur during&#xD;
           treatment with angiogenesis and EGFR inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine whether changes in factors mentioned under secondary objectives 1-4 are&#xD;
           correlated with side effects of targeted therapy and/or response to angiogenesis and&#xD;
           EGFR inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To evaluate if polymorphisms in genes involved in pathways mentioned under 1-4 associate&#xD;
           with toxicity and efficacy of angiogenesis and EGFR inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and population&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, explorative observational cohort study in patients treated with&#xD;
      angiogenesis or EGFR inhibitors. Concomitant chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy is&#xD;
      allowed. Patients must be 18 years or older at start of treatment and must be willing to give&#xD;
      written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated for vascular changes by measuring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-hour ambulatory blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  nail fold capillary microscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  skin autofluorescence at 3 time points: before start of treatment, and after 3 and after&#xD;
           6 weeks of treatment. Patients will also be asked to measure their blood pressure at&#xD;
           home twice a day, for 6 weeks. Metabolic and hormonal changes and investigation of&#xD;
           biomarkers will be done by blood and urine analyses every 3 weeks for the first 3&#xD;
           months, every 6 weeks up to 6 months and every 3 months thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in vascular, hormonal and metabolic status will be related to clinical side effects&#xD;
      and to response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      When clinically relevant differences in side effects and response to treatment are found&#xD;
      among patients treated with the same agent, DNA analysis will be carried out to investigate&#xD;
      if changes in candidate genes are related to these differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness&#xD;
&#xD;
      The minimal invasive tests will be performed during routine outpatient visits. As far as&#xD;
      known no serious adverse events are linked to the described study procedures. With this study&#xD;
      we hope to get insight into the characteristics, frequency, severity and underlying&#xD;
      mechanisms of angiogenesis and EGFR inhibitor induced vascular, metabolic and hormonal side&#xD;
      effects and to find usable surrogate markers for efficacy of treatment. Eventually, this may&#xD;
      contribute to the early detection of vascular, metabolic and hormonal changes, to the design&#xD;
      of intervention strategies for side effects and to better patient selection for angiogenesis&#xD;
      and EGFR inhibition.&#xD;
