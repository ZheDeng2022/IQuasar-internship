      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy together with safety of a&#xD;
      flexible regimen, for a period of twelve weeks, of three doses (5 mg, 10mg and 20mg) of Bay&#xD;
      38-9456, a phosphodiesterase type V inhibitor, in males with erectile dysfunction treated&#xD;
      with sildenafil in the previous &lt;6 months .At entry, once the Inclusion and Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria are confirmed, the study medication will be administered for twelve weeks in an open&#xD;
      label design. Vardenafil will be administered, as needed, at a fix dose of 10 mg once daily&#xD;
      for the first four weeks of treatment. At the Investigators' discretion, on the basis of&#xD;
      efficacy and safety evaluations, the patients may, then, receive the same dose strength of&#xD;
      their assigned study medication or, at the subsequent clinic visit(s), the next lower dose (5&#xD;
      mg vardenafil) or the next higher dose (20 mg vardenafil) for the subsequent four weeks of&#xD;
      treatment. Previous dose level of vardenafil is either maintained, increased or decreased by&#xD;
      one step according to the three applicable dose strengths (5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg ). The highest&#xD;
      dosage of vardenafil (20 mg) per day will not be exceeded. After twelve weeks of treatment,&#xD;
      the patient will be contacted twenty four hours following the last visit in order to collect&#xD;
      data concerning serious adverse events.&#xD;
