  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enterotoxigenic Escherichia (E.) coli (ETEC) bacteria are the main cause of traveler's&#xD;
      diarrhea and are significant pathogens affecting children and elderly individuals of&#xD;
      developing countries. The purpose of the study is to determine the safety of the ETEC-Cholera&#xD;
      vaccine and the body's ability to protect itself against ETEC and cholera infection after&#xD;
      receiving the vaccine. The study will enroll a total of 64 healthy volunteers, 18 to 45 years&#xD;
      old at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital. The study will provide increasing doses of the&#xD;
      vaccine or placebo (inactive substance) to 4 groups consisting of 16 participants each.&#xD;
      Participants will remain in the inpatient unit for observation for about 11 days. All&#xD;
      subjects will be treated with Cipro, an antibiotic, for 5 days. Study procedures include:&#xD;
      blood samples, vital signs, physical examinations, and stool samples. Volunteers will be&#xD;
      involved in the study for about 8 months including telephone contacts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are the principal single cause of traveler's diarrhea&#xD;
      and are a significant pathogen affecting children and elderly individuals of developing&#xD;
      countries. ETEC infections result in approximately 600 million total cases of diarrhea&#xD;
      worldwide annually, with an estimated 280 million cases and over 400,000 deaths in children&#xD;
      less than 5 years of age. The proposed study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo&#xD;
      controlled, dose-escalation, inpatient Phase I study to determine the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of a single oral dose of a combined live, attenuated, enterotoxigenic&#xD;
      Escherichia coli (ETEC)-cholera vaccine (Peru-15 pCTB). A total of 64 healthy subjects, 18 to&#xD;
      45 years old will be enrolled in this study. Subject participation duration is up to 8&#xD;
      months. Sequential cohorts of 16 eligible subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to&#xD;
      receive the assigned dose of ETEC-cholera vaccine or placebo (bicarbonate buffer only),&#xD;
      respectively. The first dose level cohort (1x10^7 colony forming units) will be divided into&#xD;
      2 groups. Initially, 4 subjects will be enrolled, treated, and observed to ensure the&#xD;
      tolerability of this dose level through Day 28. In the absence of any stopping rules,&#xD;
      enrollment and dosing will proceed with the remaining 12 subjects of this cohort. Thereafter,&#xD;
      dose escalation and subject enrollment will proceed in a step-wise fashion. A Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Committee will be convened for this study, and will review available safety data&#xD;
      through the Day 28 post-vaccination visits for each cohort prior to making a recommendation&#xD;
      to the Sponsor on advancement to the next dose level. The study will be conducted at&#xD;
      Cincinnati Children's Hospital. The primary objective of this study will be to assess the&#xD;
      safety of a combined ETEC-cholera vaccine [Peru-15-pCTB (Cholera toxin B-subunit)] when&#xD;
      administered as a single oral dose over a range of doses in healthy adult subjects compared&#xD;
      to placebo at day 28 post-vaccination. The secondary objectives will be: to assess long-term&#xD;
      safety follow-up from immunization through Month 6 post vaccination; to evaluate the&#xD;
      immunogenicity of a single oral dose of ETEC-cholera vaccine over a range of doses in healthy&#xD;
      adult subjects; and to evaluate the shedding profile of the ETEC-cholera vaccine organisms in&#xD;
      stool for a period of 7 days.&#xD;
