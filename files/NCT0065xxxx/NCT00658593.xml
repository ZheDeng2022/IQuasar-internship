      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and capecitabine, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing. It is not yet known whether gemcitabine is more effective when given&#xD;
      together with or without capecitabine in treating patients with biliary cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving gemcitabine together with&#xD;
      capecitabine to see how well it works compared with giving gemcitabine alone in treating&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic biliary cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare overall survival (OS) rates in patients with locally advanced, unresectable&#xD;
           or metastatic biliary tree cancer treated with combined gemcitabine hydrochloride and&#xD;
           capecitabine vs. gemcitabine hydrochloride alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare progression-free survival (PFS) in this patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare response rates (complete response [CR] and partial response [PR]) in this&#xD;
           patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare stable disease (SD) rates in this patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare rate of disease control (CR, PR and SD) in this patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate and compare response duration in this patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the effects of these treatments on measures of quality of life in this&#xD;
           patient group using the EORTC QLQ-C30.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the nature, severity and frequency of toxicities between the two arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumour type&#xD;
      (cholangiocarcinoma vs. gallbladder or biliary unknown), ECOG performance status (0-1 vs. 2),&#xD;
      extent of disease (locally advanced vs. metastatic), and treatment center. Patients are&#xD;
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (Gemcitabine hydrochloride and capecitabine): Patients receive gemcitabine&#xD;
           hydrochloride IV on days 1 and 8 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14.&#xD;
           Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
           toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II (Gemcitabine hydrochloride alone): Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV&#xD;
           on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life is assessed at 12 weeks after randomization and 4 weeks after completion of&#xD;
      study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 12 weeks&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
