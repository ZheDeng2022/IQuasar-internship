      This was a multicentre, single-arm, open-label study. The objective of this phase IV study&#xD;
      was to document the experience of women with the transdermal contraceptive patch (a weekly&#xD;
      contraceptive patch delivering 150 mg norelgestromin/20 mg ethinyl estradiol daily) over a&#xD;
      period of 9 cycles, compared to their previous contraceptive method. An open-label,&#xD;
      multicentre, descriptive cohort study of 392 women requiring contraception were enrolled to&#xD;
      receive the patch for nine cycles. A single treatment cycle consisted of three consecutive&#xD;
      7-day patch applications followed by one patch-free week. At the final visit, overall&#xD;
      satisfaction and preference for the patch was rated compared to the previous contraceptive&#xD;
      method.) The primary outcomes were treatment preference and overall satisfaction. Compliance,&#xD;
      contraceptive efficacy, adhesion, and safety measures were secondary outcomes. Study&#xD;
      participants were scheduled to receive the contraceptive patch for up to nine consecutive&#xD;
      treatment cycles. Participants attended the clinic for 3 study visits: baseline/screening,&#xD;
      Day 28 of Cycle 3 and Day 28 of Cycle 9 (or at early termination). A telephone interview was&#xD;
      conducted on Day 28 of Cycle 6. Approximately 400 women were to be enrolled into the study&#xD;
      and receive the transdermal contraceptive patch. Patients were recruited using ethics&#xD;
      approved advertisements, in addition to investigators approaching patients presenting for&#xD;
      routine well-woman checks. Participants who met all of the eligibility criteria were&#xD;
      instructed to apply the first patch on the first day of their next menses (or 13 weeks&#xD;
      following the last medroxyprogesterone acetate injection) and to wear this patch for seven&#xD;
      days. They were then instructed to apply a new patch for weeks 2 and 3, and then be&#xD;
      patch-free for week 4. Applying a new patch on the day after week 4 ended started a new&#xD;
      cycle. All patches were to be applied/changed on the same day of the week and at&#xD;
      approximately the same time of day. Only one patch was to be worn at a time. Patches could be&#xD;
      applied to the buttocks, abdomen, upper outer arm, or upper torso (excluding breasts) and&#xD;
      participants were instructed to apply new patches to a different site. Patches were to adhere&#xD;
      on their own; no supplemental tape or adhesive was permitted. If a patch partially detached,&#xD;
      participants could reapply it; however, patches that completely detached were to be replaced&#xD;
      immediately and the replacement patch would be worn for the remainder of that week. Eligible&#xD;
      patients were instructed to apply the 1st patch on the first day of their next menses (or 13&#xD;
      weeks following last medroxyprogesterone acetate injection) and to wear this patch for 7days.&#xD;
      They were then instructed to apply a new patch for weeks 2 and 3, and then be patch-free for&#xD;
      week 4. Applying a new patch on the day after week 4 ended started a new cycle. All patches&#xD;
      were to be applied/changed on the same day of the week and at approximately the same time of&#xD;
      day.&#xD;
