      The purpose of this pilot study is to compare the antimicrobial efficacy of silver&#xD;
      nanoparticle gel to a commercialized alcohol-based hand gel on bacterial counts isolated from&#xD;
      the hands of 40 volunteers seeded with Serratia marcescens, a surrogate microbial marker.&#xD;
      Specific aims of this study are: Aim #1: Compare the immediate antimicrobial efficacy of a&#xD;
      one-time application of silver nanoparticle gel (SilvaSorb , AcryMed, Inc., Portland, OR)&#xD;
      versus an alcohol-based hand gel (Purell, GoJo Industries, Akron, OH) in reducing transient&#xD;
      bacterial counts isolated from hands seeded with S. marcescens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim # 2: Compare the persistent antimicrobial efficacy of a one-time application of silver&#xD;
      nanoparticle gel (SilvaSorb) versus an alcohol-based hand gel (Purell) over a 10 minute time&#xD;
      frame in producing a persistent reduction on transient bacterial counts isolated from hands&#xD;
      seeded with S. marcescens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim # 3: Compare user acceptability of silver nanoparticle gel (SilvaSorb) versus an&#xD;
      alcohol-based hand gel (Purell) using a self-assessment questionnaire.&#xD;

      The objective of this randomized controlled, double blinded, 2x3 experimental study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of silver nanoparticle gel compared to an alcohol-based&#xD;
      hand gel on bacterial counts isolated from the hands of 40 healthy, adult, military student&#xD;
      volunteers. The study will be conducted in two phases: the first phase will consist of a&#xD;
      methods development period and the second phase will consist of the formal pilot study. For&#xD;
      phase I, the first four participants from the sample pool will be assigned into one of two&#xD;
      groups (nano-silver gel or alcohol-based gel) whereas in Phase II, the participants will be&#xD;
      randomized into one of two groups. Participants in both phases will follow a 7 day washout&#xD;
      period where subjects will refrain from using antimicrobial products for a week prior to&#xD;
      testing. Testing of participants in both phases will start with a baseline bacterial hand&#xD;
      count. This will be accomplished by using a surrogate biomarker (S. Marcescens). This&#xD;
      microorganism was selected because it is considered the standard surrogate marker to be used&#xD;
      in hand hygiene evaluations and because it produces a characteristic red colony that is&#xD;
      easily distinguishable from normal microbial populations of the hands making colony counting&#xD;
      more accurate. Sampling of bacterial flora will be accomplished utilizing an established&#xD;
      &quot;modified glove juice&quot; technique in which the participant's dominant hand is placed into a&#xD;
      large sterile bag containing a sampling solution, which removes the surrogate bacteria. Once&#xD;
      baseline samples have been collected, all participants will then complete two additional&#xD;
      random ordered timed conditions involving the surrogate biomarker and one of the two test&#xD;
      gels. For each test condition, five mL of solution will be withdrawn from the collection bag,&#xD;
      diluted, plated, and incubated for 36 hours. For the immediate efficacy testing, a glove&#xD;
      juice sampling will be obtained after a 1 minute application of the gel. For the persistent&#xD;
      efficacy testing, a glove juice sampling will be obtained after a 10 minute application of&#xD;
      the gel. To ensure the biomarker has been removed, all subjects will wash hands with a 70%&#xD;
      ethanol surgical handwash. The use of an UV-C light will also be implemented for 20 seconds&#xD;
      as an additional precaution. Participants in phase I will have an additional glove juice&#xD;
      sampling at the end of degerming to validate the protocol. All participants will end the&#xD;
      study by completing a 4 question visual analog questionnaire to determine user acceptability&#xD;
      of the gels. The percent difference of total bacterial counts from baseline will be used as&#xD;
      the outcome variable. An unpaired Student's t-test (or an appropriate non-parametric test)&#xD;
      will be used for data analysis for each of the study aims.&#xD;
