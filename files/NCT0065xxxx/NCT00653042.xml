  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of nesiritide compared to placebo when&#xD;
      given with standard of care therapies, on kidney function, heart function and the need of&#xD;
      other treatments in heart failure patients undergoing heart bypass graft surgery that&#xD;
      requires the use of a cardiopulmonary bypass machine (CPB pump or heart-lung machine).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In coronary heart disease (CHD), the coronary arteries become clogged with calcium and fatty&#xD;
      deposits. The deposits, called plaques, narrow the arteries that carry blood to the heart&#xD;
      muscle and could cause ischemic heart disease (too little blood and oxygen reaching the heart&#xD;
      muscle). Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery is a treatment option for ischemic heart&#xD;
      disease. CABG surgery is surgery to create new routes for blood to flow around narrowed and&#xD;
      blocked arteries so that the heart muscle will receive needed oxygen and nutrients. Acute&#xD;
      kidney injury is a serious risk of CABG surgery while on CPB pump (heart-lung machine), which&#xD;
      could result from ischemia during and following surgery. This study is a double-blind&#xD;
      (neither the patient nor the doctor knows whether the patient is assigned to receive study&#xD;
      drug or placebo), randomized (assigned to treatment by chance), placebo-controlled (study&#xD;
      drug results compared to placebo results) study to determine the effectiveness of nesiritide&#xD;
      compared to placebo when given to HF patients undergoing CABG surgery requiring the use of a&#xD;
      CPB pump . Patients will be enrolled into the study until 250 patients have received study&#xD;
      drug or placebo. Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      (nesiritide plus standard care: placebo plus standard care) within each site. Study&#xD;
      medication administration will be initiated after measurement of qualifying baseline&#xD;
      hemodynamics and prior to chest incision. Nesiritide or placebo will be administered as a&#xD;
      continuous IV infusion at a rate of 0.01 mcg/kg/min for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum&#xD;
      of 96 hours. Patients will be followed through 30 days from start of study drug. All patients&#xD;
      may receive additional standard care medications including inotropes, pressors, vasopressin,&#xD;
      antiarrhythmics, diuretics, nitrates, and nitric oxide as needed. Patient safety will be&#xD;
      monitored throughout the study through physical exams, vital signs (heart rate, blood&#xD;
      pressure, respiratory rate, and temperature), blood tests, and side effects. A follow-up&#xD;
      communication 180 days after the start of study drug was implemented to collect mortality&#xD;
      data. The patients assigned to the nesiritide group will receive a continuous I.V. infusion&#xD;
      at 0.010 mcg/kg/min of nesiritide for at least 24 hours and could be extended to up to 96&#xD;
      hours. The patients assigned to the placebo group will receive matching placebo.&#xD;
