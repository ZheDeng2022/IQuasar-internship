      The purpose of this study is to determine the long-term effects of Ramelteon, once daily&#xD;
      (QD), on endocrine function values.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is characterized by a complaint of either difficulties initiating and maintaining&#xD;
      sleep or of nonrestorative and non-refreshing sleep. Transient insomnia affects approximately&#xD;
      one-third to one-half of the US population, based on the results of 2 surveys of&#xD;
      representative samples of the adult US population conducted by the Gallup Organization in&#xD;
      which respondents were asked if they had &quot;ever had difficulty sleeping.&quot; Based on reports of&#xD;
      &quot;regular&quot; or &quot;frequent&quot; sleep difficulty, results from the same studies suggest that&#xD;
      approximately one-tenth of the US population experiences chronic insomnia. The ideal&#xD;
      treatment for insomnia would reduce the latency to onset of sleep and increase total sleep&#xD;
      time, without a negative impact on sleep architecture and without safety concerns or next-day&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ramelteon is a melatonin-1 receptor agonist under global development by Takeda Chemical&#xD;
      Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan, for the treatment of transient and chronic insomnia and for&#xD;
      the treatment of Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has been designed to determine the long-term (6 month) effects of Ramelteon on&#xD;
      endocrine function values. Study participation is anticipated to be about 7 months.&#xD;
