      This trial consists of two parts: a partially blinded dose-finding part followed by an&#xD;
      open-label part with the recommended dose of TMC114/RTV. The dose-finding part of this trial&#xD;
      consisted of a randomized controlled (standard of care), partially blinded, Phase II trial to&#xD;
      determine the antiviral activity, safety and tolerability of TMC114, formulated as an oral&#xD;
      tablet, and administered with a low dose of ritonavir. The pharmacokinetics of TMC114 are&#xD;
      also assessed.Three hundred HIV-1 infected patients who were three-class-experienced and who&#xD;
      were on a stable PI-containing regimen at screening for at least 8 weeks and who had plasma&#xD;
      HIV-1 RNA &gt; 1000 copies/mL were eligible. Three-class experience was defined as prior&#xD;
      treatment with ³ 2 NRTIs for at least 3 months in total and ³ 1 NNRTI as part of a failing&#xD;
      regimen. In addition, patients had to have received at least one PI for at least 3 months in&#xD;
      the past and had to have at least 1 primary PI mutation (according to IAS definitions) at&#xD;
      screening.As soon as all results to determine eligibility were available, and no later than 2&#xD;
      weeks prior to the baseline visit, the patients were randomized to one of 4 TMC114/RTV&#xD;
      treatment groups or to a control group (standard of care). At baseline, patients changed to&#xD;
      an investigator selected PI(s) regimen or TMC114/RTV plus optimized background regimen (OBR)&#xD;
      consisting of NRTIs with or without T-20.In the dose-finding part of the trial, the primary&#xD;
      objective of the trial was to evaluate the dose-response relationship in antiviral activity&#xD;
      between the TMC114 /RTV treatment groups at 24 weeks. The recommended dose has been selected&#xD;
      based on two joint interim analyses of this trial and of a similar trial (TMC114-C202,&#xD;
      conducted in the United States of America, Puerto Rico, and Argentina) including&#xD;
      approximately 150 patients in each of the two dose-finding trials (TMC114-C202 + TMC114-C213)&#xD;
      who reached Weeks 16 and 24 or dropped out earlier. The Week 24 interim analysis included a&#xD;
      total of 497 patients, of whom 329 had reached Week 24 or discontinued earlier. Based on the&#xD;
      results of these two joint interim analyses, TMC114/RTV 600/100 mg b.i.d. was selected as the&#xD;
      recommended dose for the open-label part of this trial and for future trials in&#xD;
      treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected patients. The recommended dose of TMC114/RTV was not&#xD;
      communicated to the investigators until the data cut-off date for the primary efficacy&#xD;
      analysis of the two dose-finding trials was reached.The primary efficacy analysis was&#xD;
      performed when approximately 300 patients in this trial reached 24 weeks of treatment or&#xD;
      discontinued earlier (i.e., the primary endpoint, which was reached on 1 February 2005; A&#xD;
      total of 318 patients were included in the analysis of whom 301 reached Week 24 or&#xD;
      discontinued earlier). In this primary efficacy analysis, all TMC114 groups were compared to&#xD;
      the control group by means of the confirmed virologic response at Week 24, defined as a drop&#xD;
      in viral load of at least 1 log10 versus baseline. This primary efficacy analysis confirmed&#xD;
      that TMC114/RTV 600/100 mg b.i.d. is the recommended dose for treatment-experienced HIV-1&#xD;
      infected patients.After the primary endpoint of the trial was reached (1 February 2005), and&#xD;
      after approval of the related protocol amendment by the relevant IEC/IRB and authorities, the&#xD;
      patients in the TMC114/RTV groups were instructed to switch to the recommended dose of&#xD;
      TMC114/RTV (600/100 mg b.i.d.) in the open-label part of the trial.In addition, long term&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and the durability of antiviral activity of TMC114/RTV over 144 weeks in&#xD;
      3-class-experienced HIV-1 infected patients will be evaluated. The trial includes a screening&#xD;
      period of a maximum of 6 weeks, and a 144-week treatment period followed by a 4-week&#xD;
      follow-up period. The maximum duration of the trial will be 154 weeks.Tibotec will provide&#xD;
      follow-up treatment with TMC114/RTV for all patients who continue to benefit from treatment&#xD;
      with TMC114/RTV. TMC114 will be provided until the drug is commercially available or until&#xD;
      its development is discontinued.The patient will remain on the study until he/she no longer&#xD;
      benefits from TMC114/RTV, as judged by the investigator, or he/she meets one of the&#xD;
      withdrawal criteria. Dose-finding part of the trial: 400 mg/100 mg q.d. TMC114/RTV or 800&#xD;
      mg/100 mg q.d. TMC114/RTV or 400 mg/100 mg b.i.d. TMC114/RTV or 600 mg/100 mg b.i.d.&#xD;
      TMC114/RTV. Open-label part of the trial: 600 mg/100 mg b.i.d. TMC114/RTV. Total treatment&#xD;
      duration of 144 weeks.&#xD;
