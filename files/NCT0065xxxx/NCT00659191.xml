    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I single and repeat dose escalation study of GSK1265744 in healthy&#xD;
      subjects and a single repeat dose cohort in HIV-1 infected subjects. The study is planned to&#xD;
      consist of three parts. Part A will enroll two cohorts with a total of 18 subjects in a&#xD;
      single dose escalation to evaluate safety, tolerability and PK. Part B plans to enroll three&#xD;
      cohorts of 10 subjects to evaluate repeat doses of GSK126744 on safety, tolerability and PK.&#xD;
      Part A and B will enroll healthy volunteers. Part C will enroll HIV-1 patients in a single&#xD;
      cohort of 10 subjects. This cohort will evaluate the effects of repeat dose on safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, PK and efficacy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parts A and B: The subject is healthy. Healthy as determined by a responsible&#xD;
             physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical&#xD;
             examination, laboratory tests and 12-lead ECG. A subject with a clinical abnormality&#xD;
             or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied&#xD;
             may be included only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the&#xD;
             finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with&#xD;
             the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female between 18 and 55 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential&#xD;

             (removal of the ovaries) or hysterectomy, or Is post-menopausal defined as 12 months&#xD;
             of spontaneous amenorrhea. A follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level will be&#xD;
             performed to confirm a post-menopausal status. For this study, FSH levels &gt; 40 mlU/ml&#xD;
             is confirmatory.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Part C: HIV-infected cohort only: A pre-baseline viral load measurement will be&#xD;
             obtained 7-14 days after the screening visit. The pre-baseline viral load must be&#xD;
             within 0.7 log of the screening HIV-1 RNA and must meet the screening HIV-1 RNA (i.e.,&#xD;
