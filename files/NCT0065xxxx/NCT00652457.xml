      To determine if memantine in doses of 10 mg BID affects memory, cognition, and behavior in&#xD;
      patients with Huntington's disease (HD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Results of several published clinical trials suggest that memantine has a beneficial effect&#xD;
      in dementing conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease; however, the effects of memantine on&#xD;
      cognitive and behavioral function in HD are unknown. Our hypotheses are that HD patients who&#xD;
      are administered memantine will show improved performance on psychometric tests of memory and&#xD;
      executive functions in addition to behavior and that patients treated with memantine will&#xD;
      show more improvement after six months than after three months of treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test - Revised for Delayed Recall (HVLT-R-delayed Recall)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months from start of drug treatment, 6 months from start of drug treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The HVLT-R consists of 3 parts. Free recall has a range of 0 to 36, delayed recall has a range from 0 to 12, and delayed recognition has a range of -12 to 12. Higher scores indicating better function in all 3 parts. Standardized scores are used by calculating an average standardized z score for each part of the HVLT-R. Change is calculated by subtracting baseline value from the respective later time point value. Imputation methods were used to determine values for all alive patients missing the post-baseline assessments. This tool is being used to measure cognitive function, specifically memory.</description>

    <measure>Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months from start of drug treatment, 6 months from start of drug treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) assesses the frequency and severity of 12 common behavioral symptoms in dementia.&#xD;
The NPI Score is calculated by multiplying the total reported frequency by the severity score, with a theoretical range of 0-1704: high scores indicating greater frequency by severity.&#xD;
The change between 2 or more time points is being reported.</description>
