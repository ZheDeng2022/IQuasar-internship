  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study it is hypothesized that a reduction of the inflammatory status may&#xD;
      prevent the occurrence of disorders and diseases related to overweight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the effects of nutritional compounds will be studied in overweight men with a&#xD;
      low grade inflammatory status. We will investigate the effects of 3 different food treatments&#xD;
      as compared to a placebo on markers of inflammation and on parameters of glucose and fat&#xD;
      metabolism. The three different food treatments are a food mix and two yogurts each&#xD;
      containing different probiotic strains. The food mix is composed of a mix of nutritional&#xD;
      components, each reported to affect inflammation parameters and (or) anti-oxidant status but&#xD;
      different in their -hypothesized-mode of action.&#xD;

      From day -01 onwards until the end of the study, subjects will come to TNO every week. Each&#xD;
      of the four study periods will be performed identically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first study period, on days -01, 07, 14, 21 and 28, subjects will come to TNO for&#xD;
      collection of study substances for the coming week. On days 14, 21 and 28 they will come in a&#xD;
      fasting state in the morning for blood sampling (fasting). Fasting blood samples will be&#xD;
      taken by venapuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After having received new study substances and the diary for the coming week, subjects can&#xD;
      leave TNO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 34, subjects will come to TNO at around 8:00 am and they will stay at TNO till about&#xD;
      11:00 for an oral glucose tolerance test. Fasting blood samples will be collected for&#xD;
      determining treatment parameters. Subsequently subjects are provided the oral glucose load of&#xD;
      75 g glucose dissolved in 300 ml water. Blood samples will be taken at t= 90 and 120 min&#xD;
      after the glucose load. After the last sample of the OGTT has been collected, subjects will&#xD;
      be asked to void their bladder and afterwards receive a bottle for collection of 24 hour&#xD;
      urine. The subjects will receive a free breakfast and can leave TNO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next day, on Day 35, subjects consume the breakfast as provided by TNO at home at around&#xD;
      8:00.They will come to TNO at around 11:00 am and they will stay at TNO till about 20:00. In&#xD;
      addition, they will turn in the urine bottle after having voided their bladder at 24 after&#xD;
      start of collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A canula will be inserted for collection of samples the rest of the day. At four hours after&#xD;
      consumption subjects are provided a high fat meal. Blood samples will be taken at t = 30, 60,&#xD;
      120, 180, 240 and 360 min after the meal. Throughout the challenge sampling subjects are only&#xD;
      allowed to drink water. After the last sample of the test has been taken subjects will&#xD;
      receive a free dinner. After dinner an adipose tissue biopsy will be taken under local&#xD;
      anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will receive new study substances and diary for the coming week, starting on the&#xD;
      next day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the next three study periods, the procedure will be identical.&#xD;
