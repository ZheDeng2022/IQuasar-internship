  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be recruited from comparable inpatient units that have been randomized as&#xD;
      either interventional (Group 1) or control (Group 2) units. Patients in the interventional&#xD;
      group will receive a comprehensive individualized diabetes education program coordinated by a&#xD;
      certified diabetes educator. Patients in Group 2 will receive education from clinical staff&#xD;
      as it is typically provided. Assessment of patient satisfaction with both inpatient and&#xD;
      outpatient care, quality of life, and diabetes self-management skills (including emergency&#xD;
      room visits and readmissions) will be measured using surveys completed during hospitalization&#xD;
      and 4 months after discharge to determine any differences between the two groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be recruited from matched sets of inpatient units determined to be comparable&#xD;
      in terms of staffing and types of patients admitted. One unit from each matched set will be&#xD;
      selected as the intervention unit (Group 1) or the control unit (Group 2) as determined by a&#xD;
      random draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 patients will receive the coordinated inpatient diabetes education program (IDEP).&#xD;
      Patients will be initially evaluated by a certified diabetes educator (CDE) to assess&#xD;
      diabetes knowledge and to set priorities for &quot;survival skills&quot; education. Based on this&#xD;
      individualized evaluation, a structured education plan will be devised and implemented by the&#xD;
      CDE. The structured education plan will be modified as needed throughout the hospital stay to&#xD;
      utilize more appropriate educational methods based on patient availability, condition or&#xD;
      educational needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (Control) will receive diabetes education as it is presently provided in our facility&#xD;
      by the clinical staff. The staff nurse will be alerted that the patient is a participant in&#xD;
      the research study and will record education provided in the electronic medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The modified Michigan Diabetes Research and Training Center's Brief Diabetes Knowledge Test&#xD;
      (DKT) and the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQs), if diabetes was&#xD;
      pre-existing, will be administered initially to all patients by a member of the research&#xD;
      team. If appropriate, the patient will be asked by the research team to complete a Quality of&#xD;
      Life Survey (The Medical Outcomes Survey (MOS) Short-Form 36 (SF-36) General Health Survey&#xD;
      prior to discharge. Completion of the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire -&#xD;
      Inpatient (DTSQ-IP) will also be requested of the patient prior to discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be contacted 4 months after discharge for a similar assessment of&#xD;
      quality of life and patient satisfaction with diabetes treatment, and for an additional&#xD;
      assessment of diabetes self-management practices which includes the number of emergency room&#xD;
      visits and readmissions since discharge. Comparisons will be made between the two groups and&#xD;
      between baseline and follow-up assessments.&#xD;
