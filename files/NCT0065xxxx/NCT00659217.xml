    <textblock>
      Mesenchymal Stem Cell (MSC) has been shown to have immunosuppressive and repairing&#xD;
      properties. Manifestations of systemic lupus eryhematosus(SLE) may in most patients be&#xD;
      ameliorated with medications that suppress the immune system. Nevertheless, there remains a&#xD;
      subset of SLE patients for whom current strategies are insufficient to control disease. The&#xD;
      investigators will infuse expanded autologous MSC into patients with lupus Nephritis. The&#xD;
      purpose of this trial is to evaluate whether this new therapeutical approach will result in&#xD;
      improvement in the lupus disease.&#xD;

      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), or marrow stromal cells, are multipotential cells that reside&#xD;
      within the bone marrow and can be induced to differentiate into various components of the&#xD;
      marrow microenvironment, such as bone, adipose and stromal tissues under proper conditions.&#xD;
      It has been reported that MSCs can suppress maturation, activation and proliferation of T, B,&#xD;
      NK and DC cell in vitro and downregulate immune response in vivo. MSCs are presently being&#xD;
      cotransplantated with hematopoietic stem cell, which can facilitates engraftment of&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cells and prevent GVHD. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an&#xD;
      autoimmune disorder that affects many organ systems. Autoimmune diseases are illnesses that&#xD;
      occur when the body's tissues are attacked by its own immune system. Patients with lupus&#xD;
      produce abnormal antibodies in their blood that target tissues within their own body. Because&#xD;
      the antibodies and accompanying cells of inflammation can involve tissues anywhere in the&#xD;
      body, lupus has the potential to affect a variety of areas of the body. The origin of&#xD;
      autoantibody production in SLE is unclear but a role has been suggested for an antigen driven&#xD;
      process, spontaneous B-cell hyper-responsiveness, or impaired immune regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BXSB mouse strain spontaneously develops a progressive and lethal autoimmune disease,&#xD;
      similar to human SLE. In our previous work we found that transplantation of MSCs could&#xD;
      alleviate the symptoms of BXSB mouse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of expanded autologous MSC infusions in&#xD;
      patients with primary and treatment -refractory SLE. This study will last 2 years.&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to receive either the prednisone (Group 1) or MSC infusions&#xD;
      alone (Group 2). Patients will undergo MSC infusions at the start of the study on Day 0. One&#xD;
      year post- infusions, Patients will be clinically assessed and evaluated for MSC and disease&#xD;
      response, and participants will undergo kidney biopsies at 12 Months.&#xD;
