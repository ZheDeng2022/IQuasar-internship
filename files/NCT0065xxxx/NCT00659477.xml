  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the study is to compare two treatment regimens (insulin Lantus as basal insulin vs&#xD;
      insulin NPH) plus oral antidiabetics in type 2 diabetic patients and confirm superiority of&#xD;
      insulin glargine. Comparison is focused on: blood glucose (BG) variability of the two&#xD;
      treatment regimens, quality of diabetes compensation (HbA1c, FBG/Fasting blood glucose), body&#xD;
      weight development, dose of insulin and occurrence of symptomatic hypoglycaemia and other&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Diabetes type 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients treated NPH insulin with stable dosage of OADs (Oral antidiabetic drugs) for&#xD;
             at least 2 months prior to study start and OADs treatment with metformin at least 1,7&#xD;
             g /day in combination with sulfonylurea or glinides.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a HbA1c range of &gt;= 4,5% ( 6,2% DCCT/Diabetes Control and&#xD;
             Complication Trials) and &lt;= 8% ( 9,4 % DCCT/Diabetes Control and Complication Trials)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability and willingness to perform continuous glucose monitoring system / CGMS&#xD;
             (examination within the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent obtained prior to enrollment in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women are either not of childbearing potential or women of childbearing potential must&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Active proliferative diabetic retinopathy, as defined by the application of&#xD;
             photocoagulation or surgery, in the 6 months before study entry or any other unstable&#xD;
             rapidly progressing retinopathy that may require photocoagulation or surgery during&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;

             return for follow-up visits and unlikelihood of completing the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Use of insulin glargine outside the scope of the current SPC (Summary of Product&#xD;
