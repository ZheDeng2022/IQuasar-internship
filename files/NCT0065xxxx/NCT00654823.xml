  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to develop a personalized pharmacogenetic approach including the major genetic&#xD;
      markers of warfarin (coumadin) dosing and patients' age and weight. The known genetic&#xD;
      determinants include several functional and common polymorphisms in CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes,&#xD;
      which explain the low-end of warfarin dosing range and mostly occur in patients of Caucasian&#xD;
      and Chinese origins. We identified a new VKORC1 polymorphism that is specifically indicative&#xD;
      of the high dose requirements and is dominant over the dose-reducing effect of the known&#xD;
      CYP2C9 and VKORC1 markers. This marker is significantly over-represented in Jews of Ethiopian&#xD;
      origin, but is also common in Ashkenazis, it is also linked to the VKORC1 genetic markers&#xD;
      characteristic of the Afro-American population (published in Blood 2007, 109:2477-80). This&#xD;
      information prompts the development of a more inclusive and universal diagnostic approach to&#xD;
      the individualized warfarin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims at evaluation of our novel pharmacogenetic model for predicting&#xD;
      warfarin (coumadin) dose response on the basis of patient's genetic markers of warfarin&#xD;
      sensitivity and resistance, and other patient specific factors. To this end, we proposes to&#xD;
      re-evaluate our previously developed pharmacogenetic model in stabilized warfarin treated&#xD;
      patients (N=200) and then to implement it in a prospective study of patients new on warfarin&#xD;
      as compared to the &quot;traditionally&quot; treated patients (N=500).&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, most warfarin-related pharmacogenetic studies are cross-sectional or retrospective&#xD;
      association studies. There have been no prospective studies designed to evaluate the impact&#xD;
      of genotype-guided compared to the &quot;traditional&quot; trial and error approach currently used in&#xD;
      clinical practice. The present study is designed to prospectively evaluate the impact of a&#xD;
      combined pharmacogenetic warfarin dosing prediction model on the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      warfarin treatment in a community based setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop and validate a genotype-based prediction model for warfarin dosing&#xD;
           optimization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To prospectively compare anticoagulation quality and clinical outcomes in&#xD;
           genotype-guided warfarin dosed patients versus &quot;traditional&quot; dosed patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed at the Molecular Lab at the Institute of Human Genetics, Sheba&#xD;
      Medical Center in collaboration with the Maccabi Health Care facilities, Israel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study I: A cross sectional study to develop and validate a genotype-based prediction warfarin&#xD;
      dosing model, including two hundred (200) unselected patients at steady-state warfarin&#xD;
      anticoagulation defined by stable therapeutic INR's (±10%) achieved by stable warfarin doses&#xD;
      (±10%) over 3 months identified from the Maccabi database. Informed consent will be obtained&#xD;
      by the treating physicians who will also document demographic and clinical data including&#xD;
      age, gender, body weight, ethnic background, indication for warfarin treatment, additional&#xD;
      medical problems and concomitant medications on appropriate forms (included in the CRF). A&#xD;
      5cc fresh whole blood sample will be drawn from each patient at the next routine INR&#xD;
      monitoring venepuncture and after anonymization, will be delivered to the Genetics laboratory&#xD;
      for DNA extraction and genotyping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic analyses include multiplex analysis of at least 10 polymorphisms associated with&#xD;
      warfarin dose response that will be performed using Sequenom Mass Spectrograph technology&#xD;
      (CYP2C9*1/*2/*3, VKORC1*1/*2/*3/*4, VKORC1 Asp36Tyr, CALU Arg4Glu and EPHX1 Tyr113His).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis includes multiple regression analysis that will be employed on the data to&#xD;
      create an accurate prediction model for individual therapeutic warfarin steady-state&#xD;
      maintenance dose (dependent variable) as a function of the demographic variables and genotype&#xD;
      groups (independent variables). The accuracy of the prediction model will be cross-validated&#xD;
      with our previous data on warfarin-treated patients at steady state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study II: A prospective controlled trial to compare laboratory and clinical anticoagulation&#xD;
      outcomes in genotype-guided warfarin dosed patients versus &quot;traditionally&quot; dosed patients,&#xD;
      including five hundred (500) patients commencing warfarin therapy for standard indications&#xD;
      and confirming informed consent will be recruited by Maccabi physicians (who will receive a&#xD;
      training session prior to the study) at the time of their 1st Maccabi laboratory INR&#xD;
      monitoring visit. Demographic and clinical data will be recorded as above. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned into one of two dosing groups: (1) genotype-guided warfarin dosing group&#xD;
      (N=250); (2) traditional dosing group (N=250).A single 5cc fresh whole blood sample will be&#xD;
      drawn in the same venepuncture used for the INR determination, for DNA extraction and&#xD;
      anonymized genotyping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic analyses include an immediate analysis of 4 most significant markers of warfarin dose&#xD;
      response (CYP2C9*1/*2/*3, VKORC1*2 haplotype and VKORC1 Asp36Tyr) that will be performed&#xD;
      using Real Time PCR or PRONTO methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controlled trial: For patients in the genotype-dosing group Maccabi physicians will receive&#xD;
      dosing recommendations based on the prediction model validated in study I, within 48 hours.&#xD;
      Genotype-based dosing recommendations will be subject to changes by the treating physicians&#xD;
      based on their own clinical judgment. All dose-recommendation changes will be recorded and&#xD;
      analyzed. Patients assigned to the traditional dosing group will be dosed by their Maccabi&#xD;
      physician according to accepted clinical practice, (using repeated INR measurements and&#xD;
      warfarin dose changes as required by physician judgment). For standardization purposes,&#xD;
      warfarin dose adjustments will be carried out according to a predefined algorithm. All&#xD;
      patients will be followed up until they achieve stable anticoagulation, defined as 3&#xD;
      scheduled visits to the anticoagulation clinic follow up program within at least 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Each follow up visit will include a short interview, INR measurement and warfarin dosing&#xD;
      schedule including timing of the next visit. At each visit the following data will be&#xD;
      recorded: major active medical problems, INR value and next warfarin daily dose, use of and&#xD;
      changes in concurrent medications, dietary intake changes or other possible explanations for&#xD;
      inadequate (excessive or under) anticoagulation, changes from scheduled warfarin daily doses&#xD;
      and occurrence of minor or major bleeding episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: Efficiency and safety of warfarin anticoagulation will be compared between the&#xD;
      two study groups applying appropriate statistical methods to the following outcome variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mean number of visits from recruitment to stable anticoagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mean number of INR measurements required from recruitment to stable anticoagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Proportion of visits with excessive INR values (above the upper limit of the therapeutic&#xD;
           INR value).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Proportion of visits with INR values below the lower limit of the therapeutic INR&#xD;
           value).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Number of required changes in warfarin daily doses during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Number of major and minor bleeding episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Benefit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating patients will benefit from early delivery to their treating physician of&#xD;
      information relevant to their genetic propensity for requiring high, intermediate or low&#xD;
      warfarin doses, possible shortening of their time of treatment titration and possible&#xD;
      decreases in their likelihood to experience dose-related complications. There is no envisaged&#xD;
      harm to recruited patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organizational Benefit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive results will be implemented as proof of concept, in a project for developing a&#xD;
      user-friendly point-of-care pharmacogenetic diagnostic technology.&#xD;
