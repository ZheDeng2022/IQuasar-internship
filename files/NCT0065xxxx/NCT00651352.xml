                  study session, unstable or worsening angina pectoris, Prinzmetal's angina or&#xD;
                  severe cardiac arrhythmia).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. A medical history which, in the opinion of the investigator, might impact the&#xD;
                  validity of the study results and may require pharmacotherapy or prevent the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject has been treated with any known enzyme-altering agents (e.g., barbiturates,&#xD;

             session.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has used any nicotine replacement therapy within 21 days prior to the first&#xD;
