  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will investigate whether four doses of RN1001 (20ng, 50ng, 100ng and 200ng) are&#xD;
      efficacious in preventing or reducing the resultant scar, as compared to placebo, when&#xD;
      applied intradermally to wound margins following excision of benign naevi situated on the&#xD;
      head and neck.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Male and female subjects (aged between 18-85 years) with one or more benign head &amp; neck naevi&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be randomised to a particular dose group, depending on the number of naevi&#xD;
      suitable for excision. For example, patients with one excised naevi will receive either a&#xD;
      dose of one of the concentrations of RN1001, or placebo. A patient with 2 excised naevi will&#xD;
      receive an active dose, and placebo. Patients with 3 excised naevi will receive 2 active&#xD;
      doses, plus placebo, and patient with four excised naevi will receive 3 active doses plus&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Naevi will be excised using punch biopsy, and then closed with standard sutures. Following&#xD;
      wound closure, the study drug (active RN1001 or placebo) will be administered via intradermal&#xD;
      injection at a rate of 100ul per linear cm of wound margin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital and film photography will be taken pre-dose and post dose (Day 0, day 14, day 28,&#xD;
      Month 2, 3, 6 &amp; 12, and thereafter at M24, M36, M48 &amp; M60). Additionally, scar assessments&#xD;
      (completed by Investigator, Research Nurse &amp; Medical photographer) will be completed at&#xD;
      follow up visits from Day 20 onwards. Silicone moulds of the scars will be taken at M6, M12&#xD;
      and then annually to M60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be requested to complete a questionnaire to rate their scar&#xD;
      expectations/assessment on a total of 5 occasions (screening, Day 0, Month 3, Month 6 &amp; Month&#xD;
      12)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Weight between 50 and 150kg and a body mass index within the permitted range for their&#xD;
             height, using Quetelet's index-weight (kg)/heightÂ² (m). The permitted index is between&#xD;
             15-55.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with one or more benign head and neck naevi which when measured are at least&#xD;
             3cm apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are aged 18-85 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who on examination have a naevus or naevi, which appear clinically suspicious&#xD;
             of malignancy and therefore require specialist referral and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who on direct questioning and physical examination have a history or evidence&#xD;
             of hypertrophic or keloid scarring or tattoo(s) or previous scar(s) in the area to be&#xD;
             excised.&#xD;
