      RATIONALE: Hormone therapy using letrozole may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of&#xD;
      estrogen the body makes. Giving letrozole before surgery allows us to monitor the effects of&#xD;
      letrozole on the tumor on a molecular level and determine markers of response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This study will show us how well letrozole works in treating postmenopausal women&#xD;
      with stage I, II or III breast cancer that can be removed by surgery.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary To determine that in breast tumors that continue to exhibit high proliferation (i.e.,&#xD;
      Ki67) upon hormone deprivation (with letrozole), their gene expression and/or a mutational or&#xD;
      proteomic signatures will harbor molecules or 'pathways' that are biomarkers of resistance to&#xD;
      endocrine therapy or a cause of it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate goal of these aims is to identify clinically-targetable pathways which can be&#xD;
      exploited to enhance responses and survival in patients with ER+ breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral letrozole once daily for 7-21 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 24 hours after the last dose of letrozole,&#xD;
      patients undergo total mastectomy or segmental resection with lymph node evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-treatment diagnostic breast tissue is obtained. Patients undergo treatment and then&#xD;
      undergo standard of care mastectomy or lumpectomy. Pre and post treatment tumor tissue&#xD;
      samples are analyzed for Ki67, P-ER, ER, progesterone receptor (PR), and caspase 3 by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry; and RNA microarray.&#xD;
