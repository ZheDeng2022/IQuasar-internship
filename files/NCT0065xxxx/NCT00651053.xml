  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a investigator-initiated, single-center, prospective study to evaluate endoscopic&#xD;
      ultrasound (EUS) as a diagnostic test for chronic pancreatitis (CP). EUS detects&#xD;
      abnormalities of the pancreas that may represent scarring from CP. The validation of any new&#xD;
      test requires a comparison with the best available reference standards. There is no true&#xD;
      &quot;gold standard&quot; for diagnosis of CP; however, pancreatic function testing (PFT) is highly&#xD;
      sensitive for exocrine dysfunction as a surrogate for early fibrosis, and is widely&#xD;
      considered the non-histologic gold standard. There are no well-designed prospective studies&#xD;
      comparing EUS with PFT as reference standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EUS detects parenchymal and ductal features of CP said to correlate with fibrosis. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that a predominance of parenchymal fibrosis results in diminished acinar-cell&#xD;
      secretion of enzymes. Conversely, a predominance of ductal fibrosis results in impairment of&#xD;
      ductal secretion of bicarbonate. Because secretin and cholecystokinin (CCK) PFTs measure&#xD;
      unique aspects of pancreatic function (duct-cell and acinar-cell function, respectively), the&#xD;
      use of both hormonal stimulants will allow the most comprehensive investigation of the&#xD;
      significance of EUS features. There are no studies comparing EUS with combined or dual&#xD;
      performance of secretin and CCK PFTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the test characteristics of EUS for&#xD;
      diagnosis of CP compared with dual secretin- and CCK- stimulated PFTs as reference standard.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include to: 1. Determine the optimal number and relative functional&#xD;
      importance of specific EUS criteria, 2. Compare the test characteristics of linear- and&#xD;
      radial-array EUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      190 patients evaluated for pancreatitis or pancreatic-type abdominal pain will undergo the&#xD;
      &quot;new test&quot; (radial and linear EUS) and the reference standard (CCK and secretin PFTs). The&#xD;
      EUS examinations will be videotaped and interpreted in a blinded fashion. EUS scores will be&#xD;
      compared with PFT results to allow the calculation of sensitivity and specificity of linear&#xD;
      and radial EUS. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis will be used to determine&#xD;
      the optimal number of EUS criteria for diagnosis.&#xD;
