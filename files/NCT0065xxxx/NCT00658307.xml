  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been suggested that the therapeutic effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (rTMS) are mediated through changes in cortical inhibition (CI). However, in&#xD;
      healthy subjects the effects of rTMS on CI have been inconsistent. The aim of this study is&#xD;
      to explore different rTMS - stimulus conditions neurophysiological and molecular mechanisms&#xD;
      in the human motor cortex. Fifty-six healthy subjects will be randomized into three different&#xD;
      treatment groups and receive 1 active or sham rTMS session (6000 rTMS pulses) at 90% of their&#xD;
      motor threshold (MT). Cortical inhibition will be indexed pre and post treatment using&#xD;
      short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), cortical silent period (CSP) and&#xD;
      long-interval cortical inhibition (LICI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous studies we hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 1: rTMS will result in a greater CI (i.e., prolonged CSP, increased LICI but&#xD;
           not SICI) compared to sham rTMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 2: 20 Hz rTMS will result in a significantly greater CI compared to 1 Hz&#xD;
           rTMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 3: There will be distinctive transcription profiles associated with increases&#xD;
           in CI from rTMS that can be detected with whole-genome microarray analysis of peripheral&#xD;
           leukocytes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated that several neurologic and psychiatry disorders are associated with&#xD;
      dysfunctional cortical inhibitory mechanisms and alterations in neurotrophins (biological&#xD;
      markers involved in neuronal survival and plasticity) and that rTMS therapeutic effects are&#xD;
      associated with changes in cortical excitability. CI produced by rTMS can be demonstrated&#xD;
      through SICI, CSP and LICI. However it remains unclear which rTMS parameters induce the best&#xD;
      CI. Exploring different rTMS stimulus conditions versus sham condition effects in CI of human&#xD;
      motor cortex can be the way to identify the best rTMS therapeutic parameters. Also,&#xD;
      evaluating the molecular effects produced by rTMS treatment on serum blood levels can help&#xD;
      identify the mechanisms through which rTMS exerts its therapeutic effects and ultimately&#xD;
      clarify mechanisms through which treatment effects are mediated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This experiment intends to demonstrate the best rTMS parameters to acquire higher CI. If our&#xD;
      hypotheses are correct, these parameters will help to obtain higher therapeutic effects, and&#xD;
      consequently, improvement of rTMS treatments.&#xD;
