    <textblock>
      This project has the long-term goal of designing and validating a psychometrically sound&#xD;
      inventory of PTSD-related functional impairment for active duty service members and veterans.&#xD;
      The inventory will include assessments of multiple dimensions of functional impairment and&#xD;
      their impact on quality of life and explicitly show how PTSD symptoms are related to&#xD;
      functional impairment. By creating and validating an inventory to assess PTSD-related&#xD;
      functioning--as they are perceived and reported by active military personnel and veterans--we&#xD;
      hope to offer a useful tool for clinicians, researchers and military leaders. A measure of&#xD;
      PTSD-related functional impairment will have enormous value from a health care perspective in&#xD;
      terms of identifying individuals with the disorder and for promoting more efficient&#xD;
      allocation of resources and efforts towards those who are in most need. We anticipate that&#xD;
      the end product of this study, an efficient, empirically-based measure of PTSD-related&#xD;
      functional impairment will have an immediate impact on the assessment and treatment of&#xD;
      military-related PTSD, in terms of promoting more efficient allocation of resources and&#xD;
      efforts towards those who are in most need. Such a measure will also assist with PTSD-related&#xD;
      compensation and pension procedures and decisions by providing a means to more accurately&#xD;
      assess PTSD-related functional impairment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the first phase of this project, we will convene a series of focus groups, whose members&#xD;
      will be a convenience sample (n = 53) selected from veterans at the Boston VAMC. These groups&#xD;
      will be used to set forth formal definitions of the PTSD-related functional impairment&#xD;
      variables, create an item pool, and refine that pool with emphasis on standards of content&#xD;
      validity, both content relevance and content breadth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using what in psychometrics is called the rational method to instrument construction&#xD;
      (Edwards, 1970; Hulin, Drasgow, &amp; Parsons, 1983; Nunnally, 1978), the first step will be to&#xD;
      carefully delineate complete and clearly expressed written definitions of the PTSD-related&#xD;
      dimensions of functioning and quality of life. Another important source of information will&#xD;
      be veterans of various conflicts with military-related PTSD in four focus group sessions. The&#xD;
      intent will be to pose a series of structured questions aimed at eliciting group members'&#xD;
      functional impairments and quality of life issues related to their PTSD. Next, a table of&#xD;
      specifications (Aiken, 1994) will be employed to aid in the orderly construction of items&#xD;
      across content areas. In this regard, for each of the functional impairment dimensions,&#xD;
      separate aspects of the definition will be identified, and items will be written so as to&#xD;
      systematically represent these aspects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end result of these steps should be an initial pool of 30 to 35 items for each construct.&#xD;
      Consistent with classic psychometric guidelines (e.g., Nunnally, 1978), this number of items&#xD;
      should be adequate to produce individual scales with 15 to 20 items each, which, in turn (if&#xD;
      the rational approach described above has been faithfully followed), should be a sufficient&#xD;
      number to exhibit acceptable psychometric characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 has the objective of selecting the best final sets of items to measure the identified&#xD;
      dimensions of PTSD-related functional impairment as well as to assess criterion-related&#xD;
      validity. Using empirically derived item and scale characteristics, we will trim the item&#xD;
      pool to arrive at smaller, higher-quality, and more parsimonious sets. For all scales,&#xD;
      content relevance and content breadth, in line with the formal definition of each factor,&#xD;
      will be maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and additional instrumentation. The test development sample will be selected&#xD;
      in accordance with the sampling plan. Two hundred and eighty six consenting veterans at the&#xD;
      Boston VAMC will participate in interviews, each lasting approximately two hours. Eighty-five&#xD;
      percent of participants will be male and 15% will be female. We aim to collect data from&#xD;
      veterans who meet criteria for current PTSD (one-third of sample) as well as those who meet&#xD;
      criteria for lifetime but not current PTSD (one-third of sample) and those who have been&#xD;
      traumatized but do not meet criteria for current or lifetime PTSD (no PTSD; one-third of&#xD;
      sample). Further, we will collect data on a diverse sample of veterans, with representation&#xD;
      from Vietnam, Persian Gulf, and OEF/OIF conflicts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historical/demographic information will be obtained during the interview as well as through&#xD;
      chart review concerning the following variables: age, race, socioeconomic status, current&#xD;
      annual income, employment, education, and marital status. In addition, historical data&#xD;
      regarding illegal behaviors, suicide attempts, psychiatric hospitalizations, prescription&#xD;
      medications, interpersonal conflicts, and service connection disability status will be&#xD;
      collected. We will also obtain pertinent information from veterans' DD-214, including&#xD;
      declaration of combat theatre duty, military occupational specialty, and combat medals&#xD;
      awarded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTSD diagnosis will be assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV&#xD;
      (CAPS). The CAPS was designed to improve the reliability and validity of PTSD assessment.&#xD;
      Since its development, the CAPS has become the gold standard for arriving at a PTSD&#xD;
      diagnosis, either current or lifetime, and has been used in more than 200 published studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional impairment will be assessed using several established measures. The Medical&#xD;
      Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey-veterans version (SF-36V; Ware &amp; Sherbourne,&#xD;
      1992) provides eight domain scores indexing physical functioning, physical role, bodily pain,&#xD;
      general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional role, and mental health; in addition,&#xD;
      summary physical and mental health scores may be computed. The reliability and validity of&#xD;
      the SF-36 are well documented (e.g., McHorney, Ware, &amp; Raczek, 1993).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule II (WHODAS II) is a measure of&#xD;
      functional disability which assesses a wide-range of impairment and disability dimensions&#xD;
      using multi-item scales including pain, concentration, understanding and communicating,&#xD;
      mobility, self care, family burden, getting along with others, household and work activities&#xD;
      and work loss, and participation in society (Appendix A:WHODAS). The WHODAS-II is becoming&#xD;
      widely used in investigations of functional disability across wide-ranging populations,&#xD;
      including the physically ill (i.e. rheumatology, pulmonary, primary care cohorts) and&#xD;
      severely mentally ill (schizophrenic cohorts). Although patients with PTSD and related&#xD;
      anxiety disorders were included in the original multi-center development of the instrument,&#xD;
      the WHODAS-II has not been employed specifically with trauma survivors. For this study, we&#xD;
      will use the 36-item self-report version of this scale. Scores for each of the 6 individual&#xD;
      domains, as well as an overall score of global functional disability can be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) is the standard method for representing a&#xD;
      clinician's judgment of a patient's overall level of psychosocial functioning. As such, it is&#xD;
      probably the single most widely used method for assessing impairment among patients with&#xD;
      psychiatric or substance use disorders or both. The GAF requires a clinician to make an&#xD;
      overall judgment about a patient's current psychological, social, and occupational&#xD;
      functioning. In DSM-IV-TR, this rating is made on a scale from 1 to 100, with ratings of 1 to&#xD;
      10 indicating severe impairment and ratings of 91 to 100 indicating superior functioning. GAF&#xD;
      ratings of impairment are modestly associated with some indexes of social functioning, such&#xD;
      as the extent of social networks and the need for support, and with residential instability,&#xD;
      lack of employment, and poor work adjustment. In general, however, these relationships are&#xD;
      relatively weak; GAF ratings tend to be more closely associated with diagnoses and&#xD;
      psychiatric symptoms than with social and occupational functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General life satisfaction, defined as &quot;an individual's evaluation of the degree to which his&#xD;
      or her most important needs, goals, and wishes have been fulfilled&quot; (Frisch, Cornell,&#xD;
      Villanueva, &amp; Retzlaff, 1992, p. 93) will be measured using the Quality of Life Inventory&#xD;
      (Frisch, 1992), a 16-item instrument employing a Likert-type response format and producing a&#xD;
      weighted summative score across multiple facets of life satisfaction (e.g., standard of&#xD;
      living, work, home, and relationships with relatives). The psychometric qualities for this&#xD;
      measure are strong, with high test-retest and internal consistency reliability and strong&#xD;
      validity coefficients for clinical and community samples, including veterans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess malingering, participants will be completing the M-FAST (Miller, 1995). The M-FAST&#xD;
      is a brief 25-item screening interview for individuals ages 18 years and older that provides&#xD;
      preliminary information regarding the probability that he/she is feigning psychiatric&#xD;
      illness. Most malingering and symptom validity instruments assess malingered cognitive and/or&#xD;
      neuropsychological deficits. The M-FAST focuses exclusively on malingered psychiatric illness&#xD;
      including Depression, Schizophrenia, Hypervigilance, Personality Disorder, Nightmares, and a&#xD;
      Suggestibility Interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytic procedures and interpretation. Classical test theory-oriented item characteristics&#xD;
      will be computed (Aiken, 1994; Anastasi, 1982; Nunnally, 1978). For the items that are&#xD;
      accompanied by multipoint Likert-type response formats (&quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly&#xD;
      agree&quot;), frequency distributions and descriptive statistics first will be calculated. Items&#xD;
      having a symmetric response distribution will be preferred over items having a skewed&#xD;
      distribution. Finally, corrected item-total correlations, the correlations of each item's&#xD;
      score with the sum of scores on all other items measuring that construct, will be computed,&#xD;
      where appropriate to the construct. Item-total correlations are indices of an item's ability&#xD;
      to distinguish among those high and low on the attribute and thus are indicative of the&#xD;
      item's precision of measurement. Items with higher item-total correlations typically take&#xD;
      precedence over those with lower item-total correlations. Using judgments of content&#xD;
      validity, distributional and endorsement patterns and statistics, and item-total&#xD;
      correlations, a final set of items for each construct will be chosen. Estimates of internal&#xD;
      consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha) will then be calculated. At the close of Phase 2,&#xD;
      the product will be a refined inventory of PTSD-related functional impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 involves the collection of data from a second-stage test sample to support cross&#xD;
      validation and criterion-related validity. Refined measures of the previously identified&#xD;
      dimensions of PTSD-related functional impairment, along with measures of PTSD and other&#xD;
      health outcomes will be administered to an active duty sample and another veteran sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and additional instrumentation. Seventy-five percent of participants will be&#xD;
      male and 25% will be female. Participants will be administered the refined and shortened&#xD;
      version of the inventory as well as scales intended to assess physical and mental health,&#xD;
      health-related quality of life, functional impairment, and social desirability. Data&#xD;
      collection is expected to last 60-75 minutes for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the exception of the CAPS and MFAST, all of the measures used in Phase 2 will be&#xD;
      employed in Phase 3. In place of the CAPS, we will use the PTSD Checklist (PCL; Weathers et&#xD;
      al., 1993) to assess PTSD symptoms. The PCL has good sensitivity and specificity and is&#xD;
      positively correlated with standard measures of PTSD. In place of the MFAST, we will the&#xD;
      SIMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytic procedures and interpretation. Data from this test validation phase will offer a&#xD;
      second opportunity to compute internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha) for the&#xD;
      measures of functional impairment. It is important to re-estimate and reexamine internal&#xD;
      consistency on a fresh sample since the estimates derived on the same sample from which the&#xD;
      items were selected (Phase 2) take advantage of sample-specific covariation and may be&#xD;
      somewhat inflated. It is also critical to cross-validate the initial findings with an&#xD;
      independent sample in order to ensure that the items which comprise the developed functional&#xD;
      impairment scale are optimal.&#xD;
