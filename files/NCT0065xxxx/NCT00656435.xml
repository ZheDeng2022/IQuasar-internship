      Persistent or recurrent vitreous hemorrhage after vitrectomy for diabetic retinopathy&#xD;
      complications is a common occurrence with an incidence of 12% to 63%. This complication may&#xD;
      prolong vitreous clear-up and delay visual rehabilitation significantly, and sometimes&#xD;
      requires additional procedures or surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The causes of bleeding are diverse. Evidence suggests fibrovascular proliferation from the&#xD;
      sclerotomy sites or from the vitreous base may be an important source of recurrent vitreous&#xD;
      hemorrhage; other sources of bleeding include iatrogenic intraoperative injury of retinal&#xD;
      vessels, and incomplete removal of fibrovascular tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have reported on the possible benefit of peripheral retinal cryotherapy and cryotherapy&#xD;
      treatment of sclerotomy sites to prevent delayed-onset recurrent vitreous hemorrhage, and the&#xD;
      possible benefit of intravitreal long-acting gas to reduce the occurrence of early&#xD;
      postoperative recurrent vitreous hemorrhage, especially for cases with active fibrovascular&#xD;
      proliferation. However, minor recurrent vitreous hemorrhage and prolonged reabsorption of&#xD;
      lysed blood clots from surgical trauma remain important factors to cause media opacity long&#xD;
      enough to prevent quick visual rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravitreal bevacizumab has been noted to induce rapid regression of retinal and iris&#xD;
      neovascularization in proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Further, presurgical administration&#xD;
      of intravitreal bevacizumab may reduce intraoperative bleeding during membrane dissection in&#xD;
      PDR with traction retinal detachment. We hypothesize that presurgical treatment of&#xD;
      intravitreal bevacizumab may reduce intraoperative bleeding and the amount of residual blood&#xD;
      clots, while intraoperative infusion of long-acting gas may facilitate post-operative&#xD;
      recovery of surgically injured retinal vessels. These combined effects would thus enhance&#xD;
      early clear-up of vitreous opacity from clot lysis and recurrent retinal bleeding. To&#xD;
      investigate this hypothesis, a clinical prospective study was undertaken to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of bevacizumab pretreatment combined with intravitreal infusion of long-acting gas on&#xD;
      the clearance speed and the recurrence rate of early postoperative vitreous hemorrhage in&#xD;
      vitrectomy for active diabetic fibrovascular proliferation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From December 2006 to August 2007, consecutive patients undergoing primary pars plana&#xD;
      vitrectomy for active proliferative diabetic retinopathy were recruited for the prospective&#xD;
      study. Included cases should have active fibrovascular proliferation with vitreo-retinal&#xD;
      adhesions in 3 or more sites but not extending beyond equator in more than one quadrant.&#xD;
      Active fibrovascular proliferation is defined as visible new vessels within the proliferative&#xD;
      membranes with any degree of fresh vitreous or preretinal hemorrhage. Exclusion criteria are:&#xD;
      1. History of preoperative or postoperative anticoagulant therapy; 2. History of blood&#xD;
      diseases associated with abnormal coagulation; 3. Severe proliferation with anticipation of&#xD;
      silicone oil usage. Informed consent is obtained in every patient before surgery. The&#xD;
      protocol was approved by the review board and research ethics committee of National Taiwan&#xD;
      University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All cases in the study group are prospectively enrolled (group 1). Consecutive patients&#xD;
      fulfilling the enrollment criteria receive intravitreal bevacizumab (1.25mg in 0.05ml)&#xD;
      injection 7 to 9 days before surgery and intravitreal 10% C3F8 infusion at the end of&#xD;
      surgery. The surgical outcomes are compared with a non-concurrent control group that received&#xD;
      gas infusion only (group2). The control group is matched by baseline characteristics and the&#xD;
      severity of diabetic proliferation with the study group. The comparisons between the two&#xD;
      groups are possible because all the relevant parameters have been carefully documented in the&#xD;
      control group. A single surgeon (CMY) performed all of the operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative Technique For intravitreal bevacizumab injection, after topical anesthesia,&#xD;
      patients were disinfected three times with povidone-iodine solution and draped. After eyelid&#xD;
      speculum put in place, the eyes are further anesthetized with proparacaine -soaked cotton-tip&#xD;
      applicators. Bevacizumab (1.25mg in 0.05ml) is drawn into a 1 ml syringe through a 27-gauged&#xD;
      needle from a newly opened vial and injected through a 30-gauged needle into the vitreous&#xD;
      cavity via temporal lower pars plana. Anterior chamber paracentesis is not performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard 3-port pars plana vitrectomy as described previously is done in every case. In&#xD;
      short, vitreoretinal traction, fibrovascular tissues, and opacified vitreous as well as blood&#xD;
      clots adherent to the peripheral vitreous skirt are removed as completely and safely as&#xD;
      possible. Hemostasis is obtained by raising the infusion bottle, mechanical compression using&#xD;
      a soft-tipped cannula, endodiathermy, or a combination of the above techniques. Blood clots&#xD;
      formed during tissue dissection are removed carefully except on the bleeding sites where they&#xD;
      were trimmed to small islands. Panretinal photocoagulation in non-laser treated eyes or&#xD;
      supplementary laser in previously laser-treated eyes extending beyond the level of the&#xD;
      equator is performed. Further peripheral retinal cryotherapy (10 to 12 spots in one row) is&#xD;
      done. 10% C3F8 intravitreal infusion is done in each case before wound closure. Finally,&#xD;
      cryotherapy of the sclerotomy sites (1 spot, each 6 seconds, for 3 sclerotomy sites) is&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, all patients are kept in a prone position overnight, and maintained a&#xD;
      head-down position during waking hours. The patients are then allowed to lie on either side&#xD;
      during sleep for 3 weeks thereafter. Ophthalmological examinations are performed in the first&#xD;
      4 days after surgery, then weekly for 4 weeks, biweekly for 1 month, and then monthly for at&#xD;
      least 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data are collected for each patient.&#xD;
      These demographics and clinical findings included age, gender, study eye, types, duration and&#xD;
      treatment regiment of diabetes mellitus, systemic diseases such as hypertension, renal&#xD;
      insufficiency, intraoperative diagnosis, extent of vitreo-retinal adhesion, degree of&#xD;
      intraoperative bleeding, duration of the surgery, and combined lens extraction. The extent of&#xD;
      neovascularization, the severity of retinal traction, and the amount of fresh vitreous&#xD;
      hemorrhage before and one week after bevacizumab injection were documented and, if possible,&#xD;
      photographed. Data regarding the duration for vitreous clear-up; the time, duration,&#xD;
      frequency and treatment of recurrent vitreous hemorrhage; and the duration of postoperative&#xD;
      follow-up are also compiled. The extent of fibrovascular proliferation is graded as follows:&#xD;
      grade 1, focal adhesions only; grade 2, broad adhesion â‰¥ one site(s) or vitreous-retinal&#xD;
      adhesion at the disc, macula, and arcade; and grade3, vitreous-retinal attachment extending&#xD;
      to the periphery. Intraoperative bleeding is classified into 3 grades : grade 1, minor&#xD;
      bleeding that stopped either spontaneously or by transient bottle elevation; grade 2,&#xD;
      moderate bleeding requiring endodiathermy or with formation of broad sheets of clots&#xD;
      extending away from the bleeding site; grade 3, thick clot formation covering at least half&#xD;
      of the posterior pole or interfering with the surgical plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of ophthalmological examinations, including best corrected visual acuity, intraocular&#xD;
      pressure, lens status, and intravitreal gas amount, are recorded. We define vitreous clear-up&#xD;
      time (VCUT) as the interval between the end of the surgery and the time when visualization of&#xD;
      retinal vessels regained below the gas bubble. VCUT equal to or more than 3 weeks is&#xD;
      considered prolonged. We define recurrent vitreous hemorrhage as recurrent hemorrhage that&#xD;
      obscured the retinal vessels (grade 2 or above in the Diabetic Retinopathy Vitrectomy&#xD;
      Study14) for more than one week after VCUT. Both early (â‰¤ 4 weeks) and late (&gt; 4weeks)&#xD;
      recurrent vitreous hemorrhage are recorded. The severity of vitreous hemorrhage was&#xD;
      classified according to the scale defined in the Diabetic Retinopathy Vitrectomy Study, and&#xD;
      is reconfirmed by another ophthalmologist for every patient. The VCUT, the rate and treatment&#xD;
      of recurrent vitreous hemorrhage, and the change of best-corrected visual acuity were&#xD;
      compared between groups 1 and 2. Visual acuity is graded into three levels: low (â‰¤1 meter&#xD;
      counting fingers), moderate (&gt;1 meter counting fingers, but &lt; 20/200), and good (â‰¥ 20/200).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis To examine the differences among groups 1 and 2, discrete variables are&#xD;
      performed statistical analysis with chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. Continuous&#xD;
      variables are presented as mean Â± standard deviation and the Wilcoxon rank sum test was&#xD;
      performed to make comparisons among groups 1 and 2. To further verify the effect of combined&#xD;
      bevacizumab and gas treatment and to examine other possible factors affecting vitreous&#xD;
      clear-up time, we would perform multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine the&#xD;
      significance of the following factors: age, gender, duration of diabetes (&lt; 10 years or â‰¥ 10&#xD;
      years), treatment regiment of diabetes, prior pan-retinal photocoagulation, hypertension,&#xD;
      renal insufficiency, extent of fibrovascular proliferation, duration of surgery, and&#xD;
      intravitreal bevacizumab. All of the statistical analyses are performed using STATA 8.2&#xD;
      software (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas, USA). A P value &lt; 0.05 was considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
