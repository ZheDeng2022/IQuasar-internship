      This study will examine changes in brain dopamine transporter activity before and after&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a serious psychiatric disorder that affects about 10% of the adult population&#xD;
      in the United States in a given year. Common symptoms of depression include a persistent down&#xD;
      mood and disinterest in previously enjoyed activities, often causing strain on work, social,&#xD;
      and family life. A person's depression can be attributed to a variety of causes, including&#xD;
      physiological and sociological factors. Among physiological factors, dopamine (DA), a&#xD;
      chemical associated with feelings of happiness and pleasure, may play a key role in the onset&#xD;
      of depression and may also be involved in the beneficial effect of antidepressant medication.&#xD;
      Recent studies have found that people with depression have increased DA transporter (DAT)&#xD;
      levels in a specific region of the inner brain called the striatum. The increased DAT levels&#xD;
      might reflect alterations in central DA function. Treatment for depression with selective&#xD;
      serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant therapy may help in returning DAT levels&#xD;
      to normal and in improving depressive symptoms. Using single photon emission computed&#xD;
      tomography (SPECT) imaging, this study will examine changes in brain DAT activity in people&#xD;
      with depression before and after they receive SSRI antidepressant therapy or cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy (CBT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last about 14 weeks and will involve participants who are&#xD;
      healthy and depressed. All participants will first undergo baseline assessments that will&#xD;
      include a medical history, questions about current and past health, a physical exam, a blood&#xD;
      draw, a urine sampling, and an electrocardiogram (ECG). After completing the baseline&#xD;
      assessments, participants will undergo a TRODAT-1 SPECT scan, which will involve an injection&#xD;
      of TRODAT-1 (a radioactive agent to measure DA) and, after a 3-hour break, a 75-minute SPECT&#xD;
      scan. If necessary, participants may also be asked to have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      brain scan after completing the SPECT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with depression will then be assigned randomly to undergo 12 weeks of treatment&#xD;
      with either the antidepressant medication s-citalopram or CBT. Participants assigned to take&#xD;
      s-citalopram will return for study visits weekly for 2 weeks, every other week for 6 weeks,&#xD;
      and then monthly for 4 weeks. During study visits, participants will receive their&#xD;
      medication, answer questions about depression and medication side effects, and occasionally&#xD;
      fill out general health questionnaires. Participants receiving CBT will attend twice weekly&#xD;
      sessions for 2 weeks and then once weekly sessions for 10 weeks. Sessions will focus on&#xD;
      modifying thoughts and behaviors that may contribute to depression. After 12 weeks, all&#xD;
      participants will be re-evaluated by a study doctor and, if still in good health, will&#xD;
      undergo a repeat TRODAT-1 SPECT scan.&#xD;

            <title>Patients With Depression: CBT and SPECT</title>
            <description>Participants with depression will undergo TRODAT-1 SPECT imaging and treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy.&#xD;
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): Participants will attend twice weekly CBT sessions for 2 weeks and then once weekly sessions for 10 weeks. Sessions will focus on modifying thoughts and behaviors that may contribute to depression.&#xD;
TRODAT-1 single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) imaging: Participants' striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) levels will be measured using [99mTc]TRODAT-1 SPECT with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) co-localization on two separate occasions. Participants with depression will undergo TRODAT-1 SPECT imaging immediately before and after 12 weeks of their assigned treatment. Healthy participants will undergo TRODAT-1 SPECT imaging at baseline and 12 weeks later.</description>
