&#xD;
          -  Each subject shall be given a general physical examination within 28 days of&#xD;
             initiation of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Such examination includes, but is not limited to, blood pressure, general&#xD;
             observations, and history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Each female subject will be given a serum pregnancy test as part of the pre- study&#xD;
             screening process&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At the end of study, the subject will have an exit evaluation consisting of interim&#xD;
             history, global evaluation, clinical laboratory measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate blood and urine samples should be obtained within 28 days before beginning of&#xD;
             the first period and at the end of the trial for clinical laboratory measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical laboratory measurements will include hematology, clinical chemistry, urine&#xD;
             analysis, HIV screen, hepatitis-B,C screen, drugs of abuse screen before dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of chronic alcohol consumption (during past 2 years), drug&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects whose clinical laboratory test values are greater tahn 20% outside the normal&#xD;
             range may be retested.If the clinical values are out side the range on retesting the&#xD;
             subject will not be eligible to participate in the study unless the clinical&#xD;
             investigator deems the result to not be significant&#xD;

             cholestyramine should be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects will have urine samples assayed for the presence of drugs and abuse as&#xD;
             part of the clinical laboratory screening procedures and at check-in before dosing.&#xD;
             Subjects found to have urine concentrations of any of the tested drugs will not be&#xD;
             allowed to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects should not have donated blood and/or plasma for at least thirty(30) days&#xD;
             prior to the first dosing of the study.&#xD;

             or inconclusive results will be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects who are physically able to father a child will not be allowed to&#xD;
             participate. Male subjects must be vasectomized(at least 3 months) with medical&#xD;
             verification.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have taken any product containing leflunomide within 180 days of dosing&#xD;
             will not be allowed to participate in this study.&#xD;
