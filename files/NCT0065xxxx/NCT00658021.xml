    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that glycemic control, as&#xD;
      measured by change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline to endpoint, with exenatide is&#xD;
      superior to that of placebo after 28 weeks of treatment in adolescent patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes who are naïve to antidiabetes agents, or patients who are being treated with&#xD;
      metformin, an SU, or a combination of metformin and an SU&#xD;

    <measure>Adjusted Change From Baseline in Glycated Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at Week 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in HbA1c is reported as adjusted least square (LS) mean values at Week 28. Baseline is defined as the last non-missing assessment (scheduled or unscheduled) on or prior to the first dose of study medication. A mixed model with repeated measures (MMRM) analysis was performed, excluding measurements after initiation of rescue medication and study drug discontinuation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Post-Treatment Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) During Safety Follow-up Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From 1 day after the Week 28/ED visit to 3 years after Week 28/ED visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Post-treatment adverse events (AEs) were defined as AEs that started or worsened during the off-treatment period (Safety Follow-up Period), which was defined as the day after the Week 28/early discontinuation (ED) visit to the date of completion of the Safety Follow-up Period. The AESIs recorded were as follows: hematological malignancies, thyroid neoplasms, pancreas neoplasms, aplastic anemia, pancreatitis, pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes (including congenital anomalies).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving HbA1c Goals of &lt; 7%, &lt;= 6.5%, and &lt; 6.5% Through Week 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 4, 12, 20 and 28</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants achieving HbA1c goals of &lt; 7%, &lt;= 6.5%, and &lt; 6.5% through Week 28 were compared between treatments using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) procedure, in which screening HbA1c strata and background diabetes therapy strata served as the stratification factors. The CMH analysis excluded measurements after initiation of rescue medication and study drug discontinuation with missing data treated as non-responder.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adjusted Change From Baseline in Body Weight Through Week 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) up to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in body weight is reported as adjusted LS mean values at Weeks 4, 12, 20 and 28. Baseline is defined as the last non-missing assessment (scheduled or unscheduled) on or prior to the first dose of study medication. A MMRM analysis was performed, excluding measurements after initiation of rescue medication and study drug discontinuation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adjusted Change From Baseline in Fasting Serum Glucose (FSG) at Week 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in FSG is reported as adjusted LS mean values at Week 28. Baseline is defined as the last non-missing assessment (scheduled or unscheduled) on or prior to the first dose of study medication.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adjusted Change From Baseline in Self-Monitored Blood Glucose (SMBG) at Week 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-meal and 2 hours post-meal on Baseline (Day 1) and Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in SMBG measurements are reported as adjusted LS mean values at Week 28. SMBG measurements were taken before (pre-prandial) and 2 hours after (post-prandial) the 2 main meals of the day on 3 separate days during the week before baseline (Day 1) and Week 28. Post-prandial excursions were calculated as the difference between the pre-prandial and post-prandial blood glucose concentrations (post-prandial - pre-prandial) and averaged (mean) over the 2 main meals over the 3 separate days in each period. Baseline is defined as the last non-missing assessment (scheduled or unscheduled) on or prior to the first dose of study medication. An ANCOVA analysis was performed, excluding measurements after initiation of rescue medication and study drug discontinuation.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline in SMBG measurements are reported as adjusted LS mean values at Week 28. SMBG measurements were taken before (pre-prandial) and 2 hours after (post-prandial) the 2 main meals of the day on 3 separate days during the week before baseline (Day 1) and Week 28. Post-prandial excursions were calculated as the difference between the pre-prandial and post-prandial blood glucose concentrations (post-prandial - pre-prandial) and averaged (mean) over the 2 main meals over the 3 separate days in each period. Baseline is defined as the last non-missing assessment (scheduled or unscheduled) on or prior to the first dose of study medication.
