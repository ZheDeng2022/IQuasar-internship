      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn whether higher doses of stem cells can&#xD;
      help to decrease the symptoms that occur after melphalan. Another goal of the study is to see&#xD;
      how the dose of infused stem cells affects the levels of certain proteins in your blood.&#xD;
      Researchers also want to learn how the dose of stem cells that you receive affects the&#xD;
      quality of your life during the weeks after the transplant procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stem cells are found in the bone marrow and bloodstream, and they rebuild blood, bone marrow,&#xD;
      and the immune system. This study uses autologous stem cells, which are stem cells collected&#xD;
      from your own blood. Melphalan is designed to damage the DNA (the genetic material) of cells,&#xD;
      which may cause cancer cells to die. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is&#xD;
      designed to help the bone marrow to make more white blood cells. G-CSF is used in this study&#xD;
      to help move your stem cells out of the bone marrow and into the bloodstream. If your doctor&#xD;
      decides it is needed, you will also receive chemotherapy to help your blood stem cells move&#xD;
      out of your bone marrow and into your blood. This allows the stems cells to be collected.&#xD;
      Researchers also want to learn how the dose of infused stem cells affects the levels of&#xD;
      certain cytokines in your blood. Cytokines are proteins that can cause symptoms such as&#xD;
      fatigue and fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will need to have a central&#xD;
      venous catheter (CVC) placed. A CVC is a flexible sterile tube that will be placed into a&#xD;
      large vein that runs under your collarbone. Having the CVC allows blood to be drawn and&#xD;
      medications to be given more easily and with less discomfort. You will be asked to sign a&#xD;
      separate consent form to have the CVC placed, and the procedure will be more fully explained&#xD;
      to you at that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your doctor decides it is needed, you will receive chemotherapy to help your blood stem&#xD;
      cells move out of your bone marrow and into your blood. You will be asked to sign a separate&#xD;
      consent form for this chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting on the day of the stem cell infusion, you will receive G-CSF by injection under your&#xD;
      skin. You will have the G-CSF injected once or twice a day for about 10 days. The injections&#xD;
      may be given at home, if possible. You will be taught how to inject the G-CSF, or someone who&#xD;
      agrees to be responsible for giving you the injections may also be taught.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the number of stem cells in your bloodstream is high enough, the stem cells will be&#xD;
      collected over the course of 2-5 days. You will be asked to sign a separate consent form for&#xD;
      the stem cell collection, and the process will be described in more detail at that time. Not&#xD;
      counting the blood that is returned to you, about 32 tablespoons of blood will be drawn for&#xD;
      the stem cell collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will keep receiving the daily G-CSF injections on the days that your stem cells are&#xD;
      collected. A procedure called apheresis will be used to collect the stem cells. During the&#xD;
      apheresis, blood will be collected either through your CVC or from a vein in one arm. The&#xD;
      blood will be processed through a machine to remove the stem cells, and then the rest of the&#xD;
      blood will be returned to you through your CVC or through a vein in the other arm. The&#xD;
      apheresis procedure will last several hours each time. You will be asked to sign a separate&#xD;
      consent form for the apheresis procedure. You will have enough stem cells collected so that&#xD;
      you will be able to have either 1 transplant with high doses of stem cells or 2 transplants&#xD;
      with standard doses of stem cells. Your stem cells will be frozen (cryopreserved) until being&#xD;
      given back to you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 2 weeks after your stem cells have been collected, you will have chemotherapy with&#xD;
      melphalan. The melphalan will be given over 30 minutes through your CVC. Since this treatment&#xD;
      destroys the normal bone marrow in addition to the myeloma cells, your blood stem cells must&#xD;
      be given back to you. This is because blood stem cells are able to refill the bone marrow. If&#xD;
      your doctor thinks it is needed, you may be admitted to the hospital the day before you&#xD;
      receive melphalan to receive fluids by vein to hydrate you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two (2) days after receiving the melphalan, your previously collected stem cells will be&#xD;
      unfrozen and given back to you through your CVC, similar to a blood transfusion. This is&#xD;
      called an autologous stem cell transplant. You will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of a&#xD;
      coin) to receive either a standard amount of stem cells or an experimental amount of stem&#xD;
      cells. You have a 50/50 chance of being assigned to either group. After you receive your stem&#xD;
      cells, you will be given G-CSF as an injection under the skin. You will keep having G-CSF&#xD;
      injections until your white blood cell count returns to normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After your stem cells have been given back to you, it will take about 2 weeks for enough&#xD;
      blood cells to be made. During this time, it is possible that you might not be making any&#xD;
      blood cells. If this happens, you may need to have several red blood cell and platelet&#xD;
      transfusions. You will receive antibiotics if infections occur, and you may need to be given&#xD;
      feedings through the CVC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire stem cell transplantation process will be done on an outpatient basis, if&#xD;
      possible. Otherwise, you may need to stay in the hospital for up to 3-4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the stem cell transplant is completed, you will need to return to the clinic for&#xD;
      follow-up visits at least once a week for a month, or more often if the doctor feels it is&#xD;
      necessary. The follow-up visits will include the same tests and procedures as is standard of&#xD;
      care. Research blood (about 2-4 teaspoons each time) will also be drawn on Day -2, Day 0, Day&#xD;
      +3, Day +5, and Day +7; twice a week during weeks 2 and 3; and then once during week 4 for&#xD;
      immune system tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires and Physical Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At several times during the study, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire about your&#xD;
      symptoms and quality of life. Sometimes the questionnaire will be done over the phone with an&#xD;
      automated phone system. Rating your symptoms using the telephone system should take less than&#xD;
      5 minutes for each call. The rest of the time questionnaires will be performed on paper and&#xD;
      through phone interviews. You will also be asked to perform physical tests, including walking&#xD;
      for 6 minutes and getting in and out of a chair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research nurse will teach you how to use the telephone system for measuring symptoms and&#xD;
      your quality of life. You will perform the physical function tests and complete the symptom&#xD;
      questionnaire. You will also have tests of the sensitivity of the nerves in your arms and&#xD;
      legs. Blood (about 4-5 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. Completing the&#xD;
      questionnaires and tasks at this first visit should take about an hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During your hospital stay or clinic visits for the stem cell transplant, you will be asked on&#xD;
      Day -2 (2 days before the transplant), Day 0, Day +3, Day +5, and Day +7 after the transplant&#xD;
      to fill out a paper questionnaire that measures symptoms. You will also be asked on the same&#xD;
      days to complete brief tasks that measure physical function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Weeks 2 and 3 you will be asked to fill out the paper questionnaire twice a week and&#xD;
      complete the tasks of physical function once a week. During Week 4, you will be asked to fill&#xD;
      out the questionnaire once and complete the tasks of physical function once. During Week 4,&#xD;
      the sensory testing of the nerves in your arms and legs will also be repeated. On the same&#xD;
      day as the physical tests, the research nurse will ask you to practice using the telephone&#xD;
      system for measuring symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you leave the hospital or clinic, the telephone system will call you at home. The calls&#xD;
      will occur 1 time a week from Week 5 through Week 12 after the transplant, then 1 time a&#xD;
      month during Months 3, 6, and 12 (+/- 1 month). The telephone system will ask you to rate how&#xD;
      strong and tolerable the symptoms are, and how much the symptoms interfere with your daily&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the clinic visit that occurs about 90 days after the transplant, you will be asked to&#xD;
      complete brief tasks that measure physical function, and you will also have the last test of&#xD;
      the nerves in your arms and legs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be on study for about 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Melphalan with autologous stem cell transplantation is&#xD;
      FDA-approved for the treatment of myeloma and amyloidosis. The medications and treatment for&#xD;
      this study are all commercially available. Up to 100 patients will take part in this study.&#xD;
      All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
