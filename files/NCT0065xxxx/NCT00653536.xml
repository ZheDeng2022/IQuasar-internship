  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute ischemic stroke and persistent arterial occlusion following failed&#xD;
      mechanical revascularization, who can undergo NeuroFlo treatment within 18 hours of last time&#xD;
      symptom free, will be eligible for enrollment to assess the safety and feasibility of the&#xD;
      NeuroFlo catheter in treating ischemic stroke patients with persistent arterial occlusion&#xD;
      following attempted thrombectomy. The NeuroFlo catheter is designed to partially obstruct the&#xD;
      abdominal descending aorta thereby increasing blood flow to the brain. Cerebral perfusion is&#xD;
      improved by diverting more blood through vessels as well as by expansion of the collateral&#xD;
      circulation. Improved regional perfusion leads to clinical improvement.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with occlusion of a proximal artery experience prompt diversion of flow through&#xD;
      collaterals and retrograde perfusion of the occluded arterial tree. Collateral perfusion&#xD;
      sustains the penumbra and may lessen stroke severity provided recanalization of the occluded&#xD;
      artery occurs. Thrombectomy attempts to achieve recanalization of the occluded artery, but&#xD;
      36% of patients (90/252 in MERCI and MultiMERCI studies) experienced persistent arterial&#xD;
      occlusion (PAO, defined as TICI flow 0-1). PAO following attempted thrombectomy was&#xD;
      associated with high mortality, with 53% dead at 90 days. Of the survivors, only 5% achieved&#xD;
      mRS of 0-2. At present, there are no therapies that have been shown to improve these risks.&#xD;
      Data obtained from a clinically indicated CT at 24 hours will be used to monitor for safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety endpoints for this study will be the proportion of patients who experience:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mortality and neurological deterioration (defined as an increase of ≥4 points on the&#xD;
           NIHSS) at 5 days post treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in neurological status and adverse events from baseline through 30 days from&#xD;
           treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other endpoints include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in neurological status and adverse events from baseline through 90 days from&#xD;
           treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The incidence of hemorrhagic transformation or other intracerebral bleeding will be&#xD;
           assessed at 5 days post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cerebral blood flow changes associated with device therapy will be assessed through&#xD;
           multimodal CT or MRI studies acquired at baseline and 3 hours post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Potential patient benefit will be assessed through collection of neurological indices&#xD;
           (NIHSS etc.) at baseline, 24 hours post-procedure, day 5 (or discharge), 30 days and 90&#xD;
           days.&#xD;
