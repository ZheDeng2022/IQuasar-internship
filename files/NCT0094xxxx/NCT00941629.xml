  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the equivalence of CPT treatment delivered remotely&#xD;
      via telemental health (TMH) over videoconferencing or via traditional face-to face (FTF)&#xD;
      treatment to veterans who have Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) from a military-related&#xD;
      stressor (i.e., combat, sexual assault, non-combat physical assault). The secondary objective&#xD;
      is to determine if patients' ratings of PTSD symptoms, affect, social adjustment, therapy&#xD;
      alliance, treatment satisfaction and therapist satisfaction, are equivalent between&#xD;
      service-delivery conditions (TMH vs. FTF). A final objective is to develop web-based practice&#xD;
      assignments to assist participants in the TMH condition with treatment adherence (completion&#xD;
      of the between- session practice assignments).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PTSD is the most common mental health diagnosis affecting service men and women who have&#xD;
      served in Iraq and Afghanistan (OEF/OIF). Despite unprecedented efforts by the Dept. of&#xD;
      Defense (DoD) and Dept. of Veterans Affairs (VA) to treat these service personnel with mental&#xD;
      disorders, significant gaps in the continuum of care for psychological health remain,&#xD;
      specifically related to which services are offered, where services are offered, and who&#xD;
      receives services. The DoD and VA have also attempted to address problems with accessibility&#xD;
      through the development of a video teleconference (VTC) network to ensure that service&#xD;
      members have access to top-quality specialized medical care regardless of their geographical&#xD;
      location. Provision of medical treatment over VTC is often referred to as telemedicine;&#xD;
      telemental health (TMH) refers to the provision of mental health treatment over the same&#xD;
      system. A handful of studies have shown that psychiatry (primarily medication management)&#xD;
      delivered over TMH systems can be as effective as face-to-face (FTF) treatment as long as the&#xD;
      equipment and band-width are capable of delivering the communication in near real time.TMH is&#xD;
      an increasingly common method of providing psychological treatment to service members with&#xD;
      PTSD and other mental health problems, and yet there are no randomized trials of TMH&#xD;
      provision of an empirically validated treatment for PTSD compared with FTF treatment.&#xD;
      Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the treatment outcomes of patients with PTSD treated&#xD;
      with CPT either remotely via TMH or traditionally in FTF treatment.&#xD;
