      Insulin-resistance plays an important role in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)&#xD;
      physiopathology. The phosphoprotein enriched in the diabetes (PED/PEA-15), a 15 kDa protein&#xD;
      related to insulin sensitivity, is over-expressed in type 2 diabetic patients and in PCOS&#xD;
      women, independently of obesity. The effectiveness of oral contraceptives pills (OCP) or&#xD;
      metformin (MET) in PCOS management is still uncertain. Aim of this pilot clinical study was&#xD;
      to compare the effects of OCPs or MET on the expression of PED/PEA-15 in association with&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity in obese PCOS women. Outcome measures: PED/PEA-15, BMI, plasma glucose&#xD;
      and insulin, 1/HOMA-IR, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance; QUICKI,&#xD;
      quantitative insulin sensitivity check index; ISI: whole-body insulin sensitivity index.&#xD;
      Study design: twenty obese PCOS women (age: 24.7±18 yr; BMI: 30±2.4 kg/m2) were randomized&#xD;
      according to insulin sensitivity to receive 30 µg ethinylestradiol plus 30 mg drospirenone 21&#xD;
      day/month or MET 1250 mg three times daily for 6 months. Results: At baseline, age and BMI&#xD;
      were not different in the two groups; PED/PEA-15 protein expression was higher in MET than in&#xD;
      OCP group (p=0.011), along with higher 1/HOMA-IR (p=0.004), and lower QUICKI and ISI (p=0.003&#xD;
      and p&lt;0.001, respectively). After treatment, independently of body weight, only in MET group&#xD;
      PED/PEA-15 decreased (p=0.004), along with insulin and 1/HOMA-IR (p&lt;0.001), and QUICKI and&#xD;
      ISI increased (p&lt;0.001). Insulin sensitivity indexes improvement correlated significantly&#xD;
      with PED/PEA-15 protein expression, but not with BMI. Conclusions: PED/PEA-15 protein&#xD;
      over-expression in obese PCOS women with IR reduced after a six month treatment with MET,&#xD;
      while remained unchanged in the OCP group. The reduction was independent of body weight, and&#xD;
      correlated with insulin sensitivity indexes. This effect further supported MET as a more&#xD;
      effective therapy than OCPs for obese PCOS women with IR, also when fertility is not&#xD;
      required.&#xD;

      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty obese PCOS women (age: 24.7±18 yr; BMI: 30±2.4 kg/m2) were consecutively admitted to&#xD;
      the Endocrinology Unit of the Department of Molecular and Clinical Endocrinology and Oncology&#xD;
      of the Federico II University of Naples, and were enrolled in this clinical study. The&#xD;
      diagnosis of PCOS was made according to the diagnostic criteria for PCOS At study entry the&#xD;
      patients were randomized in two groups of treatment, according to insulin sensitivity. OCP&#xD;
      group, 10 patients (BMI 29.7± 1.5 kg/m2) received 30 µg ethinylestradiol plus 30 mg&#xD;
      drospirenone 21 day/month. MET group, 10 patients (BMI 30.4± 3.1 kg/m2), received metformin&#xD;
      1250 mg three times daily. The duration of follow-up was 6 months. The control group&#xD;
      consisted of 10 healthy female volunteers, who were age matched.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As all PCOS women were anovulatory, they underwent a progesterone challenge test (100 mg&#xD;
      natural progesterone i.m.; Prontogest, Amsa, Rome, Italy), which induced uterine bleeding in&#xD;
      all PCOS women. To exclude the presence of type 2 diabetes or abnormal glucose tolerance, the&#xD;
      oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed and the normal glucose response to the OGTT&#xD;
      was defined according to the 'Report of the Expert Committee on the diagnosis and&#xD;
      classification of diabetes mellitus'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All anthropometric measurements were taken with subjects wearing only light clothes and&#xD;
      without shoes. In each woman, weight and height were measured to calculate the BMI [weight&#xD;
      (kg) divided by height squared (m2), kg/m2]. Height was measured to the nearest cm using a&#xD;
      wall-mounted stadiometer. Body weight (BW) was determined to the nearest 50 g using a&#xD;
      calibrated balance beam scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were given a standardized interview to obtain information about the duration of&#xD;
      obesity, eating patterns, smok¬ing habits and physical exercise. In particular, subjects were&#xD;
      also asked to make a daily record of the amount of physical activity (no exercise; ≤2-3&#xD;
      h/week; ≥2-3 h/week). Preadmission food intake and dietary history were assessed by a skilled&#xD;
      dietitian who used a computer-assisted interview (Winfood 1.5, Medimatica srl, Martinsicuro,&#xD;
      Italy). All PCOS women received a normo-caloric diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assays:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples were obtained between 08.00 h and 09.00 h from an antecubital vein after an&#xD;
      overnight fast, with the patient in the resting position. The OGTT was performed using 75 g&#xD;
      dextrose. Blood samples were obtained at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, min for plasma glucose and&#xD;
      insulin measurements. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels were determined by the glucose&#xD;
      oxidase method immediately after the OGTT. Fasting plasma insulin (FPI) samples were promptly&#xD;
      centrifuged, plasma was separated and stored at -20°C until assay. FPI was measured by a&#xD;
      solid-phase chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay using commercially available kits (Immunolite&#xD;
      Diagnostic Products Co, Los Angeles, CA). 1/HOMA-IR, QUICKI and ISI were calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PED/PEA-15 protein was measured in white-blood cells (WBC) lysates obtained from 10 to 12 ml&#xD;
      of freshly collected uncoagulated whole blood, after separation with dextran 6%, using&#xD;
      Western blot analysis. For Western blot analysis WBC were solubilized at 4°C in TAT buffer,&#xD;
      centrifuged at 500g for 20 min, and supernatant fractions were stored at -20°C until used.&#xD;
      The amount of 50 μg of lysate proteins were heated at 100°C in Laemmli buffer. Proteins were&#xD;
      separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to 0•45-mm Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore,&#xD;
      Bedfort, MA). Filters were probed with PED/PEA-15 antiserum at 1:2000 dilution, revealed by&#xD;
      enhanced chemiluminescence and autoradiography. The protein bands were quantified by laser&#xD;
      densitometry and expressed as percentage of pixels (arbitrary units).&#xD;
