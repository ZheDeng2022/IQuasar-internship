  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mentor is undertaking a five-year prospective clinical study designed to collect safety data&#xD;
      associated with the implantation of its gel-filled mammary prostheses. This study is an&#xD;
      &quot;adjunct&quot; study, which will encompass clinical reviews of reconstructive cases in all&#xD;
      patients who meet clinical and regulatory criteria for breast reconstruction with gel-filled&#xD;
      mammary prostheses. This &quot;adjunct&quot; study will be accomplished under a limited clinical&#xD;
      protocol in which specific parameters will be required but with controls somewhat less&#xD;
      stringent than those normally required in Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) Trials.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objectives of this study are to gather safety data regarding short term, post-implant events&#xD;
      and complications needed to support Premarket Approval (PMA) submissions for Mentor Silicone&#xD;
      Gel-Filled Mammary Prostheses and to maintain a comprehensive record of the patient's ongoing&#xD;
      medical history. The FDA has placed the devices in a regulatory category as a Class III&#xD;
      device, pursuant to the Medical Device Amendments to the Federal Food and Drug Act which went&#xD;
      into effect in May 1976. For devices in this class, FDA requires certain clinical data&#xD;
      regarding the risks associated with mammary prostheses. Due to several issues surrounding&#xD;
      possible risks of silicone gel-filled breast implants, the FDA has mandated specific clinical&#xD;
      study requirements to further assess possible risks and complications of silicone devices.&#xD;
      Clinical data collected via this study will supplement data which will be collected in more&#xD;
      extensive &quot;Core&quot; studies for breast reconstruction and augmentation procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective - Safety Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, data collected during this study will provide risk and complication data with&#xD;
      regard to short-term use of silicone breast implants. This safety assessment will include,&#xD;
      but is not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of capsular contracture&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Occurrence of complications such as infection and seroma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rupture rates for the implant&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is not intended to assess rare, long-term or speculative conditions which are not&#xD;
      proven clinically to be associated with mammary prostheses, such as their relationship to&#xD;
      Connective Tissue Disorders, an increased risk of cancer or teratogenic effects among breast&#xD;
      implant patients. This study is also not intended to address issues regarding the effects of&#xD;
      breast implants on mammography interpretation and occurrence of calcium deposits in the&#xD;
      tissue surrounding the implant. However, data on these and other complications noted in this&#xD;
      study, should they occur, will be recorded and analyzed with regard to the objective of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <description>Mentor Gel-Filled Mammary Prostheses are comprised of a shell made of medical grade silicone elastomer. Gel-filled implant devices manufactured by Mentor will be used in this study:&#xD;
Gel-filled device which is available in smooth surface and textured surface (SiltexÂ®)&#xD;
Becker Expander/Mammary Prosthesis which is available in both the smooth and the textured (Siltex) version&#xD;
Both of these devices were originally indicated for both augmentation and reconstruction mammaplasty procedures, however for purposes of this study, indications are for reconstruction only.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Must be female (genotypical females only), and&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient must be willing to follow the study requirements to include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Sign the Informed Consent Document before surgery is performed. (If the patient&#xD;
                  is under the age of consent, the parent or guardian must sign. It is the&#xD;
                  responsibility of the doctor to determine the state's age of majority.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Agree to complete all required follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. For those patients who wish to participate in the Patient Registry: agree to&#xD;
                  conditions of the Implant Registry and follow the requirements of the Registry&#xD;
                  program.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Agree to follow Mentor Standard Operating Procedures for explant analysis in&#xD;
                  which case the patient may be asked to authorize the sponsor to complete analysis&#xD;
                  on any study device(s) that may require removal throughout the duration of the&#xD;
                  study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Must be determined by the Investigator and other medical specialists (as&#xD;
                  required) to be an acceptable candidate for reconstructive breast surgery.&#xD;
                  General medical condition and history, as well as psychological appropriateness&#xD;
                  should be considered before surgical intervention, AND&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. In the medical opinion of the surgeon conditions must be such that saline implants are&#xD;
             deemed unsuitable for the patient. (Patient preference for gel implants is NOT&#xD;
             considered a medical condition.) Examples of saline unsuitability are:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Severe wrinkling of an existing saline implant to the extent that it would be&#xD;
                  considered a severe deformity (implant must have been in place longer than 6&#xD;
                  months)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Unilateral replacement (opposite breast is gel)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Tissue or skin is too thin to support a saline implant&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Previously dissected pocket is incompatible with saline implant, AND&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The patient must have one or more of the following breast conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Post-unilateral or bilateral mastectomy (immediate or delayed) as a result of&#xD;
                  cancer or other disease process.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Require reconstruction due to cancer treatments other than mastectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Require a revision due to complications or other undesirable results of a&#xD;
                  previous surgery for the above reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Post-Trauma defined as total or partial removal of the breast(s) through surgery&#xD;
                  (for any reason) or as a result of the trauma itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Congenital deformities defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Pectus Excavatum defined as congenital concave chest wall deformity with&#xD;
                       abnormalities of the sternum and anterior ribs.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Pectus Carinatum defined as convex chest wall deformity with abnormalities&#xD;
                       of the sternum and anterior ribs.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Severe asymmetry defined as congenital or acquired substantial discrepancy&#xD;
                       in breast sizes such as to represent a significant physical deformity or&#xD;
                       abnormality (e.g., Poland's syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Severe ptosis defined as requiring a reconstruction procedure such as a mastopexy&#xD;
                  (tissue and/or skin must be removed from the breast to qualify as a mastopexy&#xD;
                  procedure).&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Patients who require revision with implant replacement for severe deformity&#xD;
                  caused by medical or surgical complications, regardless of original indication&#xD;
                  for implantation or type of device originally implanted.&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Replacement or revision for patients whose prior surgery was not a result of&#xD;
                  treatment for cancer and for whom saline implants are unsuitable (e.g., skin too&#xD;
                  thin, insufficient tissue, etc.) as deemed by the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. Size changes (larger or smaller) are only allowed if the Investigator determines&#xD;
                  that a revision or replacement is required for medical reasons. In a case where a&#xD;
                  change of size is the only indication for surgery, and no medical necessity&#xD;
                  exists, the protocol will not allow replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
              10. Patients who require Augmentation mammaplasty in the unaffected breast as a&#xD;
                  result of the surgery, due to one of the above indications, in the affected&#xD;
                  breast (i.e., unilateral mastectomy with augmentation to opposite breast to&#xD;
                  provide symmetry).&#xD;
&#xD;
              11. Special circumstances for implantation will be considered on a case by case basis&#xD;
                  per written FDA authorization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition to general conditions which, in the opinion of the surgeon and/or consulting&#xD;
        physicians may exclude a patient from enrollment as a study subject, patients must be&#xD;
        excluded if they meet any one of the following conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Augmentation mammaplasty and the failure to have at least one of the diagnoses&#xD;
             identified in the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have an abscess or infection anywhere in their body at the time of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Be currently pregnant or nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Be diagnosed as having lupus defined as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus or Discoid Lupus,&#xD;
             or scleroderma defined as Progressive Systemic Sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Currently have uncontrolled diabetes or any diseases which are clinically known to&#xD;
             impact wound healing ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Demonstrate tissue characteristics which are clinically incompatible with mammaplasty&#xD;
             (e.g., tissue damage resulting from radiation, inadequate tissue, compromised&#xD;
             vascularity or ulceration).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Possess any condition or currently be under treatment for any condition, which in the&#xD;
             opinion of the Investigator and/or consulting physician(s), may constitute an&#xD;
             unwarranted surgical risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Demonstrate psychological characteristics such as inappropriate attitude or&#xD;
             motivation, which, in the opinion of the Investigator are incompatible with the risks,&#xD;
             involved with the surgical procedure and the prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Unwillingness to undergo any further surgery for revision (if required).&#xD;
