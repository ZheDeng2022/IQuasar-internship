  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on personal experience and the literature it is reasonable expectation that Vancomycin&#xD;
      is a viable treatment in a direct contact form to eliminate MRSA from open wounds in order to&#xD;
      heal the wounds by conventional means. The key question in my research has been to measure&#xD;
      the effectiveness of my Vancomycin Gel by culturing the wound, applying the Gel in a&#xD;
      controlled manner and then culturing the wound after one week. The end point to achieve in&#xD;
      the process, is a clinical response of accelerated healing and negative culture report.&#xD;
      Another question to solve is the duration of potency and stability of the Vancomycin gel over&#xD;
      time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over a prior preliminary 33 month study I have found negative cultures at the end of one week&#xD;
      of treatment and have had microbiological studies establishing the same MIC zones in culture&#xD;
      media greater than 15mm over a 33 month time frame. The microbiological and HPLC studies are&#xD;
      completed at present and approved. I have started the phase 2 studies on August 1,2011 as&#xD;
      authorized by the FDA on June 22,2011.&#xD;

    <description>Treatment of open wounds with Vancogel(R) 1.25-1.50% to eliminate MRSA. End point is: a negative culture report after 1-3 topical applications. The infected wounds with MRSA will be treated with the Vancomycin 1.25 to 1.50% complex gel formulation and will have conventional management in order to heal the wound. Vancogel is anticipated to accelerate wound healing by eliminating MRSA. A randomized, double blind study protocol approved by FDA.</description>
