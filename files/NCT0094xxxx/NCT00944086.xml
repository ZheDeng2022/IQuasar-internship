      Detailed Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Recruitment manoeuvre&quot; which has been defined and become popular in the recent years is&#xD;
      nowadays widely accepted and applied. The positive effects of the recruitment manoeuvre&#xD;
      during and after surgery on respiratory mechanics and oxygenation have been reported. The&#xD;
      duration and the applied pressure values of recruitment manoeuvre have been defined well and&#xD;
      in detail regarding the definitions for this manoeuvre (1-3). Despite these definitions, no&#xD;
      detailed information has been provided on the effects of the oxygen and oxygen concentration&#xD;
      during recruitment manoeuvre .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atelectasis develops after the induction of anaesthesia, even in healthy subjects, and is&#xD;
      associated with an increase in intraoperative shunt leading to impairment of gas exchange&#xD;
      (4). It is well known that in patients, who have undergone mechanical ventilation with high&#xD;
      oxygen concentration levels, oxygen replaces the less insoluble nitrogen. Partial oxygen&#xD;
      pressure increases with the implementation of oxygen in high concentrations, and the oxygen&#xD;
      flow into the blood increases. But when the gas flow into the blood is more than inspired,&#xD;
      absorption atelectasis develops in lungs - due to appliance of high oxygen concentration.&#xD;
      Atelectasis may also develop due to different reasons such as failure in secretion clearance&#xD;
      during the surgery, replacement of nitrogen with inhalation anaesthetics and appliance of&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the recent years, many studies have analyzed the effects of recruitment manoeuvre during&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum and laparoscopic surgery on respiratory mechanics and oxygenation, and&#xD;
      reported the benefits of recruitment in these operations (4-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, our goal is to compare the effects of recruitment manoeuvre which is applied&#xD;
      with different oxygen concentrations on oxygenation and respiratory mechanics during&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum.&#xD;
