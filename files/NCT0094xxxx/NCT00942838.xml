  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a prospective cohort study incorporating patients with first recurrence&#xD;
      ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer who will receive intraperitoneal chemotherapy in&#xD;
      conjunction with whole abdomen radiation. The primary end point of this investigator&#xD;
      initiated research study is to determine the toxicity associated with whole abdomen radiation&#xD;
      in combination with intraperitoneal chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of whole abdomen radiation in conjunction&#xD;
           with intraperitoneal cisplatin chemotherapy in the treatment of women with small volume&#xD;
           (&lt; 1 cm) recurrent ovarian cancer confined to the abdominal peritoneal cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of Life assessment.&#xD;

      DESIGN: This is an open label, single arm, dose finding study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES: Patients will receive chemotherapy and radiation for four weeks, and we&#xD;
      will check for any problems from the treatment for 3 months. We would like to collect&#xD;
      information from the patients regular doctor for 1 year after this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-screening If patients decide to participate in this study the doctor will evaluate if&#xD;
      they have met all the criteria to be eligible. To participate the cancer cannot have spread&#xD;
      outside the abdomen and patients must have had only one type of chemotherapy for their&#xD;
      cancer. If there any of their previous scans or blood tests show that the cancer has spread&#xD;
      outside the abdominal cavity, patients will not be able to participate in this study.&#xD;
      Patients will also not be able to participate in this study if it is determined that their&#xD;
      cancer has come back less than six months after they completed their first treatment of&#xD;
      chemotherapy. If these criteria are met, the standard next step for treatment is to have a&#xD;
      second surgery to remove all or most of the cancer from the abdominal cavity. This will&#xD;
      involve a similar surgery to what patients had when their cancer was first diagnosed. During&#xD;
      this surgery we will place a special catheter or tube within the abdominal cavity so that we&#xD;
      can administer chemotherapy into the abdomen directly and deliver it to the remaining cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following screening tests, exams and procedures will be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recording of medical history, physical exam (including vital signs, height &amp; weight&#xD;
           assessment, pelvic examination)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests (approximately 2-3 teaspoons will be drawn)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If patients have a history of hearing loss, they will have a hearing test because&#xD;
           cisplatin can affect hearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy and Radiation Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chemotherapy (Cisplatin) will be given to after recovery from surgery. It will be given&#xD;
           once per week at the same time as patients begin receiving the radiation treatment for&#xD;
           the first 4 weeks. The chemotherapy will be given through the catheter (tube) that was&#xD;
           placed under the skin during surgery and will not be visible. Patients will receive&#xD;
           medication prior to the chemotherapy to prevent nausea, vomiting, and possible allergic&#xD;
           reaction. Each infusion of chemotherapy will take approximately 60 minutes. After&#xD;
           patients receive the drug we will ask to change positions to ensure that the drug comes&#xD;
           in contact with all parts of the abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation therapy will be administered for four weeks. Radiation treatments will be&#xD;
           given every day (Monday through Friday) for approximately four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weekly blood tests will be taken before patients receive the chemotherapy (approximately&#xD;
           2-3 teaspoons) to monitor the effects of the drug on the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study doctor will evaluate patients weekly with a physical exam and review their&#xD;
           blood tests for any side effects they might be having from the chemotherapy or radiation&#xD;
           treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete a quality of life questionnaire each week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of treatment (beginning of week 5) AND approximately 90 days after the completion&#xD;
      of treatment patients will have a physical exam, blood tests evaluation of the side effects,&#xD;
      and will complete a quality of life questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of treatment, patients will likely undergo additional standard chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatment. We would like to collect and review the information about their progress and care&#xD;
      for 12 months.&#xD;

    <description>PLATINOL®-AQ (cisplatin injection) is a clear, colorless, sterile aqueous solution, each mL containing 1 mg cisplatin and 9 mg Sodium Chloride, USP. HCl and/or Sodium Hydroxide is added to adjust pH of the solution. The active ingredient, cisplatin, is a yellow to orange crystalline powder with the molecular formula PtCl2H6N2, and a molecular weight of 300.1. Cisplatin is a heavy metal complex containing a central atom of platinum surrounded by two chloride atoms and two ammonia molecules in the cis position. It is soluble in water or saline at 1 mg/mL and in dimethylformamide at 24 mg/mL. It has a melting point of 207°C.</description>

    <description>Whole abdominal radiotherapy will be delivered with an open-field anterior-posterior/posterior-anterior technique. Radiation will be administered in a dose escalating fashion to determine toxicity. The maximal dose of radiation will be defined as a mean midplane dose to the abdomen of 3,000 Gy through parallel-opposed single ports with a 1-cm margin that will cover the entire abdomen including the diaphragm.</description>
