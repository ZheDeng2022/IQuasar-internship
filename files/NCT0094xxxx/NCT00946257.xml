      This study will assess the subcutaneous administration of otelixizumab to T1DM patients. The&#xD;
      study will provide safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic information&#xD;
      which will enable the identification of appropriate safe and well-tolerated subcutaneous&#xD;
      dosage regimens to be used in subsequent clinical studies. This study will consist of a&#xD;
      screening phase, followed by an in-house phase whereby otelixizumab will be administered to&#xD;
      cohorts that will be staggered at each dose level.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Otelixizumab is a humanized, aglycosyl, non-mitogenic, anti CD3 monoclonal antibody (MAb)&#xD;
      directed against the ε domain of the human lymphocyte antigen CD3, which is currently&#xD;
      undergoing phase III clinical trials in adult new-onset type I diabetes mellitus patients and&#xD;
      has been evaluated in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis patients in small exploratory&#xD;
      studies. In previous studies, otelixizumab has been administered by intravenous infusion.&#xD;
      This study is a randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled, study of otelixizumab&#xD;
      administered subcutaneously in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of otelixizumab in T1DM subjects will provide safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic information following subcutaneous administration which&#xD;
      will enable the identification of appropriate safe and well-tolerated subcutaneous dosage&#xD;
      regimens to be used in subsequent clinical studies. This study will consist of a screening&#xD;
      phase, followed by an in-house phase whereby otelixizumab will be administered to cohorts&#xD;
      that will be staggered at each dose level. Approximately 6 dose levels, covering up to a&#xD;
      10-fold dose range, will be evaluated. A single subcutaneous dose of otelixizumab will be&#xD;
      administered on Day 1 and, serial blood samples will be obtained for clinical laboratory&#xD;
      testing, determination of pharmacodynamic markers, serum otelixizumab PK parameters, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity. Safety and pharmacodynamic data from the previous dose(s) will be evaluated&#xD;
      prior to dose escalation or modification to ensure safety and to achieve target systemic&#xD;
      peripheral blood pharmacology. Adverse events, laboratory values, vital signs and ECG's will&#xD;
      be monitored closely during this study. All subjects in the study will undergo long-term&#xD;
      follow-up out to 48 months to monitor and ensure patient safety.&#xD;
