    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study designed to assess the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of Genz-644282, administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion, to&#xD;
      patients with advanced malignant solid tumors. Each 28 day cycle of treatment will consist of&#xD;
      3 consecutive weeks of treatment every 28 days(i.e., treatment will be administered on Days&#xD;
      1, 8, and 15 every 28 days). Each 21 day cycle of treatment will consist of 2 consecutive&#xD;
      weeks of treatment every 21 days(i.e., treatment will be administered on Days 1 and 8 every&#xD;
      21 days). Treatment with Genz-644282 will continue until disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity is observed. Approximately 110 patients will be enrolled in this study. Patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled in escalating dose cohorts until the Maximum Tolerated Doses (MTDs) for the&#xD;
      2 dosing schedules are established. To further evaluate safety, approximately 40 additional&#xD;
      patients with advanced malignant solid tumors will be enrolled and treated at the MTDs (20&#xD;
      for each dosing schedule) during an expansion phase.&#xD;

    <description>Genz-644282 will be administered as a 60-minute IV infusion. The initial dose of Genz-644282 will be 0.5 mg/m2 and will be administered once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks on Day 1, Day 8, and Day 15 of the 28 day cycle. Each 28-day period will represent one treatment cycle. Study drug will continue to be given until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity is observed.</description>

Patients will receive Genz-644282 once-weekly for 2 consecutive weeks on Day 1 and Day 8 of a 21 day cycle. Each 21-day period will represent 1 treatment cycle. Patients enrolled in subsequent cohorts will receive higher doses until the MTD is established.</description>
