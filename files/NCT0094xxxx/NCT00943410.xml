    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block tumor growth in different&#xD;
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and&#xD;
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Radiation therapy uses high-energy&#xD;
      x-rays to kill tumor cells. Trastuzumab may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation&#xD;
      therapy. Giving trastuzumab together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving trastuzumab&#xD;
      together with external beam radiation therapy works in treating women with stage III or stage&#xD;
      IV breast cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the tolerability of trastuzumab (Herceptin®) and concurrent external beam&#xD;
           radiotherapy in women with HER2-overexpressing stage III or IV breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the pathologic response rate in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the locoregional recurrence rate (as site of first recurrence or any&#xD;
           recurrence) and time to locoregional recurrence in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the time to local progression in patients (who are deemed to be non-surgical&#xD;
           candidates) treated with this regimen .&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes once a week for 5 weeks. Patients also&#xD;
      undergo external beam radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three weeks after the completion of trastuzumab and radiotherapy, patients undergo surgical&#xD;
      evaluation. Patients deemed to be surgical candidates undergo surgery. Patients deemed to be&#xD;
      non-surgical candidates continue to receive trastuzumab and external beam radiotherapy for 2&#xD;
      additional weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;
