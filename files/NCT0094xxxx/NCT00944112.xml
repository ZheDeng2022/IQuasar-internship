    <textblock>
      The most effective transfusion practice in critically ill ICU patients is unknown. Currently&#xD;
      the data is unclear as to whether a liberal or restrictive transfusion policy is of most&#xD;
      benefit to patients in the short and longer term. The aim of this study is to test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that liberal use of RBCs (Hb transfusion trigger ≤90g/L; target Hb range 91-110&#xD;
      g/L) to correct anaemia improves clinical outcomes compared with a restrictive transfusion&#xD;
      trigger (Hb transfusion trigger ≤70 g/L; target Hb range 71-90 g/L) in anaemic critically ill&#xD;
      patients requiring prolonged ICU stay (≥4 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised to one of two transfusion strategies on a 1:1 basis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 &quot;Restrictive RBC Transfusion group&quot;:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive single unit RBC transfusions with a transfusion trigger of ≤70 g/L with&#xD;
      a target Hb concentration of 71-90 g/L during the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 &quot;Liberal RBC transfusion group&quot;:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive single unit RBC transfusions with a transfusion trigger of ≤90 g/L with&#xD;
      a target of 91-110 g/L during intervention. These patients will all receive a transfusion on&#xD;
      the day of randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remainder of ICU stay or 14 days from randomisation, whichever is longer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of Life, mobility and health service usage questionnaires at 60 and 180 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a feasibility study that will provide essential data to ensure the success of the&#xD;
      full trial. A qualitative study will also be carried out to explore potential reasons for&#xD;
      non-recruitment and clinician concerns with the existing protocol. An exploratory biomarker&#xD;
      sub-study will test whether a pro-inflammatory signal occurs in the liberally transfused&#xD;
      group associated with transfusions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anaemia is a common complication of critical illness and 40-50% of all patients in intensive&#xD;
      care units (ICUs) receive blood transfusions. However, despite the perceived benefits of&#xD;
      correcting anaemia, numerous non-randomised cohort studies and a system review suggest&#xD;
      associations between blood transfusions and adverse patient outcomes. The only large&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial comparing restrictive with liberal transfusion policies in&#xD;
      critically ill patients (the &quot;TRICC study&quot;) suggested a trend to greater morality at 30 days&#xD;
      in the liberal transfusion group. However the TRICC study does not inform clinical practice&#xD;
      with regard to how to manage long stay ICU patients. Also, and importantly, the blood product&#xD;
      used in the TRICC study contained white blood cells (non-leucodepleted), which are associated&#xD;
      with adverse events, whereas blood in the UK now has the white blood cells removed prior to&#xD;
      blood storage (leucodepleted). Due to continuing uncertainty many clinicians continue to use&#xD;
      higher Hb transfusion triggers in longer-term ICU patients and we confirmed this recently in&#xD;
      a survey of 184 ICU clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This uncertainty is important for patients, clinicians and the blood services. For example,&#xD;
      patients who require longer stays in ICU have long recovery times, use significant hospital&#xD;
      resource, and suffer symptoms such as fatigue, breathlessness and reduced Health Related&#xD;
      Quality of Life (HRQoL) for many months. It is possible that blood transfusions could&#xD;
      alleviate some of these problems. In addition, donated blood is in short supply and is&#xD;
      increasingly expensive to produce. As 40% of ICU patients receive transfusions, and use 8% of&#xD;
      the Scottish blood stocks, a stronger evidence base could optimise the use of this precious&#xD;
      resource.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Cochrane systematic review (co-authored by one of the applicants, BMcL) noted that current&#xD;
      evidence was dominated by the TRICC trial, and concluded that the &quot;....effects of&#xD;
      conservative transfusion triggers on functional status, morbidity and mortality, particularly&#xD;
      in patients with cardiac disease, need to be tested in further large clinical trials&quot;4.&#xD;
      Further studies are clearly required to determine the most effective transfusion practice in&#xD;
      critically ill ICU patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have completed an extensive programme of work to inform this study. Based on this data we&#xD;
      have identified a patient population in whom an RCT will address many areas of clinical&#xD;
      uncertainty. We will study longer-term ICU patients (higher illness severity; higher&#xD;
      morbidity; worse long-term functional status; low long-term HRQoL; greater illness costs) who&#xD;
      are aged ≥55 (high incidence of IHD; less certainty regarding safety with restrictive&#xD;
      approach in TRICC trial). The treatment exposure will last longer than the TRICC trial,&#xD;
      potentially including post-ICU care, because anaemia recovers slowly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a feasibility study comparing the effectiveness of a &quot;restrictive&quot; blood&#xD;
      transfusion policy in long-stay ICU patients with a more &quot;liberal&quot; transfusion policy to&#xD;
      inform the definitive RCT design. It has been designed to answer the following questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What proportion of eligible patients can be recruited to the study?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What difference in mean Hb concentration and RBCs exposure will occur with our protocol?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How good is compliance with our proposed study protocol?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What factors (if any) limit recruitment and result in protocol violations?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How should the current protocol be modified for a larger definitive trial?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are there any strong pro-inflammatory signals or other patient safety concerns&#xD;
           associated with liberal RBCs use?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How should the health economic evaluation be undertaken in the full trial?&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feasibility evaluation includes three elements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. A single blind randomised trial comparing patients managed with the restrictive versus the&#xD;
      liberal strategy (main study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. A comparison of circulating plasma levels of inflammatory biomarkers during the first 24&#xD;
      hours of randomisation in patients managed with the liberal and restrictive strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. An interview-based qualitative study with clinicians managing patients in the study units.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Main Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The overall hypothesis for this programme of work is that liberal use of RBCs to correct&#xD;
           anaemia (HB transfusion trigger ≤90g/L; target Hb range 91-110 g/L) improves clinical&#xD;
           outcomes compared with a restrictive transfusion trigger (Hb transfusion trigger ≤70g/L;&#xD;
           target Hb range 71-90 g/L) in anaemic critically ill patients requiring prolonged ICU&#xD;
           stay (≥4 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be randomised to one of two transfusion strategies on a 1:1 basis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group 1 &quot;Restrictive RBC Transfusion group&quot;:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will receive single unit RBC transfusions with a transfusion trigger of ≤70 g/L&#xD;
           with a target Hb concentration of 71-90 g/L during the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group 2 &quot;Liberal RBC transfusion group&quot;:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will receive single unit RBC transfusions with a transfusion trigger of ≤90 g/L&#xD;
           with a target of 91-110 g/L during intervention. These patients will all receive a&#xD;
           transfusion on the day of randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The intervention will last for 14 days from the time of randomisation or until discharge&#xD;
           from the intensive care unit, whichever is longer. The aim is for all surviving patients&#xD;
           to receive the randomised intervention for at least 14 days in all cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Follow-up Complication rates will be ascertained by case note review during the 60 days&#xD;
           following randomisation (hospital stay only).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The length of their stay in ICU and in hospital will be ascertained from the patient&#xD;
           records&#xD;
&#xD;
           Longer Term follow up of Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be contacted at 60 and 180 days following randomisation. At these time&#xD;
           points the following will be determined or measured:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Survival status&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physical disability using the Rivermead Mobility Index&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  HRQoL using the SF-12 questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Health economic questionnaire to determine health care resource use (180 days&#xD;
                only).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Biomarker Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The aim of this part of the study is to explore whether a pro-inflammatory signal is&#xD;
           associated with RBC transfusion in intensive care patients. A range of pro- and&#xD;
           anti-inflammatory markers will be compared between the patients entering the restrictive&#xD;
           group, who are not expected to receive RBCs during the 24 hours following randomisation,&#xD;
           and the liberal group, who will all receive at least one RBC unit during the 24 hours&#xD;
           following randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blood samples will be collected from patients as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Restrictive Group: A blood sample will be drawn following randomisation (time zero), at&#xD;
           time zero plus 6 hours, and at time zero plus 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Liberal Group: A blood sample will be drawn following randomisation and immediately&#xD;
           prior to RBC transfusion (time zero), at time zero plus 6 hours, and at time zero plus&#xD;
           24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each blood sample will be 10mL volume (total 30mL per patient). Plasma samples will be&#xD;
           batch analysed at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Qualitative Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomised controlled trial (RCT) is widely acknowledged as the &quot;gold standard&quot; in the&#xD;
      evaluation of clinical interventions. Recruitment, however, is often problematic, with&#xD;
      serious implications for the detection of important treatment differences, the&#xD;
      generalisability of research findings to other patient populations and cost. A recent review&#xD;
      demonstrated that less than a third of UK studies recruited the required sample size within&#xD;
      the timeframe originally specified, and approximately one third required an extended&#xD;
      recruitment period. The recruitment and retention of participants is particularly problematic&#xD;
      in critical care research, the rationale for which is currently ill-defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of the existing literature on barriers to research participation suggests that a&#xD;
      myriad of methodological/study-specific, organisational and clinician-specific issues exist.&#xD;
      The purpose of this exploratory qualitative study, undertaken as part of the RELIEVE&#xD;
      programme of work, is to identify and address perceived barriers to recruitment among&#xD;
      clinicians prior to a larger definitive trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore clinicians' experiences of clinical uncertainty in relation to existing&#xD;
           guidance (as a default for clinical decision-making) and in relation to recruitment and&#xD;
           compliance with the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore clinicians' knowledge of and perspectives on existing evidence and guidelines&#xD;
           in relation to blood transfusion practice&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore clinicians' practice in relation to existing evidence and guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore clinicians' prior perspectives on research participation with particular&#xD;
           reference to patient groups (e.g. patients with ischaemic heart disease) or clinical&#xD;
           scenarios (e.g. bleeding events) which might elicit clinical uncertainty in relation to&#xD;
           recruitment, randomisation or protocol compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore clinicians' subsequent experiences of trial participation with reference to&#xD;
           previously described concerns&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop potential strategies for the improved recruitment and retention of study&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods We will conduct qualitative semi-structured interviews with clinicians in each of the&#xD;
      6 participating centres. We will invite the Principal Investigator at each site to&#xD;
      participate and, in order to minimise selection bias, we will invite a second clinician with&#xD;
      a &quot;non-vested interest&quot; in the study to participate. Participants will be interviewed both&#xD;
      prior to trial commencement and following trial completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: Prior to study commencement, we will explore (a) clinicians' knowledge and&#xD;
      perspectives on existing evidence and guidelines in relation to blood transfusion practice&#xD;
      (b) clinicians' practice in relation to existing evidence and guidelines (c) clinicians'&#xD;
      perspectives on research participation per se and (d) clinicians' perspectives on the study&#xD;
      protocol in relation to patient groups or clinical scenarios which are likely to elicit&#xD;
      uncertainty in terms of recruitment, randomisation or protocol adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: Following study completion, we will invite the same clinicians to describe their&#xD;
      experiences and perceptions of trial participation, with particular reference to patient&#xD;
      groups or clinical scenarios in which recruitment, randomisation or protocol adherence&#xD;
      elicited concern or uncertainty. Using the screening logs, Case Report and Adverse Event&#xD;
      Forms kept at each site by the dedicated research nurses, we will explore, where possible,&#xD;
      the rationale for (a) clinician refusal of eligible patients and (b) non-compliance with&#xD;
      study protocol or (c) withdrawal of recruited patients. We will invite clinicians to identify&#xD;
      potential strategies for addressing these issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transcribed interviews will be examined and coded for relevant issues using Computer&#xD;
      Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software (CAQDAS), namely NVIVO8®. Using thematic&#xD;
      analysis, we will therefore identify and delineate key issues of concern, as expressed by&#xD;
      clinicians, in relation to (a) the recruitment and retention of participants in critical care&#xD;
      research (b) the recruitment and retention of eligible patients with reference to the RELIEVE&#xD;
      study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The identification of &quot;generic&quot;, protocol-specific and organisational barriers to recruitment&#xD;
      will facilitate the identification of clinically and locally relevant strategies to address&#xD;
      these issues prior to the larger definitive study. Using both the existing literature and the&#xD;
      unique insights provided by this study, we will also develop and refine a screening tool of&#xD;
      research barriers which will (a) be used to audit recruitment in the larger definitive study&#xD;
      and (b) form the basis of a tool relevant for critical care research per se.&#xD;
