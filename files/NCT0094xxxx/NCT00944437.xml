  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare two methods of delivery of noninvasive mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation (NIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since patient compliance and mechanical characteristics of the delivery devices are two&#xD;
      fundamental variables in the success of NIV during acute respiratory failure, our hypothesis&#xD;
      is that an improved patient-ventilator interface may improve the efficacy of therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is the delivery of ventilatory support without the need for an&#xD;
      invasive artificial airway. The use of noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) in&#xD;
      acute respiratory failure has been steadily increasing for intensive care unit (ICU)&#xD;
      patients. Noninvasive ventilation can often eliminate the need for intubation or tracheostomy&#xD;
      and preserve normal swallowing, speech, and cough mechanisms. Discomfort of the device is one&#xD;
      of the reason for the failure of NIV (30-40% of the cases).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Novastar oro-nasal mask (Dräger Medical, Lubeck, Germany) is a flexible, transparent mask&#xD;
      shell with a fine silicone gel cushion which adapts to the wearer's face. The pliable ring&#xD;
      embedded inside the flexible clear shell allows the mask to be bent and adjusted to fit the&#xD;
      patient's face (customized fit), while minimizing leakages. The mask has magnetic, self&#xD;
      aligning clips for capture and secure fastening of the mask headgear. The magnetic clips are&#xD;
      self-aligning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transparent flexible helmet for NIV (Rüsch 4-Vent, Teleflex Medical Europe, Athlone,&#xD;
      Ireland) is fixed with two straps passing through each armpit. The braces are protected by&#xD;
      hydrocolloid strips to prevent axillary decubitus. It is important to chose the right size of&#xD;
      the helmet to avoid air leakages in the neck region. Two filters in the in- and expiratory&#xD;
      way are necessary to reduce noise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different devices may lead to varying degrees of discomfort and, thus, improve compliance.&#xD;
      Better tolerability of NIV may improve its efficacy. Therefore, we planned this randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to investigate whether different modalities of NIV delivery may affect&#xD;
      therapeutical efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No randomized trials have compared helmets to the NOVASTAR full-face masks. This randomized,&#xD;
      controlled study aims to assess whether the new full face mask improves gas exchange in&#xD;
      patients admitted to ICU because of acute postoperative respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients meeting criteria for NIV cycles will be enrolled in this trial. Informed written&#xD;
      consent requirements were waived by the Internal Review Board since enrollment criteria meet&#xD;
      common clinical guidelines and the two devices are both widely available (and approved for&#xD;
      this indication).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ongoing or recent history of respiratory failure (either primary or secondary)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PaO2 &lt;60 mmHg if breathing room air or PaO2/FiO2 &lt;300 mmHg if receiving supplemental&#xD;
           oxygen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute dyspnea with respiratory rate &gt;25 bpm and accessory muscle recruitment and/or&#xD;
           paradoxical abdominal breathing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be excluded if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Refusing NIV&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comatose (Glasgow Coma Scale &lt;8) or unable to maintain a patent airway&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemodynamically unstable (systolic blood pressure &lt;80 mmHg on recruitment, or receiving&#xD;
           vasopressors/inotropes; ongoing angina/myocardial infarction; newly-developed arrhythmia&#xD;
           with hemodynamic impact)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Having recently (≤2 weeks) undergone oesophageal or upper respiratory tract surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon enrolment, patients will be randomized to receive NIV via one of the two available&#xD;
      interfaces. In group H (for &quot;helmet&quot;), the continuous positive pressure is obtained by a high&#xD;
      influx of fresh gases (air + oxygen) flowing through a high-compliance reservoir, with a&#xD;
      positive end-expiratory pressure valve limiting outflow. In the M (&quot;oral-nasal mask&quot;) group&#xD;
      the same flow scheme is obtained using a T-tube attached to the mask. Patients' heads will be&#xD;
      elevated to about 45° in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) will be instituted at 5 cmH2O.&#xD;
      Pressure will be increased by increments of 2-3 cmH2O until a maximum of 10 cmH2O in order to&#xD;
      reach a peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≥ 90% with the lowest FiO2 possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noninvasive ventilation will be ideally maintained for up to 24 h. Patients will be asked to&#xD;
      wear the helmet/mask as long as possible. During ventilation-free periods, which will be&#xD;
      maintained as short as possible, patients will receive 50% oxygen supplementation. The&#xD;
      criteria for success of therapy and discontinuation of NIV will be a reversal of all criteria&#xD;
      listed above for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for NIV failure and subsequent intubation and mechanical ventilation will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Coma (Glasgow Coma Scale &lt;8) or inability to maintain a patent airway&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemodynamic instability (systolic blood pressure &lt;80 mmHg on recruitment, or receiving&#xD;
           vasopressors/inotropes; ongoing angina/myocardial infarction; newly-developed arrhythmia&#xD;
           with hemodynamic impact)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intolerance to the interface&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's inability to mobilize secretions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PaO2/FiO2 ratio &lt;140 mmHg after ≥1 h of ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAIN ENDPOINT AND SAMPLE SIZE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial blood gas analyses will be performed upon enrollment, after 1 h, and after 24 h from&#xD;
      enrollment. The null hypothesis of the study is that there will be no difference in the mean&#xD;
      PaO2/FiO2 values between the two groups at 24 h. We will consider as clinically and&#xD;
      statistically significant a difference of ≥50±60 mmHg between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 50 patients will be enrolled. Sample size calculations are based on the assumption&#xD;
      of a 5% risk of type I error and a 20% risk of type II error, while accounting for a 10-15%&#xD;
      attrition rate.&#xD;
