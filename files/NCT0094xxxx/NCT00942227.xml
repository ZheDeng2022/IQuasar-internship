  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of adding mechanical traction to&#xD;
      standard physical therapy treatments for patients with low back pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the opinions of clinical experts that patients who might benefit from traction may&#xD;
      represent distinct sub-groups of patients, most studies have not attempted to narrow their&#xD;
      inclusion criteria beyond loose definitions of 'acute' or 'chronic' symptoms. While these&#xD;
      studies seem to indicate that traction interventions will be of little benefit when&#xD;
      administered to large groups of patients without a prior attempt to select which patients are&#xD;
      most likely to benefit, they are not sufficient to preclude the possibility that a subgroup&#xD;
      of patients may benefit substantially from the intervention. Recent preliminary studies&#xD;
      suggest a there exists a subgroup of patients with LBP that is likely to benefit from&#xD;
      traction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two primary aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the validity of the previously-identified prediction criteria to identify&#xD;
           patients highly likely to benefit from the addition of traction to a standard physical&#xD;
           therapy intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare the overall effectiveness of addition of a traction component to a standard&#xD;
           physical therapy intervention.&#xD;

    <description>Mechanical lumbar traction will be applied with subjects in prone utilizing 40-60% of subject's body weight to create a distraction force in the lumbar spine. Following traction, subjects will be instructed in a progression of extension oriented exercises and manual therapy to increase extension as described for the comparator group.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chief complaint of pain and/or paresthesia in the lumbar spine with a distribution of&#xD;
             symptoms that has extended distal to the gluteal fold on at least one lower extremity&#xD;
             within the past 24 hours based on the patient's self-report.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Oswestry disability score of at least 20%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age at least 18 years and less than 60 years&#xD;

          -  At least one of the following signs of nerve root compression:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Positive ipsilateral or contralateral straight leg raise test (reproduction of&#xD;
                  leg symptoms with straight leg raise &lt; 70 degrees)&#xD;
&#xD;

                  dorsiflexion, great toe extension, or ankle eversion) of the ipsilateral lower&#xD;
                  extremity&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Diminished lower extremity reflex (Quadriceps or Achilles) of the symptomatic&#xD;
