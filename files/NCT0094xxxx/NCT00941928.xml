    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if transferring the donor's NK cells, in&#xD;
      combination with an antibody called epratuzumab and low-dose interleukin (IL-2), into your&#xD;
      body can be done safely. Researchers want to find out if the infused NK cells will survive&#xD;
      after the infusion and if the NK cell infusion helps to destroy cancer cells in the&#xD;
      recipient's body and possibly to help control the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Â· Evaluate the feasibility of collecting an adequate number of natural killer (NK) cells from&#xD;
      a donor and evaluate the safety of a haploidentical donor-derived NK cell infusion,&#xD;
      Epratuzumab, and low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantification and persistence of the infused donor NK cell in vivo;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantification and persistence of cytokine levels;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of NK cell immunophenotype and function;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate above with anti-tumor effect.&#xD;

      Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epratuzumab is designed to attach to certain proteins on the surface of ALL cells. This may&#xD;
      cause the cancer cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide is designed to interfere with the multiplication of cancer cells, which may&#xD;
      slow or stop their growth. This may cause the cancer cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fludarabine is designed to make cancer cells less able to repair damaged DNA (the genetic&#xD;
      material of cells). This may increase the likelihood of the cells dying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IL-2 is designed to help NK cells live longer and work better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NK cells are the cells in the body that fight disease and infection. NK cells may destroy&#xD;
      tumor cells, particularly when the NK cells are &quot;mismatched&quot; for certain proteins, called&#xD;
      human leukocyte antigens (HLA). Researchers think that this ability to destroy tumor cells&#xD;
      can be predicted by learning the donor's and the recipient's HLA types to see if they are a&#xD;
      mismatch, and by checking for other specialized proteins found on the surface of the donor's&#xD;
      NK cells. These proteins are called killer immunoglobulin receptors (KIR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NK cells will be collected from the donor's blood and then processed in a lab at M. D.&#xD;
      Anderson, where researchers will use a machine, called a CliniMACS device, to separate out&#xD;
      the NK cells from the rest of the donor's collected white blood cells and treat them&#xD;
      overnight with a drug called IL-2. This is done to make the NK cells stronger before they are&#xD;
      given to the recipient. You will also receive IL-2 injections under your skin to try to help&#xD;
      the NK cells survive longer and to possibly increase the number of NK cells in your body&#xD;
      after the infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have &quot;screening tests&quot; to help the&#xD;
      doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this study. The following tests and&#xD;
      procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a bone marrow biopsy and/or aspiration to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
           To collect a bone marrow biopsy and/or aspirate, an area of the hip is numbed with an&#xD;
           anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow and bone is withdrawn through a needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a spinal tap to check the status of the disease. A spinal tap (also called&#xD;
           a lumbar puncture) is when a special needle is inserted into the lower back through the&#xD;
           space between the bones to draw a sample of the fluid that surrounds the spinal cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a pulse oximetry test to measure your heart rate and the level of oxygen&#xD;
           in the blood. To perform this test, a clothespin-shaped device will be placed on your&#xD;
           finger for about 1 minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including a measurement of your vital signs (blood&#xD;
           pressure, heart rate, breathing rate, and temperature).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. This blood will also be&#xD;
           checked for infections such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). You will be told&#xD;
           the results of this test. If you have an infection, you may not be able to take part in&#xD;
           this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to test for HLA and KIR. You and the donor&#xD;
           will be told the results of this test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Females who are able to have children must have a negative blood pregnancy test. This&#xD;
           test will be performed with the blood drawn for routine tests as described above. If&#xD;
           there is not enough blood leftover for this test, additional blood (about 1 teaspoon)&#xD;
           will be drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These screening tests, except for the HLA and KIR-typing, would also need to be repeated&#xD;
      before an additional leukapheresis procedure can be done as a part of this study, in order to&#xD;
      see if you continue to be eligible to have another one performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying an Eligible Donor:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your relative will be tested to see if his or her KIR has a type of &quot;mismatch&quot; that&#xD;
      researchers think will help the donor's NK cells target the cancer cells in your body. They&#xD;
      must also share half of your HLA genes to be eligible to take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The donor's blood will also be checked for infections, such as HIV, to protect against the&#xD;
      possibility of transmitting an infection to you during the NK cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To help track the NK cells after infusion, researchers prefer (but do not require) that if&#xD;
      you are a female recipient, your donor is male and if you are a male recipient, your donor is&#xD;
      female.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epratuzumab Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you and the donor are found to be eligible to take part in this study, on Day -4 (4 days&#xD;
      before the NK cell infusion) and Day -1 (1 day before the NK cell infusion), you will have an&#xD;
      epratuzumab infusion. The length of time this infusion will take will be different for each&#xD;
      patient. This will be done using an indwelling catheter (a tube that remains in a vein, such&#xD;
      as tunneled in the arm or through the chest to continuously inject or drain a part of your&#xD;
      body). If you already have an indwelling catheter in place, you will not need to have a new&#xD;
      one placed. However, if a new catheter is needed, you will be asked to sign a separate&#xD;
      informed consent form for its placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day -1 (1 day before the NK cell infusion) and on Days 3, 6, 10, 13, and 17, you will&#xD;
      receive an epratuzumab infusion. This will take several hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conditioning Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase will start within 28 days after the screening tests. During this phase, you will&#xD;
      receive chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine to weaken your immune system in&#xD;
      order to help the infused NK cells survive. You will stay in the hospital from Day -6 until&#xD;
      after the NK cell infusion or longer if the doctor thinks it is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day -6 through Day -2, you will receive fludarabine 1 time each day by vein, over about 30&#xD;
      minutes each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days -5 and -4, you will receive cyclophosphamide 1 time each day by vein, over about 2&#xD;
      hours each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days -5 and -4, you will receive mesna 5 times per day by vein, over about 15 minutes each&#xD;
      time. Mesna is given to protect your bladder from side effects that may be caused by&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and mesna will all be infused through the same indwelling&#xD;
      catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infusion of NK cells:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 0, you will receive the NK cells by vein, preferably through an indwelling catheter.&#xD;
      If you do not have an indwelling catheter, you may receive the infusion intravenously (IV --&#xD;
      by vein). The doctor will decide the amount of NK cells to be infused, which will affect how&#xD;
      long the infusion lasts. Usually the infusion should last less than 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To help prevent an allergic reaction to the infused NK cells (such as fever and chills), you&#xD;
      will receive Benadryl (diphenhydramine) by vein, over 15-30 minutes, and Tylenol&#xD;
      (acetaminophen) by mouth. You will also receive fluids by vein to help decrease the risk of&#xD;
      kidney damage. If the study doctor thinks it is necessary, you may also receive a steroid to&#xD;
      help prevent side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the doctor thinks that you are not eligible to receive the NK cell infusion on Day 0, you&#xD;
      will be taken off study without receiving the donor's NK cells. The collected NK cells will&#xD;
      be thrown away.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study allows eligible recipients under the age of 2 years of age to participate. You&#xD;
      and/or a caregiver will be trained how to give the IL-2 injections to yourself. This drug&#xD;
      will be injected under the skin for 9 doses. You will take 3 doses per week over a 3-week&#xD;
      period after receiving the NK cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measuring NK Cell Survival Through Blood Test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 0 (before the NK cell infusion and again 2 hours later), and 1 time on each of the&#xD;
      following days: Days 2, 7, 14, 21, and 28, blood (about 4 teaspoons each time) will be drawn&#xD;
      and tested to see how long the NK cells survive in your body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease gets worse or the infused NK cells can no longer be seen, this blood draw&#xD;
      schedule may be stopped early.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have follow-up visits at least 3 times per week during the first 3 weeks, and then 1&#xD;
      time about 28 days after your NK cell infusion. Then, you will have additional follow-up&#xD;
      visits at about Months 2 and 3. At these visits, the following tests and procedures will be&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have any changes in your medical history recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including a measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 14 and 28, and during Months 2 and 3, you will have a bone marrow biopsy and/or&#xD;
      aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will remain on active study for up to 3 months following your NK cell infusion that you&#xD;
      agree to have performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, mesna, and IL-2 are FDA&#xD;
      approved and commercially available. Cyclophosphamide and fludarabine are approved for&#xD;
      treating leukemia in adults. IL-2 is FDA-approved, but not for the treatment of leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epratuzumab is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is only being used in research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of the CliniMACS machine and infusing NK cells combined with epratuzumab in patients&#xD;
      with ALL are only being done in research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 10 recipients and 10 donors will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at The&#xD;
      University of Texas (UT) MD Anderson Cancer Center.&#xD;
