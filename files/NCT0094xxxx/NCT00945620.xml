    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to measure the magnitude and duration of trans-abdominis&#xD;
      plane (TAP) block analgesia in parturients undergoing elective cesarean section with&#xD;
      concurrent standard of care operative analgesic regimens including intrathecal morphine&#xD;
      sulfate (ITMS). A one sided block model takes advantage of the bilateral nature of the pain&#xD;
      created by a bilateral surgical wound and allows each patient to serve as her own control.&#xD;
      Reduced variability allows a more definitive establishment of analgesic benefit for this&#xD;
      block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current reports of conflicting data regarding efficacy make uncertain the role of TAP&#xD;
      block in post cesarean section pain relief. This model would have a better potential for&#xD;
      measuring the block's effectiveness. Quantitative sensory evaluation tools such as the von&#xD;
      Frey hair tool provides a quantitative reproducible measure of skin sensation and also allows&#xD;
      for assessment of block regression over time. Pressure algometry has been established as a&#xD;
      clinical and research tool for quantitative assessment of pain levels in multiple pain&#xD;
      conditions. A useful inexpensive reliable pressure algometer has recently been described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of serum ropivicaine levels with this block will provide useful data regarding&#xD;
      the systemic absorption of local anesthetic compared to other peripheral nerve blocks and&#xD;
      establish the safety of the technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition this study will help establish a model for the study of TAP block modifications&#xD;
      in the future. If block effectiveness is demonstrated, this model can be used to examine&#xD;
      numerous block parameters including choice of local anesthetic and dose response analysis for&#xD;
      optimal volume and concentration. Potential future study may be done also in the area of&#xD;
      adjuncts found to have increased duration and effectiveness as used in other peripheral nerve&#xD;
      blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected duration of this study is 18 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, double-blinded prospective trial. Group A patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive a TAP block with local anesthetic on the right, sham block on the left.&#xD;
      Group B be will randomized to receive the reverse. The study population will be limited to&#xD;
      healthy parturients undergoing elective caesarian section with spinal anesthesia (SAB) or&#xD;
      combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSE) placed in the operating room at time of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to enrollment into the study informed consent will be obtained. Consent will be&#xD;
      obtained by a study investigator blinded to the group into which the patient will be&#xD;
      randomized. After preanesthetic counseling and patient agreement for a SAB or CSE for&#xD;
      cesarean delivery will counsel the patient regarding study participation. Pre-operative&#xD;
      instruction of the VAS scale shall be given by the investigator. Routine pre-operative&#xD;
      preparations per current protocols will occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-operative Anesthetic Regimen:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic techniques will be per current protocols. A single intravenous infusion will be&#xD;
      used for both intraoperative infusion of intravenous fluids during anesthetic maintenance&#xD;
      infusion and for blood sampling for ropivicaine levels following TAP block placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAB and CSE utilizing 12 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine, and 0.15mg intrathecal morphine shall be&#xD;
      used as spinal anesthetic for all study patients. Intra-operative conduct of anesthesia will&#xD;
      be left to the discretion of anesthesiologist caring for the parturient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAP Block Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the surgical procedure, if there are no new exclusion criteria, the subject&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive bilateral TAP blocks using 30 mL containing 300 mg ropivicaine&#xD;
      (1%) with addition of 1:300,000 epinephrine on one side (Group A on the right), and sham&#xD;
      needle placement on the other (Group B on the right). During the procedure the study subject&#xD;
      shall be blinded to the group assignment by surgical drapes.. The investigator who records&#xD;
      the patient assessments will not be present at block placement. The un-blinded anesthesia&#xD;
      provider will remove and open 1 of 22 opaque envelopes containing a card identifying the&#xD;
      group to which the patient has been assigned by computer generated randomization. The&#xD;
      provider will then prepare the injection syringes, labeling the ropivicaine syringe with&#xD;
      RIGHT or LEFT according to randomization. The envelope will then be sealed and placed in the&#xD;
      patient's study packet. An unblinded investigator trained in the block technique using&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance will perform the block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TAP block shall be performed in the fashion described by Carney et. al (5). in the region&#xD;
      of the triangle of Petit located at the superior aspect of the iliac crest, using a 22g&#xD;
      regional block needle, utilizing the 2 pop technique(2) and needle tip position verified by&#xD;
      ultrasound imaging. The investigator will confirm placement of the injectate in the fascial&#xD;
      plane by initial injection of a small amount of the local anesthetic drug followed by&#xD;
      injection of the rest of the dose with ultrasound verification of anesthetic deposition&#xD;
      between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis. The ultrasound image will be printed&#xD;
      and included with the study data.. The other side will receive a sham needle placement&#xD;
      without medication injection. Because this block is performed before regression of spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia, it causes no pain to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Block Care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the placement of the block, all parturients will receive a standard post-operative&#xD;
      analgesic regimen that represents our routine practice:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Toradol 15mg IV upon completion of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percocet 5/325mg q 4 hrs PRN (pain)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motrin 600mg q 6 hours PRN (pain)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time to first analgesic request and administration will be recorded. The total amounts of&#xD;
      supplemental analgesics administered will be recorded for the first 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following block placement, venous blood shall be drawn at set intervals described below from&#xD;
      the indwelling venous catheter to assess ropivicaine levels.&#xD;
