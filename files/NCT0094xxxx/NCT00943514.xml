    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bronchiectasis is a disease characterized by airways that are inflamed, abnormally&#xD;
           dilated, and chronically infected. Individuals with bronchiectasis have a history of&#xD;
           chronic and recurring respiratory infections. Depending on the underlying cause, these&#xD;
           infections may involve the entire respiratory tract, resulting in sinus, ear, and lung&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bronchiectasis continues to be a significant problem in developing countries and in&#xD;
           specific groups of individuals, particularly in people who have cystic fibrosis.&#xD;
           Although treatments are available or under development for bronchiectasis related to&#xD;
           cystic fibrosis, many of the disease-specific treatments may not be effective for&#xD;
           bronchiectasis not related to cystic fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study the natural history of bronchiectasis to identify inherited and immune factors&#xD;
      that may explain why certain individuals have chronic recurring infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals 5 years of age and older who have an established diagnosis of bronchiectasis&#xD;
           or a history of chronic/recurring respiratory infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Direct family members (e.g., parents, siblings, children) of patients in the study may&#xD;
           also be asked to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Potential participants will be screened with an initial clinic evaluation and full&#xD;
           medical history, as well as a general quality of life and respiratory symptom&#xD;
           questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The following standard procedures may be done as part of the study: air sampling from&#xD;
           the nose; imaging studies, which may include an x-ray or computed tomography (CT), lung&#xD;
           function tests; and collection of samples of blood, urine, and sputum (phlegm or mucus).&#xD;
           Other tests may be performed as required by the researchers, and will be explained to&#xD;
           patients as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both patients and relatives (if asked to participate) will provide the following&#xD;
           samples: blood or buccal (cheek swab) cells for genetic testing, sputum, and urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To prevent infections and potential disease progression, patients may receive standard&#xD;
           medical care and treatment for bronchiectasis and related infections during this&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis, or abnormal dilation of the airways, is a condition typically characterized&#xD;
      by chronic and recurring respiratory tract infections. Frequently, depending on the&#xD;
      underlying cause, these infections involve the entire respiratory tract resulting in sinus,&#xD;
      ear, and lung disease. This condition used to be more common in children prior to&#xD;
      immunizations for childhood infections. It continues to be a significant problem in&#xD;
      developing countries and in specific groups of individuals in the U.S. Cystic fibrosis (CF)&#xD;
      is the most commonly associated genetic condition and tremendous strides have been made in&#xD;
      recent years in understanding the mechanisms of this disease that are leading to a multitude&#xD;
      of emerging novel treatment strategies. The mechanisms of other causes for bronchiectasis&#xD;
      have not evolved to this degree, and many of the disease-specific treatments being assessed&#xD;
      for cystic fibrosis may not be effective for non-CF bronchiectasis. Often bronchiectasis can&#xD;
      be associated with chronic infections from environmental germs such as the nontuberculous&#xD;
      mycobacteria.&#xD;

        -  PARTICIPANT INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Children age 5 years and above and adults referred to the NIH with chronic or&#xD;
                  recurring respiratory infections will be eligible for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Males and females will be considered without regard to race or ethnicity or upper&#xD;
                  age limit.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Emphasis will be primarily on non CF bronchiectasis for elucidation of mechanisms&#xD;
                  of infection susceptibility. However, select patients with cystic fibrosis or&#xD;
                  acquired immune defects (such as HIV) may be studied if relevant host defects are&#xD;
                  suspected or if needed for comparison purposes or to evaluate and study the&#xD;
                  management of chronic pathogen associated conditions such as nontuberculous&#xD;
                  mycobacterial infections or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Subjects must have a primary or referring physician&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Subjects must be willing to have samples stored&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR RELATIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        As a part of this protocol we may obtain blood, sputum, urine, or buccal swabs from some&#xD;
        blood relatives of patients on the study, with the hope of isolating and characterizing the&#xD;
        primary host defense defect(s) or genetic links responsible for airway infection&#xD;
        susceptibility and/or bronchiectasis seen within families. Male and female relatives will&#xD;
        be accepted without limitation due to age. These relatives may have pertinent&#xD;
        disease-related history obtained, but will neither receive treatment nor have any other&#xD;
        protocol procedures done unless they are enrolled on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        PARTICIPANT EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. We wish to avoid enrolling subjects, especially children, who have common respiratory&#xD;
             problems (aeroallergen sensitivity, asthma, gastric esophageal reflux) that are not&#xD;
             associated with an underlying abnormality in host defenses. Evidence of significance&#xD;
             of chronic or recurring infections suggestive of an underlying airway surface or&#xD;
             systemic host defense defect should be documented by one or more of the following: a)&#xD;
             sinus or lower airway cultures positive for bacterial, fungal, or mycobacterial&#xD;
             pathogens characteristic of these defects; or b) radiographic evidence of sinusitis&#xD;
             with mucosal thickening and/or air-fluid levels; or c) radiographic evidence of&#xD;
             bronchiectasis; d) severity of otitis media requiring placement of tympanic membrane&#xD;
             pressure equalization tubes; e) severity of sinusitis requiring surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who are unable or unwilling to provide informed consent either directly or&#xD;
             via appropriately designated surrogate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any patient who, in the opinion of the Investigator, is unable or unwilling to comply&#xD;
             with regular follow-up or is unlikely to provide pertinent information regarding&#xD;
             disease progression or response to treatment may be excluded from longitudinal&#xD;
             follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Children under the age of 5 will be excluded from this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        When a pediatric subject reaches age 18, continued participation will require reconsenting&#xD;
        with the adult consent document.&#xD;
