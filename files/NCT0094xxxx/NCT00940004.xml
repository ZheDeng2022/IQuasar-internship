      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an exploratory study, consisting of two parts. In part I a dose escalation is&#xD;
      performed and the primary objective is the safety of different doses of TLR-dendritic cell&#xD;
      (TLR-DC). In part II TLR-DC vaccination will be compared with cytokine-matured DC vaccination&#xD;
      and the primary objective of this part is the immunological response to TLR-DC vaccination,&#xD;
      with toxicity and clinical efficacy being secondary objectives. These studies will provide&#xD;
      important data on the safety and immunological effects of TLR-matured DC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an open label prospective exploratory intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' study population consists of HLA-A2.1 positive melanoma patients, with&#xD;
      proven expression of melanoma associated tumor antigens gp100 and tyrosinase. Melanoma&#xD;
      patients with regional lymph node metastasis in whom a radical lymph node dissection is&#xD;
      planned or performed within 2 months of inclusion in this study (further referred to as stage&#xD;
      III) and melanoma patients with measurable distant metastases (further referred to as stage&#xD;
      IV) will be included.&#xD;

      1. Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
           Immunotherapy applying ex vivo generated and tumor-antigen-loaded dendritic cells (DC)&#xD;
           has now successfully been introduced in the clinic. A limited, but consistent, number of&#xD;
           objective immunological and clinical responses have been observed. Thus far it remains&#xD;
           unclear why some patients respond and others not, but there is a general consensus that&#xD;
           the current protocols applied to generate DC may not result in the induction of optimal&#xD;
           Th1 responses. We and others have demonstrated that DC maturation is one of the crucial&#xD;
           factors, not only for effective DC migration but also to induce effective anti-tumor&#xD;
           immune responses in cancer patients. Currently, the &quot;golden standard&quot; used to mature DC&#xD;
           consists of a cocktail of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNFalpha) and&#xD;
           prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Recent mouse data demonstrated, however, that maturation of DC&#xD;
           by solely pro-inflammatory cytokines yielded DC that supported T cell clonal expansion,&#xD;
           but failed to efficiently direct effector T cell differentiation. Interestingly, DC&#xD;
           matured in the presence of Toll like receptor (TLR) ligands were able to induce full T&#xD;
           cell effector function and unleashed more potent immune responses. We recently&#xD;
           identified vaccines against infectious diseases that contain TLR ligands and are capable&#xD;
           of inducing DC maturation. This knowledge provides a new application for these clinical&#xD;
           applicable agents: clinical grade DC stimulators. A clinical grade DC maturation&#xD;
           protocol is developed in which TLR ligands (preventive vaccines) and PGE2 are combined&#xD;
           which resulted in the generation of mature DC that secrete high levels of the key&#xD;
           cytokine IL-12. Moreover, these TLR-ligand matured DC induced T cells secreting at least&#xD;
           20-fold higher levels of the effector cytokines IFNalpha and TNFalpha as compared to DC&#xD;
           matured in the absence of TLR ligands. In conclusion, these in vitro data demonstrate&#xD;
           that TLR-ligand matured DC are promising candidates to improve immunological and&#xD;
           clinical responses in cancer immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is an exploratory study, consisting of two parts. In part I a dose escalation is&#xD;
           performed and the primary objective is the safety of different doses of TLR-DC. In part&#xD;
           II TLR-DC vaccination will be compared with cytokine-matured DC vaccination and the&#xD;
           primary objective of this part is the immunological response to TLR-DC vaccination, with&#xD;
           toxicity and clinical efficacy being secondary objectives. These studies will provide&#xD;
           important data on the safety and immunological effects of TLR-matured DC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study is an open label prospective exploratory intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
           Our study population consists of HLA-A2.1 positive melanoma patients, with proven&#xD;
           expression of melanoma associated tumor antigens gp100 and tyrosinase. Melanoma patients&#xD;
           with regional lymph node metastasis in whom a radical lymph node dissection is planned&#xD;
           or performed within 2 months of inclusion in this study (further referred to as stage&#xD;
           III) and melanoma patients with measurable distant metastases (further referred to as&#xD;
           stage IV) will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Main study endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of the study are to investigate the toxicity of TLR-DC by dose&#xD;
      escalation of DC numbers in part I, and to investigate immunological responses upon TLR-DC&#xD;
      vaccination in part II of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunological responses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The migratory capacity of the TLR-ligand matured DC in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The activation of immune cells in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The immunological response induced with TLR-ligand matured DC loaded with mRNA encoding&#xD;
           melanoma-associated tumor antigens (gp100 and tyrosinase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and clinical efficacy are secondary objectives.&#xD;
