      RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to&#xD;
      the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Having a full&#xD;
      bladder may improve the effectiveness of radiation therapy to the bladder. It is not yet&#xD;
      known which set of bladder-filling instructions is more effective in helping patients keep&#xD;
      their bladder full during radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is comparing two sets of bladder-filling instructions&#xD;
      in treating patients with prostate cancer undergoing radiation therapy.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the consistency in bladder volumes in patients with prostate cancer&#xD;
           undergoing conformal radiotherapy, when randomized to one of two sets of bladder-filling&#xD;
           instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the incidence of acute and late genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity&#xD;
           in patients treated with these methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine patient satisfaction with the bladder-filling instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine satisfaction of bladder-filling protocols amongst radiation therapists and&#xD;
           doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients empty their bladders and consume 6 cups of water 30 minutes before&#xD;
           undergoing radiotherapy. Patients also undergo bladder volume measurements using a&#xD;
           bladder volume instrument (BVI) periodically during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients empty their bladders and consume 3 cups of water 30 minutes before&#xD;
           undergoing radiotherapy. Patients also undergo bladder volume measurements using a BVI&#xD;
           periodically during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, patients follow their bladder filling instructions and then undergo conformal&#xD;
      radiation therapy daily for about 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' perception of symptoms, quality of life, and urinary symptoms are assessed&#xD;
      periodically by the International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS). Patients' satisfaction with&#xD;
      the bladder-filling instructions (i.e., ability to comply with the bladder-filling protocol,&#xD;
      the number of incidents of wetting accidents, number of incidents of having to repeat the&#xD;
      water drinking on the same day due to machine breakdown or the patient's inability to retain&#xD;
      the full bladder for the required amount of time, and the level of frustration) is assessed&#xD;
      periodically by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staff satisfaction with bladder-filling interventions (i.e., patient compliance with the&#xD;
      protocols, acceptance of bladder dose-volume histograms [DVHs], need for re-scan with a&#xD;
      fuller bladder, amount of disruption to the therapist's work schedule, number of incidents of&#xD;
      wetting accidents, number of incidents of having to repeat the water drinking on the same day&#xD;
      due to machine breakdown or the patient's inability to retain the full bladder for the&#xD;
      required amount of time, and the level of satisfaction or frustration) is assessed&#xD;
      periodically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 4 years.&#xD;
