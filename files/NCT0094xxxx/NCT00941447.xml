    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to conduct a 12-week study to compare the effects of a&#xD;
      self-regulation intervention (SR), in which participants will self-monitor their blood&#xD;
      glucose (BG) and adjust dietary intake and physical activity through the use of current&#xD;
      dietary and physical activity guidelines to help regulate their BG, to an education and&#xD;
      self-monitoring only intervention (SM), on blood glucose, self-efficacy, and diabetes&#xD;
      self-management activities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As our nation continues to battle overweight and obesity, the prevalence of diabetes will&#xD;
      precipitously increase, placing additional financial burden on our country. Therefore,&#xD;
      finding ways to manage this chronic disease is essential. While self-monitoring of blood&#xD;
      glucose (SMBG) has been shown to be effective in improving glycemic control in individuals&#xD;
      with type 1 diabetes, the importance of encouraging individuals with type 2 diabetes to&#xD;
      engage in SMBG for better blood glucose (BG) is still unclear. SMBG is believed to be key in&#xD;
      the self-management of diabetes, as it can provide feedback on dietary and activity behaviors&#xD;
      that are believed to impact on BG. The use of SMBG to adjust other behaviors that impact on&#xD;
      BG is a self-regulatory approach to diabetes management. Self-regulation of BG is theorized&#xD;
      to impact on self-efficacy in the management of diabetes. Through greater self-efficacy,&#xD;
      greater compliance to diabetes self-management behaviors is achieved. Currently, no trial has&#xD;
      examined the use of a self-regulation approach using current dietary and physical activity&#xD;
      recommendations for individuals with type 2 diabetes who are not on insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, this investigation will involve a 12-week study to examine the effect of an SR&#xD;
      intervention to SM intervention. All participants in the investigation will receive a&#xD;
      standard 12-week behavioral intervention. The intervention will include a reduced caloric&#xD;
      prescription (1200-1500 kcal/day), fat gram prescription (30% or less kcals from fat),&#xD;
      carbohydrate gram prescription (150-190 grams/day) and a physical activity goal (slowly&#xD;
      building up to 150minutes/week of moderate-intense physical activity at the end of study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed at 0 and 13 weeks (pre- and post-intervention) on measures of&#xD;
      fasting blood glucose, self-efficacy, and diabetes self-management activities. Additionally,&#xD;
      dietary intake, physical activity, quality of life and body weight measurements will be taken&#xD;
      at 0 and 13 weeks for comparisons between the two treatment groups.&#xD;
