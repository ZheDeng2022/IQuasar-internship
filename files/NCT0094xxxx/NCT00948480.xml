  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol was conducted as a single institution trial at Hoag Cancer Center, Hoag&#xD;
      Hospital, Newport Beach, California. It was a single-arm phase II trial in which patients&#xD;
      with metastatic melanoma received subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of irradiated autologous&#xD;
      tumor cells that had been established as short-term cell lines, in conjunction with their own&#xD;
      dendritic cells (DC) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]. Eligible&#xD;
      patients had regionally recurrent and/or distant metastatic cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were stratified by whether they had no measurable disease [NMD] at the time of&#xD;
      treatment (usually because of surgical resection of metastases), or whether they had&#xD;
      objectively measurable disease (OMD) by physical examination or radiologic scans per response&#xD;
      evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST criteria). Key endpoints were the results of&#xD;
      delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin testing to their own irradiated tumor cells,&#xD;
      event-free survival [death or disease progression], overall survival, and objective tumor&#xD;
      regression in patients who have measurable disease at the time vaccine therapy was initiated.&#xD;
      This study was activated in the fall of 2000, and closed to accrual in June 2007.&#xD;
