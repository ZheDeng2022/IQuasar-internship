      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The provision of thrice weekly subcutaneous (SQ) recombinant growth hormone (rGH)&#xD;
           therapy to children receiving in-center hemodialysis (HD) will result in improved&#xD;
           growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The provision of thrice weekly SQ rGH therapy to children receiving in-center HD will&#xD;
           result in improved lean body mass, nutritional status and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TIW rGH treatment regimen (0.35 mg/kg/week divided into 3 doses, each dose being given at the&#xD;
      conclusion of the dialysis treatment) for up to 2 years; growth response, Dual energy X-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry (DEXA), and quality of life (QOL) will be measured. The goal is to enroll 20&#xD;
      children who are Tanner 1 with decreased height SDS and/or decreased height velocity standard&#xD;
      deviation scoreS (SDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this therapy is demonstrated to be efficacious and improves growth and QOL, this therapy&#xD;
      could be easily implemented for all eligible children on HD, since parental acceptance should&#xD;
      be better without having to administer the rGH at home and compliance for the child will be&#xD;
      assured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators thus propose an important study that has the ability to advance their&#xD;
      understanding and provide evidence for the best methods to promote growth in children on&#xD;
      dialysis. The results of this study will result in important information that will be of&#xD;
      value to the entire pediatric nephrologist community, including health care professionals,&#xD;
      patients, and families. In a real sense, this study will build on the 2006 Consensus&#xD;
      Conference guidelines for evaluation and treatment of growth failure in children with chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease (CKD). This will provide evidence for critical management decisions that can&#xD;
      help insure better growth opportunities to more children with CKD.&#xD;

      Objectives/Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To demonstrate the beneficial effects of thrice weekly SQ rGH Rx on growth in children&#xD;
           on HD&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To demonstrate the beneficial effects of thrice weekly SQ rGH Rx in terms of improved&#xD;
           lean body mass, nutritional status and quality of life in children on HD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study group - Provision of standard weekly dose of SQ rGH (0.35 mg/kg/week divided into&#xD;
           3 doses, each dose being given at the conclusion of dialysis therapy) for up to 2 years&#xD;
           to growth retarded (Height SDS &lt; -1.88 or Height velocity &lt; -1.88 SD) children receiving&#xD;
           HD who are na√Øve to rGH or who have not been on rGH for at least 12 months. Inclusion&#xD;
           criteria are: medically cleared for SQ rGH Rx (14); growth potential based on Tanner&#xD;
           stage 1 with open epiphyses on Bone Age radiographs (Bone age &lt; 12 years); expected to&#xD;
           require HD for at least 6 more months; at least 6 months of standardized historical&#xD;
           pre-study anthropometric data (including stadiometer height). Exclusion criteria include&#xD;
           all medical factors that indicate that rGH therapy should not be used (14), e.g., poor&#xD;
           nutritional status, poorly controlled acidosis, poor dialysis adequacy (defined by Kt/V&#xD;
           &lt; 1.2), poorly controlled renal osteodystrophy (PTH &gt; 800). Once the complicating factor&#xD;
           is addressed and corrected, the child may be considered for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SQ rGH to be provided in-center at the conclusion of dialysis session three times weekly&#xD;
           for up to 24 months. SQ rGH dose to be adjusted based on dry (euvolemic) weight every&#xD;
           month during the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Baseline and monitoring data obtained on each patient on SQ rGH Rx. This will include&#xD;
           stadiometer measured height for at least 6 months prior to initiation of SQ rGH Rx to&#xD;
           provide important baseline height and growth velocity to be used to determine magnitude&#xD;
           of the response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. For children with suboptimal response after 6 months of standard SQ rGH Rx dose&#xD;
           (annualized growth rate &lt; 2 cm more than the preceding year), the rGH dose will be&#xD;
           increased to 0.70 mg/kg/week divided into 3 doses (similar to the reported &quot;pubertal&quot;&#xD;
           dosing regimen used in some GH deficient children).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data: Height (stadiometer), Weight, BMI, Height SDS, Height velocity SDS (historical&#xD;
      past 6 months), Weight SDS, BMI SDS, Hb, BUN, nPCR, serum albumin, serum calcium, serum&#xD;
      phosphorus, iPTH, electrolytes, high sensitivity CRP (as a marker of inflammation), dialysis&#xD;
      adequacy (defined by single and double pool Kt/V - Kt/V is a unitless number used to quantify&#xD;
      hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis treatment adequacy: K - dialyzer clearance of urea, t -&#xD;
      dialysis time, V - patient's total body water; in HD the target is 1.2), IGF-1, IGFBP-3, hip&#xD;
      films and bone age (4,5,6,9). In addition, lean body mass/and fat mass will be assessed by&#xD;
      DEXA (to standardize the determination of LBM, DEXA to be done mid week, after the dialysis&#xD;
      treatment, to avoid the excess fluid commonly present after 2 days off dialysis each weekend)&#xD;
      and quality of life will be assessed by the PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales (10). The&#xD;
      nutritional parameters that will be determined (wt/ht, ht SDS, BMI, nPCR and serum albumin)&#xD;
      represent the currently used assessments of nutrition for these patients and have been&#xD;
      validated as best measures of nutrition in children on dialysis (12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments to be repeated at the following intervals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Height (stadiometer), Weight, Hgb, BUN, nPCR, serum albumin, serum calcium, phosphorus,&#xD;
           and electrolytes, Kt/V - monthly&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CRP, iPTH, IGF-1, IGFBP-3 - every 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. PedsQL - every 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. DEXA and Bone Age - yearly (and within 1 week of renal transplant if this occurs anytime&#xD;
           6 months after start of study) - DEXA and Bone Age results will be sent to Nationwide&#xD;
           Children's and analyzed by our collaborating pediatric radiologist (Larry Binkovitz,&#xD;
           MD).&#xD;
