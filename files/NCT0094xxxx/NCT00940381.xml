      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the&#xD;
      combination of sirolimus and cetuximab that can be given to patients with advanced cancer.&#xD;
      The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cetuximab is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking protein&#xD;
      on the surface of the cancer cell, called the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sirolimus is designed to block a protein called mTOR inside the cancer cell. This may&#xD;
      interfere with the growth or spread of cancer cells or possibly kill the cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose&#xD;
      level of cetuximab and sirolimus based on when you joined this study. Up to 9 dose levels of&#xD;
      cetuximab and sirolimus will be tested. Three (3) to 9 participants will be enrolled at each&#xD;
      dose level. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new&#xD;
      group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects&#xD;
      were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of the combination of&#xD;
      cetuximab and sirolimus is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the highest tolerated dose of the combination of cetuximab and sirolimus is found, 2&#xD;
      groups of additional participants (Group 1 and Group 2, each of 14 participants) will be&#xD;
      enrolled and receive the study drugs at that dose level. Another 14 participants with the&#xD;
      non-small lung and head and neck cancer will receive the study drug at that dose level, as&#xD;
      well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study &quot;cycle&quot; is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everyday, you will take sirolimus by mouth 1 time a day. You should take it at about the same&#xD;
      time each day with food and a cup of water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle, you will receive cetuximab by vein over 2 hours. If&#xD;
      the first dose is well tolerated, you will receive the next dose over 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At every study visit, you will be asked about any current health conditions you have, drugs&#xD;
      you are taking, and if you have experienced any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -If you are enrolled in a Group 2 of the highest drug combination dose, you will have a tumor&#xD;
      biopsy and your blood (about 1-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for pharmacodynamic (PD) testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About Days 8 and 22 of Cycle 1, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About Day 15 of Cycle 1, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About Day 22 of Cycles 2 and then every 1-2 cycles, the following tests and procedures will&#xD;
      be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 4 weeks, you will have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) drawn or urine collected for&#xD;
      pregnancy test if you are able to become pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 8 weeks, you will have an x-ray, CT scan, MRI, and/or PET/CT to check the status of the&#xD;
      disease. The study doctor thinks it is needed, they will be performed more often.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may stay on study for as long as you are benefitting. You will be taken off study if you&#xD;
      experience intolerable side effects, the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest, or&#xD;
      the cancer gets worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 28 days after the last dose of study drugs, you will have an end-of-study visit. At&#xD;
      this visit, the following tests or procedures may be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an x-ray, CT, MRI, and/or PET/CT to&#xD;
           check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Sirolimus is FDA approved and commercially available as an&#xD;
      anti-rejection drug for kidney transplant recipients. Cetuximab is FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available for the treatment of colorectal and head/neck cancers. The combination&#xD;
      of these drugs is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 137 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
