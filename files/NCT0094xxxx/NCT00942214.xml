      Information from blood samples may help us for choosing the best treatment in future&#xD;
      personalized medicine. Natalizumab (NTZ) a current treatment for MS can be used as a second&#xD;
      line therapy if a suboptimal response to disease modifying drugs. When to introduce NTZ is&#xD;
      not consensual. The investigators hypothesized that biological information could rationalize&#xD;
      choice and thus designed a prospective open label trial to test biological markers before&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      Current state of knowledge of the topic of the project and The general interest of the&#xD;
      project; Pharmacogenomic aims to determine biomarkers related to treatment response, a step&#xD;
      toward patient-tailored medicine. Natalizumab, a monoclonal antibody has just received the&#xD;
      EMEA approval for MS patients who do not respond to interferon treatment or who experience a&#xD;
      severe disease course. Efficacy of the drug is outstanding with 37% of the patients&#xD;
      completing the &quot;disease free&quot; definition after 2 years (7% in placebo group). On the other&#xD;
      hand, natalizumab may be associated with severe adverse events such as progressive multifocal&#xD;
      leucoencephalopathy and high costs. Overall, this emphasizes the need beyond current approval&#xD;
      criteria to identify those patients with the best efficacy to safety ratio, a major public&#xD;
      health issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific aims The primary scientific aim is to define biomarkers that would allow&#xD;
      predicting long term response to natalizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology; The investigators plan to conduct a 5 years study to search for the best&#xD;
      predicting factors at the beginning of treatment and after 2 years. In this grant application&#xD;
      the investigators will perform a multivariate analysis of clinical, MRI, and biological&#xD;
      markers (neutralizing antibody, DNA, and mRNA expression) from baseline to 2 years. For&#xD;
      feasibility reasons, long term follow up (5 years) and proteomics study will be performed in&#xD;
      a second stage.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients between the ages of 18 and 55 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of relapsing multiple sclerosis according to McDonald criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EDSS score of 0 to 5.0 on the EDSS scale. One of the following 2 items:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients who have failed to respond to a full and adequate course of a&#xD;
                  beta-interferon. Patients have had at least 1 relapse in the previous year while&#xD;
                  on therapy, and have at least 9 T2-hyperintense lesions in cranial MRI or at&#xD;
                  least 1 Gadolinium-enhancing lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis,&#xD;
                  defined by 2 or more disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more&#xD;
                  Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI or a significant increase in T2 lesion&#xD;
                  load as compared to a previous recent MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypersensitivity to natalizumab or to any of the excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Increased risk of opportunistic infections, including immunocompromised patients&#xD;
             (including those currently receiving immunosuppressive therapies or those&#xD;
             immunocompromised by prior therapies, e.g. mitoxantrone or cyclophosphamide within 1&#xD;
             year before Tysabri.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Combination with beta-interferons or glatiramer acetate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known active malignancies, except for patients with cutaneous basal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
