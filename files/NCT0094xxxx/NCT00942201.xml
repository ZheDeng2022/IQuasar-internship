      Hypothesis: A 2-day course of oral dexamethasone is the superior option for the resolution of&#xD;
      symptoms and prevention of relapse in the emergency department (ED) management of&#xD;
      mild-moderate asthma exacerbations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma has become a major public health problem of increasing concern in the US as it is the&#xD;
      most prevalent chronic disease of childhood with over 6 million children under the age of 17&#xD;
      affected 7. Low-income populations, minorities, and children living in inner cities&#xD;
      experience disproportionately higher morbidity and mortality due to asthma. Children who&#xD;
      suffer from asthma often present to the ED or outpatient center for management of their&#xD;
      symptoms and exacerbations. Asthma related ED visits in 2004 were estimated at 1.8 million,&#xD;
      with children younger than 17 accounting for almost half with 754,000 visits 7 Recent&#xD;
      clinical trials have shown the efficacy of dexamethasone in the ED management of asthma. In&#xD;
      Quereshi et al, a randomized study of 533 patients showed that two doses of DEX taken on days&#xD;
      1 and 2 were equally efficacious as 5 days of prednisolone2. However, patients treated with&#xD;
      DEX demonstrated improved compliance with less vomiting, fewer missed days of school and&#xD;
      fewer missed parental workdays. A more recent study by Altamimi et al compared single dose&#xD;
      DEX to 5-day prednisolone1. This double blinded, randomized prospective study of 134 children&#xD;
      concluded that single dose DEX is no worse than 5 days of prednisolone as well.dexamethasone&#xD;
      in the acute management of asthma exacerbation. However, practices vary as to the use of&#xD;
      single dose, two-day dosing and when to administer the second dose. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to compare various dosing regimes of dexamethasone in its efficacy in the treatment of&#xD;
      asthma exacerbations. Given the longer duration of action of DEX (36-72 hours), we&#xD;
      hypothesize that 2 doses of DEX given on days 1 &amp; 3 are superior to single dose DEX in&#xD;
      improving symptoms and preventing relapse in the ED management of mild to moderate asthma&#xD;
      exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These previous studies show similar efficacy of dexamethasone when compared to the standard&#xD;
      5-day prednisone/prednisolone treatment. . Within the institution, the investigators have&#xD;
      incorporated the use of dexamethasone in the management of acute asthma exacerbations.&#xD;
      However, practices vary as to the use of a single dose, two-day dosing and the timing of the&#xD;
      second dose for those patients receiving two doses of dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to determine if single dose oral dexamethasone is as effective&#xD;
      as a 2 dose course of oral dexamethasone in preventing relapse within 7 days for pediatric&#xD;
      asthma patients managed in the ED. Given the long half life of dexamethasone, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesized that 2 doses given on days 1 and 3 are superior to single dose in&#xD;
      improving symptoms and preventing relapse in the ED management of mild to moderate asthma&#xD;
      exacerbations.&#xD;
