  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients receiving treatment for advanced cancer often experience co-occuring pain, fatigue,&#xD;
      and sleep disturbance that are not relieved with medications. Brief cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      coping strategies such as relaxation or imagery have been shown to be useful for these&#xD;
      symptoms individually and may be effective for the cluster of co-occuring pain, fatigue, and&#xD;
      sleep disturbance. Because single cognitive-behavioral strategies don't work equally well for&#xD;
      all persons, providing training in multiple cognitive-behavioral strategies is necessary.&#xD;
      However, oncology nurses report having insufficient time and are often not available to&#xD;
      deliver the interventions exactly when patients experience symptom exacerbation. This&#xD;
      application proposes a patient-controlled cognitive-behavioral (PC-CB) intervention, using an&#xD;
      MP3 player to deliver recorded cognitive-behavioral strategies. The PC-CB intervention would&#xD;
      allow patients to select from a variety of cognitive-behavioral strategies based on their&#xD;
      personal preferences, and facilitate self-administration of those strategies at whatever time&#xD;
      and place the symptoms occur, without increasing burden on nursing staff. Primary aims are&#xD;
      (1) to explore acceptability and patterns of use of the recorded cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      strategies and (2) to pilot test efficacy of the PC-CB intervention compared to a waitlist&#xD;
      control.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing treatment for advanced cancer often experience the combination of pain,&#xD;
      fatigue, and sleep disturbance as symptoms that co-occur or &quot;cluster&quot; within patients.&#xD;
      Medications may be effective in reducing some of these symptoms; however, they often have&#xD;
      side effects that exacerbate the other symptoms. Practice guidelines and research evidence&#xD;
      suggest that cognitive-behavioral (CB) strategies may be effective treatments with few, if&#xD;
      any, side effects for each of these symptoms. However, investigators have not yet explored&#xD;
      the effect of CB strategies on co-occuring pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. It is&#xD;
      possible that an intervention that is effective for one symptom may also have beneficial&#xD;
      effects on the other co-occuring symptoms. For example, controlling pain may permit better&#xD;
      sleep and subsequently reduce fatigue. Cognitive-behavioral strategies, however, are not&#xD;
      equally effective for all patients, and training in just one strategy may not be sufficient.&#xD;
      Providing multiple CB strategies may be more efficacious, but is complicated by the fact that&#xD;
      oncology nurses report having insufficient time and equipment to deliver the interventions in&#xD;
      practice. And given patient-care demands, providing CB strategies exactly when patients&#xD;
      experience increased symptom intensity is usually not feasible. A patient-centered approach&#xD;
      to symptom management would allow patients to select from a variety of CB strategies based on&#xD;
      their personal preferences, skills, and interests and permit the use of those strategies at&#xD;
      whatever time and place the symptoms occur. The use of MP3 technology to deliver the&#xD;
      intervention would allow patients to control delivery of the CB strategies without increasing&#xD;
      burden on nursing staff and could potentially improve all symptoms in the cluster. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to conduct a pilot test of a 2-week patient-controlled&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral intervention (PC-CB intervention), using an MP3 player to deliver&#xD;
      recorded CB strategies for co-occurring pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance during cancer&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To explore the acceptability and patterns of use of recorded CB strategies delivered via&#xD;
           MP3 player among patients receiving treatment for advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To pilot test efficacy of a 2-week PC-CB intervention on symptom outcomes during cancer&#xD;
           treatment compared to a waitlist control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if changes in perceived control over symptoms and outcome expectancy&#xD;
           mediate the effect of the PC-CB intervention on symptom outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if gender, age, imaging ability, and concurrent symptoms moderate the&#xD;
           impact of the PC-CB intervention on symptom outcomes.&#xD;
