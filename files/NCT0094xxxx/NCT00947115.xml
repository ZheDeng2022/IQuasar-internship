  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) has been clearly established as the necessary cause&#xD;
      of cervical cancer. This study is designed to evaluate the long-term immunogenicity and&#xD;
      safety of the GSK Biologicals' 580299 HPV vaccine up to 10 years after administration of the&#xD;
      first dose of HPV vaccine (Month 0) in primary study NCT00196937. This protocol posting deals&#xD;
      with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the extension phase from Year 5 to Year 10. The&#xD;
      objectives &amp; outcome measures of the primary phase and extension phase up to year 4 are&#xD;
      presented in a separate protocol posting (NCT00196937).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects were aged 15-55 years at the time of entry into the primary study (NCT00196937). No&#xD;
      vaccine was administered in this extension study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results on outcome measures describing analyses on other studies are not reported in this&#xD;
      record. Please refer to the records mentioned in the respective outcome measure titles.&#xD;

    <measure>Anti-Human Papillomavirus (Anti-HPV)-16/18 Antibody Titers in Serum at Years 5, 6 and 7</measure>
    <time_frame>At Years 5, 6 and 7</time_frame>
    <description>Anti-HPV-16/18 antibody titers are presented as Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) and expressed in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) units per milliliter (EL.U/mL).&#xD;
The immune response of the HPV-16/18 vaccine (as determined by anti-HPV-16/18 antibodies assessed by ELISA) in the HPV-060 study population was compared with the immune response obtained in study HPV-001 and its long-term follow-up studies HPV-007/HPV-023 at equivalent timepoints and with the immune response obtained after natural infection in subjects from study HPV-008.&#xD;
The immune response data for the efficacy studies HPV-001/HPV-007/HPV-023 can be found under the NCT record NCT00518336. The immune response data for the HPV-008 study can be found under the NCT record NCT00122681.</description>

The immune response of the HPV-16/18 vaccine (as determined by anti-HPV-16/18 antibodies assessed by ELISA) in the HPV-060 study population was compared with the immune response obtained in study HPV-001 and its long-term follow-up studies HPV-007/HPV-023 at equivalent timepoints and with the immune response obtained after natural infection in subjects from study HPV-008.&#xD;
The immune response data for the efficacy studies HPV-001/HPV-007/HPV-023 can be found under the NCT record NCT00518336. The immune response data for the HPV-008 study can be found under the NCT record NCT00122681.</description>

        <description>Anti-HPV-16/18 antibody titers are presented as Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) and expressed in EL.U/mL.&#xD;
The immune response of the HPV-16/18 vaccine (as determined by anti-HPV-16/18 antibodies assessed by ELISA) in the HPV-060 study population was compared with the immune response obtained in study HPV-001 and its long-term follow-up studies HPV-007/HPV-023 at equivalent timepoints and with the immune response obtained after natural infection in subjects from study HPV-008.&#xD;
The immune response data for the efficacy studies HPV-001/HPV-007/HPV-023 can be found under the NCT number NCT00518336. The immune response data for the HPV-008 study can be found under the NCT number NCT00122681.</description>

        <description>Seroconversion was defined as the appearance of anti-HPV-16 and anti- HPV-18 antibodies [i.e. antibody titer greater than or equal to (≥) the cut-off value] in the serum of subjects seronegative before vaccination in the primary study HPV-014 (NCT00196937).
