    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to : 1) determine if vaccenic acid (trans-11-octadecenoic, a&#xD;
      naturally occurring trans fatty acid isomer from ruminant animal products) raises LDL&#xD;
      cholesterol in a quantitatively comparable manner as mixed trans fatty acid isomers from&#xD;
      partially hydrogenated vegetable oils at 3% of energy intake, 2) determine if cis-9, trans-11&#xD;
      conjugated linoleic acid (a naturally occurring polyunsaturated fatty acid from ruminant&#xD;
      animal products) raises LDL cholesterol compared to a control diet, and 3) demonstrate that&#xD;
      mixed trans fatty acid isomers from partially hydrogenated vegetable oil raises LDL&#xD;
      cholesterol compared to a low trans fatty acid diet.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Volunteers who have lost 10% of body weight within the last 12 months or who plan to&#xD;
             initiate a weight loss program during the next 10 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of prescription or over-the-counter antiobesity medications or supplements (e.g.,&#xD;
