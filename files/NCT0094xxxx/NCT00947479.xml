  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a frequently underdiagnosed condition that has emerged as an&#xD;
      increasing medical problem with important social and financial implications worldwide. OSA is&#xD;
      a well established risk factor for systemic hypertension myocardial infarction or stroke and&#xD;
      it has been documented that blood pressure rises in a very consistent fashion during apneic&#xD;
      episodes. The incidence of the episodes of apnea during sleep causes repeated subclinical&#xD;
      acute kidney injuries (AKI) contributing to the development of CKD. One of the mechanisms&#xD;
      responsible for AKI might be endothelial injury followed by an increase of central aortic&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;

      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a frequently underdiagnosed condition that has emerged as an&#xD;
      increasing medical problem with important social and financial implications worldwide. Its&#xD;
      prevalence may reach 25% in middle-aged men and 11% in women. The most important risk factor&#xD;
      for OSA is obesity - every 10% weight gain increases the incidence of the disease 6 times.&#xD;
      OSA usually occurs in middle age males and is characterized by history of snoring, daytime&#xD;
      somnolence and nocturnal choking or gasping. The underlying cause is transient cessation of&#xD;
      airflow due to occlusion of the oropharyngeal tract. Episodes of apnea are considered&#xD;
      important if they persist for longer than 10 seconds, but in some cases they may last as long&#xD;
      as 2 minutes. The airway occlusion results in recurrent hypoxia, hypercapnia, arousals from&#xD;
      sleep, compensatory hyperventilation leading to secondary hypocapnia and generation of&#xD;
      exaggerated negative intrathoracic pressure that all can either directly or indirectly be&#xD;
      harmful to the cardiovascular system through several pathways like sympathetic activation,&#xD;
      inflammation, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. Recurrent episodes of&#xD;
      apnea/hypoxia may negatively affect the function of many organs, e.g. they induce (cyclical&#xD;
      bradycardia during the apneic episodes, followed by tachycardia during the ensuing&#xD;
      ventilatory phases) or rise blood pressure. Moreover, OSA is a well established risk factor&#xD;
      for systemic hypertension myocardial infarction or stroke and it has been documented that&#xD;
      blood pressure rises in a very consistent fashion during apneic episodes. The mechanisms&#xD;
      responsible for this phenomenon are complex because the direct effects of apnea (hypoxemia&#xD;
      and low intrathoracic pressure) are modified by cardiopulmonary reflexes. Undoubtedly, the&#xD;
      rapid increase in arterial pressure that occurs at the end of an apneic episode is mainly&#xD;
      mediated by surges in sympathetic function during the arousal reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertension has emerged as a second, after diabetes mellitus, most frequent cause of chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease (CKD). The rise of arterial blood pressure and endothelial damage due to&#xD;
      ischaemia during apneic episodes may contribute to CKD. According to the recent findings OSA&#xD;
      patients are much more frequently diagnosed with chronic kidney disease. The high frequency&#xD;
      of OSA in patients with renal function impairment could be explained by the fact that the&#xD;
      most common comorbid conditions of CKD, namely atherosclerosis and diabetes, are also&#xD;
      independently associated with his syndrome. The detailed pathogenesis of the strong relation&#xD;
      between OSA and CKD has not been investigated so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OSA patients are characterized by arterial stiffness, evaluated by pulse-wave velocity (PWV).&#xD;
      PWV is a sensitive and validated marker of cardiovascular risk, including premature coronary&#xD;
      artery disease, atherosclerosis, stroke and cardiovascular mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) is routinely based on changes in serum creatinine,&#xD;
      but its measurements are a poor indicator of acute deterioration in kidney function. First,&#xD;
      serum creatinine concentrations might not change until about 50% of kidney function has&#xD;
      already been lost. Second, serum creatinine levels can vary widely with age, sex, muscle&#xD;
      mass, muscle metabolism, medications and hydration status. Novel, more specific and sensitive&#xD;
      biomarkers of AKI are neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), cystatin C, kidney&#xD;
      injury molecule 1 (KIM-1), liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP), which&#xD;
      concentrations in both urine or serum rise significantly in patients with AKI and correlate&#xD;
      with severity of kidney injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CKD is a devastating illness that has reached epidemic proportions worldwide. CKD is&#xD;
      characterized by a progressive decline in kidney function that is associated with excess&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. The deterioration of kidney function can be delayed and patient&#xD;
      outcome favorably affected if kidney disease is recognized and treated in a timely manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study we would like to prove that apneic episodes during sleep can cause repeated&#xD;
      renal ischaemia-reperfusion injuries, which may lead to repeated acute subclinical kidney&#xD;
      injuries (AKI) contributing to the development of chronic kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to study the influence of sleep apnea syndrome on the markers of&#xD;
      acute kidney injury, endothelial function, arterial stiffness and central aortic pressure.&#xD;
