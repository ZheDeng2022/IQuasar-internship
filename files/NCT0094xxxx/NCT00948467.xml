  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose of TAK-733 in patients with advanced, nonhematologic tumors. The&#xD;
      expansion stage of the study will evaluate evidence of antitumor activity of TAK-733 in&#xD;
      patients with advanced metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
