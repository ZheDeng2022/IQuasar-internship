  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atherogenic dyslipidemia is characterized by high levels of apolipoprotein B&#xD;
      (apoB)-containing lipoproteins, including very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and its&#xD;
      remnants and small, dense LDL (sdLDL) particles, and reduced levels of high-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)&#xD;
      recommended using non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) to surrogate&#xD;
      atherogenic lipoproteins in clinical practice. Recently, the investigators have done a pilot&#xD;
      study to study the associations between SAH gene variants and atherogenic dyslipidemia&#xD;
      (surrogated by non-HDL-C) in postmenopausal women. The investigators found that homozygosity&#xD;
      for SAH haplotype 3 was associated with increased adiposity, insulin resistance, and elevated&#xD;
      levels of non-HDL-C in the postmenopausal women. Based on the findings of the pilot study,&#xD;
      the investigators plan to expand the cohort of postmenopausal women to about 800 women, that&#xD;
      is, recruited 660 new subjects in two years. The associations between non-HDL-C and the SAH&#xD;
      gene family will be done. Fasting blood sampling for buffy coats and lipids is the core test&#xD;
      of Study 2. A 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) will be available as an optional test&#xD;
      for a better phenotyping of insulin resistance for the participants. Detailed lipid profiling&#xD;
      including measurements of VLDL cholesterol, VLDL-TG, remnant lipoprotein, LDL particle size,&#xD;
      apoA1, apoB, and apoCIII will be done in the second year of the study if significant&#xD;
      associations between gene variants of the SAH gene family and non-HDL-C are detected.&#xD;

      Atherogenic dyslipidemia is characterized by high levels of apolipoprotein B&#xD;
      (apoB)-containing lipoproteins, including very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and its&#xD;
      remnants and small, dense LDL (sdLDL) particles, and reduced levels of high-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Extensive evidence shows that atherogenic dyslipidemia&#xD;
      contributes not only to residual macrovascular risk but also to inflammation and&#xD;
      microvascular complications. The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) recommended&#xD;
      using non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) to surrogate atherogenic&#xD;
      lipoproteins in clinical practice. Elevated non-HDL-C may represent abnormal secretion,&#xD;
      abnormal catabolism, and/or abnormal hepatic uptake of triglycerides (TG)-rich lipoproteins.&#xD;
      Recently, we have done a pilot study to study the associations between SAH gene variants and&#xD;
      atherogenic dyslipidemia (surrogated by non-HDL-C) in postmenopausal women. We found that&#xD;
      homozygosity for SAH haplotype 3 was associated with increased adiposity, insulin resistance,&#xD;
      and elevated levels of non-HDL-C in the postmenopausal women. Moreover, researchers have&#xD;
      identified that there are at least four members in the SAH gene family: SAH, MACS1, MACS2,&#xD;
      and MACS3. All of them seem to have acyl-CoA synthetase activity toward medium-chain fatty&#xD;
      acids and all are clustered in chromosome 16p12. In the present study, we propose to do a&#xD;
      two-year study to examine the associations between the SAH gene family and atherogenic&#xD;
      dyslipidemia in postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the findings of the pilot study, we plan to expand the cohort of postmenopausal&#xD;
      women to about 800 women, that is, recruited 660 new subjects in two years. The associations&#xD;
      between non-HDL-C and the SAH gene family will be done 18 months after the study started.&#xD;
      Fasting blood sampling for buffy coats and lipids is the core test of Study 2. A 75-g oral&#xD;
      glucose tolerance test (OGTT) will be available as an optional test for a better phenotyping&#xD;
      of insulin resistance for the participants. Detailed lipid profiling including measurements&#xD;
      of VLDL cholesterol, VLDL-TG, remnant lipoprotein, LDL particle size, apoA1, apoB, and&#xD;
      apoCIII will be done in the second year of the study if significant associations between gene&#xD;
      variants of the SAH gene family and non-HDL-C are detected.&#xD;
