  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase I/II study that will investigate the combination of dasatinib and&#xD;
      rituximab therapy in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. In phase I, eligible subjects&#xD;
      will take either 100 mg or 140 mg of dasatinib daily along with rituximab on day 1 of each&#xD;
      cycle for 6 cycles. In phase II, eligible subjects will all receive the same dose of&#xD;
      dasatinib, as established in the phase I portion, along with rituximab on day 1 of each cycle&#xD;
      for 6 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the combination of dasatinib and rituximab will&#xD;
      demonstrate efficacy in the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory CLL.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In phase I, patients will be enrolled in a standard &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation scheme with two&#xD;
      dasatinib cohort doses of 100 mg QD and 140 mg QD x 28 days/cycle with rituximab 500 mg/m2 on&#xD;
      day 1 of each cycle (375 mg/m2 on day 1 of cycle 1 only). During the first cycle of each dose&#xD;
      cohort patients will receive dasatinib on days -7 to 0 to allow for pharmacokinetic and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic analysis of single agent dasatinib dosing. Cohorts will be assessed for DLTs&#xD;
      during the first 2 cycles. Treatment will continue for 6 cycles or until intolerable toxicity&#xD;
      or disease progression. It is estimated that accrual of 3-6 patients will be completed in 4-6&#xD;
      months depending on DLTs observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dasatinib dose established in phase I will move forward to the phase II setting. If there&#xD;
      are no DLTs, the phase II dose will be chosen based on PD parameters. Dasatinib will be&#xD;
      administered for 28 days/cycle with rituximab 500 mg/m2 on day 1 of each cycle (375 mg/m2 on&#xD;
      day 1 of cycle 1 only) for 6 cycles or until intolerable toxicity or disease progression. For&#xD;
      this portion of the study, up to an additional 22 patients will be enrolled over a 6-month&#xD;
      period for a total of 28 patients at the chosen dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both, phase I and II, patients will complete up to six cycles of D+R therapy and&#xD;
      endpoints will be evaluated 8 weeks after treatment. Patients will be followed until disease&#xD;
      progression, study withdrawal or death. Patients with a PR or CR will be eligible to remain&#xD;
      on dasatinib alone.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. No history of allergic reaction to dasatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Use of Prohibited Concomitant Medications&#xD;
&#xD;
             Subjects requiring any of the following prohibited therapies should not be enrolled:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bisphosphonates Intravenous bisphosphonates will be withheld for the first 8&#xD;
                  weeks of treatment due to the risk of hypocalcemia. After the need for Ca2+&#xD;
                  supplementation has been assessed and levels documented to be &gt;LLN, subjects on&#xD;
                  prior bisphosphonate may be restarted with caution at the Investigator's&#xD;
                  discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  CYP3A4 Inhibitors/Inducers/Substrates Dasatinib is primarily metabolized by the&#xD;
                  CYP3A4 enzyme. Therefore, potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 are prohibited during&#xD;
                  study; for such medications, a wash-out period of ≥ 7 days is required prior to&#xD;
                  starting dasatinib. Subjects should be advised not to consume substantial&#xD;
                  quantities of grapefruit juice.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Drugs that may increase dasatinib plasma concentrations:&#xD;
&#xD;
             CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Dasatinib is a CYP3A4 substrate. Concomitant use of dasatinib and&#xD;
             drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin,&#xD;
             clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir,&#xD;
             telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
             In patients receiving treatment with dasatinib, close monitoring for toxicity and a&#xD;
             dasatinib dose reduction should be considered if systemic administration of a potent&#xD;
             CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -Drugs that may decrease dasatinib plasma concentration: CYP3A4 Inducers: Drugs that&#xD;
             induce CYP3A4 activity may decrease dasatinib plasma concentrations. In patients in&#xD;
             whom CYP3A4 inducers (eg, dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin,&#xD;
             phenobarbital) are indicated, alternative agents with less enzyme induction potential&#xD;
             should be used. If dasatinib must be administered with a CYP3A4 inducer, a dose&#xD;
             increase in dasatinib should be considered and approved by the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -Drugs that may have their plasma concentration altered by dasatinib: CYP3A4&#xD;
             Substrates: CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as&#xD;
             alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide,&#xD;
             quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine)&#xD;
             should be administered with caution in patients receiving dasatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Less-potent inhibitors, inducers, and substrates of CYP3A4 are restricted.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum):&#xD;
&#xD;
             May decrease dasatinib plasma concentrations unpredictably. Patients receiving&#xD;
             dasatinib should not take St. John's wort.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Antacids Nonclinical data demonstrate that the solubility of dasatinib is pH&#xD;
                  dependent. Simultaneous administration of dasatinib with antacids should be&#xD;
                  avoided. If antacid therapy is needed, the antacid dose should be administered at&#xD;
                  least 2 hours prior to or 2 hours after the dose of dasatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  H2 Blockers/Proton Pump Inhibitors Long-term suppression of gastric acid&#xD;
                  secretion by H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors (eg, famotidine and&#xD;
                  omeprazole) is likely to reduce dasatinib exposure. The concomitant use of H2&#xD;
                  blockers or proton pump inhibitors with dasatinib is not recommended. The use of&#xD;
                  antacids should be considered in place of H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors&#xD;
                  in patients receiving dasatinib therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Medications that prolong QT Interval&#xD;
&#xD;
             Subjects enrolled in this study should not take or begin to take concomitant&#xD;
             medications known to prolong the QT interval. If such medications are already being&#xD;
             taken by the patient before study starts, a wash-out period of ≥ 7days is required&#xD;
             prior to starting dasatinib. Medications known to prolong the QT interval and/or are&#xD;
             generally accepted to have a risk of causing Torsades de Pointes ventricular&#xD;
             arrhythmia are (see http://www.qtdrugs.org/medical-pros/drug-lists/drug-lists.htm):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Amiodarone, sotalol, ibutilide, dofetilide&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Erythromycin, clarithromycin&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Chlorpromazine, haloperidol, mesoridazine, thioridazine, pimozide&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cisapride, bepridil, droperidol, methadone, arsenic, chloroquine, domperidone,&#xD;
                  halofantrine, levomethadyl, pentamidine, sparfloxacin, lidoflazine Should the&#xD;
                  Investigator believe that beginning therapy with a potentially QT prolonging&#xD;
                  medication (other than the ones explicitly prohibited) is vital to an individual&#xD;
                  subject's care, the Investigator must check that the subject's prior on-therapy&#xD;
                  ECG has not shown a QTcF ≥ 450 msec or an increase in QTc ≥ 60 msec over the&#xD;
                  baseline value.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Anticoagulants and Medications that inhibit Platelet Function Caution should&#xD;
                       be exercised if patients are required to take medications that inhibit&#xD;
                       platelet function or anticoagulants.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Subjects enrolled in this study should not take concomitant medications that durably&#xD;
             inhibit platelet function. For such medications, a wash-out period of ≥ 7days is&#xD;
             required prior to starting dasatinib. (Agents that inhibit platelet function&#xD;
             transiently or inhibit coagulation by other mechanisms are restricted.)&#xD;
&#xD;
             Medications that directly and durably inhibit platelet function include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  aspirin or aspirin-containing combinations, clopidogrel, dipyridamole&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  tirofiban, dipyridamole, epoprostenol, eptifibatide, cilostazol, abciximab,&#xD;
                  ticlopidine, cilostazol&#xD;
&#xD;
             Medications that directly and durably inhibit anticoagulation include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  warfarin, heparin/low molecular weight heparin [e.g., danaparoid, dalteparin,&#xD;
                  tinzaparin, enoxaparin]&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Exceptions: low-dose warfarin for prophylaxis to prevent catheter thrombosis, and&#xD;
                  heparin for flushes of IV lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Women who are pregnant (including having a positive pregnancy test) or breastfeeding,&#xD;
             or unable/unwilling to practice an acceptable method to avoid pregnancy for the entire&#xD;
             study period and for at least 4 weeks after cessation of study drug, or men who are&#xD;
             sexual partners thereof.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sexually active women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use an effective&#xD;
                  method of birth control during the course of the study, in a manner such that&#xD;
                  risk of failure is minimized. Prior to study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of&#xD;
                  the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential&#xD;
                  risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  All WOCBP MUST have a negative pregnancy test prior to first receiving dasatinib.&#xD;
                  If the pregnancy test is positive, the patient must not receive dasatinib and&#xD;
                  must not be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Prisoners or subjects who are compulsorily detained (involuntarily incarcerated) for&#xD;
             treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g., infectious) illness&#xD;
