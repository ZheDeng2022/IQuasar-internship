  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is for people with a specific type of leukemia called Philadelphia&#xD;
      chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (the type the patients have). The&#xD;
      investigators plan to give you combination of 3 drugs (dasatinib, mitoxantrone, cytarabine)&#xD;
      for the first part of the chemotherapy (called Induction). The investigators have previously&#xD;
      shown that the combination of mitoxantrone and cytarabine is very effective in your kind of&#xD;
      leukemia. The purpose of this study is to establish a safe dose range of dasatinib in&#xD;
      combination with this standard induction chemotherapy based on side effects. If possible, the&#xD;
      trial will also give us an idea of how well this combination might work in treating your&#xD;
      leukemia. Previous studies have shown that dasatinib can produce responses when given alone&#xD;
      for your kind of leukemia. By using the dasatinib together with the chemotherapy, the&#xD;
      investigators believe that we can kill even more leukemia cells than with either treatment&#xD;
      alone. The investigators will initially treat patients with a low dose of dasatinib and&#xD;
      monitor for side-effects. If the initial group of patients is able to tolerate this low-dose&#xD;
      of dasatinib, then future patients will receive higher doses of dasatinib. Mitoxantrone and&#xD;
      cytarabine chemotherapy is the standard therapy at the investigators' institution for the&#xD;
      patient's leukemia and it is the combination of dasatinib with this chemotherapy that is new&#xD;
      and investigational in this study.&#xD;
