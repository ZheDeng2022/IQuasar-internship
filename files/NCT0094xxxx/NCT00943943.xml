      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn the most tolerable dose of Nexavarâ&#xD;
      (sorafenib) when given in combination with Mobozilâ (plerixafor) and Neupogenâ (filgrastim)&#xD;
      to patients with AML. The safety of this combination will also be studied.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sorafenib is a type of drug called a multikinase inhibitor. It is designed to interfere with&#xD;
      the parts of cancer cells that are involved in the sending of chemical messages and helping&#xD;
      the cells divide and grow, which may block the formation of tumors and cause cell death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Filgrastim promotes the growth of white blood cells, which help to fight infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plerixafor is designed to help move stem cells from the bone marrow to the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Dose Level:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will be assigned to a&#xD;
      dose level and schedule of sorafenib based on when they joined this study. Up to 5 dose&#xD;
      levels and schedules will be tested. Three (3) participants will be enrolled at each dose&#xD;
      level for Phase I of the study. The first group of participants will receive dose level &quot;0&quot;&#xD;
      of sorafenib. If unacceptable side effects are seen, a dose lower than level &quot;0&quot; will be&#xD;
      tried. If no side effects are seen, the next group of 3 participants will be placed on a&#xD;
      higher dose level, called Level &quot;1.&quot; Each new group will either receive a higher or lower&#xD;
      dose of sorafenib or take it more or less often than the group before it, based on whether&#xD;
      intolerable side effects are seen. This will continue until the best tolerable dose and&#xD;
      schedule of sorafenib is found. Once the best tolerable dose and/or schedule is found, the&#xD;
      last 10 participants will be enrolled and will take sorafenib at that dose and schedule. This&#xD;
      last group of 10 is considered the early Phase II part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each group will receive the same dose level and schedule of filgrastim and plerixafor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will receive filgrastim and plerixafor by injection through a needle under the&#xD;
      skin on Day 1 (the day the study starts) and then every other day for a total of 7 doses. The&#xD;
      injections will be given in the morning. After day one, the injections may be done at&#xD;
      participant's home. Participant's study doctor will meet with them one-on-one to discuss how&#xD;
      the drug will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1, participant will begin taking their dose of sorafenib by mouth every other day,&#xD;
      once a day, or twice a day, depending on when they join the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participant is taking sorafenib every other day, during Cycle 1 they will start&#xD;
           taking it 12 hours after the filgrastim and plerixafor injections (the next morning) .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participant is taking sorafenib every day, they will take it at the same time every&#xD;
           morning. The first time participant takes sorafenib during Cycle 1 will be 12 hours&#xD;
           after the first filgrastim and plerixafor injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participant is taking sorafenib twice a day, during Cycle 1 they will start taking it&#xD;
           12 hours after the filgrastim and plerixafor injections and then every 12 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will take sorafenib without food, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating.&#xD;
      If participant misses a dose, they should not take double the dose next time to make up for&#xD;
      the missed dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These 28 days are one &quot;study cycle&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant is allowed to take hydroxyurea or other treatments to control high white blood&#xD;
      cell counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Diary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will be given a study drug diary that they will be expected to fill out whenever&#xD;
      they take study drugs at home. A staff member will explain to participant how to fill out the&#xD;
      diary. The study staff will review the diary with participant at every study visit and they&#xD;
      will be given a new diary at the beginning of every cycle they start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every week for the first 6 weeks and then every 4-8 weeks until participant leaves the study,&#xD;
      the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam, including measurement of their weight, and vital&#xD;
           signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy done before treatment starts&#xD;
           and once somewhere between day 14 and day 17 after the first Sorafenib administration.&#xD;
           Another bone marrow sample will be collected between days 24 and 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participant continues on study, another bone marrow sample will be collected after&#xD;
           the third cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn every 2-4 days for routine tests while&#xD;
           participant is taking the study drugs and once a week on days they are not taking the&#xD;
           study drugs Plerixafor and Neupogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the first week, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease before each dose of the filgrastim and plerixafor combination and again 4 to 8&#xD;
           hours after receiving the study drugs. If participant's doctor feels it is needed,&#xD;
           additional blood may be drawn after the 2nd blood draw to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease. If participant's doctor feels it is needed, these blood draws may continue&#xD;
           after the first week if the disease is not responding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant may continue taking the study drugs for up to 6 cycles (about 6 months). If&#xD;
      participant is in complete remission, partial remission, or complete remission with&#xD;
      incomplete platelet count recovery after 6 months with no intolerable side effects, their&#xD;
      doctor may discuss continuing on the study with them. Participant will be taken off study if&#xD;
      the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is in complete remission, and if their doctor thinks it is in their best&#xD;
      interest, they may have follow-up visits about every 3 months until the study closes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a bone marrow biopsy and/or aspirate to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will have an end-of-study visit about 30 days after their last dose of the study&#xD;
      drugs. At this visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam, including measurement of their weight and vital&#xD;
           signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Sorafenib is FDA-approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      treatment of advanced renal cell cancer (RCC) and hepatocellular cancer (HCC) that cannot be&#xD;
      removed by surgery. Its use in patients with AML is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plerixafor is FDA-approved and commercially available for use in boosting the number of&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) for stem cell collection and transplants (in combination with&#xD;
      filgrastim) in participants with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM). Its&#xD;
      use in participants with AML is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Filgrastim (NeupogenÒ) is FDA-approved and commercially available for use in boosting white&#xD;
      blood cell production in participants with low blood cell counts caused by chemotherapy&#xD;
      (nonmyeloid malignancies, acute myeloid leukemia, and bone marrow transplantation), treating&#xD;
      severe chronic neutropenia (SCN-low blood counts), and boosting production of hematopoietic&#xD;
      progenitor cells in patients undergoing peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 28 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
