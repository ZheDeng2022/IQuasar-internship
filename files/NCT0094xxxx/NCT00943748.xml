  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Few available drugs can slow the progression of neurodegenerative pathologies such as&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease (PD). One of the recent hypotheses concerning the reduction of oxidative&#xD;
      stress and neuron death features a harmful effect of iron, which may reach abnormally high&#xD;
      levels in the substantia nigra (SN) pars compacta (iron overload has been seen in the&#xD;
      substantia nigra in parkinsonian patients and in the&#xD;
      1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD). Iron overload is&#xD;
      harmful because it reacts with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) produced during the oxidative&#xD;
      deamination of dopamine, generating hydroxyl radicals which then damage proteins, DNA and&#xD;
      phospholipid membranes and may be responsible for neuron death. The use of an iron chelator&#xD;
      (clioquinol) produces a reduction in neuron death in the MPTP mouse model. In humans, a&#xD;
      special, partially refocused interleaved multiple echo (PRIME) MR sequence has been used to&#xD;
      study the relaxation time (T2*) and quantify iron overload in the SN of PD patients and the&#xD;
      nucleus dentatus of patients with Friedreich's ataxia. T2* sequences have revealed a decrease&#xD;
      in iron overload following treatment with the chelator deferiprone, in parallel with a&#xD;
      clinical improvement in these patients. Furthermore, the very recent open label use of&#xD;
      deferiprone in rare serious, systemic, neurological iron overload diseases (Neurodegeneration&#xD;
      with Brain Iron Accumulation (NBIA)) has revealed a clinical improvement after 6 months, with&#xD;
      2 case reports from our group and another from an Italian group (Forni et al., 2008). The&#xD;
      safety of the low dosages of deferiprone (20 to 30 mg/kg/day) used in neurology appears to be&#xD;
      much greater than for the high dosages (75 to 100 mg/kg/day in 3 doses) used in hematology to&#xD;
      decrease post-transfusion iron overloads in thalassemia major.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the investigators wish to evaluate the effect of treatment with an oral iron chelator&#xD;
      which is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier (deferiprone) on iron overload in the&#xD;
      SN(as assessed by the T2* sequence) with respect to the progression of clinical sign in PD.&#xD;
      It is expected a 6-month course of deferiprone able to produce a moderate reduction in iron&#xD;
      overload of the SN, associated with a drop in the motor handicap score. Depending on the&#xD;
      risk/benefit balance determined in this initial pilot study, a larger, multicenter&#xD;
      neuroprotection study could be envisaged.&#xD;

      Primary objective: decrease the iron overload (as measured by the T2* MRI sequence) in the&#xD;
      substantia nigra in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) after 6 months of deferiprone&#xD;
      treatment, relative to the placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Other radiological criteria: Modification of T2* in MRI of the caudal nucleus head,&#xD;
           putamen and pallidum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the &quot;disease modifier&quot; effect on the clinical symptoms:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Parkinsonian syndrome: UPDRS III&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the Clinical Global Impression scored by the examiner and the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the safety on cognitive and behavioral functions&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  MDS-UPDRS I&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  overall cognitive function (Mattis, MMSE), memory, executive function, attention&#xD;
                (simple and choice reaction times)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  drowsiness and sleep (Epworth scale, Parkinson Disease Sleep Scale), depression&#xD;
                (MADRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Safety: complete blood count (CBC) with weekly leukocyte counts, standard blood&#xD;
           biochemistry profile, blood iron profile, ECG, blood pressure, bodyweight, adverse event&#xD;
           reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Specific biochemistry screen: heavy metal profile, oxidative stress and dopamine&#xD;
           metabolism.&#xD;

      Study center: Service de Neurologie et Pathologie du Mouvement (Head: Prof. Destée, Clinique&#xD;
      Neurologique and Service de Neuroradiologie (Head: Prof. Pruvo), Salengro Hospital, Lille&#xD;
      University Medical Center, Lille, France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study characteristics: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,&#xD;
      single-center trial with a delayed onset paradigm (Early-start group with 12 months of&#xD;
      deferiprone versus delayed -start group with 6 months of placebo then 6 months of&#xD;
      deferiprone) to study the effect of deferiprone on the relaxation time of the substantia&#xD;
      nigra during a T2* MRI sequence (R2*=1/T2* reflecting iron overload) with respect to motor&#xD;
      disorders in Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active compound: the iron chelator 1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-4-pyridinone (deferiprone,&#xD;
      FERRIPROX®), which decreases abnormally high iron and ferritin levels. Its low molecular&#xD;
      weight and liposolubility enable it to cross the blood-brain barrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Posology: the recommended dosage in neurology is a total of 30 mg/kg/day, in 2 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 40 adult parkinsonian volunteers, with early-stage PD under their first&#xD;
      optimised dopaminergic therapeutic strategy (i.e. either dopamine agonist and/or slight dose&#xD;
      of L-dopa) and free of motor fluctuations or dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned inclusion period: 12 months. Study duration for individual patients: 13 months (2&#xD;
      weeks between screening and randomization, 6 months of double-blind treatment, then 6 months&#xD;
      of open label treatment and then a 2-week wash-out period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures and timeline:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A screening visit (Sc).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two comprehensive examinations (a neurological and neuropsychological check-up) at the&#xD;
           randomization visit (V0, at D7-15 ± 1 week after Sc), visit after 6 months (V6, at least&#xD;
           6 months after V0), visit after 12 months (V12, at least 12 months after V0)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weekly monitoring of the CBC with the leukocyte count, results faxed by the patient's&#xD;
           local clinical lab or Lille University Medical Center's central lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitoring of blood iron and zinc status and overall tolerance during a brief&#xD;
           consultation: V1, V3, V5, V7, V9, V11&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI in an external facility at V0, V6, V12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Telephone follow-up: V2, V4, V8, V10&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be invited to participate in an ancillary study involving analysis of the&#xD;
           cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at the randomization visit and the V6, in order to perform a&#xD;
           full set of CSF biochemistry assays and with a view to determining biological benefits&#xD;
           at the central nervous system level and identifying biological markers.&#xD;
