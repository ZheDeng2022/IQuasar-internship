  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Keratosis pilaris (KP) is a benign skin condition that often is very frustrating for the&#xD;
      patients and treating physicians. The investigators are interested to see if the study&#xD;
      product is effective in treating moderate to severe KP.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Keratosis pilaris (KP) is a benign, inherited skin disorder that presents as grouped, rough,&#xD;
      horny follicular papules. It is estimated that 40-50% of the adult population and 50-80% of&#xD;
      adolescents suffer from KP. Both men and women are affected, with a possible female&#xD;
      predominance. It is noted worldwide and shows no racial predilection. Most patients with KP&#xD;
      are actually unaware that the condition has a designed medical term. Although no clear&#xD;
      etiology had been identified, KP is sometimes associated with other skin conditions such as&#xD;
      icththyosis vulgaris, xerosis or atopic dermatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patients with KP never seek medical attention since they are asymptomatic. However, KP&#xD;
      can create significant cosmetic concerns in some cases. It can also become symptomatic&#xD;
      especially when inflammatory lesions are present. There is no gold standard treatment for KP.&#xD;
      Prevention of excessive dryness of the skin and continued moisturization are used currently&#xD;
      as standard of care. Many topical agents such as tretinoin, ammonium lactate lotion, urea&#xD;
      creams, tazarotene, adapalene, tacrolimus, alpha hydroxy acids and salicylic acids have been&#xD;
      used with variable results. Sometimes topical corticosteroids are used, especially when&#xD;
      inflammation is present. In general, KP treatments need to be continuous and complete&#xD;
      clearance may not be possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Salkera emollient foam is a keratolytic foam containing 6% salicylic acid in an aqueous based&#xD;
      emollient foam vehicle. It is different from other salicylic containing topical product in&#xD;
      that it has been shown to produce desquamation of the stratum corneum while not effecting&#xD;
      qualitative or quantitative changes in the structure of the viable dermis. In addition, it&#xD;
      also contains aloe vera and anti-oxidants which help to sooth the skin. Salkera emollient&#xD;
      foam has been used to treat several hyperkeratotic skin disorders such as KP, psoriasis,&#xD;
      keratosis palmaris/plantaris, verrucae, icthyoses and pityriasis rubra pilaris. However,&#xD;
      there has been no published study assessing the efficacy and safety of Salkera emollient foam&#xD;
      in treating moderate to severe KP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective single center pilot study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Salkera emollient foam in treating moderate to severe KP. Patients' cosmetic acceptance of&#xD;
      the product will also be assessed. In addition, this study is also designed to develop a&#xD;
      validated outcome measure for assessing KP severity that can be used in future KP clinical&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
