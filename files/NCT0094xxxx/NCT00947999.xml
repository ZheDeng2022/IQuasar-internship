  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been little research on how chronic pain is related to brain activity. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to learn more about pain and brain activity by finding any differences in&#xD;
      brain activity among people who have moderate to severe chronic pain and a spinal cord&#xD;
      injury, those who have a spinal cord injury but do not experience chronic pain, and people&#xD;
      who have neither a spinal cord injury nor chronic pain (please note: subjects do not have to&#xD;
      have pain to participate in this study). The information we collect will help the&#xD;
      investigators get a better understanding of chronic pain.&#xD;

      Research staff will record the brain activity of subjects by using an electroencephalogram&#xD;
      (EEG), a device that measures the electrical activity in the brain through electrodes put on&#xD;
      the scalp. There is no risk of electrical shock. Research staff will put a cap on the&#xD;
      subject's head that has electrodes that will measure your brain activity. In addition to the&#xD;
      electrodes in the cap, two electrode clips will be put on your ears. EEG activity will be&#xD;
      collected for 20 minutes: subjects will have their eyes open for ten minutes, and then eyes&#xD;
      closed for ten minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the assessment, subjects will be asked how much pain they are currently in. Once the&#xD;
      20-minute assessment has ended, the research staff member will again ask subjects how much&#xD;
      pain they are currently in, and how much pain they had during the EEG assessment. Subjects&#xD;
      with SCI-related pain on a daily basis may also be contacted in the future to see if they&#xD;
      want to participate in the second phase of this study that will involve learning to directly&#xD;
      change their brain activity.&#xD;

        Subjects will be recruited primarily from a previous survey study conducted by the&#xD;
        principal investigator, as well as a data registry maintained by the principal&#xD;
        investigator. Individuals recruited for these studies were recruited primarily from&#xD;
        rehabilitation clinics. Interested individuals may also learn about the study from&#xD;
        advertisements in newsletters and magazines from consumer organizations, physician&#xD;
        referrals, recruitment descriptions on University of Washington websites, and study&#xD;
        brochures in clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, SCI subjects participating in the study will give friends and relatives who do&#xD;
        not have a spinal cord injury or chronic pain a brochure informing them about the study.&#xD;
