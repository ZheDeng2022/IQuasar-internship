  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C infected with genotype 1 hepatitis C virus&#xD;
      (HCV) consists of combined peginterferon/ribavirin for 48 weeks. Approximately 50% of&#xD;
      patients experience sustained virological response which equals cure. All other patients&#xD;
      either do not respond or experience recurrence of HCV virus and chronic hepatitis. Important&#xD;
      predictors of successful treatment are sustained dosing of both peginterferon and ribavirin.&#xD;
      With regard to the latter, clinical evidence indicates that higher ribavirin doses may in&#xD;
      fact even improve treatment outcome. However, high ribavirin doses cause hemolytic anemia&#xD;
      which require dose reductions. Recent clinical experience show that erythropoetic growth&#xD;
      factors, including erythropoetin, can counteract hemolytic anemia caused by antiviral&#xD;
      treatment in chronic hepatitis C patients. Therefore, the current trial aims to test whether&#xD;
      higher ribavirin doses adapted to a target plasma concentrations instead of a weight-based&#xD;
      dosing result in better healing rates, and whether ribavirin-associated hemolytic anemia can&#xD;
      be compensated by concommitant erythropoetin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a randomized, controlled, open-label design, the investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      patients with high ribavirin doses adapted to plasma levels experience better viral clearance&#xD;
      than patients treated with standard weight-based ribavirin doses. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that erythropoetin treatment will counteract hemolytic anemia&#xD;
      induced by ribavirin thereby allowing maintenance of target plasma concentrations without&#xD;
      ribavirin dose reductions.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevalence and incidence of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) are rising worldwide. Complications&#xD;
      include chronic liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma, and chronic hepatitis C is a&#xD;
      major indication for liver transplantation. Effective treatment is required to prevent these&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatment consists of a combination of peginterferon (PegIFN) and ribavirin (RBV)&#xD;
      given for 24 or 48 weeks depending on the viral genotype. While genotypes 2 and 3 respond&#xD;
      well to 24 weeks of PegIFN/RBV with approximately 80% viral clearance, genotype 1 infected&#xD;
      patients only achieve about 40-50% sustained viral response (SVR) with 48 weeks of&#xD;
      combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RBV is a nucleoside analog with structural similarities to guanosine, which modulates RNA and&#xD;
      DNA synthesis. RBV reveals antiviral activity against respiratory syncytial (RS)-virus,&#xD;
      influenza virus, Lassa virus uand others. The exact mode of antiviral activity is yet unknown&#xD;
      but believed to relate to reducing survival of HCV-infected hepatocytes thereby allowing for&#xD;
      elimination of infected cells by interferon-stimulated immune mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generally, RBV is well tolerated. With standard daily doses between 1.000 and 1.200mg,&#xD;
      irritability, sleeping abnormalities, cough and pruritus. The most prevalent and typical side&#xD;
      effect of RBV is a dose-dependent hemolytical anemia which responds well to dose reduction or&#xD;
      interruption of RBV therapy. RBV-associated anemia impairs quality of life and, overall,&#xD;
      25-36% of patients require dose reductions and/or RBV cessation. However, reduction/cessation&#xD;
      of RBV is associated with a significant drop of SVR and measures to maintain RBV doses are&#xD;
      clearly warranted. Several recent studies have shown that erythropoetin can counteract&#xD;
      RBV-induced hemolytic anemia, and improve quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relevance of RBV dose with regard to therapeutic response to combination therapy is&#xD;
      well-established and currently, RBV is dosed according to weight: patients with CHC genotype&#xD;
      1 are treated with 1.000mg if body weight is &lt;65kg, and receive 1.200mg if &gt;65kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective studies have shown that relapsers and non-responders to antiviral treatment&#xD;
      with RBV had lower RBV levels than those who had a SVR. In a retrospective analysis of 4&#xD;
      studies investigating a total of 1105 patients treated with RBV, RBV plasma concentrations&#xD;
      measured at 4 weeks of treatment correlated with viral clearance: SVR was 31.8% in those with&#xD;
      RBV levels &lt;1,000ng/ml, and increased to 62.5% with RBV concentrations at &gt;4,000ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot trial from Sweden investigated whether dosing RBV according to a plasma level of&#xD;
      15mcmol/l (3.7mcg/ml) in 10 patients. Median RBV dose was 2.540mg/day and all patients&#xD;
      received erythropoetin.SVR was achieved in 9 of 10 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, a randomized, controlled trial comparing weight-based RBV (standard) vs. RBV dosed&#xD;
      according to kidney function and plasma levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of efficacy and tolerability of treatment with PegIFN-alpha 2a + RBV dosed&#xD;
      according plasma concentrations vs PegIFN-alpha 2a + weight-based RBV in patients with&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis C genotype 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
