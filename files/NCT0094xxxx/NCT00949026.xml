  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine if it is effective to take samples of fluid&#xD;
      from the patient's brain tumor with a microdialysis catheter for Torisel measurement. The&#xD;
      investigators are also doing it to learn if it is safe to do so. The investigators will use&#xD;
      these samples to measure how much Torisel reaches the patient's brain tumor. The use of the&#xD;
      microdialysis catheter to collect brain fluid is an FDA approved method. This catheter is&#xD;
      already being used in patients who have sustained severe brain trauma from head injuries. The&#xD;
      catheter itself is smaller in size than the standard needle that will be used to take the&#xD;
      patient's biopsy. To obtain additional information Torisel will also be measured at the same&#xD;
      time in the patient's cerebral spinal fluid by taking it from a catheter placed in the&#xD;
      patient's cerebral spinal fluid producing spaces in their brain and in their blood from a&#xD;
      catheter in one of their vessels.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must be at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have histologically confirmed supratentorial grade III or IV astrocytoma&#xD;
             (anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, glioblastoma multiforme) and&#xD;
             require a stereotactic biopsy for confirmation of tumor progression or differentiation&#xD;
             of tumor progression from treatment induced effects following radiation therapy ±&#xD;
             chemotherapy. Patients with previous low-grade glioma who progressed after&#xD;
             radiotherapy ± chemotherapy and are in need of a stereotactic biopsy to confirm the&#xD;
             presence of a high-grade glioma, and this is accomplished at the time of biopsy, are&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status ≥ 50% (i.e. the patient must be able&#xD;
             to care for himself/herself with occasional help from others).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have had prior radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The patient is a candidate for temsirolimus as the next therapy for their tumor and&#xD;
             the treating physician and the patient must be planning to continue temsirolimus&#xD;
             chemotherapy after receiving the one dose required for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must have recovered from the toxicity of prior therapy. An interval of at&#xD;
             least 3 months must have elapsed the since the completion of the most recent course of&#xD;
             radiation therapy while at least 3 weeks must have elapsed since the completion of a&#xD;
             non-nitrosourea containing chemotherapy regimen and at least six weeks since the&#xD;
             completion of a nitrosourea containing chemotherapy regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must have adequate bone marrow function (defined as an absolute neutrophil&#xD;
             count of &gt;1500 cells/mm3 and platelet count &gt;100,000 cells/mm3), liver function with&#xD;
             Total bilirubin &lt;2.0 mg/dl and SGOT &lt;4 times upper limit of normal, and adequate renal&#xD;
             function with serum creatinine ≤ 2 mg/dl, creatinine clearance (24 hour collection)&#xD;
             &gt;50 cc/min. (Required labs must be within -7 days of catheter placement)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must be able to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with the potential for pregnancy or impregnating their partner must agree to&#xD;
             follow acceptable birth control methods to avoid conception. Women of child bearing&#xD;
             potential must have negative pregnancy test. The anti-proliferative activity of&#xD;
             temsirolimus may be harmful to the developing fetus or nursing infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients must not be allergic to temsirolimus or rapamycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with serious concurrent infection or medical illness, which would jeopardize&#xD;
             the ability of the patient to receive the chemotherapy outlined in this protocol with&#xD;
             reasonable safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients without MRI or CT evidence of measurable, contrast-enhancing residual disease&#xD;
             are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients receiving concurrent chemotherapeutic or investigational agents.&#xD;
