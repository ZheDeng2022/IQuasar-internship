  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will explore the safety and feasibility of performing a successful intravenous&#xD;
      patient controlled analgesia (IV PCA) Oxymorphone titration and conversion to oral ER&#xD;
      Oxymorphone (extended release or OPANA ER) in the outpatient setting.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This project will enroll 12 volunteers who suffer from chronic pain. Potential participants&#xD;
      must be on one of the following therapies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long acting morphine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxycodone Participants will be asked to complete a pain diary for approximately 10 days&#xD;
           and to stop taking their current pain medications the night before they are admitted o&#xD;
           the GCRC. Once the patients present at the GCRC, they will be started on the IV PCA&#xD;
           (Patient Controlled Analgesia) Oxymorphone to control their pain. Titration will take&#xD;
           approximately a total of 8 hrs. At the end of the titration period, patients will be&#xD;
           discharged home on OPANA ER. The oral dose will be calculated based on the IV PCA use.&#xD;
           During the titration, patients' pain, vital and side effects will be assessed hourly&#xD;
           until the 8th hour of the IV PCA titration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be contacted daily by a member of the study team to assess pain and side&#xD;
      effects. The OPANA ER dose will be adjusted as needed to adequately manage both.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients do not feel as though they are getting adequate pain relief, they can return to&#xD;
      their previous medication, at which point they are considered withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo an exit examination 2 weeks after they were admitted to the GCRC in&#xD;
      order to assess pain relief. In addition, a final follow-up telephone interview will take&#xD;
      place 6 weeks after the initial 1-day stay at the GCRC. Our research staff or physicians will&#xD;
      ask about your pain treatment and ask which Opioid medication you are currently taking.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years of age or older.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Ongoing chronic Opioid treatment with either oral morphine or oxycodone (long&#xD;
             term-more than three months and at least a total daily Opioid dose of 60mg morphine or&#xD;
             of 30 mg oxycodone).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pain of moderate intensity (&gt;= 4, on the numerical scale 0-10) despite ongoing Opioid&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-pregnant, non-lactating women.&#xD;

          -  Clinically significant respiratory, renal, hepatic, or cardiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented diagnosis of sleep apnea (the study physician may exclude patients who&#xD;
             present with clinical features and complaints suggestive of a diagnosis of probably&#xD;
             sleep apnea).&#xD;
