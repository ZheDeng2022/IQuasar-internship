      This study is being done to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test the safety of EP-100 and see what effect (good and bad) it has on the patient and&#xD;
           their cancer;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Find the highest dose of EP-100 that can be given without causing bad side effects;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine how much EP-100 is in the blood at certain times after it is given and how&#xD;
           quickly the body gets rid of it;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observe whether there is any effect of EP-100 on the size and activity of cancer in the&#xD;
           patient's body.&#xD;

             [Zoladex], deslorelin [Suprelorin, Ovuplant], Triptorelin and others) or antagonists&#xD;
             (such as Abarelix [Plenaxis], Cetrorelix [Cetrotide], Ganirelix [Antagon] and others)&#xD;
