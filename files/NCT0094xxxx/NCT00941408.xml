      This protocol aims to create a tissue bank of breast tumors obtained at the time of diagnosis&#xD;
      for the identification of biomarkers for diagnosis, prognostication, and prediction of&#xD;
      treatment response in breast cancer. While tissue banks now exist in major hospitals in&#xD;
      Singapore to collect tumor specimens at the time of surgery, specimens collected at surgery&#xD;
      from patients who had undergone pre-operative treatment represent a post-treatment sample and&#xD;
      not a baseline, untreated sample. Such samples are intrinsically different from untreated&#xD;
      samples, and have to be analyzed separately from untreated samples. However, they remain&#xD;
      valuable samples, particularly if a pre-treatment sample has been obtained, providing paired&#xD;
      pre- and post-treatment samples, which could provide valuable information on&#xD;
      treatment-related tumor biomarker changes. A tissue bank comprising of samples collected&#xD;
      during the diagnostic core biopsy thus represents a valuable supplement to existing tissue&#xD;
      banks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 10-20% of patients diagnosed with non-metastatic breast cancer will require&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In addition, future clinical trials may include&#xD;
      'window-of-opportunity' studies during which biological therapy is administered for a short&#xD;
      period (2-3 weeks) while an operable breast cancer patient is awaiting definitive surgery.&#xD;
      The majority of early-stage breast cancer patients would be eligible for such trials,&#xD;
      allowing the rapid recruitment of breast cancer patients. When coupled with analysis of&#xD;
      surrogate markers of response (eg apoptosis, anti-angiogenic effects, etc), these unique&#xD;
      clinical trials could provide valuable insights into the biological effects of new&#xD;
      therapeutic agents in evaluation.&#xD;

      Abstract of Research Proposal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, with various subtypes demonstrating differing&#xD;
      biological behavior, prognosis, and response to therapeutic agents. Improving the&#xD;
      understanding of the biology of breast cancer can result in better prognostication and&#xD;
      therapy in individual patients, and has important clinical implications. While valuable&#xD;
      scientific knowledge is generated from studies of breast cancer cell lines or animal models,&#xD;
      such information generated in vitro may not fully reflect the in vivo model. Direct analysis&#xD;
      of patient samples is important to validate in vitro findings, and represents a step closer&#xD;
      to clinical application. Studying patient tumor samples for genetic and protein markers and&#xD;
      correlating these analyses with clinical characteristics and outcomes could provide valuable&#xD;
      insights into tumor biology in vivo, and leads to better understanding of tumor biology and&#xD;
      resistance mechanisms. This is a single-centre study of biomarker analysis in breast tumors.&#xD;
      A total of 400 patients with breast lesions for whom a diagnostic core biopsy is planned will&#xD;
      be enrolled over 2 years. During the diagnostic tumor core biopsy, 3-4 additional tumor&#xD;
      samples will be obtained through the same needle track for the purpose of this study. The&#xD;
      tumor cores will be stored in liquid nitrogen for subsequent histopathological analysis; DNA,&#xD;
      RNA and protein will be extracted from tumor cores for genetic, gene expression and&#xD;
      proteomics studies. The patient's clinical progress will be tracked through the clinical case&#xD;
      files. For patients in whom the clinical diagnostic biopsy yields a benign result, the&#xD;
      samples obtained from them will serve as control specimens. For patients in whom the clinical&#xD;
      diagnostic core biopsy confirms the diagnosis of breast cancer, the samples will be&#xD;
      considered cases, and the following information will be tracked: histopathological&#xD;
      characteristics of the tumor including ER/PR/c-erbB2 status and other known prognostic and&#xD;
      predictive immunohistochemical markers (e.g., Ki67, p53, etc), anti-cancer treatment,&#xD;
      progression-free and overall survival.&#xD;
