  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent research has demonstrated a relationship between depression and immune system&#xD;
      activity, specifically proinflammatory cytokine activity. Although experimentally-induced&#xD;
      immune activation leads to increases in depressed mood, the neural correlates associated with&#xD;
      these changes have remained largely unexplored. Based on relationships between cytokine&#xD;
      activity, depression, and heightened physical and social pain sensitivity, I propose to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of proinflammatory cytokine activation on the neural correlates of&#xD;
      socially painful experience that may contribute to depression. Our previous work has shown&#xD;
      that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), typically associated with physical pain&#xD;
      distress, also plays a role in the distressing feelings associated with social rejection or&#xD;
      social loss. Moreover, recent pilot data has revealed that individuals with elevated levels&#xD;
      of baseline proinflammatory cytokines report feeling more distressed and show more dACC&#xD;
      activity during social rejection. To investigate the causal role that cytokines may play in&#xD;
      the heightened social pain sensitivity that can contribute to depression, participants will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to receive either endotoxin (which increases proinflammatory cytokine&#xD;
      activity) or placebo. Subsequently, participants will complete a neuroimaging study in which&#xD;
      they will be rejected during an online ball-tossing game. We hypothesize that individuals&#xD;
      exposed to endotoxin will report more social distress and depression following rejection and&#xD;
      will show more dACC reactivity during rejection. The proposed study is the first to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of systemic inflammation on neural reactivity related to social and&#xD;
      affective processes that may increase the risk of depression.&#xD;
