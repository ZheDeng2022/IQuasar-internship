      This study is a comparison of sensory recovery outcomes following the use of AVANCE Nerve&#xD;
      Graft or hollow tube conduit for peripheral nerve gap repairs in the hand.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CHANGE study is a post-marketing study designed as a prospective, single-blind,&#xD;
      randomized, two phase study comparing clinical outcomes of AVANCE Nerve Graft to hollow tube&#xD;
      conduits. The first phase (pilot phase) assesses projected differences expected between two&#xD;
      treatment groups. The second phase of the study provides comparison data between the two&#xD;
      treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AVANCE Nerve Graft is current regulated in the United States as a 361 HCT/P Tissue for&#xD;
      transplantation; not a Drug, Biologic, or Medical Device. Hollow tube conduits are currently&#xD;
      regulated in the United States as medical devices.&#xD;

    <description>Summary of Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) scores (Core Module) at Month 12&#xD;
The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) core module questionnaire is a 30-item questionnaire includes 21 physical function items, 6 symptom items, and 3 social/role function items. It is a patient reported questionnaire used to assess physical function and severity of symptoms in patients with musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb. Each of the items in the DASH use a 5-point Likert scale to assess the corresponding severity or functional parameter. The outcome measure is scored based on the formula ([sum of n responses)/ - 30 (minimum score]/1.2 (range of scores ÷100), where n represents the number of completed items. Computed scores range from 0 (no disability) to 100 (most severe disability).</description>

    <description>Summary of Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) scores (Work Module) at Month 12&#xD;
The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) Work Module questionnaire is a 4-item questionnaire used to identify the job-specific difficulties that workers might experience but which may not affect their activities of daily living. It is a patient reported questionnaire used to assess the impact that musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb have on a patient's ability to perform work-related tasks. Each of the items in the DASH Work Module use a 5-point Likert scale to assess the corresponding severity or functional parameter. The outcome measure is scored based on the formula ([sum of n responses)/ - 4 (minimum score]/0.16 (range of scores ÷100), where n represents the number of completed items. Computed scores range from 0 (no difficulty) to 100 (most severe difficulty).</description>

    <measure>Pain at 12-months</measure>
    <time_frame>12-months</time_frame>
    <description>Summary of Pain Assessment using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at Month 12&#xD;
The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) For Pain is a patient reported outcomes scale whereby the patient indicates his/her current pain level by making a mark on a continuous horizontal 10 centimeter (100 millimeter) line. The distance from the 0 millimeter to the patient's mark corresponds to the amount of pain the subject is currently experiencing. VAS for Pain data are recorded as the number of millimeters from the left of the line to the patients mark across the range of 0-100 millimeters, with 0 millimeter representing no pain and 100 millimeters representing &quot;the worst pain imaginable&quot;.</description>

        <description>Summary of Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) scores (Core Module) at Month 12&#xD;
The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) core module questionnaire is a 30-item questionnaire includes 21 physical function items, 6 symptom items, and 3 social/role function items. It is a patient reported questionnaire used to assess physical function and severity of symptoms in patients with musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb. Each of the items in the DASH use a 5-point Likert scale to assess the corresponding severity or functional parameter. The outcome measure is scored based on the formula ([sum of n responses)/ - 30 (minimum score]/1.2 (range of scores ÷100), where n represents the number of completed items. Computed scores range from 0 (no disability) to 100 (most severe disability).</description>

        <title>12-month DASH (Work Module) Scores</title>
        <description>Summary of Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) scores (Work Module) at Month 12&#xD;
The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) Work Module questionnaire is a 4-item questionnaire used to identify the job-specific difficulties that workers might experience but which may not affect their activities of daily living. It is a patient reported questionnaire used to assess the impact that musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb have on a patient's ability to perform work-related tasks. Each of the items in the DASH Work Module use a 5-point Likert scale to assess the corresponding severity or functional parameter. The outcome measure is scored based on the formula ([sum of n responses)/ - 4 (minimum score]/0.16 (range of scores ÷100), where n represents the number of completed items. Computed scores range from 0 (no difficulty) to 100 (most severe difficulty).</description>

The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) For Pain is a patient reported outcomes scale whereby the patient indicates his/her current pain level by making a mark on a continuous horizontal 10 centimeter (100 millimeter) line. The distance from the 0 millimeter to the patient's mark corresponds to the amount of pain the subject is currently experiencing. VAS for Pain data are recorded as the number of millimeters from the left of the line to the patients mark across the range of 0-100 millimeters, with 0 millimeter representing no pain and 100 millimeters representing &quot;the worst pain imaginable&quot;.</description>
