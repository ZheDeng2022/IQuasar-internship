  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Current rates of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) experienced by&#xD;
      outpatient surgery patients are as high as 20-30%. Electroacustimulation (EAS) therapy has&#xD;
      been demonstrated to be effective in controlling these symptoms, but trials identifying their&#xD;
      efficacy in the outpatient surgery population are lacking. This study integrates conventional&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy with alternative medicine in prevention of PONV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: One hundred twenty two patients undergoing surgery procedures at an&#xD;
      outpatient surgery center were randomized to two treatment arms. The first arm was&#xD;
      standardized pharmacologic PONV prevention typical for patients undergoing outpatient&#xD;
      surgery, while the second arm employed the use of ReliefBand, an FDA-approved&#xD;
      electroacustimulation (EAS) device with pharmacologic treatment to relieve symptoms of PONV&#xD;
      and pain. EAS is a derivative of acupuncture therapy that uses a small electrical current to&#xD;
      stimulate acupuncture points on the human body and is thought to relieve nausea, vomiting and&#xD;
      pain. Outcomes measured were post-op questionnaires evaluating pain and nausea symptoms,&#xD;
      emetic events, the need for rescue medications and the time to discharge.&#xD;

    <description>Phone survey of nausea/vomiting symptoms was administered on postoperative day 1. The survey consists of 8 questions, including: 1) a query about whether or not participant has experienced nausea since returning home; 2) rate nausea severity on a scale of 1-10 (where 10 is the most severe); 3) a query about satisfaction of nausea control; 4) a question asking if they would use the same post-op nausea treatment again; 5) a query about what activities the participant has been unable to do since surgery; 6) whether or not the participant has taken prescription medicine for treatment of nausea since returning home; 7) whether or not participant has taken prescription medicine for treatment of pain since returning home; and 8) if yes for 6-7, which medications.</description>
