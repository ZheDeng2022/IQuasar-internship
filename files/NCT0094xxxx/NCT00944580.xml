  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and immunological effects of a vaccine&#xD;
      for people diagnosed with high risk neuroblastoma, osteogenic sarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma.&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that this vaccine could reduce the incidence of relapse.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MAGE -A1, MAGE- A3, and NY-ESO-1 are antigens that can be found with significant frequency on&#xD;
      neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and osteogenic sarcoma, three relatively common solid tumors&#xD;
      that in some cases can be associated with a high risk for relapse. In this study each subject&#xD;
      will be screened for the presence of these antigens, and an individualized vaccine will be&#xD;
      developed and administered using the subject's own dendritic cells (DC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of two phases: a screening phase and a treatment/vaccine phase. First,&#xD;
      eligible individuals will be consented into the screening phase. Tumor specimens will be&#xD;
      tested by immunohistochemistry or RT-PCR for the presence of MAGE- A1, MAGE- A3, and&#xD;
      NY-ESO-1. Those testing positive for one or more antigen can be consented for the treatment&#xD;
      phase of the study. Blood will be drawn for DC culture, and approximately one month later a&#xD;
      series of three vaccines will be administered at two week intervals. Subjects will receive a&#xD;
      topical medication called imiquimod to the vaccine site prior to and following each&#xD;
      injection, to help immune cells travel into the area. Study participation occurs over 18&#xD;
      months and also involves periodic physical examinations and blood draws.&#xD;
