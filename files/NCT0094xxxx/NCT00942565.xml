  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient experience moderate to severe pain after abdominal surgery. This post-operative pain&#xD;
      can also contribute to complications such as respiratory impairment, cardiovascular events,&#xD;
      ileus, sleep deprivation and mood disturbance. Opioid based patient-controlled analgesia&#xD;
      (PCA) is commonly employed but opioids have the side effects such as respiratory depression,&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting, sedation, pruritus and urinary retention. Bowel motility can also be&#xD;
      affected. Consequently alternative or adjunct analgesic medications without these&#xD;
      side-effects have been investigated in order to reduce opioid consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multimodal analgesia is a technique whereby a combination of analgesic drugs with different&#xD;
      modes of action can be used to improve analgesia and decrease adverse effects by virtue of&#xD;
      synergism. Postoperatively, with adjunctive analgesia, PCA morphine consumption as well as&#xD;
      the side effects may be reduced. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been&#xD;
      shown to be opioid sparing and decrease the adverse effects of PCA morphine. A recent review&#xD;
      showed that acetaminophen combined with PCA could induce a significant opioid-sparing effect&#xD;
      but the incidence of PCA morphine related side effects were not reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is common nowadays to give oral analgesic supplements to post-operative patients on PCA&#xD;
      morphine. Tramadol, an analogue of codeine, is one of the choices. However, some of the&#xD;
      patients cannot tolerate the side effects such as nausea, drowsiness, sweating, postural&#xD;
      hypotension and dry mouth. Combination of tramadol 37.5 mg and acetaminophen 375 mg, which&#xD;
      has been used successfully to treat post-operative pain, may improve analgesic response with&#xD;
      better tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to assess tramadol 37.5 mg and acetaminophen 375 mg combination on the efficacy&#xD;
      of pain control, down stepping of morphine consumption and related adverse events with PCA&#xD;
      use after open colorectal surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to compare and evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The efficacy of tramadol/acetaminophen combination on postoperative pain relief after&#xD;
           lower abdominal surgeries&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effects of tramadol/acetaminophen combination on the consumption and the duration of&#xD;
           PCA morphine use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The adverse effects related to this regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effects on postoperative bowel function, tolerability of fluid and diet, ambulatory&#xD;
           function, sleep, and duration of hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The overall satisfaction of the patients&#xD;

      This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study site Patients will be recruited and studied at Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia for operation No premedication will be prescribed. Patients will be induced with&#xD;
      fentanyl 1 to1.5µg/kg, thiopentone 2-4mg/kg or propofol 2-3mg/kg and rocuronium 1mg/kg.&#xD;
      Anaesthesia will be maintained with cisatracurium and isoflurane with air and oxygen.&#xD;
      Intravenous morphine will be used for pain relief intraoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative PCA settings&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the operation, at the recovery area, patients will be given boluses of intravenous&#xD;
      morphine until satisfactory pain control, i.e. numerical rating scale (NRS) less than 4. PCA&#xD;
      machine will then be connected and patient will learn the technique of using PCA. The PCA&#xD;
      pump will be programmed as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each bolus: 1 to 1.5mg Lockout interval: 5 minutes Maximum hourly dose limit: 0.1mg/kg for&#xD;
      patients up to 65 years old and 0.075mg/kg for patients over 65 No background morphine&#xD;
      infusion will be given. Intramuscular pethidine 0.5mg/kg four-hourly will be prescribed as&#xD;
      rescue pain medications. Patients will be assessed everyday by the pain team of the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation and blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised to one of the following 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group T: Tramadol 37.5mg / acetaminophen 325mg: 1 tablet 3 times daily orally Group P:&#xD;
      Acetaminophen 500mg 3 times daily A computer-generated random sequence will decide the&#xD;
      allocation order. The appearance of acetaminophen looks similar to the tramadol/acetaminophen&#xD;
      combination. Both pain team members and patients will be blinded to the study medications.&#xD;
      The study medications will be used for 48 hours after operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up and assessments Patients will be assessed each morning by the pain team. The daily&#xD;
      average pain score at rest and during cough will be recorded in numerical rating scale (NRS).&#xD;
      Average daily pain intensity (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe) and average daily relief&#xD;
      (4=complete relief, 3=a lot, 2=moderate, 1=slight, 0=no, -1=worse pain) will be assessed. The&#xD;
      tries/good ratio shown on PCA machine and the total amount of morphine used, daily rescue&#xD;
      pain drug consumption will be charted. The adverse effects (nausea, vomiting, pruritus,&#xD;
      dizziness, and others) will be recorded with their frequencies and severity graded. Sedation&#xD;
      will be assessed based on the scale shown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ambulatory function, tolerability of fluid and diet and bowel function will also be&#xD;
      assessed. Sleeping quality will be evaluated using NRS and reason for it asked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PCA machine will be off if the NRS pain score on cough is less than 4. Patients will then&#xD;
      grade their overall satisfaction of pain relief at postoperative day 3.&#xD;
