      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of multiple ascending-doses of TAK-875 in subjects with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TAK-875 is being developed as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Nonclinical data suggest that TAK-875 stimulates&#xD;
      insulin secretion only at elevated blood glucose levels, with the potential for low&#xD;
      hypoglycemic side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this phase 1, multiple ascending-dose study is to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of once daily oral doses of TAK-875 for&#xD;
      14 days in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be housed for a total of 8 consecutive overnight stays in the clinic, and&#xD;
      will undergo oral glucose tolerance tests and standardized meal tests with multiple blood&#xD;
      sampling throughout their clinic stay.&#xD;
