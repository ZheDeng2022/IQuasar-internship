  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of 1994 indicated that 59% of&#xD;
      American men and 49% of women have body mass indexes (BMIs) over 25. Extreme obesity, defined&#xD;
      as a BMI of 40 or more, was found in 2% of the men and 4% of the women&#xD;
      [http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm]. The newest survey in 2007 indicates an alarming&#xD;
      increase in BMI; 63% of Americans are overweight, with 26% now in the obese category. With&#xD;
      extreme obesity as high as 26-30% in adults, obesity percentages in children are also sharply&#xD;
      on the rise. These alarming numbers pose a major clinical problem in terms of the safe and&#xD;
      effective use of drugs in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity may alter the disposition and/or clearance of drugs in the body as well as the&#xD;
      response, which should be considered when using anesthetics in these patients. Total&#xD;
      intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol is widely used in children, adolescents and&#xD;
      adults undergoing surgery, because of rapid onset of action, ease of titration and rapid&#xD;
      offset of action. While extensive research on optimal propofol dosing has been performed in&#xD;
      non-obese adults, including in critically ill mechanically ventilated adult patients by the&#xD;
      investigators' collaborators, there is no evidence on required dosages in morbidly obese&#xD;
      adult or pediatric patients of this highly lipophilic agent. As a consequence, serious&#xD;
      problems do arise due to under- and overdosing, increasing the risk of inadequate effects and&#xD;
      adverse events, respectively. Crucial additional information is needed on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of drugs used in morbidly obese children to improve safety and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal will test a novel approach by identifying pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      (PK/PD) factors that are associated with response to therapy and adverse events. If&#xD;
      successful, this study will provide proof of concept data for PK/PD model-based dosing&#xD;
      strategy that can be implemented into daily clinical care to allow tailoring of dose to&#xD;
      individual needs. Propofol is a versatile anesthetic agent which if dosed to individual needs&#xD;
      based on a patient's characteristics and specific PK/PD parameters, will allow individualized&#xD;
      dosing, thereby greatly reducing related toxicities. The prospective identification of&#xD;
      predictive factors in these morbidly obese high-risk patients represents a new approach to an&#xD;
      increasingly common clinical problem. The investigators expect that this study will generate&#xD;
      the PK/PD data necessary to continue with a well powered prospective clinical trial.&#xD;

      STUDY OBJECTIVES Hypothesis: The inter-patient variability in propofol effects in relation to&#xD;
      clinical response and adverse events in morbidly obese adolescents is associated with&#xD;
      identifiable pharmacokinetic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Determine to what extent body weight affects propofol pharmacokinetics (PK)&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamics (PD) in morbidly obese adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Develop a PK/PD model-based dosing algorithm for individualized propofol&#xD;
      dosing in morbidly obese adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this hypothesis, we will conduct a clinical study evaluating the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamics of propofol in 20 morbidly obese subjects scheduled to undergo&#xD;
      laparoscopic gastric banding or another elective procedure. Full PK/PD profiles will be&#xD;
      obtained during surgery and the Bispectral index monitor will be used as a validated approach&#xD;
      for PD monitoring, a measure of depth of anesthesia (5). The population nonlinear mixed&#xD;
      effect modeling (NONMEM) approach will be used with extensive covariate analysis to account&#xD;
      for observed inter- and intraindividual variability (6, 7). The potential covariates&#xD;
      affecting propofol PK (and PD) we will explore include total body weight, lean body mass,&#xD;
      Body Mass Index (BMI), Body Surface Area (BSA), height, age, gender, type of procedure, and&#xD;
      duration of procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, in an exploratory fashion, we will evaluate propofol pharmacogenetics. CYP2B6&#xD;
      and UGT1A9 are highly polymorphic enzyme responsible for the metabolism of propofol (20, 21).&#xD;
      Novel allelic forms of CYP2B6 (22) and UGT1A9 (23) were identified recently that potentially&#xD;
      could explain some of the large between patient variability in clearance resulting in large&#xD;
      differences in propofol blood concentrations and responses to standard doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN Description of Study Design The study will be a clinical non-intervention study&#xD;
      and will not interfere with the standard anesthetic and perioperative care except for BIS&#xD;
      monitoring and additional blood sampling from an indwelling line during and following&#xD;
      anesthesia. One blood sample for genetic testing (3 ml) and 1.0 ml for baseline PK/PD&#xD;
      modeling will be drawn from a venous line placed for clinical standard of care. The remaining&#xD;
      1.0 ml serial blood samples for pharmacokinetic modeling will be drawn from an indwelling&#xD;
      venous line placed under anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate that propofol will be given will be standardized to minimize variability between&#xD;
      anesthesiologists. Induction of anesthesia will be done with an infusion of 1000mcg/kg/min of&#xD;
      propofol. This bolus will be followed by propofol infusion at a rate of 250-350 mcg/kg/min&#xD;
      for 10 min, and then titrated to clinical needs by the anesthesia team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propofol Concentration Measurements: Blood samples (1.0 ml) will be collected from an&#xD;
      indwelling line in oxalate tubes. Samples will be collected at scheduled time points. The&#xD;
      number of samples for subjects may vary depending on the amount of time subjects are in&#xD;
      surgery. Samples may also be drawn at unscheduled time points if propofol dose adjustments&#xD;
      are made during the surgical procedure. The total sample volume for propofol concentration&#xD;
      measurements will not exceed 22ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be collected at the following scheduled and unscheduled time-points. Times for&#xD;
      sample collection are approximations. Ideally, samples beginning with the 15 minute&#xD;
      collection should be obtained within +/- 5 minutes of the times listed, when possible:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scheduled time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • within 15 minutes prior to induction of propofol&#xD;
&#xD;
      After induction of propofol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1-3 min&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 min&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 min&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  15 min&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  30 min&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  45 min&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  60 min&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  120 min&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  180 min&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  240 min&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Within 5 min prior to stopping propofol infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of propofol infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 min&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 min&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  15 min&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30 min&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  45 min&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  120 min&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unscheduled time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Within 5 min prior to each dose adjustment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  60 min after each dose adjustment&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: If a scheduled sample collection falls within 10 minutes of an unscheduled sample&#xD;
      collection, only the unscheduled sample will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole blood samples will be stored at 4°C until analysis (within 1 month).&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIS Monitoring: An age and head size-appropriate disposable BIS sensor (standard pediatric or&#xD;
      XP sensor, Aspect Medical Systems, Norwood, MA) will be placed on each child's forehead and&#xD;
      will be connected to a BIS monitor as directed by the manufacturer and described recently by&#xD;
      us (5). The sensors are single-use and are latex/PVC free.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each sensor contains a strip of electrodes. This one-piece unit is coated with a medical&#xD;
      grade adhesive to establish electrical contact when placed on the forehead, and is designed&#xD;
      for symmetrical placement to capture bi-hemispheric data. The sensor is attached via a cable&#xD;
      to a VISTA stand alone unit module that serves as an interface between the sensor and the BIS&#xD;
      monitor. This module is a signal converter, which acquires the electroencephalogram (EEG)&#xD;
      signal from the sensors and converts the EEG signal to digital format. The EEG signal is then&#xD;
      processed and the BIS index is played on the monitor. Data output (processed and raw EEG)&#xD;
      will be downloaded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BIS monitor screen will be covered during the procedure to ensure that anesthesia&#xD;
      personnel involved in the care will be blinded to the BIS score and trend screen to avoid BIS&#xD;
      score influenced changes in propofol doses. At the end of the procedure, the BIS data will be&#xD;
      electronically transferred to a computer along with time points and other study parameters&#xD;
      (18). Data that will be collected on case report forms include the following: date and time&#xD;
      of BIS data collection, including start and end times; minimum, average and maximum BIS&#xD;
      values at various time points including during propofol bolus doses, rate changes and&#xD;
      discontinuation; average Signal Quality Index (SQI);and average electromyography (EMG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and Clinical Data: We will use and analyze patient demographic and clinical data&#xD;
      in combination with the PK/PD data (10, 11) for Pharmacokinetic /Pharmacodynamic modeling&#xD;
      purposes. Patient data to be collected include: age, gender, ethnicity, weight, height and&#xD;
      body mass index. Clinical data to be collected and recorded on case report forms include:&#xD;
      blood pressure, heart rate, temperature and end tidal carbon dioxide level (ETCO2). Other&#xD;
      clinical data that will be recorded on case report forms include: time needed to lose&#xD;
      consciousness (loss of verbal contact), start/stop time of propofol dosing, propofol infusion&#xD;
      rates, propofol dose adjustments, time to eye opening on verbal command post infusion, and&#xD;
      sedation scores (Ramsey sedation scale) post-operatively every 10 minutes (+/- 2 minutes) for&#xD;
      the first 30 minutes and thereafter every 30 minutes (+/- 5 minutes) while in the Post&#xD;
      Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacogenetics: Participation involves the collection of one blood sample (3.0 ml) in an&#xD;
      EDTA (lavender top) tube for pharmacogenetic testing. Genomic DNA will be extracted using&#xD;
      standard procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire(s): The Structured Awareness Screening Interview shall be used to detect&#xD;
      awareness during the anesthetic period which can be an adverse event related to&#xD;
      underdosing/reduced sensitivity to propofol effects (24). This questionnaire has been used to&#xD;
      detect awareness and perioperative behavioral studies for children age 5 and older (25). The&#xD;
      same questions will be used for all children. No incentives will be given for the children to&#xD;
      answer, and no leading questions will be asked during the screening interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, the questionnaire will be administered two times, on post-operative day (POD)&#xD;
      1 and 3. The POD1 questionnaire will be administered by a study anesthesiologist. If the&#xD;
      subject answers &quot;no&quot; on question six, the anesthesiologist may decide to not continue the&#xD;
      interview. For subjects discharged prior to POD 3, parents or a legal representative will be&#xD;
      given a written set of questions before leaving the hospital and will be requested to ask&#xD;
      their child the questions on POD 3, write down the child's responses, and mail the questions&#xD;
      back. To justify repeated questioning, the parents will be told that a child's memories of&#xD;
      their anesthetic might change with time. They shall be instructed to ask the questions&#xD;
      exactly as they are written and to write down their child's reply verbatim. If a child&#xD;
      answers the POD3 questions directly instead of being asked the questions by a parent, their&#xD;
      responses will be evaluated for inclusion by the Principal Investigator. Subjects consented&#xD;
      as adults may answer the questions directly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a subject is still in the hospital on POD 3, a study anesthesiologist will administer the&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
