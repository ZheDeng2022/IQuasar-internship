      This study will develop and test a Web-based program to treat women with postpartum&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After a woman gives birth, she will often feel anxious, depressed, or upset. For most women,&#xD;
      these feelings go away within a week of giving birth, but for some, postpartum depression&#xD;
      (PPD) can develop. PPD involves long-term, more severe feelings of anxiety, depression, and&#xD;
      despair that impair normal functioning. Untreated PPD threatens both the mental health of&#xD;
      mothers and the development of their infants, but many cases go untreated. This may be&#xD;
      because of the stigma of mental health treatment, limited availability of programs, cost of&#xD;
      treatment, or difficulty finding the time to schedule trips out of the home. Treatment&#xD;
      through a Web-based program addresses all these concerns by providing a private,&#xD;
      cost-efficient program available anywhere with computer access. This study will develop and&#xD;
      test a Web-based version of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to treat women with PPD to&#xD;
      determine its feasibility and acceptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last 3 months. All participants will be offered a Web-based&#xD;
      version of CBT for PPD. The CBT program will include guided behavioral strategies for dealing&#xD;
      with depression, online videos of women who have used these strategies, Web forums in which&#xD;
      participants can ask questions of peers and experts, and periodic phone coaching. The program&#xD;
      will last 6 weeks. All participants will complete assessments at baseline, post-treatment,&#xD;
      and 3-month follow-up. Safety monitoring questionnaires will also be completed at Weeks 2 and&#xD;
      4 of treatment. Assessments will include clinical interviews and questionnaires related to&#xD;
      the following: health; depression; demographics; maternal skills, stress, and self-efficacy;&#xD;
      Internet use, experience, and self-efficacy; behavioral self-efficacy; and program&#xD;
      acceptability.&#xD;
