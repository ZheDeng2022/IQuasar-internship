      This trial studies how well a new smoking cessation and prevention intervention works in&#xD;
      enhancing smoking cessation for university students. The new intervention may be easier to&#xD;
      use for students to quit smoke.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the feasibility of a new smoking cessation and prevention intervention&#xD;
      including two new modules addressing alcohol use and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Demonstrate the feasibility of a smoking prevention website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Participants who currently smoke complete a survey over 30 minutes and discuss the&#xD;
      survey results with the counselor over 30 minutes at week 2. Participants also complete 3&#xD;
      internet surveys over 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Participants who currently do not smoke complete a survey over 30 minutes and discuss&#xD;
      the survey results with the counselor over 30 minutes at week 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 3 months.&#xD;
