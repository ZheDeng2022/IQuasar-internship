      The purpose of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the proportion of Asian patients achieving a target area under the curve&#xD;
           (AUC) of 20-24 mg.h/L using a pharmacokinetically guided 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the safety and tolerability of dose adjusted 5-FU&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To correlate 5-FU pharmacokinetics with gene variants associated with the 5-FU pathway&#xD;
           and with clinical outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on Western data, levels of 5-FU are highly variable when doses are based on BSA. A&#xD;
      relationship between systemic plasma levels of 5-FU and treatment toxicity and efficacy&#xD;
      exists. Whilst pharmacokinetically-guided dose management has been shown to improve 5-FU&#xD;
      efficacy and tolerance, there is currently no data in Asian patients using this approach.&#xD;
      Using pharmacokinetically guided 5-FU-dose adjustment, the investigators hypothesize the&#xD;
      proportion of Asian patients achieving a target AUC of 20-24 mg.h/L is similar to that of&#xD;
      Caucasians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open, non-randomised single center Phase II study evaluating dose adjusted 5-FU in&#xD;
      patients receiving de Gramont, FOLFIRI or mFOLFOX-6 schedules.&#xD;
