    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alveolar soft part sarcoma is a type of cancer that develops in tissues that connect,&#xD;
           support, or surround other organs in the body. It relies heavily on new blood vessels to&#xD;
           grow and spread through the body. There is no effective systemic treatment for patients&#xD;
           with alveolar soft part sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The drug AZD2171 (cediranib) is an experimental drug, not yet approved by the Food and&#xD;
           Drug Administration. The drug blocks the creation of new blood vessels. The drug has had&#xD;
           initial clinical trials, and researchers are interested in determining whether cediranib&#xD;
           is effective in inhibiting tumor growth in individuals who have alveolar soft part&#xD;
           sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To find out whether AZD2171 works in patients who have alveolar soft part sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals 18 years of age and older who have been diagnosed with alveolar soft part&#xD;
      sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After an initial screening visit, patients will take AZD2171 by mouth once a day, every&#xD;
           day for the duration of the study. The treatment will be given in 28-day cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will keep a study diary to record the doses taken, any missed doses, and any&#xD;
           side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will have the following tests and procedures during the treatment period:&#xD;
           clinic visit with physical examination every 2 weeks during cycles 1 and 2, then at the&#xD;
           start of each subsequent cycle, regular blood pressure monitoring, blood and urine&#xD;
           tests, heart function tests, imagining scans to evaluate tumor size and response to the&#xD;
           treatment, and possible tumor biopsy.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a rare, highly vascular tumor accounting for less than&#xD;
      1% of soft tissue sarcomas. There is no effective systemic treatment for patients with&#xD;
      metastatic ASPS. Little is known with regards to relevant molecular markers as potential&#xD;
      therapeutic targets. Cediranib (AZD2171), a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/KIT&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has recently demonstrated antitumor activity in early phase&#xD;
      clinical trials, which included 7 adult and 3 pediatric patients with ASPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the response rate (Partial Response (PR) + Complete Response (CR)) of&#xD;
           AZD2171 in adult patients with ASPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare gene expression profiles between pre-treatment and post-treatment biopsy&#xD;
           specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine if pediatric patients with ASPS will experience at least a minimal response&#xD;
      rate when treated with AZD2171&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic alveolar soft part&#xD;
      sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Less than 16 years old. Body surface area (BSA) must be greater than or equal to 1.04&#xD;
           m^2 and subject must be able to swallow tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate organ function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients will be treated with AZD2171 at 30 mg by mouth once a day for 28 days (28-day&#xD;
      cycles). Pediatric patients (&lt; 16 years old) will be treated with 12 mg/m^2/day once a day&#xD;
      for 28 day (28-day cycles).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure will be monitored weekly for the first 2 cycles then every 2 weeks for the&#xD;
      remainder of the study (unless patients have experienced elevated blood pressure requiring&#xD;
      drug therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computed tomography (CT) scans will be performed at baseline and every 2 cycles for restaging&#xD;
      during the first 18 months; after 18 and 36 months, restaging CT scans will be performed&#xD;
      every 3 or 4 cycles, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted using an optimal two-stage design in both pediatric and adult&#xD;
      patients. The portion in adults will rule out an unacceptably low 5% clinical response rate&#xD;
      (PR+CR) in favor of a modestly high response rate of 25%. In pediatric patients, the study&#xD;
      will rule out an unacceptably low 5% overall clinical response rate (CR + PR) in favor of a&#xD;
      higher response rate of 35%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional biopsies will be performed in adult patients only at baseline and after 3-5 days of&#xD;
      treatment (Day 3 (D3)-Day 5 (D5)) to evaluate early drug effect. A third optional biopsy&#xD;
      after completion of 4 weeks of therapy (between Cycle 1 Day 28 (C1D28) and Cycle 2 Day 7&#xD;
      (C2D7)) may be collected with the intention of providing further information about disease&#xD;
      response to treatment. Depending on results of initial gene expression profiles, the timing&#xD;
      of the biopsies may be adjusted, but without change in total number of biopsies per patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a retrospective pilot study, CT scans from 20 consecutive off-study patients will be&#xD;
      re-reviewed. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) imaging measurements will&#xD;
      be compared to volumetric density (Total Volume of Viable Tumor, TVVT) CT measurements. The&#xD;
      objective is to establish whether volumetric density/percent necrosis algorithms such as TVVT&#xD;
      more accurately assess extent of disease and response to therapy than standard RECIST&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total accrual ceiling is 73 participants (60 adult and 13 pediatric patients).&#xD;

&#xD;
        At present, the potential of Cediranib (AZD2171) for clinically significant drug&#xD;
        interactions involving the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes is unknown. However, studies of&#xD;
        the agent in rats indicated possible suppression of cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A&#xD;
        (CYP1A) that may be of biological significance. Eligibility of patients receiving any&#xD;
        medications or substances known to affect or with the potential to affect the activity of&#xD;
        pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD2171 will be determined following review of their case by the&#xD;
        Principal Investigator. Efforts should be made to switch patients with brain metastases who&#xD;
        are taking enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant agents to other medications one week prior to&#xD;
        starting therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        AZD2171 has been shown to terminate fetal development in the rat, as expected for a process&#xD;
        dependent on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling. For this reason, women of&#xD;
        child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to study entry. Women of&#xD;
        child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
        barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of&#xD;
        study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
        participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients should not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior therapy with anti-angiogenic agents is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with clinically significant illnesses which would compromise participation in the&#xD;
        study, including, but not limited to: active or uncontrolled infection, uncontrolled&#xD;
        diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;
        pectoris, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia;&#xD;
        or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
        requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may not be receiving any medication that may markedly affect renal function (e.g.,&#xD;
        vancomycin, amphotericin, ibuprofen, pentamidine).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are unable to swallow tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Mean QTc greater than 500 msec (with Bazett's correction) in screening electrocardiogram or&#xD;
        history of familial long Q wave, T wave (QT) syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Greater than +1 proteinuria on two consecutive dipsticks taken no less than 1 week apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant women are excluded from this study because AZD2171 is a VEGF inhibitor with known&#xD;
        abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in&#xD;
        nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with AZD2171, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
        discontinued if the mother is treated with AZD2171.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
        are ineligible because of the potential for PK interactions with AZD2171.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adult patients with hypertension not controlled by medical therapy (hypertension defined as&#xD;
        systolic blood pressure greater than 150 millimeters of mercury or diastolic pressure&#xD;
        greater than 90 millimeters of mercury despite optimal medical management). Pediatric&#xD;
        patients must have blood pressure (BP) within normal limits (WNL) for age. NOTE: blood&#xD;
        pressure within the upper limit of normal is defined as: blood pressure less than or equal&#xD;
        to the 95th percentile for age, height, and gender, and measured, and not be receiving&#xD;
        medication for treatment of hypertension.&#xD;
