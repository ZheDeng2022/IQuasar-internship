  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic 'Gastroparesis' or 'Gastroenteropathy' is a condition in which patients suffer&#xD;
      episodes of nausea, vomiting, abdominal bloating and pain after eating. These symptoms occur&#xD;
      in the absence of any structural abnormality of the stomach, rather abnormal gastric function&#xD;
      underlies the condition. Up to one in five patients with type I diabetes experience symptoms&#xD;
      consistent with this diagnosis. The effects on diabetic control, physical health and&#xD;
      emotional quality of life are severe. Patients do not respond reliably to general supportive&#xD;
      management or conventional medications. Surgical options have disappointing results. The need&#xD;
      for more effective treatment is acknowledged universally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feeding into the small bowel beyond the stomach (jejunal feeding) is established management&#xD;
      in diabetic patients with gastroenteropathy that are malnourished due to poor oral intake.&#xD;
      The benefits have been assumed secondary to improved nutrition and diabetic control; however&#xD;
      this assertion has never been studied. Recently we observed that patients with severe&#xD;
      gastroenteropathy recovered promptly and could eat normally during and for a few hours after&#xD;
      jejunal feeding. These observations suggest that jejunal feeding has 'quasi-pharmacological'&#xD;
      effects in patients with gastroenteropathy. One attractive explanation for these observations&#xD;
      is that gastroenteropathy represents a failure of oral intake to 'switch' the stomach from&#xD;
      the fasted to the fed state. According to this hypothesis, jejunal feeding 'restores' the&#xD;
      normal fed state by bypassing the dysfunctional stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will assess the effects of feeding on gastrointestinal (GI) sensory and motor&#xD;
      function in diabetic gastroenteropathy. Healthy volunteers and diabetic controls without&#xD;
      symptoms will also be investigated. Studies will assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Effects on GI symptoms and function to gastric distension in fasted and fed states&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Effects on GI symptoms and function to oral vs. nasogastric delivery of a test meal&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A trial of gastric feeding with and without prior jejunal feeding on GI symptoms and&#xD;
           function Non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques will be applied to&#xD;
           assess complex gastric response to feeding. In addition the effects of feeding on&#xD;
           symptoms and gastric function will be related to alterations in GI hormones and&#xD;
           autonomic nervous activity (eg cardiovagal tone) to assess how the integrated response&#xD;
           of the GI tract to feeding fails in patients with diabetic gastroenteropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this project is to assess the effectiveness of jejunal feeding in the&#xD;
      management of diabetic gastroenteropathy. However, by defining the processes that 'switch'&#xD;
      gastric function between the fasted and the fed states and control gastric emptying, we hope&#xD;
      also to identify candidate targets for more effective pharmacologic treatment of this severe&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
