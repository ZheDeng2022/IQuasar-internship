      MATERIAL &amp; METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICPANTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION CRITERIA: The enrolled participants must fulfill the following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All pre-terms ( &lt; 37 weeks of gestational age.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Within the first 7 days postnatal days (&lt;/=168 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinically stable from respiratory, hemodynamic and metabolic point of view.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Who have not received any painful stimulus at least 30 minutes prior to the&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Requiring routine orogastric tube insertion within the first 7 days of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Only the first attempt at putting OGT in controlled NICU environment will be considered&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXCLUSION CRITERIA: The neonates with the following characteristics will be excluded from the&#xD;
      study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neonates requiring ventilatory support.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neonates requiring oxygen supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Having any facial congenital anomalies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Having any neurological impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Receiving opiates or born to mothers receiving opiates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  New born babies to whom muscle relaxants, sedatives and analgesics have been&#xD;
           administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  With grade 3 and 4 IVH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  With major congenital anomalies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any history of birth trauma especially involving face or scalp (including&#xD;
           cephalhematoma/ subgaleal bleed).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Face presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two groups in the study ( group A &amp; group B). The enrolled neonates will be&#xD;
      administered either a sterile solution of 24% sucrose or double distilled water orally. These&#xD;
      solutions will be prepared under all sterile precautions by the laboratory staff unrelated to&#xD;
      the study, and packed in 2 ml sterile syringes further covered with opaque sealed envelopes&#xD;
      bearing serially numbered patient codes. The composition of these packets would be decided by&#xD;
      a senior consultant in the department of pharmacology who would have the access to the&#xD;
      randomization sequence and would be uninvolved in the present study. Fresh solutions will be&#xD;
      prepared daily and unused solutions will be discarded at the end of the day to be replaced&#xD;
      with identically numbered solutions from the laboratory. All study solutions will be stored&#xD;
      in the refrigerator at 2-8 0C until they are used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be enrolled into the study only after an informed written consent has been&#xD;
      obtained from either of the parent/ caregiver. 2 minutes prior to procedure, 1 ml of the&#xD;
      solution marked with patients's serial number will be administered orally to the patient by a&#xD;
      nurse using the syringe. The procedure would involve putting a 5-6 Fr. OGT in the neonate&#xD;
      which will be done by a group of 8-10 nurses who have been specially trained in this&#xD;
      procedure. This insertion of OGT will be done 2 min post administration of test solution by a&#xD;
      nurse who will be blinded to the contents of the solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The whole procedure (beginning 2 minutes before the OGT insertion and continuing till 4&#xD;
      minutes after it is inserted) will be video recorded on a fixed camera focusing on the face&#xD;
      of the patient. Neonate will be monitored using a non invasive vital signs monitor to monitor&#xD;
      his heart rate and SpO2 changes during the entire procedure and for 2 minutes post procedure.&#xD;
      The highest heart rate and lowest SpO2 obtained during the procedure till 2 minutes post&#xD;
      procedure will be recorded. The research candidate will evaluate the pain response to the&#xD;
      procedure according to the PIPP scale at time t=pre-procedure, t=intra-procedure,t=post 30&#xD;
      sec, t=post 1min, &amp; t=post 2 min; wherein t denotes the time at which tube is inserted into&#xD;
      the oral cavity. The research candidate will also monitor the time taken in the OGT insertion&#xD;
      using a stopwatch. The neonatal nurse putting the OGT will rate the procedure as easy,&#xD;
      difficult or very difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OUTCOME: Painful response, as assessed by the PIPP scale. SECONDARY OUTCOME: Maximum&#xD;
      heart rate and minimum oxygen saturation recorded during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION:The sample size was calculated based on the assumption that there&#xD;
      would be a decrease of at least 20% in the pain scores in the study population with the&#xD;
      intervention and using a alpha error of 0.05 and a power of 90% the sample size was&#xD;
      calculated to be 55 each in both the groups ie a total of 110 neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMISATION:Block Randomisation using computer generated random sequences with a block size&#xD;
      of 4 each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SEQUENCE GENERATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Block randomization using computer generated random sequences will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALLOCATION CONCEALMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be done by the pharmacy who will pack the sucrose and the double distilled water&#xD;
      (control/placebo) into identical containers and opaque sealed envelopes sequentially labeled&#xD;
      according to randomization code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPLEMENTATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization sequence will be generated by a senior consultant in the department of&#xD;
      pharmacology .The participants will be enrolled for the study by the candidate according to&#xD;
      the serial number as the candidate will be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BLINDING:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants, the research candidate,the nursing staff administering the intervention as&#xD;
      well as the investigators assessing the painful response will be blinded to the group&#xD;
      assignment&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL METHODS: Descriptive statistics will be calculated.Between groups comparison of&#xD;
      continuous variables will be done with the help of t test for parametric data and by Mann&#xD;
      Whitney test for non parametric data.The proportion and frequencies will be calculated using&#xD;
      the chi square test.&#xD;
