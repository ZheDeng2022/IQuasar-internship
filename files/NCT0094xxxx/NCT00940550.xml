  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has been designed to compare the effects of melatonin with those of drugs&#xD;
      (temazepam and zolpidem) regularly prescribed for the treatment of insomnia, in healthy,&#xD;
      middle-aged volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place at one centre. Volunteers consenting to participate in the study&#xD;
      will have their eligibility confirmed by a screening panel, including spending one night in&#xD;
      the sleep clinic to acclimatize to the study procedures. Blood and urine samples will be&#xD;
      collected during this overnight visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers continuing to remain eligible will receive, in turn, melatonin, temazepam,&#xD;
      zolpidem and placebo as a single dose during 4 treatment phases lasting one night and&#xD;
      separated by at least five days. Neither the volunteer nor the study staff will be aware of&#xD;
      which drug each volunteer is receiving at each treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteer's electrical brain activity will be measured whilst sleeping. Other aspects of&#xD;
      sleep, including measures of sleep quality, will also be measured. Urine samples will be&#xD;
      collected during each treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will undergo an assessment of health prior to departure from the clinic at their&#xD;
      last treatment phase, and study staff will telephone 2 weeks later to obtain further&#xD;
      information on their health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study objective is to compare EEG power spectra during nonREM sleep in the&#xD;
      slow-wave frequencies following administration with melatonin to temazepam.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This four-way cross-over study has been designed to compare the effects of three drugs used&#xD;
      in the treatment of insomnia on the brain electrical activity of healthy middle-aged&#xD;
      volunteers during sleep. During each of four treatment phases, volunteers will receive either&#xD;
      prolonged-release melatonin, temazepam, zolpidem or placebo, in sequence as governed by a&#xD;
      pre-determined randomisation schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at a single centre clinical research facility (Surrey CRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers who are eligible following screening will be invited to return to the sleep clinic&#xD;
      so that they may undergo a one-night period of acclimatisation to the study procedures (the&#xD;
      polysomnography [PSG] screen, Visit 2). Following confirmation that the participant has&#xD;
      adhered to the protocols restrictions, including tests for drugs of abuse and alcohol use,&#xD;
      vital signs will be measured and the actigraph will be replaced. Twice before going to sleep&#xD;
      and once on awakening, participants will complete a Karolinska Sleepiness Scale and undergo a&#xD;
      Karolinska Drowsiness Test. Participants will then undergo polysomnography, a series of&#xD;
      recordings of brain activity using electroencephalography and patterns of breathing, for an&#xD;
      eight hour period of sleep. In the evening a cannula will be fitted so that repeat blood&#xD;
      samples can be taken and this will be removed the next morning. During the course of the&#xD;
      evening three urine samples and four blood samples will be taken for the purpose of assay for&#xD;
      melatonin. Three additional blood samples will be taken during the night and urine will be&#xD;
      collected. On awakening, urine will be collected and the participant's stability will be&#xD;
      assessed using the Romberg test and the Heel-to-Toe Gait test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the PSG screen, volunteers will then undergo four periods of study (Visits 3&#xD;
      through 6), each of one night and separated by at least five days, during which time&#xD;
      participants will be administered either a single dose of prolonged-release melatonin or a&#xD;
      matching placebo, and a single dose of temazepam, zolpidem or a matching placebo. During each&#xD;
      of these periods, the same assessments as those conducted during the PSG screen will be&#xD;
      repeated except that blood samples will not be drawn for melatonin assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to departure from the sleep centre on each participant's last treatment period (or at&#xD;
      withdrawal if earlier), a physical examination including measurement of vital signs will be&#xD;
      performed, 12-lead ECG recorded and the clinical safety laboratory evaluations repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events and concomitant medications will be recorded throughout the study from the&#xD;
      time of screening to discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two weeks after the final treatment period, participants will be contacted by telephone to&#xD;
      confirm whether they have experienced any adverse events since completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A person's melatonin profile is widely recognised as a reliable marker of that individual's&#xD;
      timing of the circadian clock. Study participants' plasma melatonin profiles will be measured&#xD;
      during the PSG visit. Urinary melatonin will be measured during the PSG visit and all&#xD;
      treatment periods.&#xD;

             months or more at Visit 1:&#xD;

             of any allergy that in the opinion of the investigator would contraindicate subject&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
