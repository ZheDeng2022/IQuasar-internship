    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that clemizole hydrochloride is safe and&#xD;
      well tolerated when administered to subjects who are infected with hepatitis C virus and have&#xD;
      not yet received treatment. This study will also examine how the virus and body respond to&#xD;
      clemizole hydrochloride.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a phase 1b, open label study of four weeks of treatment with 100 mg po BID of&#xD;
      clemizole hydrochloride administered immediately prior to the initiation of treatment with&#xD;
      HCV standard of care therapy consisting of pegylated interferon and ribavirin in&#xD;
      treatment-naïve subjects chronically infected with HCV genotype 1 or genotype 2. The duration&#xD;
      of the study for each subject will be approximately 11 weeks (up to three week screening&#xD;
      period, four week treatment period and four week safety follow-up period). The duration of&#xD;
      the entire study is anticipated to be approximately four months (first subject in to last&#xD;
      subject out). Pharmacokinetic sampling will be done at Day 1 and Day 28 of dosing. PK&#xD;
      sampling will be conducted only on subjects who have consented to participate in the PK&#xD;
      portion of this study. Participation in PK sampling is optional for each subject.&#xD;
