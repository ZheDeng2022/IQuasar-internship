  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on manufacturer testing, no major difference in drilling condition is expected in this&#xD;
      study compared to the drilling conditions previously established. However clinical testing is&#xD;
      needed to establish optimal drilling conditions to be used for further development in both&#xD;
      unaffected and affected parts of the nail. The aim of this study is to determine the optimal&#xD;
      drilling condition that could be used in future studies of this device in combination with&#xD;
      topical treatment for onychomycosis.&#xD;

      This drug-free, single-blind device study will evaluate the completeness of the holes and the&#xD;
      tolerability (pain) of the drilling process by testing several trigger levels. Subjects with&#xD;
      distolateral onychomycosis will have a series of holes drilled into the unaffected and&#xD;
      affected areas of 1 or 2 big toenail(s). A pain level &lt; 4 using the subject self-assessment&#xD;
      Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) is considered as acceptable with regard to the study procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use a two-cohort design in subjects with distolateral onychomycosis.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is a male or female 18 years of age or older with clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
             distolateral onychomycosis without matrix involvement in at least one big toe with a&#xD;
             nail plate at least 2 cm wide. Note: This diagnosis will be based on clinical signs&#xD;
             and microscopy; no laboratory culture is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The total disease involvement will be at least 30% and no more than 70% of the total&#xD;
             surface of the 1 or 2 big toenail(s) to be drilled in order to allow drilling of up to&#xD;
             5 holes spaced at least 3 mm apart, 5 mm from the lunula, and 2 mm from the lateral&#xD;
             edge in each affected and unaffected part of the nail(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is willing and able to comply with the requirements of the CIP and visit&#xD;
             schedule. In particular, subjects must agree to remove and not reapply any nail polish&#xD;
             or related products to the target toenails for the duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject understands that this is a drug-free device study for which no therapeutic&#xD;
             benefit is expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must agree not to file, clip, or otherwise disturb the target toenail&#xD;
             between study visits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject agrees to participate in the study and authorize photographs taken per&#xD;
             study requirements, verified by dating and signing an approved written Informed&#xD;
             Consent Form (ICF) and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)&#xD;
             authorization before any study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is a female of non-childbearing potential (defined as post-menopausal&#xD;
             [absence of menstrual bleeding for 1 year prior to enrollment], hysterectomy or&#xD;
             bilateral oophorectomy) or if the subject is a female of childbearing potential and&#xD;
             has a negative urine pregnancy test (UPT) at the baseline visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Affected toenail(s) distal edge of the toenail plate more than 4 mm thick. The&#xD;
             distance from the affected distal edge of the toenail plate to the toenail bed will be&#xD;
             measured by using a ruler or caliper.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has other clinically significant nail disease, including clinical signs of&#xD;
             nail psoriasis, nail discoloration of nail trauma, or paronychia of the target&#xD;
             toenail(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signs of infection (other than fungal) in one of the feet, including the contralateral&#xD;
             foot&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject takes daily pain medication, including anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
             corticosteroid medications at doses that relieve pain&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject takes anti-coagulants (e.g., heparin, warfarin) at therapeutic doses.&#xD;
             Prophylactic anti-coagulant therapy (for example inhibitors of platelet aggregation,&#xD;
             low dose aspirin, or low molecular weight heparin) is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has proximal subungual onychomycosis or only superficial nail plate&#xD;
             onychomycosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has immunodeficiency, peripheral neuropathy, or peripheral vascular&#xD;
             disease, or known types 1 or 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has another underlying known disease, a surgical or medical condition&#xD;
             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might interfere with interpretation of the&#xD;
             study results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is currently enrolled in another investigational drug or device study OR&#xD;
             participated in such a study in the past 3 months prior to Visit 1 OR in an exclusion&#xD;
             period from a previous study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is pregnant or plans to conceive a child within 1 month&#xD;
