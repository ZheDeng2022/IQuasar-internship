      The purpose of this European Union (EU) study to evaluate the safety and performance of the&#xD;
      CAdiscTM-L Lumbar Spinal Disc Replacement Device in the surgical replacement of the lumbar&#xD;
      intervertebral discs (L3 to S1) for patients requiring surgical intervention for total lumbar&#xD;
      disc replacement for the treatment of debilitating, chronic low back pain.&#xD;

      Study Design: International, multicenter, open, clinical investigation with comparison to&#xD;
      pre-operative&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there are two surgical procedures for the treatment of chronic low back pain:&#xD;
      Spinal fusion and Total Disc Replacement. CAdisc™-L(Compliant Artificial disc - Lumbar) is a&#xD;
      Lumbar total disc replacement product that preserves motion and restores disc height and&#xD;
      stability&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical access is via a routine anterior approach with discectomy (removal of the diseased&#xD;
      disc), which is performed prior to implantation of the CAdisc™-L. Instruments are then used&#xD;
      to prepare the disc space and to controllably place the replacement disc at the target point.&#xD;
      It is not intended for the surgery to differ in type, duration or risk to any other device of&#xD;
      this nature.&#xD;
