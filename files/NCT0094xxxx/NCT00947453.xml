  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a group of 24 zinc containing enzymes in man. These&#xD;
      enzymes were originally described as cleaving extracellular matrix (ECM) substrates with a&#xD;
      predominant role in ECM homeostasis, but it is now clear that they have much wider&#xD;
      functionality. An imbalance between MMP activity and that of their inhibitors (tissue&#xD;
      inhibitors of metalloproteinases, TIMPs) is considered to play a critical role in the&#xD;
      synthesis or degradation of the extracellular matrix of the airway architecture which results&#xD;
      in fixed airflow obstruction in both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).&#xD;
      Using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) the investigators have&#xD;
      identified a difference between the level of steady state mRNA for MMP-9, MMP-14 and MMP-2 in&#xD;
      2 patients with asthma compared to 4 healthy controls using our method. However the&#xD;
      investigators require further refinement of the process in order to optimise RNA quality and&#xD;
      to evaluate the effect of montelukast across the entire family of MMPs and their inhibitors&#xD;
      (TIMPs).&#xD;

      The following measurements will be performed at screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spirometry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induced sputum&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following will be performed after 8 weeks of study medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spirometry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induced sputum&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diary Card&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spirometry:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be performed with a Microlab spirometer (Micro Medical Ltd, Rochester, Kent, UK).&#xD;
      The procedure will be according to American Thoracic Society specifications(13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diary Card Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will record their symptoms on a daily basis in the morning according to &quot;cough&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;breathlessness&quot; and &quot;wheeze&quot; on a 4 point scale with 0=no symptoms and 3=maximal symptoms. A&#xD;
      total symptom score will be calculated out of 12. Patients will also measure their peak&#xD;
      expiratory flow on a daily basis in the morning and record the highest of three measurements.&#xD;
      They will record that they have taken their study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sputum Induction &amp; Examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sputum will be obtained with hypertonic saline by the method described by Pizzichini et&#xD;
      al(14) inhaling increasing concentrations of saline (3, 4 and 5%) each for 7 minutes, through&#xD;
      a mouthpiece. After each period of inhalation, FEV1 will be measured for safety. Subjects&#xD;
      will be asked to cough sputum into a sterile container. Total cell count of leukocytes will&#xD;
      be obtained in a modified Neubauer haemocytometer. The cell viability will be determined by&#xD;
      the trypan blue exclusion method. Four hundred non squamous cells will be counted in&#xD;
      Wright-stained slides and the results will be expressed as a percentage and absolute number&#xD;
      of the total non squamous count. Measurement of MMP-9, 12 TIMP-1 and TGFb will be performed&#xD;
      in sputum supernatant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Profile of mRNA of MMP and TIMPs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total RNA will be extracted from the cellular content of the induced sputum plug using a&#xD;
      combination of Trizol extraction and Qiagen RNeasy spin columns in a similar way to&#xD;
      previously described12. Quantitative RT-PCR, using previously developed primers and probes,&#xD;
      will be used to determine the relative quantities of mRNA of MMPs and TIMPs as described12.&#xD;
      We remain the only centre in the world to routinely profile the entire MMP and TIMP gene&#xD;
      family in human samples. This gives an all encompassing view of the involvement of these&#xD;
      enzymes and inhibitors in the disease process and also sheds light on potential new&#xD;
      biomarkers. The possibility of expanding the gene profiling without the need for additional&#xD;
      sputum collection also adds value to the research. This might include other proteinase&#xD;
      families with roles in ECM breakdown or in inflammation.&#xD;
