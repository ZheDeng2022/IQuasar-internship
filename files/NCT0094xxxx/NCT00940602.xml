    <textblock>
      This randomized, double blind trial to evaluate deferasirox vs placebo in patients with&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndromes (low/int-1 risk) and transfusional iron overload consisted of four&#xD;
      periods, a screening period, a treatment period, a post treatment follow-up period and a&#xD;
      survival period. The trial recruitment period lasted until December 2014 and the trial&#xD;
      continued for three years from the date the last patient enrolled until February 2018 (last&#xD;
      patient last visit date).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening period lasting up to 35 days with two screening visits, at least 14 days apart,&#xD;
      used to assess patient eligibility. Eligible patients with low or int-1 risk myelodysplastic&#xD;
      syndromes (MDS) with transfusional iron overload were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to&#xD;
      deferasirox or placebo respectively. Randomization was also stratified using the&#xD;
      International prognostic scoring system of low or int-1 MDS and by geographical region (Asian&#xD;
      vs non-Asian countries) since the Asian population has been reported to have a longer&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following concomitant medications could be permitted for use while the patient was on&#xD;
      study, and information outlining start date(s) and end date(s) of each medication taken were&#xD;
      to be recorded on the appropriate eCRF: Erythropoietin (growth factor), G-CSF (growth&#xD;
      factor), GM-CSF growth factor), Azacitidine, Thalidomide, Arsenic trioxide, Lenalidomide,&#xD;
      Decitabine, Cyclosporine A, Vitamin C supplements (≤ 200 mg/day)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosing schedule was 10 mg/kg/day (once daily) for the first 2 weeks, followed by 20&#xD;
      mg/kg/day (once daily). After 3 months of treatment at the dose of 20mg/kg/day, the dose&#xD;
      could be adjusted by 5 or 10 mg/kg/day up to 40 mg/kg/day based on the serum ferritin&#xD;
      response. Placebo matching to each strength of the active deferasirox was utilized to&#xD;
      maintain the double-blind trial design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the treatment period patients returned to the investigational site every four weeks&#xD;
      for routine procedures and to monitor safety, efficacy and compliance to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) monitored patient safety and trial conduct and&#xD;
      received a blinded summary of serious adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All suspected endpoint events were reviewed and adjudicated by the Endpoint Adjudication&#xD;
      Committee (EAC) to ensure that all events that were reported were judged uniformly using the&#xD;
      same criteria. The first confirmed suspected endpoint event for a patient was counted for the&#xD;
      trial's composite primary endpoint, &quot;event free survival&quot;. The composite primary endpoint,&#xD;
      &quot;event free survival,&quot; was defined for a patient as the date randomized to trial treatment to&#xD;
      the date of the first documented non-fatal event, related to cardiac and liver function,&#xD;
      transformation to AML, or death due to any cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a patient had a non-fatal event, related to cardiac and liver function, and&#xD;
      transformation to AML, the trial treatment (deferasirox or placebo) was discontinued. After&#xD;
      trial treatment was discontinued, a 28 days post treatment safety assessment for AEs and SAEs&#xD;
      was completed. Any patient who died during the treatment or 28 day post treatment safety&#xD;
      assessment is represented in the all-cause mortality table in the safety section of this&#xD;
      result. After trial treatment was discontinued for a patient, their treatment was un-blinded.&#xD;
      Subsequent iron chelation treatment was subject to the patient's and investigator's decision.&#xD;
      Patients continued to be followed during the post-treatment evaluation or survival follow up&#xD;
      period, depending on their choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who did not meet a non-fatal event, study treatment was continued as long as the&#xD;
      patient and the treating physician felt it was in the best interest for the patient or until&#xD;
      the trial terminated/completed. There was no un-blinding of the trial treatment for patients&#xD;
      who terminated trial treatment without meeting a non-fatal event. Patients continued to be&#xD;
      followed during the post-treatment evaluation or survival follow up period, depending on&#xD;
      their choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient who discontinued study treatment without meeting a non-fatal component of the&#xD;
      composite primary endpoint continued to be evaluated every 3 months. Once a patient stopped&#xD;
      study evaluations they were followed for at least every 6 months for overall survival and any&#xD;
      iron chelation therapies they are receiving up to the end of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-treatment evaluation period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who had a non-fatal event: After treatment termination, all patients were&#xD;
      followed for safety (28 days) and then evaluated with visits every three months if they&#xD;
      agreed to move into the post treatment evaluation phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who did not meet a non-fatal event: After termination of study treatment, if a&#xD;
      patient and investigator chose the post-treatment evaluation period, the patient was followed&#xD;
      for safety and endpoints at visits occurring every three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival Follow Up period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent to the post treatment evaluation period, or at the end of treatment period, if a&#xD;
      patient and treating physician decided that the patient would not participate in the post&#xD;
      treatment evaluation period, the patient was followed every 6 months for overall survival and&#xD;
      iron chelation therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of the study was defined as three years from the date the last patient was enrolled&#xD;
      (last patient first visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size of 210 patients did not provide sufficient power for testing statistical&#xD;
      hypotheses. The statistical analysis was revised accordingly to concentrate on evaluating the&#xD;
      treatment effect of deferasirox relative to placebo, and the study phase designation was&#xD;
      changed from Phase lll to Phase II. Amendment 4 of the study adjusted the sample size,&#xD;
      statistical analysis, and duration of the study and added two secondary endpoints:&#xD;
      Hematologic improvement (HI) in terms of erythroid response and Frequency and rate of&#xD;
      infections requiring intravenous (IV) antimicrobials. Upon approval of the amendment,&#xD;
      patients signed a new consent form and continued the appropriate visit schedule.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>1 patient rand. to deferasirox arm did not receive study drug &amp; was excl. from the Safety set. Terminated by Sponsor: Patients who had completed at least 3 years of on-treatment period including 28-day follow-up &amp; were still on trial when end-of-study definition (3 years after LPFV) was reached &amp; therefore, the study was terminated as per protocol</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The planned sample size of 210 patients randomized in a ratio of 2:1 in favor of deferasirox was based on the feasibility of enrolling the patients and consultations with the Health Authorities.</pre_assignment_details>
