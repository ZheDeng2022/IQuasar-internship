    <textblock>
      Pulmonary hypertension (PH) at rest is a risk factor for death in patients with sickle-cell&#xD;
      anemia (SCA). Exercise echocardiography (EE) can detect latent PH. We sought to investigate&#xD;
      the occurrence of exercise-induced PH in patients with SCA and normal pulmonary pressure (PP)&#xD;
      at rest, and its relationship with clinical and echocardiographic variables.Forty-four&#xD;
      patients with SCA and normal PP at rest were studied and divided into two groups: exhibiting&#xD;
      normal PP after treadmill EE (TRV≤2.7m/s) (G1), and exhibiting exercise-induced PH&#xD;
      (TRV&gt;2.7m/s) (G2). TRV cutoff points at rest and during exercise were based on data from&#xD;
      healthy control subjects, matched for age, sex, and body surface area. Data obtained from EE&#xD;
      were correlated with clinical, echocardiographic and ergometric variables.Exercise-induced PH&#xD;
      occurred in 57% of the sample (G2), significantly higher than those of G1. Exercise-induced&#xD;
      PH was related to higher levels of creatinine (p&lt;0.05), increased left atrial volume (p&lt;0.05)&#xD;
      and right ventricular diastolic area (p&lt;0.05), larger E/Em waves ratio derived from spectral&#xD;
      and tissue Doppler (p&lt;0.05), and higher TRV at rest (p&lt;0.005).We concluded that patients with&#xD;
      SCA and normal PP at rest may exhibit exercise-induced PH, which was related to renal&#xD;
      function, increased cardiac chambers, abnormal indices of diastolic function and baseline TRV&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;

      Pulmonary hypertension (PH) at rest is a risk factor for death in patients with sickle-cell&#xD;
      anemia (SCA). Exercise echocardiography (EE) can detect latent PH. We sought to investigate&#xD;
      the occurrence of exercise-induced PH in patients with SCA and normal pulmonary pressure (PP)&#xD;
      at rest, and its relationship with clinical and echocardiographic variables.Forty-four&#xD;
      patients (22 men, mean age 25 y.o.) with SCA and normal PP at rest (tricuspid regurgitant jet&#xD;
      flow velocity [TRV] &lt;2.5 m/s) were studied and divided into two groups: exhibiting normal PP&#xD;
      after treadmill EE (TRV≤2.7m/s) (G1), and exhibiting exercise-induced PH (TRV&gt;2.7m/s) (G2).&#xD;
      TRV cutoff points at rest and during exercise were based on data from healthy control&#xD;
      subjects, matched for age, sex, and body surface area. Data obtained from EE were correlated&#xD;
      with clinical, echocardiographic and ergometric variables.Exercise-induced PH occurred in 57%&#xD;
      of the sample (G2), with mean TRV level of 3.4±0.4 m/s (range 2.8 - 4.5m/s), significantly&#xD;
      higher than those of G1 (2.5±0.3 m/s, p&lt;0.001). Exercise-induced PH was related to higher&#xD;
      levels of creatinine (p&lt;0.05), increased left atrial volume (p&lt;0.05) and right ventricular&#xD;
      diastolic area (p&lt;0.05), larger E/Em waves ratio derived from spectral and tissue Doppler&#xD;
      (p&lt;0.05), and higher TRV at rest (p&lt;0.005).We concluded that patients with SCA and normal PP&#xD;
      at rest may exhibit exercise-induced PH, which was related to renal function, increased&#xD;
      cardiac chambers, abnormal indices of diastolic function and baseline TRV levels. The&#xD;
      clinical meaning of these findings requires clarification in future studies.&#xD;
