  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of ABT-888 when given in&#xD;
      combination with temozolomide in treating young patients with recurrent or refractory CNS&#xD;
      tumors. ABT-888 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.&#xD;
      Giving ABT-888 together with temozolomide may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ABT-888 in combination with temozolomide&#xD;
      in children with recurrent or refractory CNS tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To study the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of ABT-888 and PARP inhibition in peripheral&#xD;
      blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in order to recommend a Phase 2 dose of ABT-888 in combination&#xD;
      with temozolomide in children with recurrent or refractory CNS tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To describe the toxicities of the combination of ABT-888 and temozolomide in children&#xD;
      with recurrent or refractory CNS tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To measure non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) activity in peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
      cells (PBMC) prior to and following ABT-888 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess PARP expression and/or activity in tumor tissue obtained at either initial&#xD;
      diagnosis or relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine expression and/or activity of DNA repair pathways, including MGMT and&#xD;
      mismatch repair, in tumor tissues, when available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To document, within the confines of this phase 1 trial, radiographic tumor response to&#xD;
      ABT-888 and temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ABT-888.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral ABT-888 twice daily and oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 13-26 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are collected for pharmacokinetics and further laboratory analysis.&#xD;
