        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;

             the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following&#xD;
             confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the&#xD;
             study without use of a contraceptive method.&#xD;
