      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the best combination of oxaliplatin,&#xD;
      bevacizumab, 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and cetuximab that can be given to patients with&#xD;
      advanced cancer that has spread to the liver. Different combinations of these drugs will be&#xD;
      used, and the safety of all drug combinations will also be studied.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxaliplatin is designed to keep new cancer cells from growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5-fluorouracil is designed to block the way cancer cells grow and divide, which may slow or&#xD;
      stop their growth and keep them from spreading throughout the body. This may cause the cancer&#xD;
      cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leucovorin is designed to strengthen the effect of 5-fluorouracil by reducing tumor cell&#xD;
      resistance to 5-fluorouracil. BECAUSE OF A PHARMACY SHORTAGE OF IV LEUCOVORIN, PATIENTS WILL&#xD;
      CONTINUE TREATMENT WITHOUT LEUCOVORIN UNTIL IT BECOMES AVAILABLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab is designed to block the growth of blood vessels that supply nutrients necessary&#xD;
      for tumor growth. This may prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells. Bevacizumab is no&#xD;
      longer FDA approved to treat breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cetuximab is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking proteins&#xD;
      inside the cancer cell, called the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study&#xD;
      &quot;arm&quot; (group) based on the results of your screening tests. All patients will receive&#xD;
      oxaliplatin and bevacizumab. If your doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you will also&#xD;
      receive cetuximab. However, recent studies have found that cetuximab, when given alone or in&#xD;
      combination with other chemotherapy drugs, was not effective when given to patients with&#xD;
      colorectal cancer that had a K-RAS mutation. If you have colorectal cancer and you are tested&#xD;
      for and do not have the K-RAS gene, you will also receive cetuximab. Patients with normal&#xD;
      liver function will also receive 5-FU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Arm A, you will receive oxaliplatin, 5-FU, and bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Arm B, you will receive oxaliplatin, 5-FU, leucovorin, bevacizumab, and&#xD;
           cetuximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Arm C, you will receive oxaliplatin and bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Arm D, you will receive oxaliplatin, bevacizumab, and cetuximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the same dose levels of oxaliplatin and bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be assigned to a dose level of 5-FU based on when you joined this study. Up to 4&#xD;
      dose levels of 5-FU will be tested. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level.&#xD;
      The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will&#xD;
      receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the same dose levels of oxaliplatin, bevacizumab, and&#xD;
      leucovorin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be assigned to a combination dose level of 5-FU and cetuximab based on when you&#xD;
      joined this study. Up to 4 combination dose levels of 5-FU and cetuximab will be tested. Up&#xD;
      to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants will&#xD;
      receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group&#xD;
      before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm C:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the same dose levels of oxaliplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be assigned to a dose level of bevacizumab based on when you joined this study. Up&#xD;
      to 4 dose levels of bevacizumab will be tested. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled at each&#xD;
      dose level. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new&#xD;
      group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects&#xD;
      were seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm D:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the same dose levels of oxaliplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be assigned to a combination dose level of bevacizumab and cetuximab based on when&#xD;
      you joined this study. Up to 4 combination dose levels of bevacizumab and cetuximab will be&#xD;
      tested. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of&#xD;
      participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose&#xD;
      than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each group, after the highest tolerable dose of the study drug combination is found, up to&#xD;
      12 additional patients will receive that dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, for Arm A and Arm B, after the highest tolerable dose of the study drug&#xD;
      combination is found, up to 20 additional participants with colorectal cancer will be added&#xD;
      to Arm A and Arm B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catheter Placement for Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be hospitalized to receive the study drug combination. On the day of your admission&#xD;
      to the hospital, you will have a catheter (a sterile flexible tube that will be placed in the&#xD;
      hepatic artery [a blood vessel in the liver] while you are under local anesthesia) through&#xD;
      which you will receive the study drugs. The catheter will be placed and removed during each&#xD;
      cycle. Your doctor will explain this procedure to you in more detail, and you will be&#xD;
      required to sign a separate consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You must lay in bed for the entire time that the catheter is in place. In some cases, the&#xD;
      catheter will be removed right after your chemotherapy is complete. In some cases, the&#xD;
      catheter may remain in overnight. Therefore, you must remain in bed until the catheter is&#xD;
      removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 1 of each 21 day cycle you will receive oxaliplatin through the hepatic arterial&#xD;
      catheter over 2 hours. You will then receive 5-FU over 24 hours through the hepatic arterial&#xD;
      catheter. You will then receive bevacizumab by vein over 1 1/2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 1 of each 21 day cycle you will receive oxaliplatin through the hepatic arterial&#xD;
      catheter over 2 hours and 5-FU and leucovorin by vein over 24 hours on Days 1 and 2 of each&#xD;
      cycle (a total of 48 hours). You will then receive bevacizumab by vein over about 1 1/2&#xD;
      hours, followed by cetuximab by vein over 1-2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm C:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 1 of each 21 day cycle you will receive oxaliplatin through the hepatic arterial&#xD;
      catheter over 2 hours and bevacizumab by vein over about 1 1/2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm D:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 1 of each 21 day cycle you will receive oxaliplatin through the hepatic arterial&#xD;
      catheter over 2 hours and you will receive bevacizumab by vein over about 1 1/2 hours. You&#xD;
      will also receive cetuximab by vein over about 1-2 hours on Day 1 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each study visit, you will be asked about any other drugs you may be receiving and about&#xD;
      any side effects you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be used to test your blood's ability to clot.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If your study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who are able to become pregnant will have a urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 2 of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If your study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who are able to become pregnant will have a urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 2 of Cycles 2 and beyond:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of each cycle, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to test your blood's ability&#xD;
      to clot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of Cycle 2 and then every 2-3 cycles after that, you will have scans to check the&#xD;
      status of the disease. This may include a chest x-ray, CT scan, MRI scan, a PET scan and/or a&#xD;
      PET/CT scan. If the study doctor thinks it is more appropriate for you, other types of scans&#xD;
      may need to be performed. The study doctor will discuss these scans with you, and you may be&#xD;
      asked to sign a separate consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue to receive the study drug combination for as long as you are benefitting.&#xD;
      You will be taken off study if the disease gets worse or if you experience any intolerable&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 6 weeks after your last dose of study drugs, the following tests and procedures will be&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. All of the study drugs are FDA-approved and commercially&#xD;
      available for use in other types of cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5-FU - for cancers of the breast, pancreas, colon/rectum, stomach, and a type of skin&#xD;
           cancer (superficial basal cell carcinoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxaliplatin and leucovorin - for colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bevacizumab - for colorectal and lung cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cetuximab - for colorectal and head/neck cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is investigational to give the study drugs together for advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 198 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
