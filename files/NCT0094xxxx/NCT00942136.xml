  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK1349572 is an integrase inhibitor that is currently being evaluated for the treatment of&#xD;
      HIV infection. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether the addition of a&#xD;
      proton pump inhibitor, omeprazole, to GSK1349572 impacts the blood levels of GSK1349572. It&#xD;
      will also evaluate if a high fat meal impacts the blood levels of GSK1349572. In addition,&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single supratherapeutic (high) dose of&#xD;
      GSK1349572 will be evaluated.&#xD;

      Official Study Title: A randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      and pharmacokinetics of a supratherapeutic dose of GSK1349572 250 mg and a randomized,&#xD;
      open-label study to evaluate the effects of omeprazole 40 mg daily and a high fat meal on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of GSK1349572 50 mg in healthy adult subjects (ING112941)&#xD;
