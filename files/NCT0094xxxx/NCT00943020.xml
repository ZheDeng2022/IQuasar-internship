  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical patients are usually starved for 8 hours before operation in order to ensure the&#xD;
      stomach is empty and thus reduce the chances of vomiting during the anaesthetic. Recent&#xD;
      studies have shown that this period of starvation is harmful as it 'weakens' the body before&#xD;
      operation. To avoid the harmful effects of starvation, patients are now given carbohydrate&#xD;
      (sugar-containing) drinks 2 to 4 hours before surgery. These drinks have been shown to make&#xD;
      patients feel better, reduce sickness after the anaesthetic/surgery and result in a quicker&#xD;
      recovery from operation. The optimum time of giving these drinks to patients before operation&#xD;
      is unknown. Previous studies have shown that the drinks empty from the stomach within 2 - 4&#xD;
      hours depending on their ingredients. The investigators would like to study the effects of&#xD;
      adding protein and fat to these drinks on how quickly the drinks empty from the stomach. This&#xD;
      study will investigate the hormone responses of the body following intake of 3 different&#xD;
      drinks in order to determine the mechanisms that underlie the control of stomach emptying.&#xD;
      This information will also allow us to improve the design of these drinks and this could help&#xD;
      patients who undergo surgery who receive them.&#xD;

      The eligibility criteria for this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interested participants will be asked to attend a screening interview during which the study&#xD;
      procedures/risks/benefits will be explained, followed by a brief history and physical&#xD;
      examination. If deemed necessary by the study investigator, a 7ml sample of blood will be&#xD;
      taken for screening purposes. The volunteer will be deemed eligible for the study once they&#xD;
      have passed the screening visit and [when performed] had normal screening blood investigation&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each volunteer will be studied 3 times, the order of which will be determined randomly by&#xD;
      computer. Participants will report for the study at the Division of GI Surgery (E-floor, West&#xD;
      Block, Queen's Medical Centre), at 7:15am. On arrival the subject's height and weight will be&#xD;
      recorded and 'drip needle' will will be placed in the back of the wrist. The hand will be&#xD;
      rested in a hand-heater allowing venous blood to be sampled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will be randomly allocated to receive one of the three study drinks. At 7:50am&#xD;
      baseline blood will be sampled (10ml [1.5 tablespoons] via the drip needle). At 8am the&#xD;
      volunteers will drink the study drink. The rate of stomach emptying will be measured by using&#xD;
      Gamma scintigraphy (a specialised medical camera). The drinks will have added a tracer&#xD;
      substance that is visible on the camera and allows us to follow drink as it passes through&#xD;
      the stomach into the bowels. Each 'picture' of the stomach lasts 20 seconds and we plan to&#xD;
      take these every 20 minutes for 4 hours after intake of the drink. At 20 minute intervals&#xD;
      (until 220 mins have elapsed) 7ml (1 tablespoon) of blood will be sampled via the drip&#xD;
      needle. The final 10 ml blood sample will be taken at 240 minutes following which the drip&#xD;
      needle will be removed and the volunteers will be allowed home. The subsequent two studies&#xD;
      will be performed 7 days following the first study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total 95ml (a sixth of a pint) blood will be taken during each of the 3 crossover studies&#xD;
      which will be separated by a period of 7 days (i.e. a total of 285 ml [half a pint] blood&#xD;
      will be required from each volunteer).&#xD;
