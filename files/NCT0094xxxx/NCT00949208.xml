      This clinical study is designed to support the development of new generations of the Given®&#xD;
      Diagnostic System and Agile™ Patency System that will accomplish better visualization, better&#xD;
      diagnostic capabilities and will improve the system ease of use from the physician as well as&#xD;
      patient's point of view.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *The PillCam™ Capsules Capsule endoscopy using the PillCam™ capsule (Given Imaging Limited,&#xD;
      Yoqneam, Israel) represents the newest imaging modality of the gastrointestinal tract without&#xD;
      the need for invasive techniques, sedation, or radiation exposure1-35. Initially cleared for&#xD;
      marketing in August 2001 as an adjunctive modality, the FDA in 2003 cleared PillCam™ SB&#xD;
      (previously called M2A) as a stand alone tool for detecting small bowel abnormalities in&#xD;
      those patients who meet the device's indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PillCam™ SB provides visualization of the entire small bowel mucosa and is presently&#xD;
      purely a diagnostic test without therapeutic or biopsy potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before capsule endoscopy, enteroscopy was one of the methods for examining the small bowel&#xD;
      tract, but the diagnostic value of this test for a wide variety of specific lesions is low&#xD;
      due to inability to reach the entire length of the small bowel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other endoscopic techniques include, Sonde enteroscopy, and intraoperative enteroscopy, but&#xD;
      these are limited for several reasons including significant technical difficulties, length of&#xD;
      procedures, potential risks, and frequently incomplete small bowel examination36-38. To date&#xD;
      more than 400,000 PillCam™ SB capsules were ingested world wide. The Given® Diagnostic System&#xD;
      (GDS) for Small Bowel is now the Gold standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional PillCam™ capsules were developed and are used for diagnosing the Esophagus as well&#xD;
      as the Colon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PillCam™ ESO system received FDA clearance as well as the CE mark early 2005. To date,&#xD;
      thousands of PillCam™ ESO capsules were ingested in both clinical trials and regular clinical&#xD;
      setup worldwide with numerous published clinical studies39-45.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PillCam™ COLON capsule received CE marking on October 15th, 2006 and is cleared for&#xD;
      marketing in Europe. It is now pending FDA clearance. To date, several hundreds of PillCam™&#xD;
      COLON capsules were ingested in numerous pilot studies and ongoing multi-center studies in&#xD;
      Europe and USA34-35.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *The Agile™ Patency System Small and large bowel strictures are present in a large spectrum&#xD;
      of diseases and clinical situations such as adhesion related diseases, Crohn's disease,&#xD;
      patients who are post abdominal radiation treatment and patients who have undergone abdominal&#xD;
      surgery46. Knowledge of intestinal patency in such patients will aid the physician in&#xD;
      assessment and treatment of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current methods for identifying intestinal strictures primarily include small bowel&#xD;
      follow through (SBFT), enteroclysis, computed tomography (CT) and enteroscopy but the&#xD;
      diagnostic value of these tests is low. Advanced strictures are often missed and some of&#xD;
      these methods include radiation and others are invasive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Agile™ Patency System is designed to aid the gastroenterologist in verifying the patency&#xD;
      of the GI tract. The system is essentially based on small identification tags, which are&#xD;
      detected by radio frequency (RFID) encapsulated in a disintegrating capsule. The RFID tags&#xD;
      have been marketed for many years for veterinary use. In animals they are injected&#xD;
      sub-dermally and are used for life-long identification, marking and tracking47.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary results demonstrate that the Agile System performs as intended48. Future&#xD;
      developments of the unique technology which make up the Agile patency capsule will broaden&#xD;
      its range of uses and applications beyond simple patency testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Agile ingestions are estimated in the excess of three thousand worldwide.&#xD;
