      This is a phase I and pharmacology study of Camptothecin-20-O-Propionate Hydrate (CZ48) in&#xD;
      Patients with Solid Tumors or Lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe the dose limiting toxicities and adverse event profile of&#xD;
           Camptothecin-20-O-Propionate hydrate (CZ48) administered orally every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine Phase II recommended dose of Camptothecin-20-O-Propionate hydrate (CZ48)&#xD;
           administered orally every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To perform a pharmacokinetic study of orally administered CZ48 in the plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess responses by RECIST criteria.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CZ48 is an analog of the topoisomerase I inhibitor Camptothecin (CPT). CPT is an alkaloid&#xD;
      extracted from the Chinese tree, Camptotheca acuminata. Only the S isomer (the natural form)&#xD;
      is biologically active. The intact E lactone ring, which tends to be preserved in an acid&#xD;
      environment, is essential for anti-tumor activity. Moreover, the open lactone ring moiety&#xD;
      tends to promote toxicity [1-3]. In phase I and II trials conducted from 1970-1972 with the&#xD;
      sodium salt of CPT (later shown to be largely inactive) toxicities included myelosuppression,&#xD;
      diarrhea and cystitis [2, 3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the observation in 1984 that the mechanism of action of CPT was through topoisomerase I&#xD;
      inhibition [1], renewed interest in the drug led to the development of a variety of analogs,&#xD;
      some of which had higher potency than the parent drug. Some derivatives are water soluble&#xD;
      such as CamptosarÂ® (irinotecan, CPTÂ¬-11) and HycamptinÂ® (topotecan), which are currently&#xD;
      approved for use in the USA for colon and ovarian cancers, respectively. Studies have shown&#xD;
      that substitutions at the C-9 and C- 10 positions enhance activity, and may confer water&#xD;
      solubility. In general, analogs that are water-soluble have reduced anti-cancer activity in&#xD;
      preclinical models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The water-insoluble native camptothecin (CPT) caused diarrhea, which proved to be the dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicity. Measurements demonstrated very little closed lactone ring CPT in the&#xD;
      plasma of subjects receiving this compound [4]. This was later explained by the demonstration&#xD;
      that CPT binds to human albumin, an action which promotes opening of the lactone ring [5].&#xD;
      Mouse albumin is much less efficient in this activity, hence explaining the greater antitumor&#xD;
      activity observed in mice models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast to CPT, CZ48 incubated in vitro with human plasma and studied in vivo maintains a&#xD;
      substantial closed lactone ring concentration in the plasma. It appears to act as a pro-drug.&#xD;
      The removal of the side chain by endogenous esterases liberates the active drug, CPT.&#xD;
      Malignant cells have a high esterase content and are rapidly transforming the pro-drug into&#xD;
      the active parent drug. Preclinical studies suggest retention of anti-cancer activity and&#xD;
      reduction in toxicity, probably because the pro-drug in the systemic circulation has no or&#xD;
      little activity. Therefore, delivery of higher concentrations of closed lactone ring CPT&#xD;
      analog inside the tumor cells should potentiate the anti-tumor activity. This study offers an&#xD;
      opportunity to evaluate this hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - OVERVIEW OF NONCLINICAL TESTING STRATEGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      All nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, and toxicology studies described herein were&#xD;
      conducted by or for The CHRISTUS Stehlin Foundation for Cancer Research. For studies&#xD;
      conducted in accordance with GLP regulations, the location of records for inspection is/will&#xD;
      be included in each study report. For nonGLP studies, study records are retained on file at:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CHRISTUS Stehlin Foundation for Cancer Research 1315 St. Joseph Parkway, Suite #1818&#xD;
      Houston, TX 77002&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several experiments were conducted to examine the primary pharmacodynamics (i.e., efficacy&#xD;
      and potency) of CZ48 against various tumor lines both in vitro and in vivo. In light of the&#xD;
      intended Phase I patient population, the CZ48 safety pharmacology package was limited to in&#xD;
      vitro and in vivo cardiovascular assessments. No secondary pharmacodynamic or pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      drug interaction studies were conducted with CZ48.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: For all GLP studies the purity of the CZ48 as determined by HPLC validated methods is&#xD;
      98.9%. For these studies, the drug was formulated in a 0.5% medium density carboxymethyl&#xD;
      cellulose aqueous suspension (CMC). For all non-GLP studies the drug (98% purity) was&#xD;
      formulated as a suspension in cottonseed oil (except the non-GLP study performed by Covance&#xD;
      which also used the CMC formulation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics of CZ48 and its active&#xD;
      metabolite camptothecin after either single- or repeat-dose administration were conducted in&#xD;
      mice and dogs. The repeat-dose studies were toxicokinetic evaluations conducted as part of&#xD;
      the pivotal toxicology program using validated bioanalytical methods. No extensive&#xD;
      distribution studies were conducted with CZ48; however, drug distribution into tumor, liver&#xD;
      and kidney tissues of tumor-bearing mice was evaluated. Several in vitro and in vivo&#xD;
      metabolism studies were conducted to examine the metabolic conversion of CZ48 to its active&#xD;
      moiety, camptothecin. Excretion studies were limited to measurement of CZ48 in the feces of&#xD;
      nude mice following single-dose administration. Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies were&#xD;
      not conducted with CZ48.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CZ48 toxicology program consisted of exploratory (nonGLP) dose range-finding studies in&#xD;
      the mouse and dog and definitive (GLP) toxicity and toxicokinetic studies in both species.&#xD;
      Pivotal toxicology studies conducted with CZ48 employed the intended clinical route and&#xD;
      schedule of administration. Additionally, two studies (nonGLP) were conducted in mice to&#xD;
      assess the general tolerability of chronic high-dose CZ48 administration.&#xD;

    <description>CZ48 will be administered in successive cohorts of 1 patient per participating site until hints of toxicity (grade 2 or worse adverse events related to the drug) are observed. Then cohort of 3+3 patients will be treated. CZ48 will be administered orally daily for 3 weeks followed by a 1 week rest. (1 course = 4 weeks). No pre-medications will be administered. Patients will be asked to drink 2 liters of fluid daily to flush the bladder.</description>
