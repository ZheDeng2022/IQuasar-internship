    <textblock>
      This study compares two approaches to helping people who are aging with MS or SCI and are&#xD;
      experiencing depressed mood to become more physically active. The study is carried out&#xD;
      entirely by telephone. There is no need to travel and participants may reside anywhere within&#xD;
      the United States. We will examine the effects of the intervention on overall physical&#xD;
      activity, mood, pain, fatigue and general health. Participants will complete surveys over the&#xD;
      phone throughout the study and wear an activity monitor 3 times. The study is 6 months in&#xD;
      length and participants may receive up to $120 for their time and effort.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People aging with disabilities such as spinal cord injury (SCI) or multiple sclerosis (MS)&#xD;
      report high rates of major depression. Depression frequently adds to the disabilities and&#xD;
      suffering in these populations. Few definitive studies of depression treatments have been&#xD;
      done in people with MS and none in SCI. There are several reasons to explore novel treatments&#xD;
      for major depression in these groups. First, standard treatments, such as antidepressant&#xD;
      medications, may not be as effective in people with neurological disabilities. Next, people&#xD;
      with physical disabilities tend to be inactive. Lack of physical activity has been positively&#xD;
      correlated with higher levels of depression. Longitudinal data and treatment trials suggest&#xD;
      that increased physical activity is related to improved mood. Controlled trials show that&#xD;
      increased exercise and physical activity can be effective treatments for major depression in&#xD;
      nondisabled older adults. Previous research by the investigators' group suggests that people&#xD;
      with MS are quite interested in exercise and that exercise is a safe and effective treatment&#xD;
      for depression in younger, less disabled people with MS. Exercise may have widespread&#xD;
      benefits for people with MS or SCI. Finally, exercise or increased physical activity&#xD;
      represents a low cost, non-stigmatizing, highly accessible potential treatment for depression&#xD;
      in people with physical disabilities. In this study the investigators will determine whether&#xD;
      a relatively brief telephone-based intervention to promote physical activity is an effective&#xD;
      treatment for major depression in people aging with MS or SCI. The investigators define&#xD;
      &quot;aging&quot; as chronological age greater than 45 years old.&#xD;
