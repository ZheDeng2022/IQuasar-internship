    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the safety of xenotransplantation of&#xD;
      DIABECELL(R)[immunoprotected (alginate-encapsulated) porcine islets] in patients with&#xD;
      established type 1 diabetes mellitus, and to establish preliminary evidence of the efficacy&#xD;
      of DIABECELL(R), as measured by a reduction in serial hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intraperitoneal islet transplantation has the potential to ameliorate type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus and avert the long-term consequences of chronic diabetes which cannot be achieved by&#xD;
      conventional insulin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As donor human islets are not available in sufficient numbers, porcine islets are the best&#xD;
      alternative source as they are recognised as the most physiologically compatible xenogeneic&#xD;
      insulin-producing cells. Although the use of pig-derived cells raises the risk of xenotic&#xD;
      infections, this can be minimised by obtaining cells from designated pathogen-free (DPF)&#xD;
      animals bred in isolation and monitored to be free of specified pathogens. The worldwide&#xD;
      experience to date in more than 200 patients who have received transplants of pig tissue has&#xD;
      not demonstrated evidence of transmitted xenotic infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As animal-derived tissues have to be protected from immune rejection when transplanted into&#xD;
      humans, transplants are usually accompanied by immunosuppressive therapy. However, porcine&#xD;
      islets are preferably transplanted without the use of immunosuppressive drugs which cause&#xD;
      significant morbidity. To protect them from immune rejection, the islets can be encapsulated&#xD;
      in alginate microcapsules which permit the inward passage of nutrients and glucose and the&#xD;
      outward passage of insulin. Alginate-encapsulated porcine islets transplanted without&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs have survived rejection for many months in animal studies, and have&#xD;
      been retrieved from a diabetic patient over 9.5 years after intraperitoneal transplantation&#xD;
      and shown to contain viable islets that stain positive for insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DIABECELL® comprises neonatal porcine islets encapsulated in alginate microcapsules.&#xD;
      DIABECELL® has been safely transplanted in healthy and diabetic mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and&#xD;
      non-human primates. Following DIABECELL® transplants, the requirement for daily insulin was&#xD;
      significantly reduced in diabetic rats and non-human primates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimal dose and frequency of transplantation of the current DIABECELL® preparation for&#xD;
      the treatment of type 1 diabetes in humans can only be determined in clinical trials. The&#xD;
      intention of this phase I/IIa clinical trial is to obtain at least 52 weeks safety and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy data in type 1 diabetic patients following transplantation of a single&#xD;
      low effective dose of DIABECELL® into the peritoneal cavity.&#xD;
