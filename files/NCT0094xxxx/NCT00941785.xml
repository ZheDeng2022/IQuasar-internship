      The aim of the study is to determine whether piperaquine plus dihydroartemisinin (DHA-PQ) is&#xD;
      as effective, and better tolerated, than sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine (SP+AQ),&#xD;
      when used for seasonal Intermittent Preventive Treatment (IPT) to prevent malaria in children&#xD;
      aged 3 to 59 months in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso and to determine the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      piperaquine in children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence from several studies that in areas where the transmission of malaria is&#xD;
      seasonal, the use of IPT can reduce substantially the incidence of clinical malaria in&#xD;
      children under the age of five years, by as much as 90% (Greenwood et al, Trends in&#xD;
      Parasitology 24(11):485-6, 2008). The most effective regimen is SP+AQ but alternative&#xD;
      regimens are needed because amodiaquine can be poorly tolerated (Sokhna et al PlosOne&#xD;
      3:e1471, 2008) and resistance to SP is increasing. In recent trials in Senegal and The&#xD;
      Gambia, PQ combined with DHA or SP was as effective against malaria, and better tolerated,&#xD;
      than SP+AQ. Of these regimens, only DHA+PQ is licensed for use as an antimalarial in African&#xD;
      countries. However there are no data on pharmacokinetics of PQ when used for IPT in children,&#xD;
      and the impact of DHA+PQ in preventing spread of resistance is not known. This trial aims to&#xD;
      provide this information in order to evaluate the suitability of DHA+PQ for use for seasonal&#xD;
      IPT in children and to determine the optimum dose regimen for piperaquine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malaria (caused primarily by Plasmodium falciparum) is endemic in the southern third of&#xD;
      Burkina Faso, occurring seasonally between June to November, with most cases occurring&#xD;
      between August and October. In Burkina Faso there has been no evidence of a recent decline in&#xD;
      malaria incidence as seen in some other African countries. Although the policy is to treat&#xD;
      uncomplicated malaria with artemisin combinations, in practice chloroquine remains the&#xD;
      treatment used in most health facilities. Several studies have shown that seasonal IPT in&#xD;
      children (IPTc) can provide a high degree of protection against clinical malaria. SP+AQ is&#xD;
      the most effective regimen but amodiaquine is not well tolerated and resistance to SP is&#xD;
      increasing n many areas. Alternative regimens are required. Piperaquine (PQ), a long acting&#xD;
      antimalarial used for prophylaxis in China, is suitable for use for IPT. In studies in&#xD;
      Senegal and The Gambia piperaquine plus SP or dihydroartemisinin (DHA) was as effective and&#xD;
      better tolerated than SP+AQ. The purpose of this study is to determine whether DHA-PQ is more&#xD;
      effective than SP+AQ in preventing spread of drug resistant parasite genotypes and to&#xD;
      determine the pharmacokinetics of piperaquine in children who receive this drug for IPT.&#xD;
      Little was known about the pharmacokinetics of piperaquine until recently, and there is&#xD;
      currently only limited information about the pharmacokinetics of piperaquine in children. The&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic data from this study will allow us to estimate the optimum dose regimen for&#xD;
      piperaquine; the current recommended regimen for DHA-PQ is three doses over three days. For&#xD;
      IPT, a single dose regimen is highly desirable as it would be easier to deliver and better&#xD;
      accepted by communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1500 children aged 3 to 59 months will be enrolled and randomized to receive 3 monthly&#xD;
      administrations of DHA-PQ or SP-AQ, in August, September and October. From August to November&#xD;
      children will be visited twice weekly to check for malaria symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of 45 children in each treatment group will be asked to provide a venous blood&#xD;
      sample on days 0 and 7 for analysis of biochemical and haematological parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the DHA-PQ group only, a subset of 210 children will be asked to provide finger prick&#xD;
      blood samples for PK analysis on day 0, between day 0 and day 6, on day 7, and between day 8&#xD;
      and day 30. To calibrate measurements of drug concentration in peripheral blood against&#xD;
      existing PK models, each month 17 of these children will be asked to also provide a venous&#xD;
      sample (up to 2ml taken into a vacutainer) on three occasions (one between day 0 and 6, one&#xD;
      on day 7, and one between day 8 and 30). In addition, a separate group of 750 children aged 3&#xD;
      to 59 months will be recruited to be surveyed at the end of the transmission season to&#xD;
      determine the prevalence of malaria parasitaemia and of drug-resistance parasite genotypes in&#xD;
      the study area.&#xD;
