  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clopidogrel (Plavix) and aspirin are two antithrombotic agents (blood thinners) commonly used&#xD;
      in patients with previous thrombotic events (stroke or heart attack). Thrombosis is the&#xD;
      formation of a blood clot in a blood vessel. Patients with polycythemia vera are routinely&#xD;
      treated with aspirin which has been shown to be effective in reducing their thrombotic risk.&#xD;
      However, in polycythemia vera patients with previous thrombosis, a further benefit might be&#xD;
      obtained by using the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel which is routinely used in&#xD;
      patients with recent acute myocardial ischemia (reduced blood supply to the heart muscle).&#xD;
      The study will assess whether this combination therapy greatly increases the risk of bleeding&#xD;
      versus aspirin alone, if clopidogrel reduces biological factors that might lead to a stroke&#xD;
      or heart attack, and whether a high number of patients with polycythemia vera are resistant&#xD;
      to clopidogrel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled to the Myeloproliferative Disorders-Research&#xD;
      Consortium (MPD-RC) study in Europe and the United States with participation expected to last&#xD;
      for 7 months (6 months of receiving study medication plus a 30 day follow-up visit).&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients are included in the study if all of the following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A documented diagnosis of polycythemia vera established within 5 years of&#xD;
             registration. There must be documentation that the patient has met the revised WHO&#xD;
             criteria for the diagnosis of polycythemia vera. Patients must meet the 2 major&#xD;
             criteria and 1 of the minor criteria. To verify that the criteria have been met, the&#xD;
             appropriate laboratory or pathology reports must be submitted demonstrating that the&#xD;
             patient has documentation of these diagnostic criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Major Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin &gt;18.5 g/dl in men, &gt;16.5 g/dl in women or other evidence of increased&#xD;
                  red cell volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Presence of JAK2V617F or other functionally similar mutation such as JAK2 exon 12&#xD;
                  mutation&#xD;
&#xD;
             Minor Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bone marrow biopsy showing hypercellularity for age with trilineage growth&#xD;
                  (panmyelosis) with prominent erythroid, granulocyte, and megakaryocytic&#xD;
                  proliferation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum erythropoietin level below the reference range for normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Endogenous erythroid colony formation in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. High cardiovascular risk due to having experienced a prior vascular event such as an&#xD;
             ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction or venous thromboembolism. Objective&#xD;
             documentation of these events must be accurately reviewed and registered. Stroke and&#xD;
             pulmonary embolism must be documented by an imaging study, deep vein thrombosis by&#xD;
             ultrasound or other objective methods, myocardial infarction by typical ECG changes&#xD;
             and/or an increase in serum troponin. Minor thrombotic events such as transient&#xD;
             ischemic attacks, superficial thrombophlepitis or atypical microcirculatory&#xD;
             disturbances alone or in combination are considered to qualifying events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. No contraindication to aspirin use such as allergy, a history of a previous&#xD;
             hemorrhagic stroke or a major gastrointestinal bleed in the previous three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Use of hydroxyurea as a cytoreductive agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Signed informed consent: Patients must have signed consents for both the ISCLAP&#xD;
             protocol and for the mandatory correlative biomarker MPD-RC 107 protocol in order to&#xD;
             be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Serum bilirubin levels less and or equal to 2 times the upper limit of the normal&#xD;
             range for the laboratory (ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) levels and&#xD;
             serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) less and or equal 2 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Serum creatinine levels less and or equal 1.5 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             prior to clopidogrel treatment and should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant. Women&#xD;
             of childbearing potential must practice effective methods of contraception (those&#xD;
             generally accepted as standard of care measures). Women of child bearing potential are&#xD;
             women who have not been menopausal for 12 months or who have not undergone previous&#xD;
             surgical sterilization. If the subject is a woman of childbearing potential, she must&#xD;
             use a medically acceptable form of contraception during the study period and for 30&#xD;
             days thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Age greater than or euql to 18 years to 81 years of age. Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects are excluded from participating in this study if 1 or more of the following&#xD;
        criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Therapy with clopidogrel within the last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any history of prior treatment with aspirin which has resulted in a significant&#xD;
             clinical adverse event requiring the discontinuation of aspirin therapy (e.g.&#xD;
