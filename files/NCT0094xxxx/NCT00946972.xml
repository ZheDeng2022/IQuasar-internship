  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (explores what the body&#xD;
      does to the drug), and pharmacodynamics (explores what a drug does to the body) of multiple&#xD;
      doses of JNJ-38431055 in volunteers with type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind (neither physician or participant knows the name of the assigned study&#xD;
      drug), placebo-controlled (substance containing no medication), study in male and female&#xD;
      volunteers with type 2 diabetes mellitus. For each volunteer, the study consists of a&#xD;
      screening phase (up to 45 days), a run-in phase during which volunteers discontinue their&#xD;
      oral anti-hyperglycemic drugs (21 to 35 days), a treatment phase during which volunteers will&#xD;
      continue to be off their anti-hyperglycemic drugs and receive daily study drug (JNJ-38431055&#xD;
      or placebo) for 14 days, and a follow-up phase (10 days). After the follow-up phase,&#xD;
      volunteers will restart their oral anti-hyperglycemic drugs. The following safety evaluations&#xD;
      will be taken throughout the study: Electrocardiogram (an ECG is a painless procedure that&#xD;
      gives a picture of the electrical activity of the heart), blood pressure, heart rate, and&#xD;
      blood samples for laboratory tests. The primary outcomes will be safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      JNJ-38431055 and 24-hour weighted mean glucose concentrations after 14 days of dosing with&#xD;
      JNJ-38431055. Study drug will be administered as daily doses for 14 days. The two treatments&#xD;
      will be JNJ-38431055 and placebo.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males or postmenopausal or surgically sterilized females, who have type 2 diabetes&#xD;
             mellitus&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medically stable on the basis of physical examination, medical history, laboratory&#xD;
             safety test results, vital signs and ECG performed at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) between 22 and 39.9 kg/m2, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On a generally stable antihyperglycemic agent regimen (i.e. with no change in&#xD;
             medication, or only 1 dose step change in dose) for at least 2 months prior to&#xD;
             Screening visit, including volunteers who are: (a) Not currently on antihyperglycemic&#xD;
             therapy and have an HbA1c &gt;=7.0 % and &lt;=10%, or (b) On a single oral antihyperglycemic&#xD;
             agent [metformin, a sunfonylurea, a meglitinide (e.g., repaglininide or nateglinide),&#xD;
             a DPP-IV inhibitor (sitagliptin or vildagliptin), or an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor&#xD;
             (e.g., acarbose)] and have an HbA1c &gt;=6.5% and &lt;=9.5%, or (c) On low-dose dual oral&#xD;
             agent therapy (i.e., &lt;50% maximum labeled doses of both agents) and have an HbA1c&#xD;
             &gt;=6.5% and &lt;=9.5%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On Day -2 (two days prior to study drug administration), FPG concentrations between&#xD;
             120 mg/dL and 260 mg/dL, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Taking non-oral antihyperglycemic agent (e.g., insulin, exenatide or other GLP-1&#xD;
             analogues), or taking a thiazolidinedione (i.e., a PPARg agonist) within 3 months of&#xD;
             the Screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of a recent severe hypoglycemic episode, recurrent hypoglycemic episodes&#xD;
             (i.e., within the past year), or a history of hypoglycemic unawareness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of clinically significant diabetic complications, including retinopathy,&#xD;
             nephropathy, neuropathy or gastroparesis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive test for alcohol and/or drugs of abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychological and/or emotional problems, which would render the informed consent&#xD;
             invalid, or limit the ability of the volunteer to comply with the study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the well&#xD;
             being of the volunteer or the study or prevent the volunteer from meeting or&#xD;
             performing study requirements&#xD;
