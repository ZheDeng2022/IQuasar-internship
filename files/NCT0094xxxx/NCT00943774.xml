  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Baroreflex sensitivity is integral to blood pressure regulation, and varies among healthy,&#xD;
      normotensive individuals. A reduced compensatory ability of baroreflex buffering in patients&#xD;
      with carotid denervation results in blood pressure variability and an elevated blood pressure&#xD;
      response to mental stress. Furthermore, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure variability may&#xD;
      also be a significant and independent risk determinant of cardiovascular disease. It remains&#xD;
      unknown whether the degree of baroreflex sensitivity and ambulatory blood pressure&#xD;
      variability are predictive of the pressor response to sympathoexcitatory stress in healthy&#xD;
      humans. In this study the investigators propose a comprehensive evaluation of the&#xD;
      relationships among the pressor and forearm vasodilator response to sympathoexcitation,&#xD;
      ambulatory blood pressure variability, and baroreflex sensitivity in healthy normotensive&#xD;
      subjects. Ultimately this study will provide preliminary data and protocol development for&#xD;
      large-scale high resolution phenotyping in population-based trials aimed at determining the&#xD;
      functional relevance of candidate gene variation in intermediate physiological traits&#xD;
      pertinent to the pathogenesis of hypertension and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Growing evidence suggests an association of environmental stress with the development of&#xD;
      hypertension and there is strong evidence in normotensive subjects that a greater pressor&#xD;
      response to sympathoexcitatory stress is a harbinger of future hypertension. Pharmacological&#xD;
      studies have shown that individuals with HTN have a blunted baroreflex sensitivity, and&#xD;
      display a greater increase in blood pressure during administration of an alpha-agonist.&#xD;
      Furthermore, exaggerated 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure variability (BPV) is proposed to&#xD;
      be a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. Finally, Beta-2 adrenergic&#xD;
      receptor-mediated forearm vasodilator responses to mental stress are blunted in Caucasian&#xD;
      subjects at increased risk for hypertension, in African Americans, and in mild hypertension.&#xD;
      We postulate that a relationship exists between these variables, even in normotensive healthy&#xD;
      individuals. We also believe that signs of subclinical metabolic dysfunction exist in healthy&#xD;
      individuals and that they may either contribute to or be affected by BPV. There is also&#xD;
      evidence the prematurity at birth and low birth weight are associated with hypertension.&#xD;
      Finally, arterial stiffness may also be related to blood pressure variability and the pressor&#xD;
      response. Therefore the specific aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine the relationship between 24-hour ambulatory BPV and baroreflex sensitivity.&#xD;
           By measuring the baroreflex control of heart rate during sequential boluses of&#xD;
           nitroprusside and phenylephrine, we hypothesize that baroreflex sensitivity will be&#xD;
           inversely related to the degree of 24-hour BPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the relationship between 24-hour ambulatory BPV and the pressor response to&#xD;
           four sympathoexcitatory maneuvers: head-up tilt testing, mental stress, cold pressor&#xD;
           test, and isometric handgrip to fatigue. We hypothesize that greater BPV will predict&#xD;
           the pressor response to stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine the relationship between baroreflex sensitivity and the pressor&#xD;
           response/forearm vasodilator response to the three sympathoexcitatory maneuvers. We&#xD;
           hypothesize that individuals with higher baroreflex sensitivity will have a lower&#xD;
           pressor response and a lower forearm vasodilator response to sympathoexcitatory stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To draw a venous blood sample for future screening of genetic polymorphisms of interest,&#xD;
           which may include nitric oxide synthase (NOS), alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic&#xD;
           receptor polymorphisms. We hypothesize that genetic variation in these key regulatory&#xD;
           systems might explain some of the differences in baroreflex sensitivity, BPV, the&#xD;
           pressor response and forearm vasodilator response to sympathoexcitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To examine the relationship between 24-hour ambulatory BPV and the pressor response to&#xD;
           sympathoexcitatory maneuvers and insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and body fat&#xD;
           distribution. We hypothesize that greater BPV will be associated with insulin&#xD;
           resistance, dyslipidemia, and increase waist-hip ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To examine the relationship between 24-hour ambulatory BPV and arterial stiffness using&#xD;
           measurements of pulse wave velocity. We hypothesize that greater BPV will be associated&#xD;
           with increased pulse wave velocity, an index of arterial stiffness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To examine the relationship between 24-hour ambulatory BPV and the pressor response to&#xD;
           sympathoexcitatory maneuvers with birth weight and post-conceptual age at birth. We will&#xD;
           ask each subject to provide this data based on their birth certificate and/or knowledge&#xD;
           of their medical history.&#xD;
