    <textblock>
      Malaria in African countries remains an important cause of mortality and morbidity among&#xD;
      young children. The global malaria control strategies include prompt treatment with an&#xD;
      effective antimalarial drug, vector control using ITNs or curtains, indoor residual spraying&#xD;
      (IRS), and intermittent preventive treatment. However, individually these interventions&#xD;
      provide only imperfect protection. Thus, there is a need to investigate whether additional&#xD;
      control measures provide added benefit in reducing mortality and morbidity. Therefore, 1312&#xD;
      children under 5 years of age living in villages and hamlets near Farafenni, The Gambia,&#xD;
      which form part of the rural Farafenni Demographic Surveillance system (FDSS) in North Bank&#xD;
      Region(NBR) were randomly allocated to receive IPTc or placebo from village health workers&#xD;
      based in primary health care villages. Treatment with a single dose of sulfadoxine&#xD;
      /pyrimethamine plus three doses of amodiaquine or placebo was given to all study subjects at&#xD;
      monthly intervals on three occasions during the months of September, October and November. In&#xD;
      addition, VHWs were trained to administer treatment with coartem to children if they develop&#xD;
      symptoms compatible with malaria during the malaria transmission season. The primary end&#xD;
      point was the incidence of clinical attacks of malaria detected during the study.&#xD;

      Goals and Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The goal of this project was to determine the degree to which morbidity from malaria can&#xD;
           be prevented in children who receive intermittent preventive treatment(IPTc) with SP&#xD;
           plus amodiaquine and home based management of malaria with Coartem by village health&#xD;
           worker during 2008 malaria transmission season.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The objective of the project was to conduct an individually randomized trial of IPTc in&#xD;
           children who receive HMM in North Bank Region an area where malaria transmission is&#xD;
           highly seasonal. This trial will determine whether IPTc adds significant benefit to HMM.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study was undertaken in a group of 42 villages and hamlets near Farafenni. The&#xD;
           villages ranged in size from 46 to 1250 inhabitants. The total population of the rural&#xD;
           FDSS catchment area was about 17 000 and that of children under 5 years of age was about&#xD;
           3000. The area has one general hospital, three health centres and two private healthcare&#xD;
           clinics. There are 18 rural primary health care (PHC) villages in the study area. PHC&#xD;
           villages, each with a population over 400, have mainly been selected plus, occasionally,&#xD;
           others located in relatively isolated areas. In all villages, village health workers&#xD;
           (VHWs) and traditional birth attendants (TBAs) are selected by the Village Development&#xD;
           Committee (VDC) and given 6 to 8 weeks of training with a standardised curriculum on how&#xD;
           to treat common conditions such as uncomplicated malaria, ARI, diarrhoeal diseases and&#xD;
           minor injuries. Thus, VHWs function as primary health care providers for minor illnesses&#xD;
           and injuries for all ages. In addition, the VHW are expected to work as a&#xD;
           community-based health educator. TBAs functioned as birth attendants, family planning&#xD;
           distributors and health educators. Both TBAs and VHWs were expected to refer serious&#xD;
           cases to the local health facility for management. VHWs and TBAs are supervised by&#xD;
           Community Health Nurses who oversee circuits of 4 to 10 PHC villages. All rural&#xD;
           settlements also have a Medical Research Council(MRC) Village Reporter who carries out&#xD;
           sensitization for MRC activities. The bednet coverage in NBR was estimated to be 50%.&#xD;
           However, during the study, details of bed net usage by the community were assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recruitment and randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study was carried in collaboration with the EPI unit of the Department of State for&#xD;
           Health, National Malaria Control Programme and NBR District Health Team. During the&#xD;
           preparatory phase of the study, the design and objectives of the study were discussed&#xD;
           extensively with the NBR District Team and all health care providers working in the&#xD;
           study area. The study team visited all the villages in the study area to explain the&#xD;
           objectives of the trial to village elders, opinion leaders, and heads of women's groups,&#xD;
           village health workers and traditional birth attendants. This was followed by village&#xD;
           meetings, at which the entire community was invited to participate. During these&#xD;
           meetings, agreement to participate in the study was obtained from the villagers. In&#xD;
           addition, parents or guardians of prospective study subjects in the right age group were&#xD;
           visited at home and they were provided with flyers in English and the appropriate local&#xD;
           language (Mandinka, Wollof or Fula). Written informed consent was obtained from the&#xD;
           parent(s) or guardian(s) before a child was enrolled in the study. Enrolled subjects&#xD;
           were provided with a treatment card stamped with a label carrying their name and study&#xD;
           number to facilitate identification at each contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Individual randomization was carried out. Study subjects were allocated to receive IPTc&#xD;
           plus HMM or HMM alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
           IPTc and malaria treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study children received their monthly treatment from a VHW based in a PHC village. The&#xD;
           VWH distributed the trial medication at a central point (usually a health post) during&#xD;
           the first 10 days of the month during September, October and November. Mothers and&#xD;
           carers were asked to bring their children to the central point during the morning when&#xD;
           the VWH was available to distribute the drugs. When a child presented to the central&#xD;
           point for medication, the VHW identified the study subject using the treatment card held&#xD;
           by the mother and matched the information on the treatment card with that on his&#xD;
           register. When he was satisfied that he had correctly identify the study subject, the&#xD;
           correct dosage of the trial medication was given to the study subject. In non-PHC&#xD;
           villages, mothers were asked to bring their children to their nearest PHC village to&#xD;
           receive IPT during the transmission season.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The first dose of treatment was taken under direct supervision of the VHW and the&#xD;
           remaining two doses were given to the mother or guardian of the child with clear&#xD;
           instructions on how to administer the drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the end of the malaria transmission season, the total number of complete treatment&#xD;
           doses each child in the trial had taken was recorded. Compliance was checked on a&#xD;
           rolling basis throughout the study by assessing the number of correct doses of&#xD;
           medication received.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Malaria treatment and morbidity surveillance during the rainy season Passive&#xD;
           surveillance for malaria was maintained throughout the transmission season. VHW were&#xD;
           instructed to treat febrile illnesses suggestive of malaria with coartem .&#xD;
           Parents/guardians were encouraged to take their child to the VHW at any time the child&#xD;
           became unwell. One field worker was attached to 2-3 village health workers during the&#xD;
           surveillance period. The role of the field worker was to prepare a thick blood film from&#xD;
           children scheduled for treatment by the VHW with coartem for subsequent confirmation of&#xD;
           the diagnosis. VHWs were asked to keep records of children treated for malaria. In&#xD;
           addition, they were asked to refer children who failed to improve on treatment and those&#xD;
           with danger signs to the nearest health centre or AFPRC Hospital for further evaluation&#xD;
           and management.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Any death of a study child was investigated within a month of death using the&#xD;
           post-mortem questionnaire technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cross-sectional survey:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In December, at the end of the malaria transmission season, a cross-sectional survey of&#xD;
           all the children enrolled in the study was undertaken in all the villages. Information&#xD;
           was obtained on demographics, bed net usage, a clinical history was obtained and a&#xD;
           physical examination performed, including abdominal palpation for splenomegaly and&#xD;
           measurement of height, weight and axillary body temperature. A finger-prick blood sample&#xD;
           was obtained from all the children taking part in the cross-sectional survey for&#xD;
           preparation of blood films, a filter paper sample and determination of the haemoglobin&#xD;
           level.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Definitions&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following definitions were used during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical malaria. The primary definition of malaria required:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. the presence of fever (axillary temperature &gt; 37.5 C) or a history of fever in the&#xD;
                past 24 hours,&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. the absence of any other obvious cause of the fever,&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. the presence of P. falciparum asexual parasitemia above a threshold value of 5,000&#xD;
                parasites per ul (a threshold shown previously to be of value in differentiating&#xD;
                symptomatic malaria from other illnesses associated with co-incidental&#xD;
                parasitemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
           A secondary definition of malaria required only the presence of P. falciparum&#xD;
           parasitemia at any density.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Severe malaria. Severe malaria was defined according to the WHO criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
           Anemia. Anemia was defined as a haemoglobin(Hb) concentration &lt;11 g/dl, moderate anemia&#xD;
           as a Hb concentration &lt; 8 g/dL and severe anemia as an Hb concentration &lt; 5 g/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
           End-points:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary endpoint :&#xD;
&#xD;
           Malaria incidence (the number of study subjects seen at the OPD clinic with clinical&#xD;
           malaria that meet the primary case definitions as indicated above during the&#xD;
           surveillance period).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary endpoints :&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Malaria incidence (the number of study subjects seen by the VHW with clinical&#xD;
                malaria that meet the secondary case definitions as indicated above during the&#xD;
                surveillance period).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. the incidence of severe malaria as defined above,&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. the incidence of anaemia among children seen at a hospital or health centre,&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. the prevalence of parasitaemia at the end of malaria transmission season&#xD;
                cross-sectional survey,&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. the prevalence of anaemia at the end of malaria transmission season cross-sectional&#xD;
                survey,&#xD;
&#xD;
           (d) the incidence of all cause hospital admissions,&#xD;
&#xD;
           (e) the incidence of hospital admissions due to malaria,&#xD;
&#xD;
           (f) Coverage with IPTc as measured by the following indicators:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the proportion of children who received three IPT courses on schedule;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the proportion of children who received partial or off-schedule IPT courses&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the proportion of children with no IPT.&#xD;
