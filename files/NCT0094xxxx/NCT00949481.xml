    <textblock>
      The rationale for the study stems from the goal of reducing the very high unmet need for&#xD;
      family planning among women in their first year postpartum. It is understood that the reason&#xD;
      this need is so high in general is because postpartum women do not always &quot;demand&quot; family&#xD;
      planning services, and family planning providers do not always &quot;supply&quot; services to&#xD;
      postpartum (amenorrheic) women who do &quot;demand&quot; them. To address these supply and demand&#xD;
      problems, corresponding supply and demand solutions will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demand Generating Strategy-Integrate into Immunization Services Following birth, return&#xD;
           to fertility among postpartum women is dependent on many factors. These include time&#xD;
           since last birth, breastfeeding intensity, and menstrual status. However, when and how&#xD;
           fertility returns is often misunderstood by women. For instance, many women think that&#xD;
           they can not get pregnant before their menses return, or that as long as they are&#xD;
           breastfeeding they are protected from pregnancy. Educating women about their return to&#xD;
           fertility following giving birth, and reminding women about the importance of birth&#xD;
           spacing for their health and the health of their children is the focus of the&#xD;
           demand-generating strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To reach postpartum women with these messages a demand generating activity at&#xD;
           immunization clinics will be conducted, as immunization services are well attended.&#xD;
           Based on the recommended immunization schedules for infants, women will make several&#xD;
           visits to these clinics throughout the course of their first year postpartum, which&#xD;
           provides an ideal opportunity to &quot;hit&quot; them with family planning messages more than&#xD;
           once.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To aid providers of immunization services in their delivery of family planning messages,&#xD;
           a simple job aid was developed. The job aid takes providers through a series of 3&#xD;
           questions that will allow the provider to determine a mother's immediate risk for&#xD;
           pregnancy (based on LAM criteria). If a woman is currently at risk for pregnancy, it&#xD;
           prompts the provider to give a healthy timing and spacing message and to make a referral&#xD;
           to the family planning clinic. If a woman is not currently at risk for pregnancy, the&#xD;
           job aid helps the provider instruct the mother about when her risk for pregnancy will&#xD;
           change, and therefore when she will need to seek family planning services to achieve&#xD;
           proper birth spacing (should this be desirable to the mother).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Also, in the family planning (FP) clinics that are located in the same facility as the&#xD;
           immunization clinic, providers will be given the pregnancy checklist. This job-aid has&#xD;
           already been researched (refer to citations). The purpose of providing it is to make&#xD;
           sure that when women are referred to FP clinics by immunization providers, FP providers&#xD;
           will supply them with a method. As a consequence, it hoped that by the time women are&#xD;
           9-12 months postpartum, there will be an increase in uptake of non-condom family&#xD;
           planning methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Supply Solution-Diversify Tools Available to Rule-Out Pregnancy The supply strategy&#xD;
           focuses on giving providers the tools to give contraceptive methods to women who are&#xD;
           amenorrheic. As recommended by the WHO, it is standard practice for FP providers to rule&#xD;
           out the possibility of pregnancy before providing many types of methods to their&#xD;
           clients. The presence of menses is often used to make this determination. However,&#xD;
           return of menses can be delayed for many months in the postpartum period, limiting a&#xD;
           provider's ability to supply postpartum women with contraceptive methods. To overcome&#xD;
           this challenge, the Pregnancy Checklist was developed. It is a job-aid designed to rule&#xD;
           out pregnancy based on client responses to questions concerning her recent sexual and&#xD;
           reproductive history. Urine pregnancy testing is another viable option for ruling out&#xD;
           pregnancy in non-menstruating FP clients, especially in situations where providers feel&#xD;
           they cannot trust women to answer questions honestly. Thus, family planning clinics will&#xD;
           be provided with free pregnancy test strips, and the change in same day uptake of FP&#xD;
           methods will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Providing family planning messages to women attending immunization clinics with their&#xD;
           child will cause them to seek family planning services in a greater proportion at 9-12&#xD;
           postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The availability of free pregnancy testing will increase same day method provision for&#xD;
           new and restarting family planning clients.&#xD;

    <description>A new job-aid will be given to immunization providers that will guide them in assessing a mother's risk for pregnancy (based on LAM criteria), and guide them in making family planning referrals, including when a woman should start to use a family planning method if she wants to prevent pregnancy. The providers in immunization clinics will be asked to make such an assessment each time a woman has her baby vaccinated.&#xD;
Additionally, in family planning clinics located in the same facilities as the immunization clinics, family planning providers will be trained to use and provided with the pregnancy checklist (see &quot;links&quot; for more information on the checklist)</description>
