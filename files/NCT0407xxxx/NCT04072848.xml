  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective observational cohort study of patients admitted to hospital with suspected&#xD;
      hypercapnic respiratory failure and requiring treatment with non-invasive ventilation (NIV)&#xD;
      as part of standard, routine management. Contemporaneous blood gas samples will be obtained&#xD;
      via arterial, capillary, and venous methods. The venous samples will undergo mathematical&#xD;
      arterialisation via the v-TAC system. In line with standard medical care, arterial samples&#xD;
      will be obtained before starting NIV and at two set points afterwards (day 1 post-NIV, and&#xD;
      pre-discharge). Pre-existing clinical thresholds will be used to assess the reliability of&#xD;
      v-TAC against ABG, the existing gold standard and will conduct a retrospective model of&#xD;
      decision-making once the blood sampling component of the study is concluded.&#xD;
