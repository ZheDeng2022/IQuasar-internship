  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This an open label study using a FDA-cleared TMS stimulation protocols which will be used to&#xD;
      treat patients who have responded or remitted from depression using acute clinical TMS&#xD;
      therapy at the University of Missouri-Columbia Neuromodulation Clinic. TMS therapy will be&#xD;
      given to subjects at monthly intervals. Depression severity questionnaires will be given&#xD;
      monthly to determine if the subjects original response to TMS can be maintained. Subjects&#xD;
      will be tapered down from antidepressant medication prior to TMS maintenance treatment.&#xD;
      Results will be analyzed to determine the effectiveness and feasibility of maintenance TMS&#xD;
      therapies in a clinical setting.&#xD;

      This an open label study using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) as a maintenance&#xD;
      treatment for subjects that have seen a clinically significant response or remission from&#xD;
      their depressive symptoms after having had an acute clinical course of TMS. All potential&#xD;
      subjects must have been treated at the University of Missouri Columbia Neuromodulation Clinic&#xD;
      to qualify.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 2 arms in this study. The first is a group of patients who will not receive any TMS&#xD;
      treatments and will be followed for a year, and have their depression severity assessed&#xD;
      monthly using the Personal Health Questionnaire (PHQ9), and the Quick Inventory of Depressive&#xD;
      Symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second arm will receive TMS treatments 5 times/month for 12 months, be assessed for&#xD;
      changes in depressive symptom severity monthly using the PHQ9 and QIDS. TMS treatment&#xD;
      protocols will consist of wither the standard 20min 10Hz protocol, or a 3min theta-burst&#xD;
      protocol. The protocol used will be determined by what worked for the subject when they were&#xD;
      treated clinically at the University of Missouri Columbia Neuromodulation clinic. Subjects in&#xD;
      this arm will be tapered of antidepressant medication prior to monthly TMS treatment and will&#xD;
      remain antidepressant free for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a year long in duration.&#xD;
