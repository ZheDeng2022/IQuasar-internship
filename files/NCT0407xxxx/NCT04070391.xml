      Purpose of Study The purpose of this crossover study was to determine how vitamin B6&#xD;
      supplementation impacts mood states in college age (18-25 y) women that use oral&#xD;
      contraceptives, in comparison to a placebo treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Daily supplementation of vitamin B6 (100 mg) over a 4-week period will improve&#xD;
      mood states in college age women (18-25 y) with marginal vitamin B6 status that use oral&#xD;
      contraceptives, compared to the placebo treatment.&#xD;

      This study is a 12-week, randomized, double-blinded crossover trial. After eligibility is&#xD;
      confirmed through prescreening and onsite screening assessments (screening visit; ~30&#xD;
      minutes), participants will sign the consent form and enter the trial. Participants are&#xD;
      stratified by age, BMI, and length of oral contraceptive use and randomized by a coin flip&#xD;
      into the experimental group (B6 supplement) or control group (low does vinegar pill).&#xD;
      Participants will visit the test site in the fasted state (no food or drink with the&#xD;
      exception of water for 10 hours) on 4 occasions (pre and post weeks 1-4 and pre and post&#xD;
      weeks 9-12) These visits are approximately 30 minutes long. At the start of the trial,&#xD;
      participants are instructed to take the provided pills once daily for four weeks. For weeks&#xD;
      5-8, participants will not take any pills (the washout period). Daily pill consumption will&#xD;
      resume during weeks 9-12 (the crossover treatment). Participants are their own control in&#xD;
      this crossover trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants are instructed to maintain their normal exercise and eating patterns&#xD;
      consistently throughout the duration of the 12-week study. Additionally, participants are&#xD;
      instructed not to start any new medications or nutritional/herbal supplements. To promote&#xD;
      compliance, participants will have a calendar to check off each day that the pills are&#xD;
      consumed during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric data are collected and fasting blood draws are performed at weeks 0, 4, 9 and&#xD;
      12. Fasting blood samples will be tested for B6 and associated metabolites. Additionally,&#xD;
      mood assessments, including the Profile of Mood States and the Beck Depression Inventory will&#xD;
      be administered at weeks 0, 4, 9 and 12.&#xD;
