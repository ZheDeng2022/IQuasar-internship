  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV/AIDS is the second leading cause of death in Africa. Adolescents living with HIV (ALWH)&#xD;
      are at increased risk for HIV-related morbidity and mortality due to poor retention in HIV&#xD;
      care and suboptimal antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence. Despite having the world's&#xD;
      largest population of ALWH (15-24 years, n=870,000), only 14% of South African ALWH are on&#xD;
      ART, 12% are retained in HIV care 1-2 years after ART initiation, and 10% are virally&#xD;
      suppressed. During treatment interruption, the effects of ART quickly reverse, increasing&#xD;
      transmission risk, treatment resistance, and potentially fatal complications. Unless their&#xD;
      treatment retention and adherence improves, ALWH will continue to transmit the virus to their&#xD;
      sexual partners and die prematurely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While social support is often viewed as a bridge that joins ALWH to key resources within&#xD;
      their environments, little is known about which types of social support are most impactful&#xD;
      and from whom within their network, particularly among ALWH in endemic countries. Moreover,&#xD;
      many South African ALWH lack social support from key social network members due to lack of&#xD;
      HIV status disclosure, increasing their risk for poorer HIV-related outcomes when compare to&#xD;
      their disclosed peers. Social network interventions (i.e., those that leverage the resources&#xD;
      within one's network to improve behaviors and outcomes) that meet the needs of both ALWH who&#xD;
      are disclosed and non-disclosed are needed, but lacking. Such inventions have the potential&#xD;
      to facilitate appraisal support, during which ALWH receive targeted assistance with&#xD;
      identifying appropriate and trustworthy people in their lives. More broadly, there exists a&#xD;
      lack empirically supported interventions aimed at improving retention in HIV care and ART&#xD;
      adherence for ALWH in low-middle income countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal follows the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST), a comprehensive framework&#xD;
      for optimizing and evaluating multicomponent behavioral interventions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This K08 focuses on the preparation phase, which consists of compiling information from&#xD;
      various sources, including behavioral theory, scientific literature, secondary analyses of&#xD;
      existing data, and formative research to inform a theoretical model. This model guides&#xD;
      intervention-related decisions, such as the selection of intervention components. Piloting of&#xD;
      intervention components and the identification and operationalization of an optimization&#xD;
      criterion also occur in this phase. The investigators will first use social network analyses&#xD;
      to elucidate network characteristics that influence ALWHs' retention and adherence (Aim 1),&#xD;
      then use participatory methods to inform intervention development (Aim 2), and lastly assess&#xD;
      intervention acceptability, feasibility, safety and evidence of efficacy (Aim 3). Aim 3 is&#xD;
      the clinical trial component and described in detail below. Aim 1 will determine how ALWHs'&#xD;
      social networks influence their retention in HIV care and ART adherence and Aim 2 will then&#xD;
      focus on the development of a network-based, social support intervention to improve ALWH&#xD;
      retention in HIV care and ART adherence informed by Aim 1 and other relevant information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of aim 3 is to assess intervention acceptability, feasibility, safety and evidence&#xD;
      of efficacy through open piloting. The investigators will assess intervention acceptability,&#xD;
      feasibility, safety, and evidence of efficacy using an iterative process enabling feedback&#xD;
      and continuing quality improvement over the course of implementation. This approach involves&#xD;
      the piloting of the network intervention developed in Aim 2. The rationale is that the best&#xD;
      interventions for ALWH will consider their unique needs and include tailored components. The&#xD;
      outcome of this Aim will be a feasible and acceptable social network intervention that will&#xD;
      be tested in an adaptive intervention using future grant funding. The hypothesis for aim 3 is&#xD;
      that the intervention will be acceptable, feasible, and safe, with trends towards improved&#xD;
      ALWH retention in HIV care and ART adherence.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention is a network-based, social support intervention to improve ALWH retention in HIV care and ART adherence. The specific intervention will be developed during Aim 2 of the study and uses qualitative findings, along with data from Aim 1, to develop an interventions that integrates participant feedback and borrows components from two existing interventions: Masivukeni and LIFECommunity.</description>
