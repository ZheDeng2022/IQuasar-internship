  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate Procellera® , a novel FDA approved antimicrobial&#xD;
      wound dressing in a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical study. The hypothesis is&#xD;
      that when the dressing is moistened, the low electric field created by moisture-activated&#xD;
      elemental silver and zinc electro-couple will prevent formation of biofilm in wounds or to&#xD;
      disrupt existing biofilm.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The healing of traumatic wounds, to include burns, can be compromised by the presence of&#xD;
      infection so efforts are made to prevent or diagnose infection early in order to mitigate the&#xD;
      negative impact on healing. Electric stimulation has previously been shown to have both&#xD;
      bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects in wounds. Until now, administering low intensity&#xD;
      electric field/micro-current as a therapy to mitigate biofilm infection and to improve wound&#xD;
      healing was not feasible. In this study the investigators will use Procellera® , a FDA&#xD;
      approved fabric based wireless electroceutical dressing (WED) consisting of a silver-zinc&#xD;
      electro-couple for the prevention of wound biofilm formation. The dressing generates a low&#xD;
      electric field (~1V) upon activation by a moist environment, which mitigates biofilm&#xD;
      formation and promotes wound healing. The objectives of the study are to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of a wireless electroceutical dressing to prevent the formation or disrupting&#xD;
      existing biofilms. The investigators will conduct a prospective, randomized controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial using the Procellera® dressing compared to the standard of care. Treatment&#xD;
      sites will be randomized to either receiving Procellera® or the standard of care treatment.&#xD;
      Objective measurements and assessments will be completed during subject follow-up visits for&#xD;
      up to one month post treatment. This includes biopsies to calculate bacterial load by&#xD;
      assessing colony forming unit (CFU) count and bacterial film visualization using scanning&#xD;
      electron microscopy, histology, clinical assessment of infection, Transepidermal Water Loss&#xD;
      (TEWL) and wound photography.&#xD;
