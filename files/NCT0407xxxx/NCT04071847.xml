  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this international study is to evaluate long-term safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      Abbott deep brain stimulation (DBS) systems for all indications, including Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease, essential tremor or other disabling tremor and dystonia.&#xD;

      ADROIT is an international, prospective, multicenter, observational, post-market study&#xD;
      intended to collect worldwide long-term safety and effectiveness data on subjects implanted&#xD;
      with market-released Abbott DBS systems in routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed for 5 years after the initial programming visit.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline to 6 months in disease-specific motor rating scale. For subjects with Parkinson's disease, MDS-UPDRS Part III.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) assess the severity of Parkinson's disease. This questionnaire is composed of four sections: Part I: non-motor experiences of daily living consisting of 13 questions (Part Ia is assessed by the investigator while part Ib is assessed by the subject, with or without the help of the caregiver); Part II: motor experiences of daily living consisting of 13 questions, designed to be self-administered; Part III: motor examinations consisting of 33 scores based on 18 questions with several right, left or other body distribution scores; Part IV: motor complications: consisting of 6 questions. Each item is scored from 0 to 4, where 0 indicates normal, 1 indicates slight symptoms, 2 indicates mild symptoms, 3 indicates moderate symptoms, and 4 indicates severe symptoms. The total score for each part is obtained from the sum of the corresponding item scores. Higher scores indicate greater impact of PD symptoms.</description>

    <description>The Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale (FTMTRS) assesses tremor severity and and consists of three parts. Part A (with a maximum score of 80) rates tremor at rest, during posture, and intentional movements for nine parts of the body, including the head, trunk and limbs; Part B (with a maximum score of 36) rates action tremor of the upper limbs, particularly while writing and pouring liquids; part C the patient rates the impact of tremor on his or her functional disability (speaking, feeding, drinking, hygiene, dressing, writing, and working) with a maximum score of 28. The total score obtained by adding the three parts of the FTM-TRS is 144, with a higher score indicating higher disease severity/disability.&#xD;
The FTM-TRS also includes one separate item dealing with global assessment of tremor-related disability, rated by both patient and examiner on a 5-point scale.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline to 6 months in disease-specific motor rating scale. For subjects with dystonia (except for cervical dystonia), BFMDRS movement scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BFMDRS consists consists of a movement subscale and a disability subscale. The movement scale measures dystonia in nine body regions (including the eyes, mouth, speech and swallowing, neck, trunk, arms, and legs). Each domain is scored on degree of provoking factor (0=no dystonia at rest or with action to 4=dystonia present at rest) and severity factor (0=no dystonia to 4=extreme/severe dystonia). Scores are weighted yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 120. The disability scale is a functional marker consisting of parental- or self-reported daily activities (involving speech, handwriting, feeding, eating, swallowing, hygiene, dressing, and walking), with scores ranging from 0 (completely independent) to 30 (completely dependent). A higher score indicates higher disease severity/disability.</description>
