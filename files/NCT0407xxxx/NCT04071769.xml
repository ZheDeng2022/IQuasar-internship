  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is being done to determine whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      using inhaled hyper-polarized 129 Xenon gas can help visualize impaired lung function to&#xD;
      detect changes over time in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) patients receiving approved&#xD;
      IPF treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo an approximately hour long comprehensive MRI protocol, including&#xD;
      administration of multiple doses of hyper-polarized 129 Xenon. The subjects will have this&#xD;
      initial study prior to initiation of IPF therapies. Then the subjects will have repeat&#xD;
      studies at 3, 6 and 12 months following the initiation of therapy. Additional studies&#xD;
      including pulmonary function studies, serum for bio markers, 6 minute walk distance and a&#xD;
      high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan (only at the 6 month visit) will be performed&#xD;
      to determine how 129 Xenon MRI performs relative to standard of care evaluations for IPF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI uses a magnet and radio waves to make diagnostic medical images of the body. There&#xD;
      have been no ill effects reported from exposure to the magnetism or radio waves used in this&#xD;
      test. Risks of the xenon gas are slight numbness in legs, nausea, a feeling of well-being,&#xD;
      and mild tingling in fingertips. You will have pulmonary function testing for the study, you&#xD;
      may experience breathlessness or dizziness during or immediately following these tests.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Red Blood Cell (RBC):Barrier Ratio Following Initiation of IPF Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>The RBC:barrier measure will be assessed at time of study enrollment and then at 3, 6 and 12 months following initiation of IPF therapy.</time_frame>
    <description>RBC:barrier ratio will be determined using 129 Xenon MRI. This ratio will be assessed in each individual prior to initiation of IPF therapy. Following initiation of therapy additional 129 Xenon MRIs will be performed at 3, 6 and 12 months. The outcome measure will be assessment of rate of RBC:barrier decline following initiation of therapy across the imaging studies from the initial 129 Xenon MRI performed prior to initiation of therapy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pulmonary Function Following Initiation of IPF therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Pulmonary function testing will occur prior to initiation of therapy and then at 3, 6 and 12 months following initiation of therapy.</time_frame>
    <description>Lung function will be assessed in all subjects. This will include forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). The outcome measure will be for FVC decline &gt;10% or DLCO decline &gt;20% over the 12 months. These measures have been identified as surrogate measures of IPF outcomes in prior clinical studies.</description>
