      This is a single-center,Exploratory Research for evaluating the efficacy of MASCT-I With PD1&#xD;
      Antibody and Apatinib in patients with advanced Advanced Osteosarcoma and Soft Tissue Sarcoma&#xD;
      and preliminarily assessing the preliminary observation of immune response and safety. About&#xD;
      20 cases of adult patients are to be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were randomly divided into two groups. One group received MASCT-I A+PD1&#xD;
      antibody+Apatinib treatment, the other group received MASCT-I B+PD1 antibody+Apatinib&#xD;
      treatment. In combination with MASCT-I, the dosage and cycle of PD1 antibody and Apatinib did&#xD;
      not change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MASCT-I A and MASCT-I B are mainly administered with different frequencies of MASCT-I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment, patients were assessed by CT imaging every 8 weeks. If the disease&#xD;
      progressed or could not be tolerated, or when the end of treatment (104 weeks), the treatment&#xD;
      would be discontinued, whichever happened first.&#xD;

    <description>Multi-antigen autoimmune cell injection (MASCT-I) is an adoptive cellular immunotherapeutic product being developed by Heng Ruiyuan.&#xD;
PD1 antibody is a blocking antibody of human programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1). It can bind to PD-1 receptor, block its interaction with PD-L 1 and PD-L2, release PD-1 pathway mediated inhibition of immune response, including anti-tumor immune response.&#xD;
Apatinib is a small molecule targeted anti-angiogenesis drug. It can highly selectively compete for ATP binding sites of endothelial growth factor R-2, block downstream signal transduction and inhibit neovascularization in tumor tissues.</description>
