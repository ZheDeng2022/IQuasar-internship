  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study we want to learn more about whether taking Niagen, a daily supplement&#xD;
      containing a form of Vitamin B3, will improve cognitive function, mood, and daily activity in&#xD;
      people with Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over a 6 month period, we will ask study participants to take both Niagen or a placebo for 8&#xD;
      weeks each and complete research visits ever 4 or 8 weeks. Most research visits will involve&#xD;
      a blood draw, cognitive testing, and mood questionnaires. Most study activities will take&#xD;
      place via Zoom videoconferencing. We will ask you to come to our center 4-5 times to complete&#xD;
      some study activities in-person. There will be an option to participate in a lumbar puncture&#xD;
      sub-study, in which participants would have up to 3 lumbar punctures. There will also be an&#xD;
      option to participate in an MRI sub-study, in which participants would have up to 3 MRIs over&#xD;
      the course of the study. In between research visits, we will also ask the participants to&#xD;
      wear a Fitbit activity tracker and play computerized brain games a few times a week. This&#xD;
      will enable us to get a snapshot of each subject's functioning levels day to day and better&#xD;
      determine whether or not the supplement is having an effect on the participant.&#xD;

             National Institute on Aging:&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. SCD will be defined as: i. any subjective concern of change in cognitive&#xD;
             functioning without objective evidence of cognitive impairment, and ii. complete&#xD;
             preservation of functional abilities and independence in instrumental activities of&#xD;
             daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
             b. MCI will be defined as: i. a preexisting diagnosis of MCI given by a trained&#xD;
             physician or behavioral health provider, or ii. evidence of objective impairment in&#xD;
             cognitive functioning in one or more domain with preservation of functional abilities&#xD;
             and independence in instrumental activities of daily living as defined by the National&#xD;
             Institute on Aging;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Minimum score of 16 on t-MoCA;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Ability to provide direct informed consent as assessed by obtaining a score of 70% on&#xD;
