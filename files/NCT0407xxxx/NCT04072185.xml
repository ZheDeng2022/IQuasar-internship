    <textblock>
      Background: Social isolation, loneliness and anxiety-depressive states are emerging health&#xD;
      conditions in the elderly of our society. This situation is related to higher morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. There is a growing need to determine effective interventions that address these&#xD;
      situations, since sometimes pharmacological options are limited in these patients. Physical&#xD;
      activity (AF) and social relationships in the elderly are linked to physical and mental&#xD;
      health. Being able to do some physical or recreational activity will help them face this&#xD;
      stage of life with more optimism and relate to others in a healthy and independent way,&#xD;
      however, few studies have evaluated their effectiveness in our territory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objectives: To evaluate whether a 4 month AF group program and the visit to know&#xD;
           socio-cultural entities improve the emotional, social and quality of life situation in a&#xD;
           sample of people over 64 years of age with anxiety, depression, social isolation or&#xD;
           solitude And measure whether adherence to AF and the linkage to sociocultural entities&#xD;
           is maintained after the intervention has taken place.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Multicentre, randomized, two-group clinical trial, of 1 year follow-up. Study&#xD;
      population: Patients over 64 years of age assigned to primary care teams (EAP) from different&#xD;
      locations: Sant Joan de Vilatorrada, Súria and Manresa 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: To meet criteria of depression or anxiety at the time of the study,&#xD;
      score&gt; 12 on the Beck Depression Scale and / or score&gt; 10 on the GAD-7 Scale (General Anxiety&#xD;
      Disorder) and that Present a score &lt;32 on the steps of DUKE-UNC-11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomization of between 44 and 56 patients will be performed at each participant EAP. Half&#xD;
      will be allocated to the control group (GC) and half to the intervention group (GI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will participate in a group AF program for 4 months. It will consist&#xD;
      of 60 minutes of walking sessions 2 days a week. Also once a month, coinciding with the walk,&#xD;
      you will visit some sociocultural municipal equipment to promote a community connection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Main measures: Response to the intervention or clinical remission of depression (Escalera&#xD;
      de Beck), and / or anxiety (Escala GAD-7), improvement of social support (DUKE-UNC) and&#xD;
      quality of life (EuroQol) . Secondary measures: Adherence to the AF (VREM questionnaire&#xD;
      (Spanish Reduced Version of the Minnesota Free Time Questionnaire in Minnesota)), and linkage&#xD;
      to sociocultural entities once the intervention has been completed. The assessments will be&#xD;
      made at 0, 4, 8 and 12 months.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND CURRENT STATUS OF THE SUBJECT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our society, thanks to medicine and development, the proportion of the elderly population&#xD;
      tends to increase every year. The percentage of people over 64 years of age in 2017 in Spain&#xD;
      was 18.8%, and is expected to continue to increase to 34.6% in 2066, according to the&#xD;
      National Statistics Institute projection (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social isolation, loneliness and anxiety-depressive states are emerging health conditions in&#xD;
      the elderly in our society. As much in adult population as in old population&#xD;
      noninstitutionalized it has been verified that to have little social support is related to a&#xD;
      worse mental health. According to the European Health Survey in Spain carried out by the&#xD;
      Ministry of Health, Consumption and Social Welfare of 2017, the prevalence of depression and&#xD;
      chronic anxiety were in subjects of 65-74 years of 10.64% and 8.25% , from 75 to 84 years of&#xD;
      13.73% and 9.49% and over 85 years of 11.36% and 6.68% (2). This situation is related to&#xD;
      higher morbidity and mortality. There is a growing need to determine effective interventions&#xD;
      that address these conditions, since sometimes pharmacological options are limited in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For decades it has been known that social relationships are linked to physical and mental&#xD;
      health. A satisfying social network promotes healthy behaviors and habits. Social support&#xD;
      especially protects the elderly from loneliness (3) and from depression (4). In particular,&#xD;
      it can have a beneficial impact on mental health problems and psychological distress among&#xD;
      older adults (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also AF in the elderly has multiple advantages, not only at the physical level but also at&#xD;
      the emotional level (6-8), several studies show that physical or leisure activities reduce&#xD;
      loneliness (9), depression (10- 14), anxiety (15) and are associated with better mental&#xD;
      health (16, 17). According to Guszkowska (18), the AF's benefits of anxiety, depression and&#xD;
      irritability are especially high in those who start from high levels of anxiety and&#xD;
      depression. The type of AF that causes major improvements is those based on cyclical aerobic&#xD;
      activities (walking, swimming or cycling) from moderate to low intensity. This statement is&#xD;
      aligned with the position of the American College of Sports Medicine, which recommends AF for&#xD;
      the larger populations and affirms that regular AF can minimize the physiological and&#xD;
      psychological effects of a sedentary lifestyle time that increases the expectations of life&#xD;
      (19) and the quality of life (20). Being able to do some physical or recreational activity&#xD;
      will help them face this stage of life with more optimism and relate to others in a healthy&#xD;
      and independent way (21), however, few studies in our territory have evaluated their&#xD;
      effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The AF improves the emotional, social and quality of life situation in subjects over 64&#xD;
           years of age with problems of anxiety, depression, social isolation or loneliness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The intervention group remains more active than the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The intervention favors maintaining the AF for a long period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The intervention group is more linked to sociocultural entities than the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TARGETS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To evaluate if the AF improves the emotional, social and quality of life situation in a&#xD;
      sample of people over 64 years of age with problems of anxiety, depression and little social&#xD;
      social support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate whether the intervention of an AF program for 4 months keeps improving the&#xD;
           emotional, social and quality of life situation in a sample of people over 64 years of&#xD;
           age with anxiety, depression, social isolation or loneliness at 8 and 12 months of the&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure if the adherence to the AF is maintained after the intervention has taken place&#xD;
           at 8 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure if the link to sociocultural entities is created and maintained once the&#xD;
           intervention has been carried out at 4, 8 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the satisfaction of the users after the intervention at 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY Design: Multicentre, randomized, two-group clinical trial, of 1 year follow-up.&#xD;
      Study population: Patients over 64 years of age assigned to primary care teams (EAP) from&#xD;
      different locations: Sant Joan de Vilatorrada (12,721 assigned), Súria (8,956 assigned),&#xD;
      Manresa 2 (23,351 assigned). With this representativeness of territories, patients living in&#xD;
      urban, semi-urban and rural areas will be able to study. Subsequently, the participation of&#xD;
      other SAP teams will be attempted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Meet the criteria of depression or anxiety at the time of the study,&#xD;
      score&gt; 12 on the Beck Depression Scale (BDI-II) and / or score&gt; 10 on the GAD-7 Scale&#xD;
      (General Anxiety Disorder) and that they score &lt;32 on the back of DUKE-UNC-11. Possibility to&#xD;
      follow a year by the same primary care team. At least read and write Spanish or Catalan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria. Diagnosis of dementia or moderate cognitive impairment. Greater&#xD;
      depression (BECK scale score&gt; 28). Dependency disorders due to abuse of alcohol or other&#xD;
      drugs. You are receiving some psychological therapy from the Center for Reference Mental&#xD;
      Health. Physical illness at an advanced stage. Present any physical, mental or temporary&#xD;
      limitations to be able to walk 1 hour a day two days a week. That they have not signed the&#xD;
      informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Show and recruitment: Each participating Primary Care Team (EAP) will be randomized between&#xD;
      44 and 56 patients. Half will be allocated to the control group (GC) and half to the&#xD;
      intervention group (GI). The recruitment will be consecutive in each EAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The professionals participating in the study will consult the database of the Computerized&#xD;
      Clinical History of Catalonia (ECAP) through the consultation form of their quotas (Dbsform),&#xD;
      in order to obtain the lists of patients that meet the inclusion criteria (have the active&#xD;
      diagnosis of depression or anxiety and have little social support). Subsequently, your doctor&#xD;
      or nurse will make the selection of the patients and will contact them to offer them the&#xD;
      possibility to participate in the study and, in case they accept, they will be grouped in&#xD;
      their CAP to explain In detail, study and sign informed consent, an interview will be&#xD;
      followed and the questionnaires will be administered to assess whether they meet the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria. They will finally be assigned to Control group or intervention randomly&#xD;
      and anonymously using a statistical program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: The sample size for independent groups was estimated, capable of detecting&#xD;
      differences of two points in the average score of the Depression of Beck and GAD-7 and 7&#xD;
      points in the scale of social support of DUKE-UNC-11. A control has been assigned for each&#xD;
      case, assuming a statistical power of 80% with a confidence interval of 95%. Between 146 and&#xD;
      162 patients would be needed and for reasons of convenience three groups of 50 patients each&#xD;
      will form in each EAP, 25 of which will be in the intervention groups and 25 in the control&#xD;
      units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables and measurement methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables main results:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical remission of depression and / or response to the intervention once the&#xD;
           intervention has been completed, at 4 months after the start of the study. Clinical&#xD;
           remission is considered: Beck scale score (BDI-II) &lt;12 points (Riedel 2010) and response&#xD;
           to the intervention: reduction of the basal score. The Beck Depression Inventory is an&#xD;
           auto-applied questionnaire of 21 items with four response alternatives, sorted according&#xD;
           to the severity of the symptoms it refers to (range 0 to 3; range score from 0 to 63&#xD;
           scale). The version adapted to Spanish by Sanz (2003) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Remission of the anxiety clinic and / or response to the intervention once the&#xD;
           intervention has been completed, at 4 months after the start of the study. Clinical&#xD;
           remission is considered: scaling of the GAD-7 scale (General Anxiety Disorder) &lt;10&#xD;
           points and response to the intervention: reduction of the score compared to basal. The&#xD;
           GAD-7 scale is simple and self-administrable, it has 7 items of anxiety symptoms on a&#xD;
           Likert scale on the presence of the symptom in the last two weeks (&quot;nothing at all&quot;,&#xD;
           &quot;several days&quot;, &quot;more than half of the days &quot;and&quot; almost every day &quot;) that score from 0&#xD;
           to 3, where the maximum score is 21. A score greater than or equal to 10 is indicative&#xD;
           of anxiety disorders, achieving a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 82 %. This&#xD;
           scale has been validated in Spanish by García-Campayo (2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Improvement of social support once the intervention has finished 4 months after the&#xD;
           start of the study. Social support improvement is considered a decrease in the score in&#xD;
           the DUKE-UNC-11 social support questionnaire with respect to the basal, and good social&#xD;
           support with a score &lt;32 points. This instrument was designed to measure functional&#xD;
           social support perceived by Broadhead and validated for the Spanish population by Bellón&#xD;
           et al. (1996). This is a self-administered 11 item instrument, uses a Likert type&#xD;
           response scale with scores from 1 to 5, stands out for its simplicity and brevity,&#xD;
           evaluates the perceived social support, evaluates the confidential social support&#xD;
           (possibility of have people to communicate) and affective social support (demonstrations&#xD;
           of love, affection and empathy). In the Spanish version, a cut-off point was chosen in&#xD;
           the 15th percentile, which corresponds to a score &lt;32, to divide the subjects into two&#xD;
           groups (normal or low support).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Improved quality of life once the intervention has been completed at 4 months after the&#xD;
           start of the study. Quality of life improvement is considered a decrease in the score in&#xD;
           the EuroQol questionnaire (EQ-5D) with respect to basal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary result variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical remission of depression and / or response to the intervention at 8 and 12&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical remission of anxiety and / or response to the intervention at 8 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Improvement of the situation / social perception (DUKE-UNC Social Welfare Questionnaire)&#xD;
           at 8 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Improved quality of life measured through EuroQol (EQ-5D) at 8 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Result variables that measure feasibility in the intervention group:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Satisfaction with the intervention: A patient satisfaction survey will be carried&#xD;
                out at the end of the intervention, with 5 items and Likert scale of 4 categories.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adherence to the intervention: for each GI patient the number of sessions attended&#xD;
                will be collected. A variable of adherence to the intervention will be calculated:&#xD;
                attend 75% or more of the sessions, attend less.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adherence to AF post intervention through the VREM Questionnaire (Reduced Spanish&#xD;
                version of the AF time questionnaire in Minnesota)). The assessments will be made&#xD;
                at 0, 4, 8 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Linking to sociocultural entities once the intervention has been completed. The&#xD;
           assessments will be made at 0, 4, 8 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables that can act as confusers or modifiers of the effect:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pharmacological treatment. The DDD (defined daily dose) must be calculated for each&#xD;
           active ingredient in the follow-up period, taking into account the number of days, the&#xD;
           dose provided and the route of administration of the drug. The active principles that&#xD;
           will be registered will be those belonging to the following groups: antidepressants,&#xD;
           anxiolytics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participation in other mental health therapies, taught by a psychologist, psychiatrist.&#xD;
           Patients included in the therapies of the reference mental health centers will be&#xD;
           excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Prior participation in some AF activity on a regular basis: yes / no. Socio-demographic&#xD;
           variables: Sex, age, marital status, live life (yes / no), educational level (without&#xD;
           studies / incomplete primary / full primary / high school / higher education). Reference&#xD;
           primary care team: rural (assigned to a doctor's office) / semi-urban (assigned to an AP&#xD;
           center in a population &lt;15,000 inhabitants) / urban (assigned to an AP center with a&#xD;
           population of 15,000 or more).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will participate in a group AF program for 4 months. It will consist&#xD;
      of 60 minutes of walking sessions 2 days a week. The sessions will be directed by two&#xD;
      referents of each CAP, which will carry an application to the mobile (type STRAVA), to&#xD;
      control the distances recurred from each session. Also once a month, coinciding with the&#xD;
      walk, you will visit some sociocultural municipal equipment to promote a community&#xD;
      connection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the field work, different groups of professionals participate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Professional recruiters: doctor and / or nurse to which the patient is assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researcher in charge of the random allocation of patients: not linked to any EAP.&#xD;
           Perform the random assignment once all the patients required in each team have consented&#xD;
           to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluators: carry out baseline interviews at 4, 8 and 12 months, without knowing which&#xD;
           group the patient belongs to.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Professionals that will accompany the walks: two for each EAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Professionals from sociocultural centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The external evaluator will be in charge of collecting the results of the self-administered&#xD;
      scales previously mentioned in paper. These stairs will be in a unique place that only this&#xD;
      reviewer will have access to. They will be read with automatic reading with the identifier of&#xD;
      the survey using the Teleform Elite v 8.2 reading software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, the sociodemographic characteristics of the two groups will be described. For the&#xD;
      description of qualitative variables, percentages and for quantitative, standard averages and&#xD;
      averages, ranges and 25-75 percentiles will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous to the intervention, baseline scores on the selected scales after randomization of&#xD;
      the patients will be compared to verify that there are no significant differences. After the&#xD;
      intervention, the average scores of the different scales in both groups will be compared&#xD;
      independently, and for the different periods of post-intervention time, using the Student&#xD;
      test for matched samples in case of normality adjustment or the Mann-Whitney U if the&#xD;
      distribution was not normal. A secondary analysis, through multiple regression, will be&#xD;
      carried out, including sociodemographic and confusing variables, for the variable of clinical&#xD;
      remission of depression Yes / No (Yes: Beck scale &lt;12), for the clinical remission variable&#xD;
      of anxiety Yes / No (Yes: GAD-7 &lt;10) and for the social support variable Yes / no (Yes:&#xD;
      DUKE-UNC-11&gt; 32).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results showing differences with a p &lt;0.05 will be considered significant. For&#xD;
      statistical analysis, it was used in program SPSS v. 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance with Law 14/2007 of July 3, of biomedical and human rights research (BOE of&#xD;
      July 4, 2007), all recruited patients will be informed verbally and in writing of the&#xD;
      objectives, methodology, tests and interventions that can be received if they participate in&#xD;
      the study. It will be included to those who sign informed consent in writing. The document&#xD;
      will be written in a language that the patient can understand. The protocol has been approved&#xD;
      by the Ethical Committee of Clinical Investigation of the JGol Idiap. The researchers&#xD;
      undertake to maintain the confidentiality of the data. If the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      intervention is shown, the control group will receive the same group intervention once the&#xD;
      study has finished.&#xD;
