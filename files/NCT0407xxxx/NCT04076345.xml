    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to validate presepsin as a biological marker for identifying&#xD;
      bacterial fever among febrile syndromes of infants under three months of age. Clearly, our&#xD;
      goal is to determine if this marker can help us distinguish a viral infection from a&#xD;
      bacterial infection. Indeed, presepsin would be specific for bacterial infection, and rise&#xD;
      earlier in the blood during infection than biological markers currently used. Such validation&#xD;
      could improve the precocity of the therapeutic management by a better targeted antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy, and the limitation of invasive complementary examinations (lumbar puncture), in&#xD;
      infants for whom the fear of a bacterial infection leads to examinations and systematic&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An exploratory proof of concept that evaluates an innovative and minimally invasive&#xD;
      diagnostic technique, with brief, monocentric longitudinal follow-up, this study aims to&#xD;
      validate presepsin as a biomarker for identifying bacterial fever among febrile syndromes of&#xD;
      infants under three months of age. Presepsin is thought to be specific for sepsis, and would&#xD;
      rise earlier in the blood during sepsis than biomarkers currently used. Such validation could&#xD;
      improve the precocity of the therapeutic management by a better targeted antibiotic therapy,&#xD;
      and the limitation of invasive complementary examinations (lumbar puncture), in infants for&#xD;
      whom the fear of a bacterial infection leads to examinations and systematic treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do this, we will study the discriminative power (bacterial or viral, verified, a&#xD;
      posteriori, by the results of microbiological examinations such as blood cultures,&#xD;
      cytobacteriology of urine, lumbar puncture, virological or bacteriological samples of stool&#xD;
      and nasopharynx) and prognosis (comparison of initial signs of clinical severity and&#xD;
      presepsin levels, length of hospitalization and hospitalization unit) of presepsin by&#xD;
      comparing its blood levels to the usual biological markers (CRP, PCT, leukocytes,&#xD;
      neutrophils, lymphocytes) in children less than 3 months old with fever. It will also be&#xD;
      compared, a posteriori, the rate of presepsin between the group of children treated with&#xD;
      antibiotics and the group of untreated children to verify that the rate of presepsin is&#xD;
      predictive of the initiation of antibiotic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If in this study the superiority of presepsin is confirmed, it will also be evaluated, by a&#xD;
      medico-economic study, the effect of a decision of care based on the interpretation of the&#xD;
      blood presepsin level on downstream health costs and on the speed of care of children under 3&#xD;
      months with fever presenting to the emergency department by the commissioning of a&#xD;
      delocalized analyzer. This device is, for the moment, available only in the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study plans to include 160 children under 3 months admitted to pediatric emergencies or&#xD;
      pediatric resuscitation at Estaing Hospital in Clermont-Ferrand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the study will not require additional venipuncture given the very small&#xD;
      amount of blood sufficient for the presepsin assay. The diagnosis of the child will not be&#xD;
      made according to the presepsin test, but according to the standard criteria, and its&#xD;
      management will not be modified by his participation in the study. Thus, the study presents&#xD;
      neither benefit nor risk for the participants.&#xD;
