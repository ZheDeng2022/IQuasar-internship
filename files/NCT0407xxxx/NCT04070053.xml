  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of patients with Hypoxemic respiratory failure (HRF) and Acute Respiratory Distress&#xD;
      Syndrome (ARDS) is complex. Therapies that have been shown to save the lives of patients with&#xD;
      HRF and ARDS are available but they are not always provided. To reduce practice variation and&#xD;
      improve adherence to evidence-informed therapies, the investigators developed the Treatment&#xD;
      of Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure (HRF) and ARDS with Protection, Paralysis, and Proning&#xD;
      (TheraPPP) Pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this pilot study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of the TheraPPP&#xD;
      Pathway. To assess feasibility, the investigators will test the ability to measure adherence&#xD;
      to the pathway as well as patient and economic outcomes. To assess perceptions about the&#xD;
      acceptability of the TheraPPP Pathway, the investigators will conduct a survey to clinicians&#xD;
      who used the Pathway.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypoxemic respiratory failure (HRF) and ARDS are common conditions among patients admitted to&#xD;
      the Intensive care unit (ICU). Treatment of these patients is complex. Evidence based&#xD;
      therapies that can improve survival exist; however, implementation is extremely inconsistent.&#xD;
      As a potential solution to this problem, the investigators developed the Treatment of&#xD;
      Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure (HRF) and ARDS with Protection, Paralysis, and Proning&#xD;
      (TheraPPP) Pathway to reduce practice variation and improve adherence to evidence-informed&#xD;
      therapy. The objective of this pilot before and after study is to evaluate the feasibility&#xD;
      and acceptability of the TheraPPP Pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot study will use a before and after quasi-experimental design to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of the TheraPPP pathway. The TheraPPP pathway is a&#xD;
      comprehensive evidence-based, stakeholder-informed pathway for the diagnosis and management&#xD;
      of HRF. The study will be conducted in a single center mixed medical surgical ICU. The study&#xD;
      population will include all patients who are admitted to the ICU and are mechanically&#xD;
      ventilated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathway will be implemented over a one month period, followed by a one year post&#xD;
      implementation assessment period. The comparison (control) therapy will be usual management&#xD;
      assessed in the one year pre-implementation period. We estimate approximately 1000 patients&#xD;
      will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of the pilot study will be to assess feasibility and acceptability. To&#xD;
      assess feasibility, the investigators will test the ability to measure: (1) Fidelity through&#xD;
      5 process of care indicators (2) Patient and economic outcomes. To assess the acceptability&#xD;
      of the Pathway, the investigators will conduct a survey to clinicians who used the pathway.&#xD;
      The acceptability survey will be sent to approximately 250 ICU clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For data analysis, no specific comparisons will be made as the investigators are testing the&#xD;
      ability to measure the outcomes. However, feasibility and acceptability data will be&#xD;
      presented in aggregate as frequency with proportion or median with interquartile range, as&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
