  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) is a parasitic disease caused by more than 15 different species&#xD;
      of the protozoan parasite Leishmania. The CL usually begins with a papule at the site of the&#xD;
      sandfly bite, increasing in size to form a nodule that ulcerates in a period of 1 to 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact incidence of CL is not known. An estimated 1.2 million cases/year in approximately&#xD;
      102 countries worldwide suffer from different forms of CL. Among the different parasites that&#xD;
      cause CL, L.tropica in the Old World and L.braziliensis in the New World are considered to be&#xD;
      the most important due to the difficulty of healing, the public importance and the severity&#xD;
      of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pentavalent antimony remains the first choice drug for the treatment of CL and the evidence&#xD;
      to support its use is sometimes based on qualitative, retrospective and uncontrolled&#xD;
      observations, with only some controlled clinical studies. Antimonials are widely used despite&#xD;
      their toxicity, difficulty in the route of administration, and high cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Miltefosine (hexadecylphosphocholine), an oral medication that has proven effective for some&#xD;
      types of Leishmania, is potentially teratogenic, is contraindicated during pregnancy and&#xD;
      requires appropriate counseling for female patients of childbearing age.&#xD;

      Curaleish is a topical formulation in lotion and cream that contains natural extracts&#xD;
      (hydroalcoholic and glycolic for lotion and cream, respectively) of the branches (stems and&#xD;
      leaves) of the Caesalpinia spinosa tree known as &quot;Tara&quot; or &quot;Davidivi&quot; , which was developed&#xD;
      by Bionest SAS, Duitama, Colombia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The product is currently manufactured by Biohealthy SD S.A.S in accordance with Colombian&#xD;
      Good Manufacturing Practices (BPM) and evaluated by PECET following the international&#xD;
      standardized animal protocols and models of OECD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of a topical formulation of Curaleish is intended to offer a treatment to be&#xD;
      applied locally in the lesion of the LC, with a high antiparasitic effect. The formulation of&#xD;
      Curaleish lotion and Curaleish cream containing natural extracts, started from the activity&#xD;
      demonstrated in In vitro for the hydroalcoholic extract of C. espinosa (EC50 = 18.4 ± 1.3 µg&#xD;
      / mL) and a low cytotoxicity evidenced by an LC50 of 135.6 ± 0.7, 183.3 ± 1.1 and 136.6 ± 7.4&#xD;
      µg / mL in human liver cells HepG2, human macrophages U937 and peritoneal hamster&#xD;
      macrophages, respectively, and a selectivity index of 9.41, 9.96 and 7.42, respectively. This&#xD;
      activity was validated in in vivo studies in hamsters experimentally infected with L.&#xD;
      braziliensis. Applying the cream alone twice a day for 28 days produced a cure in 83% and&#xD;
      fails in 17%. On the other hand, the lotion applied once a day for 28 days showed cure in 67%&#xD;
      and relapse in 33%. When the lotion was used in combination twice a day and the cream once a&#xD;
      day for 28 days, 100% cure was achieved, which occurred early in most hamsters, this is at&#xD;
      the end of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accelerated stability tests for 3 months and natural stability (6 months) under Zone IV&#xD;
      conditions of the ICH (conditions 25ºC / 60% RH, 30ºC / 65% RH, 30ºC / 75% RH and 40ºC / 75%&#xD;
      RH) have shown that the product meets the criteria required for physical and microbiological&#xD;
      analysis, established by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP). These parameters are for the&#xD;
      cream: density 0.957 ± 0.000 g / mL for the cream and 0.958 ± 0.000 g / mL for the lotion;&#xD;
      Extensibility area 123.24 ± 19.64 mm2 for the cream; pH of 6.69 ± 0.115 for the cream and&#xD;
      4.82 ± 0.017 for the lotion; &lt;104 CFU of total aerobes and &lt;103 CFU / mL for molds and&#xD;
      yeasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight, clinical appearance and behavior data, as well as histological studies obtained from&#xD;
      preclinical acute dermal toxicity tests as well as cellular viability data obtained in skin&#xD;
      irritation / corrosion tests for Curaleish lotion and cream, executed according With the OECD&#xD;
      guidelines, it was concluded that skin contact with Curaleish products does not generate&#xD;
      toxic effects at the local level (application site) or at the systemic level, so it can be&#xD;
      considered as safe for use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An exploratory study to assess the safety, and to determine whether the Curaleish topical&#xD;
      cream when the lotion is applied three times a day in combination with the cream, applied&#xD;
      twice a day for 4 weeks showed that it is 83% effective for treatment of Colombian subjects&#xD;
      with uncomplicated LC. 25 of 30 patients managed to cure between 1.5 and 3 months after the&#xD;
      end of Curaleish treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of a topical formulation of Curaleish is intended to offer a treatment to be&#xD;
      applied locally in the lesion of the CL, with a high antiparasitic effect. Skin&#xD;
      irritation/corrosion tests for Curaleish lotion and cream, performed following the guidelines&#xD;
      of the OECD, allowed to conclude that skin contact with Curaleish products does not generate&#xD;
      toxic effects locally, or at a systemic level, therefore they can be considered safe for use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Objectives To assess the safety and tolerability of two Curaleish regimens administered&#xD;
      topically in individuals with uncomplicated CL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two regimes to evaluate are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regimen 1: Curaleish lotion applied three times a day in combination with Curaleish&#xD;
           cream applied two times a day for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regimen 2: Curaleish lotion applied three times a day in combination with Curaleish&#xD;
           cream applied two times a day for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives Evaluate the safety of Curaleish (frequency and severity of adverse&#xD;
      events (AEs)). Other secondary efficacy objectives include the assessment of the condition of&#xD;
      the lesions over time up to 100% re-epithelialization of the ulcerated lesions and the&#xD;
      proportion of individuals with 100% re-epithelization of not ulcerated lesions over time.&#xD;
