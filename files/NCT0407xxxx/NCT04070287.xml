    <textblock>
      The I-TEST study builds upon two participatory approaches, open challenge contests and&#xD;
      entrepreneurship training. The study utilizes open challenge contest to generate youth-driven&#xD;
      interventions on strategies to promote HIV self-testing and other testing for other sexually&#xD;
      transmitted infections (STIs) among young people in Nigeria. Open challenge contests involves&#xD;
      leveraging on the knowledge and strengths of the crowd (in this case young people) to&#xD;
      generate solutions to an issue. Following completion of one of the open challenge contest,&#xD;
      was the Designathon contest where young people in Nigeria collaborated to develop new&#xD;
      services and products for promoting self-testing for HIV and other sexually transmitted&#xD;
      diseases, guided by human-centered, design thinking framework. After which, six teams from&#xD;
      the Designathon were selected to move onto an Innovation bootcamp. The Innovation bootcamp&#xD;
      was a 4-week long accelerated training program for young people to delve into the world of&#xD;
      entrepreneurial and innovation management skills, while applying basic research principles.&#xD;
      At the end of the course, 5 finalist teams were selected to pilot test their innovation plan&#xD;
      in the community for a duration of 6 months, beginning July 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is focused on evaluating the effectiveness of these five youth participatory&#xD;
      interventions on HIV testing and other key prevention among at risk youth (14-24 years old in&#xD;
      Nigeria).This research study will involve undertaking a prospective one-year assessment of&#xD;
      these five pilot interventions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Step 1: Participant enrollment. This will involve recruiting youth to participate in the&#xD;
      pilot study. Participant recruitment strategies will include: social media, online, event-&#xD;
      and venue based, participant referral, and walk-ins at study clinics. Participant enrollment&#xD;
      will be completed by study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2: Intervention implementation. Following participant recruitment and enrollment in the&#xD;
      study. Study participants will be assigned to one of the 5 youth participatory interventions&#xD;
      focused on expanding the uptake of HIV self-testing and key HIV prevention services. The&#xD;
      pilot intervention implementation would occur for 6 months. Nigerian Institute of Medical&#xD;
      Research (NMIR) will provide local training on HIV prevention to the five participatory&#xD;
      interventions following their existing guidelines.The participatory interventions will be&#xD;
      conducted in the locations of the five teams who emerged as winners from the innovation&#xD;
      boot-camp. These participatory interventions will only provide HIV self-testing kits and&#xD;
      instructions of how to perform the test to participants. They will also provide referral&#xD;
      coupons to youth friendly centers for sexually transmitted infections (STI) screening and&#xD;
      treatment and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) awareness and initiation for at-risk youth. The&#xD;
      referral coupons are intended to provide study participants information on trained youth&#xD;
      friendly centers that are involved with the research. The referral coupons give the study&#xD;
      participants access to other sexually transmitted infections (STI) screening and treatment&#xD;
      and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) awareness and initiation at these health facilities. The&#xD;
      intervention only provide participants with the HIV self-testing kits and then refer them to&#xD;
      youth-friendly health facilities for other testing services. The intervention does not&#xD;
      involve monitoring HIV self-testing procedure, the investigators will only be asking for&#xD;
      self-reported HIV testing and other sexually transmitted diseases testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 3: Baseline data collection. After allocation of participants into the intervention,&#xD;
      study team will collect baseline data on HIV testing history, sexual behavior history, youth&#xD;
      participation experience, and other related outcomes will be collected (survey questionnaire&#xD;
      attached) from recruited participants. Participants mobile phone numbers will also be&#xD;
      collected as tracking information for follow-up and retention in a coupon format. The mobile&#xD;
      phone numbers would be used to contact study participants through text messages and phone&#xD;
      calls. These contacts would serve as reminders for participants to participate in follow-up&#xD;
      data collection. The mobile phone service charge would be covered by the research. No other&#xD;
      personal identifiers will be collected and no biological specimens will be collected at&#xD;
      baseline. The investigators will obtain informed consent before proceeding with any data&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 4:Health facilities training. For the purposes of this research study, the Nigerian&#xD;
      Institute of Medical Research team would provide training to youth-friendly health centers&#xD;
      currently working with the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research based on the World Health&#xD;
      Organization guidebook for youth-friendly health services (handbook is attached).The training&#xD;
      would be to ensure that these health facilities are trained to provide youth friendly&#xD;
      services to participants who be referred to receive STI screening, STI treatment and PrEP&#xD;
      awareness and initiation. Following the training, the NIMR research team would in charge of&#xD;
      collecting data to record record participants HIV self-testing uptake as well as uptake of&#xD;
      STI screening, STI treatment and PrEP awareness and initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 5: Follow up surveys at 3 and 6 months: At 3 and 6 months post intervention&#xD;
      implementation, study team will collect similar baseline data from study participants. The&#xD;
      follow-up survey will assess HIV testing, sexual behavior history, youth participation&#xD;
      experience and other related outcomes will be collected (survey questionnaire attached) from&#xD;
      recruited participants.&#xD;
