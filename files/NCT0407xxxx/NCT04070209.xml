      This is the first pilot phase II trial assessing the response of SBRT layered on Darolutamide&#xD;
      (BAY1841788) on RPFS and deferring palliative second line systemic therapy in M0CRPC with&#xD;
      oligoprogression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metastases-directed therapy with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is emerging as a&#xD;
      new treatment option for solid tumor patients with a limited number of metastases (&lt; 5) at&#xD;
      the time of recurrence/progression, so called oligoprogression therapy. As such,&#xD;
      oligoprogression is defined as prostate cancer patients with castration resistance and no&#xD;
      metastases (M0CRPC) who are receiving ADT and new generation hormonal therapy (enzalutamide,&#xD;
      apalutamide or darolutamide) as standard of care, and who are then progressing to&#xD;
      oligometastases. The new generation hormonal therapy used in this study will be darolutamide&#xD;
      (ODM-201). The rationale behind this approach has been to delay the start of palliative&#xD;
      systemic therapies that are most often toxic and associated with a negative impact on&#xD;
      patient's quality of life, as well as being more costly. However, to date, there are no&#xD;
      prospective published data or ongoing studies that are looking into non metastatic castration&#xD;
      resistant prostate cancer (M0CRPC) patients who progress to oligometastases&#xD;
      (oligoprogression). To this end, we are proposing this pilot phase II trial to assess the&#xD;
      impact of SBRT on radiological progression-free survival (RPFS) of M0CRPC patients who are&#xD;
      receiving darolutamide and progress to oligometastatic disease (oligoprogression).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate cancer patients with castration resistance and no metastases (M0CRPC) diagnosed by&#xD;
      bone scan and CT scan or MRI will be recruited in this phase II and initiate darolutamide&#xD;
      while continuing on ADT (Part 1 of the study). Patients who then progress to wide spread&#xD;
      metastases or metastases situated at locations not amenable to ablative therapy will be&#xD;
      excluded and treated with second line therapy as per the treating physician. Patients with&#xD;
      oligoprogression (&lt; 5 mets) and amenable to ablative therapy will be then treated with SBRT&#xD;
      or surgery as an ablative therapy if SBRT is not feasible (Part 2 of the study). All patients&#xD;
      will continue to receive non-interrupted LHRH agonist, PSA testing every 6-12 weeks and&#xD;
      re-imaging every 6 months. Imaging will also be repeated at the appearance of symptoms or at&#xD;
      PSA progression, whichever occurs first and this schedule continues until disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first pilot phase II trial assessing the response of SBRT layered on darolutamide&#xD;
      on RPFS and deferring palliative second line systemic therapy in M0CRPC with&#xD;
      oligoprogression. This phase II will consist of 66 M0CRPC patients treated with darolutamide,&#xD;
      of which we anticipate 48 will be eligible for SBRT.&#xD;
