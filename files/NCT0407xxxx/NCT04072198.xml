    <textblock>
      This is a multicentric single arm, open label trial. In this study patients candidated to a&#xD;
      first line of chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer will be treated with 8 cycles of&#xD;
      folfoxiri plus bevacizumab plus nivolumab followed by a maintenance with bevacizumab plus&#xD;
      nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who do not progress during chemotherapy phase will receive bevacizumab plus&#xD;
      nivolumab as maintenance therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or&#xD;
      patient/physician decision.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, multicentric phase II trial in which patients with&#xD;
      metastatic colorectal cancer RASm/BRAFm patients will receive nivolumab in combination with&#xD;
      FOLFOXIRI/Bevacizumab as first line chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study screening will take place within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment. At&#xD;
      screening, every patient must have local RAS/BRAF known status. A centralized review of&#xD;
      RAS/BRAF status will be performed during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be enrolled and begin treatment with FOLFOXIRI/bevacizumab plus&#xD;
      nivolumab every 2 weeks for 8 cycles followed by maintenance with bevacizumab plus nivolumab&#xD;
      every 2 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient/physician decision.&#xD;
      Bevacizumab will be administered intravenously at dose of 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Nivolumab&#xD;
      will be administered intravenously at flat dose of 240 mg every 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Folfoxiri will be administered as 165 mg/m2 intravenous infusion of irinotecan for 60 min,&#xD;
      followed by an 85 mg/m2 intravenous infusion of oxaliplatin given concurrently with&#xD;
      leucovorin at a dose of 200 mg/m2 for 120 min, followed by a 3200 mg/m2 continuous infusion&#xD;
      of fluorouracil for 48 h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study treatment period, patients will be followed for safety based on AE&#xD;
      assessments including vital signs, physical findings and clinical laboratory test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to guarantee the safety of the patients, the enrolment will be stopped when the 10th&#xD;
      patient will start treatment. An Independent Monitoring Committee will evaluate the safety&#xD;
      data of these patients and will decide if the study should be completed, amended or closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be evaluated by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1 every 8 weeks during&#xD;
      treatment and then every 3 months for 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study baseline tumor blocks will be centrally analysed to determinate inflammatory&#xD;
      infiltrate, MSI/MSS and PD-L1 status. The biological characterization and Tumor Mutation&#xD;
      Burden (TMB) will be also analysed centrally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following discontinuation of study treatment, safety assessments will be conducted 30 days&#xD;
      after the last study drug administration or until initiation of other anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
      (whichever occurs first). Thereafter, patients will be followed for disease progression&#xD;
      (unless this has already occurred), SAEs, anticancer therapy and survival. Follow-up will&#xD;
      continue for up to 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample will be collected for all patients at baseline, prior to cycle 5, at the end&#xD;
      of chemotherapy and at disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life will be assessed at baseline, every 4 weeks during treatment and study&#xD;
      discontinuation visit.&#xD;
