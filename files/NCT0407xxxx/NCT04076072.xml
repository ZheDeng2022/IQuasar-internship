      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficiency of the new Utravit High-Speed 10000&#xD;
      cpm Beveled Probe to the current standard vitrector probe- Alcon (non-beveled) Ultravit 7500&#xD;
      cpm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing the efficiency of the Ultravit&#xD;
      High-Speed Beveled Probe with the current Alcon vitrector probe in a cohort of patients&#xD;
      undergoing routine vitrectomy surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Advanced Ultravit high-speed beveled probe will show non-inferiority to the standard,&#xD;
      Alcon (non-beveled) Ultravit 7500 cpm with regards to time to completion of vitrectomy and&#xD;
      surgical outcomes.&#xD;

      High-speed beveled tip versus standard tip vitrectomy probe: a prospective randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Advanced Ultravit High-Speed Beveled Probe (Alcon) has a beveled-tip design that allows&#xD;
      the cutting port to come closer to the retina compared to the previous vitrectr probe design.&#xD;
      This allows the surgeon to maneuver in tight tissue planes and increases the functionality of&#xD;
      the vitrector probe. This in combination with the increased cut rate of 10,000 independent&#xD;
      cuts per minute reduces traction on the retina and increases efficiency of vitreous removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficiency of the new Utravit High-Speed 10000&#xD;
      cpm Beveled Probe to the current standard vitrector probe- Alcon (non-beveled) Ultravit 7500&#xD;
      cpm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing the efficiency of the Advanced&#xD;
      Ultravit High-Speed Beveled Probe with the current Alcon vitrector probe in a cohort of&#xD;
      patients undergoing routine vitrectomy surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Intraoperative efficiency of vitrectomy surgery regarding time to completion of core&#xD;
      vitrectomy and shave of vitreous base&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Intraoperative complications (e.g. iatrogenic retinal breaks, intraocular bleeding, retinal&#xD;
      detachment)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative complications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will not be sufficiently powered to assess safety. Surgeons will want to make sure&#xD;
      there is no significant increase in complications with a different probe. However, any post&#xD;
      operative complications would merely be an association, without any causality attributed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinically significant difference in time to completion of core vitrectomy and shave of&#xD;
      vitreous base between the two groups with 80% power at a 95% confidence interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A p-value of less than 0.05 will be deemed as statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation Target: 40 participants (20 in each cohort) Assuming an average core&#xD;
      vitrectomy time of 12 +/- 3 minutes, a sample size of at least 32 is needed to adequately&#xD;
      assess for a clinically significant difference between the two groups with 80% power at a 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval. A p-value of less than 0.05 will be deemed as statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures and Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo baseline testing in the study eye including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Best corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  intraocular pressure (IOP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  slit-lamp examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  360 degree indirect ophthalmoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      9 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of surgery, patients will be randomized to the Ultravit High-Speed Beveled Probe&#xD;
      or the current non-beveled Alcon Probe. All patients will undergo routine vitrectomy surgery&#xD;
      as scheduled; patients will be masked to the vitrector probe used. Time to completion of&#xD;
      vitrectomy and time to completion of vitreous base shave will be recorded by a masked timer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All examination will be repeated as regularly scheduled postoperative visits by a masked&#xD;
      reader.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed at each visit by evaluation for any adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and data storage will occur in RedCap. Patients will be randomized the day of&#xD;
      surgery. The randomization numbers will be generated using the following procedure to ensure&#xD;
      that treatment assignment is unbiased and concealed from patients and investigator staff. A&#xD;
      patient randomization list will be produced by the IRT provider using a validated system that&#xD;
      automates the random assignment of patient numbers to randomization numbers. These&#xD;
      randomization numbers are linked to the different treatment arms. The randomization scheme&#xD;
      for patients will be reviewed and approved by a member of the Randomization Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unique Patient identifier&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vision&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IOP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oculus sinister (Left Eye) /Ocular Dexter (Right Eye)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical Indication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to completion of vitrectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to completion of vitreous base shave&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Slit-lamp abnormalities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dilated Fundus Exam (DFE) abnormalities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post operation complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data collection April 2019 to Dec 2019&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data Analysis Jan 2020&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting of Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, and Unanticipated Problems Involving&#xD;
      Risk to Participants or Others will be reported to the Institutional Review Board (IRB)&#xD;
      pursuant to their policy as outlined under the VANDERBILT HUMAN RESEARCH PROTECTIONS PROGRAM&#xD;
      Policy III.L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk Minimization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization&#xD;
      (ICH) along with the Good Clinical Practices (GCP) guidelines and all applicable local and&#xD;
      U.S. federal regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to entry into the study or initiation of any study related procedures, the subject or&#xD;
      legal representative must read, sign, and date the current institutional review&#xD;
      board-approved version of the informed consent form. Fully informed consent or verbal consent&#xD;
      must be obtained from the subject or legal representative in accordance with local legal&#xD;
      requirements and IRB requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only potential subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in to this&#xD;
      protocol. The Principal Investigator will oversee all study procedures to ensure subject&#xD;
      safety and protocol compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk v. Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prospective subject will be carefully screened to ensure inclusion/exclusion criteria are&#xD;
      met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be no direct benefit to the subjects ;however, the knowledge gained from this study&#xD;
      may lead to improved methods of diagnosing, staging and managing Vitrectomy surgery in the&#xD;
      future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no specific ethnic or age group targeted or excluded.&#xD;
