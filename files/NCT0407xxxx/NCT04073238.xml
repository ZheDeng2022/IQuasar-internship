  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low level light therapy (LLLT) is an innovative and non-invasive therapeutic treatment for a&#xD;
      variety of eye diseases. Its potential mechanisms of improving choroidal metabolic rate and&#xD;
      circulation may improve scleral hypoxia, thus slowing down the progression of myopia. The&#xD;
      investigator's preliminary case-series study suggested that repeated low-level red-light&#xD;
      therapy was effective in slowing myopia progression without any clinically observable side&#xD;
      effects. Using a randomized clinical trial design, the purpose of this study is to determine&#xD;
      if repeated low-level red-light therapy can slow myopia progression in Chinese&#xD;
      schoolchildren. Study subjects will be randomly assigned to either the treatment group&#xD;
      (receive repeated low-level red-light therapy) or the control group (wearing ordinary single&#xD;
      vision lenses). Axial length and cycloplegic refraction will be monitored over one year (1st&#xD;
      month, 3rd month, 6th month and 12th month), after which changes in axial length and&#xD;
      refractive errors in the two groups will be compared. An interim analysis will be performed&#xD;
      at the 3rd month, at which the data will be reported and presented. Appropriate adjustment of&#xD;
      the p-value and decision on the continuation of the study will be made.&#xD;

    <measure>Axial length change (mm)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year</time_frame>

    <measure>Cycloplegic spherical equivalent change (Diopter)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Cycloplegic spherical equivalent change (Diopter, D) is characterized as the difference between each follow-up visit and baseline values. Cycloplegia is induced with one drop of Alcaine 0.5% followed by two drops of 1% cyclopentolate administered at 0, 5th to each eye. The third drop of cyclopentolate is used if the light reflex exists after 20 minute. The light reflex and pupil dilation is checked after an additional 15 minutes. Dilation and light reflex status is recorded and full cycloplegia is justified if the pupil dilates to 6 millimeters or greater and the light reflex is absent. Refraction is performed with an auto-refractor. The data on spherical and cylindrical power and axis is automatically extracted from the auto-refractor. The spherical equivalent power (D) is calculated as the spherical power (D) plus half of the cylindrical power (D).</description>

    <description>Visual acuity change is characterized as the difference between each follow-up visit and baseline values. An ETDRS chart (Precision vision, Villa Park, Illinois, USA) with standard illumination is used to measure distance visual acuity. Visual acuity measurement is performed at a distance of 4 meters. Uncorrected visual acuity is measured for all children.</description>
