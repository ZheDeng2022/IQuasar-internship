    <textblock>
      A better understanding of the impact of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) in the elderly, in terms&#xD;
      of brain damage, cognitive and motor functions, sleep quality and quality of life is&#xD;
      necessary due to the increasing incidence and prevalence of TBI in this population and its&#xD;
      high economic impact on society. Therefore, this study aims at describing the short-term&#xD;
      consequences of TBI by studying injury patterns, injury severity, risk profiles, brain&#xD;
      damage, co-morbidities, post-traumatic history, level of dependency, serum-based injury&#xD;
      biomarkers, cognitive and motor functions, sleep quality and quality of life 6 months after&#xD;
      TBI. All the obtained results will be integrated in a new prognostic tool for the course of&#xD;
      the outcomes of TBI in the elderly population.&#xD;

      In order to achieve the goals of the project, a cohort of 50 patients and 50 volunteers is&#xD;
      expected, and the following evaluations will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the patients group, after signing the informed consent form, a clinical data collection,&#xD;
      a serum-based injury biomarkers study, a brain damage assessment, a cognitive and motor&#xD;
      assessment, a sleep quality and a quality of life evaluation will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data collection: injury patterns, injury severity, co-morbidities and post-traumatic&#xD;
           history will be prospectively registered in our cohort of patients in order to study&#xD;
           which types of accidents are risky to result in poor outcome. This will be done through&#xD;
           the data collection in medical records of the patients. Advanced statistical methods,&#xD;
           such as Gaussian models, will be applied in order to find relations between input and&#xD;
           outcome to the best extent possible. In addition, injury mechanisms will be categorized&#xD;
           into classes with more or less similar magnitudes of force and acceleration inputs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum based injury biomarkers study: blood samples from our cohort, taken by UZ Leuven&#xD;
           nurses in the context of routine-clinical practice will be studied by the Laboratory for&#xD;
           Molecular Neurobiomarker Research in UZ Leuven, through Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent&#xD;
           Assay (ELISA). No data will be available for the control group. The results will be&#xD;
           compared to results previously obtained in the Laboratory for Molecular Neurobiomarker&#xD;
           Research from healthy patients with similar demographic characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT imaging: CT images performed in the context of routine clinical practice at admission&#xD;
           and follow up will be obtained from the hospital's database. The scans will be carefully&#xD;
           studied, using automated reports created by Icometrix and the Marshall Head Injury&#xD;
           Scale, in order to quantify brain damage. No data will be available for the control&#xD;
           group, so results will not be compared between both groups. These findings will be&#xD;
           related with the results obtained in the serum-based injury biomarkers study and&#xD;
           cognitive and motor assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Economic impact prospective analysis: hospital costs for the clinical management in our&#xD;
           cohort will be extracted from the financial database of UZ Leuven, in order to know what&#xD;
           is the economic impact that TBI in the elderly has on society.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1st evaluation session with the patient: 6 months after the injury, the patient will be&#xD;
           called back to UZ Leuven for evaluation.The protocol for this session will be done in 1&#xD;
           or 2 sessions, depending on the preferences of the patient, and will consist of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI: High-resolution T1 and T2 weighted imaging sequences will be used to study&#xD;
           volumetric and morphological changes in the brain. Moreover, Diffusion Tractography&#xD;
           Imaging (DTI) will be used to study changes in white matter. Susceptibility Weighted&#xD;
           Imaging (SWI) sequences will also be included in order to study axonal injuries and&#xD;
           microbleeds. One MRI scan will be obtained from each patient and the results will be&#xD;
           interpreted with the Icobrain TBI report, provided by Icometrix.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive assessment: the CANTAB test will be used to study cognitive functions after&#xD;
           TBI, as it is a validated and reliable computerized neuropsychological battery,&#xD;
           consisting of memory, learning, attention, problem solving and executive function test.&#xD;
           Moreover, the patients' level of education will be asked, registered and correlated with&#xD;
           the results obtained in our evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motor assessment: it will be performed using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Timed Up an&#xD;
           Go (TUG) test, Timed Up and Go with cognitive dual task (TUGcog) test, Box-and-block&#xD;
           test and a cycling test performed with a bicycle simulator created by the IMPAct group&#xD;
           (KU Leuven).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep quality assessment: the sleep quality in our cohort will be assessed using the&#xD;
           Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, in order to understand how TBI can affect the patients'&#xD;
           sleep patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life evaluation: the quality of life in our cohort will be assessed with the&#xD;
           Quality of Life after Brain Injury (QOLIBRI) tool, in the same session as cognitive and&#xD;
           motor outcomes, in order to understand how the quality of life is affected in the&#xD;
           elderly population after TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the results will be compared with the results obtained in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient chooses to have two evaluation sessions, instead of one, the first session&#xD;
      will be dedicated to the MRI scan and the second session will be dedicated to the cognitive,&#xD;
      motor, sleep quality and quality of life evaluation. Both sessions will be performed within&#xD;
      the same week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the control group, after signing the informed consent form MRI scans, a cognitive and&#xD;
      motor assessment, sleep quality and quality of life evaluation will be performed in this&#xD;
      group at the time of recruitment, in one or two sessions, depending on the preference of the&#xD;
      volunteer. All the assessments will be performed in University Hospitals Leuven and the&#xD;
      results will be compared with the patients group's results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI: High-resolution T1 and T2 weighted imaging sequences will be used to study&#xD;
           volumetric and morphological changes in the brain. Moreover, Diffusion Tractography&#xD;
           Imaging (DTI) will be used to study changes in white matter. Susceptibility Weighted&#xD;
           Imaging (SWI) sequences will also be included in order to study axonal injuries and&#xD;
           microbleeds . One MRI scan will be obtained from each volunteer and the results will be&#xD;
           interpreted with the Icobrain TBI report, provided by Icometrix, and compared with the&#xD;
           results obtained for the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive assessment: CANTAB test will be used to study cognitive functions in this&#xD;
           group, as it is a validated and reliable computerized neuropsychological battery,&#xD;
           consisting of memory, learning, attention, problem solving and executive function test.&#xD;
           Moreover, the volunteers level of education will be asked, registered and correlated&#xD;
           with the results obtained in our evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motor assessment: it will be performed using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Timed Up an&#xD;
           Go (TUG) test, Timed Up and Go with cognitive dual task (TUGcog) test, Box-and-block&#xD;
           test and a cycling test performed with a bicycle simulator created by the IMPAct group&#xD;
           (KU Leuven).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep quality assessment: the sleep quality in our cohort will be assessed using the&#xD;
           Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life evaluation: the quality of life in this group will be assessed with the&#xD;
           Quality of Life after Brain Injury (QOLIBRI) tool, in the same session as cognitive and&#xD;
           motor outcomes, in order to understand how the quality of life is affected in the&#xD;
           elderly population after TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the volunteer chooses to have two evaluation sessions, instead of one, the first session&#xD;
      will be dedicated to the MRI scan and the second session will be dedicated to the cognitive,&#xD;
      motor, sleep quality and quality of life evaluation. Both sessions will be performed within&#xD;
      the same week.&#xD;
