      The Mistral is an investigational device intended for percutaneous trans-catheter repair in&#xD;
      high risk for surgery individuals suffering from functional Tricuspid Regurgitation (TR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device system is to be used only in accordance with the approved Investigational Plan on&#xD;
      subjects who have signed an informed consent form. Device use is limited to the approved&#xD;
      study investigators.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study is designed to clinically demonstrate device acute safety and technical performance&#xD;
      (Primary Endpoints) along with longer FU device safety and effectiveness evaluation&#xD;
      (Secondary Endpoint).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of the study are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the Acute safety of the implanted Mistral device post procedure and at 30 day&#xD;
           follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the long term Safety of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demonstrate effectiveness of the Mistral device in reducing TR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety: Acute safety. Rate of device related SAE including device related mortality,&#xD;
           stroke, MI, cardiac tamponade, surgery for failed percutaneous repair and non-elective&#xD;
           cardiovascular surgery to treat an adverse event. At discharge and 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performance: Mistral Implantation rate of technical success (defined as successful&#xD;
           device implantation with grasped chords from at least two leaflets.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety: Safety at 3, 6 and 12 months. Rate of device related SAEs at 3, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effectiveness: TR reduction post-procedure, at discharge and 30 days, 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
           Improved NYHA class, 6MWTdistance and KCCQ (quality of life) at 30 days, 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevant only for patients 11-20:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety: Safety at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Rate of device related SAEs at 3, 6, 12 and 24&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effectiveness: TR reduction post-procedure, at discharge and 30 days, 3, 6, 12 and 24&#xD;
           months. Improved NYHA class, 6MWT distance and KCCQ (quality of Life) at 30 days, 3, 6,&#xD;
           12 and 24 months.&#xD;
