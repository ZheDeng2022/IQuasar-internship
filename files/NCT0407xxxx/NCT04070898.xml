      INTRODUCTION: Recommendations for peroperative bladder catheterization remain a controversial&#xD;
      issue since it is a procedure that is not without complications. Most of the current&#xD;
      suggestions derive from open surgery data that have been extrapolated to Enhanced Recovery&#xD;
      After Surgery (ERAS) or Fast-Track programs ranging between 24-48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the present study is to find the perfect balance with a better degree of&#xD;
      evidence than the current one between the reduction of the probing time and the non-increase&#xD;
      of the acute retention of urine in the patients operated in a programmed way of laparoscopic&#xD;
      colon surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Multicenter, prospective, controlled, randomized non-inferiority study on the&#xD;
      management of the bladder catheter in patients undergoing scheduled laparoscopic colon&#xD;
      surgery, randomized in two study groups: experimental group (removal of the bladder catheter&#xD;
      after surgery ) and control group (removal of the catheter at 24 hours) after the surgical&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the present study is to reduce the permanence of the bladder catheter&#xD;
      trying to find the balance of the probing time and the non-increase of the acute retention of&#xD;
      urine in the patients operated in a programmed way of laparoscopic colon surgery As secondary&#xD;
      objectives we will consider the decrease in the incidence of urinary tract infections within&#xD;
      the first 30 days as well as the reduction in hospital stay and morbidity related to the&#xD;
      bladder catheter.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION: The usual recommendations for a peroperative bladder catheter vary from&#xD;
      surgical reasons to the control of hemodynamics or personal preferences, so since it is not a&#xD;
      procedure free of complications, it requires an evidence-based approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For hospitalized patients, the optimal duration of bladder catheterization remains&#xD;
      controversial. For colorectal surgery, most authors traditionally suggested with limited&#xD;
      evidence, based mainly on open surgery data, 5 days with a range of 3 to 10 days, which meant&#xD;
      a significant increase in hospital stays associated with an increase of the risk of&#xD;
      complications (42-60% of urinary infections).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the introduction of the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) or Fast-Track programs of&#xD;
      minimally invasive surgery it has been shown that old concepts adopted by the inertia of the&#xD;
      custom were wrong and therefore the recommended duration of bladder catheterization has been&#xD;
      shortened with the aim of reducing the incidence of urinary tract infections without&#xD;
      significantly increasing acute urinary retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, European international guidelines recommend that bladder catheterization may be&#xD;
      limited to a period of 24-48 hours after scheduled colon and rectal interventions, except for&#xD;
      resections of the middle and lower rectum (with extensive perineal and rectal dissection)&#xD;
      that require the permanence of the bladder catheter for a longer period according to the&#xD;
      clinical indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical guidelines of the ASCRS (American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons) and the&#xD;
      SAGES (Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons) are even more&#xD;
      restrictive in the use of bladder catheterization in elective colon or upper rectum surgery,&#xD;
      recommending its withdrawal within 24 hours after it as they consider that at 48 hours the&#xD;
      risk of postoperative urinary tract infection has doubled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES AND OBJECTIVES Hypothesis: Although the ERAS guidelines recommend the removal of&#xD;
      the bladder catheter at 24 hours or 2-3 days, we believe that it can be removed earlier at&#xD;
      the end of surgery without detriment to the increase in acute retention of urine and with the&#xD;
      benefit of earlier mobilization and decreased morbidity related to the bladder catheter&#xD;
      (urine infection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is the assessment of the degree of acute retention of urine&#xD;
      after removal of the bladder catheter in colon surgery in the two study groups, control (24&#xD;
      h) and in the experimental group (once the surgical intervention ends ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As secondary objectives we will consider the decrease in the incidence of urinary tract&#xD;
      infections within the first 30 days as well as the reduction in hospital stay and morbidity&#xD;
      related to the bladder catheter. Urine culture samples will be collected if the patient&#xD;
      presents a clinic suggestive of urinary tract infection: dysuria, urinary frequency, urgency,&#xD;
      suprapubic pain, hematuria or testicular pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS / DESIGN Study design This protocol has been designed following the standards of the&#xD;
      SPIRIT statement and is a prospective, multicentre, controlled, randomized, non-inferiority&#xD;
      study on the management of the bladder catheter in scheduled laparoscopic colon surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria Any patient who understands, agrees to participate and signs the informed&#xD;
      consent, that is over 18 years old, operated electively and programmed by laparoscopic colon&#xD;
      and upper rectum in which the peritoneal reflection has not been opened, will be included in&#xD;
      the study. with a duration of the surgical act less than 180 minutes. The previous anesthetic&#xD;
      assessment will be of an ASA I-III and should have an international prostate symptom score&#xD;
      (IPSS) of less than 19 with / without treatment for BPH (alpha-blocker).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Open surgery or conversion to open surgery; performing periodic anesthesia&#xD;
      or being ASA IV; preoperative diagnosis of urinary tract infections (more than 3 episodes /&#xD;
      year documented by urinoculture or two urinary tract infections in the last 6 months);&#xD;
      moderate-severe prostate clinic (IPSS&gt; 19); in men, the presence of positive urine culture in&#xD;
      preoperative tests; in women, the urinary infection clinic and the positive urine culture.&#xD;
      The previous history of acute urine retention will also be grounds for exclusion from the&#xD;
      study; be a carrier of a permanent bladder catheter or ureteral catheter and intermittent&#xD;
      self-catheterization. Men who have undergone prostatic deobstructive surgery (Holep, RTUp,&#xD;
      Millin or prostatic vaporization) will not be included; patients with a history of treatment&#xD;
      for urological tumor (prostate cancer, bladder tumor, ureteral or renal tumor); or have a&#xD;
      history of urethral stricture, enterovesical fistula or previous pelvic surgery. Other&#xD;
      reasons for exclusion will be urinary incontinence or neurogenic bladder; chronic renal&#xD;
      failure (CRF) with creatinine levels greater than 2 (including terminal CRI stage or&#xD;
      dialysis); emergency surgery, pregnant women, having received pelvic radiotherapy or the&#xD;
      administration of suerotherapy during the operative time&gt; 2,000ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study withdrawal criteria The difficulty / impossibility of intraoperative catheterization,&#xD;
      urethral bleeding / hematuria after traumatic catheterization or the need for suprapubic&#xD;
      cystostomy placement; the patient who is under active antibiotic treatment due to urinary&#xD;
      tract infection at the time of surgery; the need for intraoperative ureteral catheter&#xD;
      placement; the need for 24-hour diuresis monitoring by bladder catheterization, the&#xD;
      combination with other surgeries (hysterectomy, prostatectomy, etc.), Clavien post-surgical&#xD;
      complications&gt; 2 (need to take a probe longer than expected); intraoperative urinary tract&#xD;
      injury or the need for peridural anesthesia in the immediate postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preoperative evaluation in men will include an IPSS questionnaire and a urine culture as&#xD;
      its positivity will mean exclusion from the study. It will also be evaluated if you take&#xD;
      medication for BPH. In women, a urine culture will be performed in case of presenting a&#xD;
      urinary infection clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and scope of the study Patients will be recruited from colorectal surgery units&#xD;
      of hospitals participating in the study following the same criteria.&#xD;
