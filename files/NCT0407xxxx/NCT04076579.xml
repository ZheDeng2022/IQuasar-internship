  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well trabectedin and olaparib work in treating patients with&#xD;
      sarcoma that cannot be removed by surgery or has spread to other places in the body. Drugs&#xD;
      used in chemotherapy, such as trabectedin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells, either by killing cells, stopping them from dividing or stopping them from spreading.&#xD;
      Olaparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking pathways responsible for repairing&#xD;
      damaged cells. Giving trabectedin and olaparib may shrink or stop the tumor from growing.&#xD;
