  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether Lofstrand or axillary crutches are better&#xD;
      suited to treat mobility impairments and improve physical activity levels in rural,&#xD;
      resource-limited, settings like the Northern Region of Malawi. To do this, we are proposing&#xD;
      the implementation of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to measure and compare the physical&#xD;
      activity and satisfaction of mobility aid recipients sorted into two groups - one receiving a&#xD;
      set of Lofstrand crutches (Group 1) and the other a set of axillary crutches (Group 2).&#xD;
      Changes in physical activity, disability, and life satisfaction levels will measured with a&#xD;
      follow-up data collection period conducted one year after the distribution of the devices.&#xD;

      STAGE 1 - BASELINE DATA COLLECTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Potential participants will be identified at outreach clinics in the Mzimba, Rumphi, and&#xD;
           Nkhata Bay Districts for participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Potential participants will take the Washington Group Extended Set Questions on&#xD;
           Disability (WGES) and those that meet a baseline level of disability/mobility impairment&#xD;
           - validated by physiotherapist opinion - are invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  100 or more participants (50+ per group) who fulfill the inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
           selected for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete a Demographic Survey to determine their age, gender, health&#xD;
           barriers, social determinants of health etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) to&#xD;
           determine a baseline of their physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete the PROMIS Satisfaction with Participation in Social Roles -&#xD;
           Short Form 8a (SPSR) and General Life Satisfaction (Ages 18+) - Fixed Form A (GLS)&#xD;
           questionnaires to determine a baseline of their overall life satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment groups will be randomized through the use of randomization envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Selected devices, as determined in the randomization process, will be distributed to&#xD;
           participants in each treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The addresses/villages of residences of selected participants will be recorded and&#xD;
           marked manually on a detailed satellite map. A list of study participants will be&#xD;
           provided to the local Health Surveillance Assistant (HSA) for record keeping and&#xD;
           monitoring purposes. (HSAs have intimate knowledge of the communities they serve and&#xD;
           will be useful partners to help find participants in the follow-up stages of the trial.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE 2 - ONE-YEAR FOLLOW-UP DATA COLLECTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be located using the assistance of the local HSA, address records, and&#xD;
           map markings from Stage 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete follow-up SPSR, GLS, WGES and GPAQ questionnaires, and will&#xD;
           complete the Crutch Satisfaction Survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reports of missing and damaged crutches will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE 3 - DATA ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two study groups will be compared using the following metrics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stratified by level of disability based on Washington Group Extended Set Questions on&#xD;
           Disability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in GLS and SPSR scores between baseline and follow-up data collection will be&#xD;
           used to determine changes in participants' overall life satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in Global Physical Activity Questionnaire scores between baseline and follow-up&#xD;
           data collection will be used to determine changes in participants' mobility impairments&#xD;
           and day-to-day activity levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scores from the Crutch Satisfaction Survey will be used determine participants'&#xD;
           subjective experiences with their respective mobility devices.&#xD;
