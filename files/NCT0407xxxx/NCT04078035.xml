  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to conduct a crossover experimental trial examining physiological&#xD;
      responses to a socio-evaluative speech task under laboratory conditions. Participants will&#xD;
      attend two laboratory sessions. At one session participants will take part in a brief&#xD;
      laboratory stress task and at the other participants will rest for the same period. Measures&#xD;
      of cardiovascular response will be assessed at both sessions. In addition, blood will be&#xD;
      drawn at multiple time points across a 125 minute period to assess changes in circulating&#xD;
      levels of cortisol, catecholamines, markers of inflammation and cell free mitochondrial DNA&#xD;
      in response to the task. The investigators expect that the stress task will induce a specific&#xD;
      increase in ccf-mtDNA, which will statistically mediate subsequent peak circulating&#xD;
      Interleukin-6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor-Î± levels. In secondary analyses, the investigators&#xD;
      will examine whether stress-induced increases in circulating cortisol, epinephrine, and&#xD;
      norepinephrine levels correlate with increases in ccf-mtDNA. These studies will establish the&#xD;
      kinetics and magnitude of psychological stress-induced ccf-mtDNA release, the association&#xD;
      with early stress mediators, and whether ccf-mtDNA mediates the inflammatory response to&#xD;
      acute stress in humans.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will examine physiologic responses to acute psychological challenge in the&#xD;
      laboratory among healthy adults. It is widely accepted that there is an increase in&#xD;
      circulating markers of inflammation following a single bout of laboratory stress. This&#xD;
      increase in systemic inflammation is believed to contribute to the damaging health effect of&#xD;
      psychological stress. However, to date, the biological mechanisms by which psychological&#xD;
      stress is transduced into inflammation are unclear. The investigators' preliminary evidence&#xD;
      suggests that mitochondrion may play a role, with stress-induced increases in circulating&#xD;
      levels of mitochondria- derived signaling molecules that are known to modulate immune cell&#xD;
      function and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this possibility, the investigators plan to conduct a crossover experimental trial&#xD;
      examining physiological responses to an evaluative speech task under laboratory conditions.&#xD;
      The investigators have previously used this task to induce physiological arousal. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to recruit 60 non-smoking volunteers (50% female, aged 20-50 years) and&#xD;
      test these participants on two occasions separated by at least a month. On one occasion the&#xD;
      participants will be exposed to the speech task. On the other occasion, the participants will&#xD;
      rest quietly for the same period. Conditions will be counterbalanced. At both visits&#xD;
      cardiovascular responses (heart rate, blood pressure, and heart rate variability) will be&#xD;
      assessed as measures of autonomic activation before, during and after the task period.&#xD;
      Participants will also have an intravenous catheter inserted and blood drawn at ten time&#xD;
      points over the two hour testing period on each occasion. Blood samples will be sent to&#xD;
      laboratories at the University of Pittsburgh and at Columbia University for the assessment of&#xD;
      mitochondria-derived signalling molecules, inflammatory markers, and cortisol levels.&#xD;
