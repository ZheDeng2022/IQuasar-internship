  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent brains undergo rapid and significant changes in structural architecture and&#xD;
      functional organization during development. A concussive injury during this developmental&#xD;
      period can have substantial physiological and cognitive ramifications. If not adequately&#xD;
      managed, adolescent concussions can have profound long-term effects. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to determine whether ketone supplementation after a concussion will reduce long-term&#xD;
      consequences and improve short-term functional status and outcomes in adolescents who have&#xD;
      suffered a concussion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized design, study participants (n=30) will take a supplement 3 times per day&#xD;
      for 14 days and will be followed throughout completion of the concussion protocol, up to one&#xD;
      year. The initial visit (pre-experimental visit) will serve to obtain informed consent,&#xD;
      anthropometric information, a 24-hour dietary recall, health and lifestyle questionnaire, and&#xD;
      circulating metabolites. Randomization will also occur at the initial visit and will be done&#xD;
      by a computer to determine each participant's group assignment. Unless otherwise specified,&#xD;
      follow up visits (experimental visits) will involve an identical clinical protocol as&#xD;
      described below. The following are clinical tests that will be conducted during study visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Visit: Participants will arrive to the Concussion Clinic in the Sports Medicine&#xD;
      Clinic at Children's of Alabama for their routine initial visit. Participants will be&#xD;
      provided with the study protocol, the purpose of the study, and routine and potential risks&#xD;
      associated with the study procedures. Participants will then fill out the informed&#xD;
      consent/assent, health and lifestyle questionnaire, and 24-hour dietary recall. As part of&#xD;
      standard of care, height and weight will be measured using a stadiometer, body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI) will be calculated, circulating metabolites will be collected, and resting blood&#xD;
      pressure will be measured using a standard blood pressure cuff and a stethoscope. The SCAT5&#xD;
      will be conducted by a licensed healthcare professional. For research-specific purposes, body&#xD;
      composition will be measured using BIA, C3Logix evaluation will be conducted by trained&#xD;
      research personnel, and MRI scans will be taken. Participants will then be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to 1 of 2 experimental groups and the appropriate supplement will be provided. Participants&#xD;
      will also be provided with information regarding Return-to-Play progression and documents to&#xD;
      track Return-to-Learn, supplement compliance, and GI distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Visits: Participants will arrive to the Concussion Clinic in the Sports Medicine&#xD;
      Clinic at Children's of Alabama for their routine follow up visits. Participants will fill&#xD;
      out the 24-hour dietary recall. As part of standard of care, height and weight will be&#xD;
      measured using a stadiometer, body mass index (BMI) will be calculated, circulating&#xD;
      metabolites will be collected, and resting blood pressure will be measured using a standard&#xD;
      blood pressure cuff and a stethoscope. The SCAT5 will be conducted by a licensed healthcare&#xD;
      professional. For research-specific purposes, body composition will be measured using BIA and&#xD;
      C3Logix evaluation will be conducted by trained research personnel. Data collection sheets&#xD;
      for the Return-to-Learn Progression, supplement compliance, and GI distress will be&#xD;
      collected. If applicable, data collection sheets for the Return-to-Play Progression will be&#xD;
      collection. Supplement compliance and GI distress will only be collected at follow up visit&#xD;
      #1. Return-to-Learn Progression will be evaluated at each visit until completion of the&#xD;
      Return-to-Learn Protocol.&#xD;

    <measure>Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in SCAT5 from Baseline to 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>SCAT5 is a standardized tool, not a diagnostic tool, physicians can use for assessing concussions. It will be conducted by a licensed healthcare professional as part of standard of care to obtain numerical values for the following: immediate or on-field assessment (red flags, accident details, etc.), symptom evaluation (dizziness, headache, etc.), cognitive screen (memory, concentration), and neurological screen (balance, coordination). This will be conducted when the concussion occurs and at each clinic visit, irrespective of how much time has passed since the concussion.</description>

    <measure>C3 Logix System</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in C3 Logix from Baseline to 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The computer-based system includes the Graded Symptoms Checklist and Neurological Evaluations. This system is used to assess baseline neurological responses. For assessment, a belt with an iPad holder is affixed to the participant's waist and an iPad is clipped in. Neuro-motor function, balance, and vestibular function are evaluated visual acuity and information processing are assessed. It takes an average of 12 minutes for each athlete to complete the assessment.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in MRI from Baseline to 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>MRI is a noninvasive, routine diagnostic imaging modality that uses a large magnet, radio waves and a computer to produce 2- and 3-dimensional images of the brain. The adolescent will be placed head first into a cylindrical machine that houses a large, tube-shaped magnet that provides a strong magnetic field, so that a radiofrequency coil can image the brain. The magnetic field, along with applied radiofrequency waves, temporarily alters the alignment of hydrogen protons found in water molecules within the body. Computers construct the images based on the radiofrequency signals emitted by the protons.</description>

    <measure>Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA)</measure>
    <time_frame>The participant will be assessed at baseline (&lt;7 days post-SRC), 14 days, and 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>BIA is a non-invasive technique from which total body composition will be measured.

Data from diet recalls will be entered into diet analysis software and examined for total calories, carbohydrate, protein, fat, and select vitamins related to ketone and brain metabolism. Detailed printouts of nutrient intake will be compared to written entries by another member of the research team to identify errors in entry and ensure accurate data entry.</description>
