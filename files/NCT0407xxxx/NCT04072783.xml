  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Context: Craniosynostosis is a common craniofacial abnormality which can be associated with&#xD;
      various clinical syndromes. Though it has been established that children with&#xD;
      craniosynostosis score lower on certain developmental tests, the effect of craniosynostosis&#xD;
      and cranioplasty surgery on the neural circuitry and brain development is less well known or&#xD;
      understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The purpose of this study is to describe the effect of cranial vault remodeling&#xD;
      in children with craniosynostosis on white matter tracts with tractography and Diffusion&#xD;
      tensor imaging (DTI), functional MRI, and neurodevelopmental tests, before and after surgery&#xD;
      as compared to age-matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This will be a prospective study of patients diagnosed with craniosynostosis&#xD;
      and who are going to have open or endoscopic cranial vault remodeling (CVR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Measures: The study will measure MRI sequences before and after surgery and at set time&#xD;
      intervals to quantify the effect of white matter tract maturity. Parallel to this,&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental tests will be administered at these same intervals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Craniosynostosis, the premature ossification and fusion of one or more cranial sutures, is a&#xD;
      common craniofacial abnormality occurring in 1 of 2,000 live births. 1 2 Craniosynostosis can&#xD;
      lead to increased intra-cranial pressure in between 12-50% of those affected which may have&#xD;
      delayed neuro developmental implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The crucial neurodevelopment occurs in the first years of life and is most rapidly&#xD;
      progressing during the first year of life. Premature closure of the cranial sutures decrease&#xD;
      the intracranial volume and space available for the rapidly developing brain. Cranial vault&#xD;
      remodeling (CVR) is the current standard of care to mitigate any possible developmental delay&#xD;
      secondary to craniosynostosis and also improve the head shape. CVR is a combined surgery&#xD;
      between the neurosurgeon who takes off the cranial bone/bones, and the craniofacial surgeon&#xD;
      who assists and reconstructs the cranium with absorbable plates and screws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, although there is no doubt that there is an improvement in head shape, the&#xD;
      craniofacial skeleton and the soft tissues, but there is less data, and virtually no&#xD;
      functional imaging information available addressing the effect of CVR surgery on the growing&#xD;
      brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this project would be to begin to explore the relationship of CVR and&#xD;
      it requisite effects on the growing brain with a cohort of patients who are set to undergo&#xD;
      CVR, while performing a battery of neurodevelopmental and imaging studies pre- and&#xD;
      post-operatively and compare with normative controls. This is one part of a three-center&#xD;
      study collaborating with craniofacial units at Yale University and Wake Forest University in&#xD;
      which similar, if not identical protocols will be carried out. We hope that analyses of these&#xD;
      data will provide better insight into and greater definition of the effect of CVR and the&#xD;
      secondarily available increase in intra-cranial volume on the growing brain in the clinical&#xD;
      setting of craniosynostosis.&#xD;

    <description>Will quantify the change in white matter tract organization after cranial vault remodeling (CVR) surgery in patients with craniosynostosis by analyzing pre- and post-operative DTI data. This experimental cohort will also be examined in comparison to age-matched controls, pooled with other centers and compared with published data sets of normal babies from the Baby Connectome Project. . The imaging will be repeated at three intervals after surgery leading up to approximately 4 years of age.</description>

    <description>Patients will undergo testing with Pre- and and post-surgical MRI. The protocol will be Sagittal T1, Axial inversion recovery, T2, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, susceptibility weighted image, diffusion weighted images, diffusion tensor imaging, resting state fMRI, sagittal 3D GRE / FFE or 3D T1 VIBE and tractography.&#xD;
Once patients are identified, surgery is planned.The standard of care procedures fall into two categories based on age of presentation, clinician judgement and family preference all other things being equal. Both the endoscopic-assisted craniectomy and open CVR are standard of care procedures. Patients self-select into these groups. None of the surgery nor any aspect of it is experimental.&#xD;
Patients are routinely examined for neurodevelopment pre- and post-operatively as part of American Cleft Palate Craniofacial Association guidelines.The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales are used up to and including age 4.</description>
