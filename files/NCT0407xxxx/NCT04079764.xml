  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One third of individuals aged &gt;60 years will be diagnosed with at least one renal cyst&#xD;
      following abdominal imaging. These cystic lesions are categorized according to the Bosniak&#xD;
      classification which categorizes cysts according to their degree of complexity and risk of&#xD;
      malignancy. Growing evidence suggests that a significant proportion of Bosniak III and IV&#xD;
      cysts are benign and that the malignant ones present low metastatic potential. Since renal&#xD;
      surgery carries substantial morbidity (20%) and potential mortality (0.5%), active&#xD;
      surveillance has gained attention as a potential tradeoff to surgery to overcome&#xD;
      overtreatment. Therefore, prospective studies of long-term follow-up are needed to confirm&#xD;
      the oncologic outcomes of this strategy for Bosniak III/IV cysts. We first designed a pilot&#xD;
      study that will assess the feasibility of a subsequent larger multicenter observational study&#xD;
      aiming to ascertain mid-term safety of active surveillance. The objectives of this pilot&#xD;
      study are a) Determining patients and urologists buy-in and barriers to the proposed&#xD;
      intervention; b) Collecting perceptions and concerns of patients and urologists; c)&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN - This is a two-arm multicenter prospective observational pilot study where&#xD;
      patients with Bosniak III or IV choosing either active surveillance or surgery will be&#xD;
      monitored closely. OBJECTIVES - PRIMARY Validate the feasibility issues (acceptability,&#xD;
      recruitment rate, costs, protocol adherence and implementation of imaging central review) of&#xD;
      an observational study on the treatments of complex cysts. SECONDARY a- Validate the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria in regard to the feasibility of the study; b- Validate the&#xD;
      triggers for discontinuation of AS in terms of feasibility and safety for the patients.&#xD;
      POPULATION - For the pilot study, the intended targeted population will be patients&#xD;
      incidentally diagnosed with a Bosniak III or IV cysts and who opted to be managed by either&#xD;
      surgery or active surveillance. METHODOLOGY - Upon written consent, patients will be&#xD;
      explained the followup scheme which will consist of a semi-annual visits for 1 year. To mimic&#xD;
      the upcoming larger study and to evaluate visit feasibility issues, the baseline and the&#xD;
      follow-up visits will consist of the following items: blood results, CT-scan result, quality&#xD;
      of life questionnaires and medical data. Baseline (prior to study entry) and follow-up&#xD;
      abdominal imaging (CT/MRI) suspicious for progression will be reviewed centrally by an&#xD;
      interventional radiologist at the CIUSSSE-CHUS, to confirm Bosniak classification.&#xD;
