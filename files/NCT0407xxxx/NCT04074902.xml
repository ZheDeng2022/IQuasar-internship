  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) imposes a significant burden on patients and health-care&#xD;
      providers. Most of the malignant pleural effusions are the result of metastases to the pleura&#xD;
      from other sites. The primary tumors were, in the decreasing order of frequency: lung (37%),&#xD;
      breast (17%), unknown site (10%), lymphoma (9%), gastrointestinal (8%), ovary (7%) and&#xD;
      mesothelioma (3%) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of malignant effusions depends on palliation of dyspnea and prevention of the re&#xD;
      accumulation of pleural fluid to provide the highest possible quality of life, regardless of&#xD;
      the need for other treatment modalities. Most patients require definitive treatment, usually&#xD;
      drainage and chemical pleurodesis to relieve symptoms and prevent fluid recurrence.&#xD;
      Pleurodesis is defined as the symphysis between the visceral and parietal pleural surfaces;&#xD;
      its function is to prevent accumulation of either air or fluid into the pleural space.&#xD;
      Effusions of malignant origin are the most common indication for pleurodesis Thoracic&#xD;
      ultrasound (TUS) can easily visualize pleural effusions and help in identifying malignant&#xD;
      effusion and the presence of pleural adhesions or thick pleural peel and could therefore have&#xD;
      a role in predicting long-term pleurodesis success or failure in MPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the easiest sign to identify during chest sonography is the movement of the visceral&#xD;
      pleura compared to immobility of the parietal pleura. This sign of 'pleural sliding', firstly&#xD;
      described in veterinary medicine and was used to exclude the presence of pneumothorax when&#xD;
      present and to suspect atelectasis, fibrosis or pleural adhesions (pleurodesis) when absent.&#xD;
      Thoracic ultrasonography easily detects the sign of 'pleural sliding', due to the movement of&#xD;
      the visceral pleura on the parietal pleura This sign is absent when pleurodesis is&#xD;
      successful. Contrast-enhanced chest CT has become the imaging modality of choice to detect&#xD;
      pleural effusions and assist the differentiation between benign andmalignant effusions&#xD;
      detected bystandard radiographs. Chest CT findings characteristic of malignant pleural&#xD;
      disease include (i) circumferential pleural thickening, (ii) nodular pleural thickening,&#xD;
      (iii) parietal pleural thickening greater than 1 cm, and (iv) mediastinal pleural involvement&#xD;
      or evidence of a primary tumour.(9'10) The reported specificities of each of these individual&#xD;
      findings range from 22% to 56% and sensitivities range from 88% to 100%.(9;11) Histological&#xD;
      confirmation of the diagnosis, however, remains necessary. Chest CT should be performed&#xD;
      before large-volume thoracocentesis to allow visualization of both the visceral and parietal&#xD;
      pleurae, which may identify a pleural mass and appropriate site for needle biopsy.&#xD;
