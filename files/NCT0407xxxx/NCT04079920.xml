  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 24-month, prospective, non-interventional, multi-center study with primary aim to&#xD;
      identify baseline characteristics of patients that predict response at 6 months of treatment.&#xD;
      The study also aims to describe the treatment patterns of RA patients prescribed tofacitinib&#xD;
      in a real-world setting and assess the effect of treatment on patient quality of life and&#xD;
      physical function. Finally the study will assess the use of healthcare resources and costs in&#xD;
      patients with RA treated with tofacitinib in Greece.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned recruitment period is 12 months. The planned observation period of each patient&#xD;
      is 12 months. In this time period up to 4 visits will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be reviewed and approved by the Central Regulatory Committee for NIS and IRB&#xD;
      Board of each participating site&#xD;
