  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The amount of change of European League Against Rheumatism Sjögren's syndrome disease activity(ESSDAI) score compared to the baseline at week 24.</measure>
    <time_frame>week 24</time_frame>
    <description>ESSDAI= European League Against Rheumatism Sjögren's syndrome disease activity index score.The ESSDAI includes It includes 12 domains (ie, organ systems: cutaneous,respiratory, renal, articular, muscular，peripheral nervous system (PNS), central nervous system (CNS), haematological, glandular,constitutional,lymphadenopathic,biological).. Each domain is divided into 3-4 levels of activity.The higher the score, the more serious the symptoms ,that is,the worse the results.Subscales are combined by summed.</description>

    <measure>The amount of change of European League Against Rheumatism Sjögren'sSyndrome Patient Reported Index(ESSPRI) score compared to the baseline at week 12 and week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>week 12，24</time_frame>
    <description>European League Against Rheumatism Sjögren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index.Dryness, pain, somatic and mental fatigue were identified as the main symptoms of patients with primary SS. It was suspected that a single 0-10 numerical scale for each domain was sufficient to assess these symptoms.The higher values represent a worse outcome.Subscales are combined by averaged.</description>

    <measure>Doctors assess overall changes in disease activity relative to baseline at week 12 and week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>week 12,24</time_frame>

    <measure>Changes in short form(SF)-36 relative to baseline at week 12 and week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>week 12,24</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36=36-item short form. As a concise health questionnaire, SF-36 summarized the quality of life of the subjects from eight aspects: physiological function, physical pain, general health condition, energy, social function, emotional function and mental health.The SF-361 is a self-report, 36 item survey measuring health-related quality-of-life. Thirty-five items are used to construct 8 scales. An additional item measures health transition.The higher values represent a better outcome.Subscales are combined by averaged.</description>

    <time_frame>week 12,24</time_frame>
    <description>Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory.The MFI is a 20-item scale designed to evaluate fi ve dimensions of fatigue: general fatigue, physical fatigue, reduced motivation,reduced activity, and mental fatigue.The higher values represent a worse outcome,Subscales are combined by summed.</description>
