    <textblock>
      Despite the intensive worldwide research dedicated to the nutrition and faecal microbiota,&#xD;
      the studies that follow the link between the early nutrition, initial intestinal microbiota,&#xD;
      and development of children over a longer time period are limited. From 2010 to 2013, the&#xD;
      investigators conducted a study &quot;My-Milk&quot; in Slovenia. From 185 participating pregnant women&#xD;
      involved in the detailed part of the protocol (comprising of 4-days weighed dietary record,&#xD;
      visits at clinic and biological sample collection), 152 participants completed the study at&#xD;
      the child's first year of age. Five of the participants bore twins whose data was excluded&#xD;
      from the research because infant's identity was not consistently followed throughout the&#xD;
      research. In addition to studying the microbiota and fatty acid composition of breast milk&#xD;
      and the initial development of intestinal microbiota of breastfed babies, the investigators&#xD;
      also monitored the diet of expecting and nursing participants, concentration of vitamin D in&#xD;
      serum and bone mineral density in participating mothers and children. The investigators&#xD;
      performed anthropometric measurements of children during the first year of age. All singleton&#xD;
      children who have completed My-Milk study (N= 147) will be invited in the follow-up study&#xD;
      &quot;My-Milk-2&quot;. The first step of the proposed study will be the evaluation of nutritional&#xD;
      status of children aged 6 to 7 years in 2017/2018, including the assessment of the body&#xD;
      composition (bone density, percentage of fat and muscle tissue), health indicators (blood&#xD;
      pressure, blood cholesterol, frequency and severity of infections) and fecal microbiota. The&#xD;
      obtained data of My-Milk and My-Milk-2 studies will enable the prospective cohort study to be&#xD;
      carried out on the effects of early nutrition and various factors of mother and child during&#xD;
      the first year of age on the health and developmental status of children aged 6- 7 years. The&#xD;
      project results will significantly improve the progress in research areas of public health&#xD;
      and nutrition. The interactions along the axis nutrition in early childhood, gut microbiota&#xD;
      composition/ diversity and potential health problems in later life are still not fully&#xD;
      explored. The investigators expect the results of the proposed study will contribute to the&#xD;
      scientific development in this field in global prospective. The acquired information will&#xD;
      also be an excellent basis for development of new dietary guidelines for children.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nutrition can act either as a risk or protective factor in the development of a series of&#xD;
      non-communicable diseases. While such effects were established for the whole life cycle, the&#xD;
      nutrition in early life may be particularly relevant for its long-term impact on later life&#xD;
      health. The reliable scientific data on dietary intakes and nutritional status of the&#xD;
      representing sample population serve as a basis to elucidate the role, the specific&#xD;
      nutritional factors exert on human health. The scientific background of the proposed&#xD;
      applicative research project is based on the fact that the studies, following the link&#xD;
      between the early nutrition, initial intestinal microbiota, and development of children, over&#xD;
      a longer time period, are limited. Therefore, the key scientific challenges addressed are&#xD;
      focused on the effects of the early life nutrition on growth and health of participating&#xD;
      children, and to investigate the relationship among various markers of health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the work programme of this multidisciplinary applicative prospective study will be&#xD;
      focused onto children, it shall be tightly linked to former &quot;My-Milk&quot; project (SRA J43606;&#xD;
      finished in the year 2013), where the role of early nutrition in the development of breast&#xD;
      fed children and their intestinal microbiota, during the first year of life, was&#xD;
      investigated. This study will be conducted within the population of 6-7 years olds included&#xD;
      in the first &quot;My-Milk&quot; study. The study will characterize the key modifying factors during&#xD;
      participant's early life (defined through maternal variables (BMI before pregnancy, weight&#xD;
      gain during pregnancy, nutrition during pregnancy and lactation, fatty acid composition of&#xD;
      human milk, and vitamin D concentration in serum) and infant variables (duration of&#xD;
      breastfeeding and antibiotic treatments, faecal microbiota at first month, anthropometrics&#xD;
      and bone mineral density in the neonatal period)) on participant's nutritional status at the&#xD;
      age 6-7 years. The current nutritional status will be defined by participant's dietary&#xD;
      intakes, anthropometrics, body composition - bone density, percentage of fat and muscle&#xD;
      tissue), health (blood pressure, blood cholesterol, frequency and severity of infections),&#xD;
      and fecal microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population invited to participate will include all singleton children of mothers&#xD;
      who completed the detailed part of the My-Milk study at child's first year of age (N=147).&#xD;
      Considering a very low drop-out rate in the first detailed part of the study My-Milk (33&#xD;
      participating mothers out of 185, approximately 18 percent), investigators expect that at&#xD;
      least 70-75 percentage of the invited participants will respond, meaning between 100 - 110&#xD;
      children may get enrolled in the study. This population will represent 0,5 percentage of&#xD;
      children born in 2011 (21947 children - statistical data for Slovenia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters will be measured and evaluated: the nutrition of children by using&#xD;
      the standard dietary assessment methodology for children and adults/elderly population as&#xD;
      provided in the European Food Safety Authority guidance (EFSA). Namely, the food consumption&#xD;
      survey will be carried out on the individual level by repeated 24-h food diary and Computer&#xD;
      Assisted Personal/Telephone Interview method (CAPI/CATI) and by supporting General&#xD;
      Questionnaire and the Food Propensity Questionnaire (FPQ) according to PANCAKE - Pilot study&#xD;
      for the Assessment of Nutrient intake and Food Consumption Among Kids in Europe. The 24-h&#xD;
      structured diet recall interview is a quantitative research method used in the nutritional&#xD;
      assessment. A trained dietitian investigator will ask a parent or caretaker to recall all&#xD;
      foods and drinks that the participating child consumed during the previous 24 hours at two&#xD;
      different time points during the study (non-consecutive days at least 8 - 20 days between the&#xD;
      two records) to receive the proper information about the habitual intake of foods. From the&#xD;
      data obtained by 24-h recall investigators intend to evaluate nutritional intakes of the&#xD;
      population sub-groups. In addition, connections between the nutrition of children and body&#xD;
      composition and health markers will be studied. FPQ will enable the estimation of certain&#xD;
      relevant, infrequently consumed food groups. Data will be collected using validated&#xD;
      questionnaires using computer -assisted data collection methods and processing. Evaluation of&#xD;
      the dietary intake data will be performed by dietary software Open Platform for Clinical&#xD;
      Nutrition (OPEN) by Jožef Stefan Institute (IJS). OPEN is a web-based application for dietary&#xD;
      assessment and treatment as well as upgraded to support the 24h -recall/food diary method and&#xD;
      FPQs in line with the EFSA pan-European food consumption survey, also known as the EU Menu,&#xD;
      methodology. OPEN is an efficient, first Slovenian web-based tool for dietary assessment&#xD;
      based on the local food items. OPEN allows the dietitian to enter the food and amounts for&#xD;
      each participant. After food items, amounts and preparations are entered into the OPEN, the&#xD;
      program creates an analysis with the breakdown of nutritional information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of growth, development, and health status in 6-7 years old participants will&#xD;
      base on the conducted clinical examination and data obtained from the medical records.&#xD;
      Clinical examination will include the assessment of clinical status, anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements, and quantitative ultrasound measurements of the bone mineral density and&#xD;
      measurement of blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical examination will be performed at the University Children's Hospital and will be&#xD;
      carried out by a specialist doctor of paediatrics and investigator biologist. It will include&#xD;
      the assessment of clinical status, anthropometric measurements, and quantitative ultrasound&#xD;
      measurements of bone mineral density. The bone mineral density will be measured at the right&#xD;
      tibia using the (QUS) Sunlight Omnisense (Sunlight Medical Ltd, Tel Aviv, Israel) which is&#xD;
      simple, painless and radiation free investigation and gives information about the bone&#xD;
      density and micro architecture. The QUS measures the time taken by the ultrasound signal to&#xD;
      travel between two transmitters and two receivers contained within the probe. These&#xD;
      propagation times are used by a proprietary algorithm to determine the bone speed of sound&#xD;
      (SOS), which is expressed as meters per second (m/s). The software will use the three most&#xD;
      consistent measurements to compute the result. The results will be taken as SOS and Z score&#xD;
      (units of standard deviations relative to the mean for age- and sex-matched population&#xD;
      reference values). Unlike in children, in adults, measurements are taken on a radius. For&#xD;
      anthropometry: body height [cm] and body mass [kg] will be measured with a certified medical&#xD;
      scale barefooted and in a minimal clothing. The precision of a height measurement will be 0.1&#xD;
      cm and of a mass measurements 0.1 kg. Skinfold thicknesses [mm] at six standard locations&#xD;
      will be measured according to the standardised methodology with the precision of 0.1 mm by a&#xD;
      calibrated certified skinfold calliper (Harpenden, England). Circumferences [cm] will be&#xD;
      measured once on the trunk or on the right side of the body with a non-stretchable narrow&#xD;
      measuring tape (fibre glass tape, China) with the precision of 0.1 cm. The estimates of body&#xD;
      composition will be linked to the acquired nutritional data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other information regarding the current health status (including blood cholesterol) and child&#xD;
      development will be obtained from the medical documentation. For this purpose investigators&#xD;
      will ask paediatricians for the access to the participants' medical records. The data on the&#xD;
      eventual disruption of a regular physical development shall be analysed (the accelerated&#xD;
      growth, attenuated growth, low body mass and BMI for overweight or obesity), and on the&#xD;
      presence of allergies and emerging chronic diseases. The emphasis will also be laid on the&#xD;
      infections, medication intakes (antibiotic treatments) and chronic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study of children fecal microbiota will base on molecular approaches such as quantitative&#xD;
      real-time PCR (qPCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) sequencing of the 16 sedimentation&#xD;
      coefficient (16S) subunit of ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene amplicons using Illumina&#xD;
      technology. A single fecal sample of an apparently healthy child will be collected at the&#xD;
      clinical examination. Priorly, the parents will be supplied with the coded sterile sampling&#xD;
      containers with a spoon attached to the lid and with sampling instruction by post and e-mail.&#xD;
      They will be asked to collect approximately 2 g (2 spoons) of participating child's faeces&#xD;
      possibly on the planned day of visit at the Pediatric clinic or one day before. Samples will&#xD;
      be kept refrigerated/cooled until the visit and will be immediately frozen at -20 ˚C upon the&#xD;
      arrival to the clinic by the medical personnel. Within a month after being collected, -20 ˚C&#xD;
      frozen fecal samples will be transferred to the laboratory and stored at -80 ˚C until the&#xD;
      performance of microbial analyses. QPCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing methods, also&#xD;
      applied in the first part of My-Milk project, are suitable for the assessment of the&#xD;
      biodiversity among total bacterial communities and composition of fecal microbiota, as well&#xD;
      as, the evaluation of the quantitative fluctuations of specific target groups in the complex&#xD;
      microbial ecosystems such as gastrointestinal tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data about the nutrition of 6-7-year old participants will be studied in connection with body&#xD;
      composition (bone density, fat percentage, and muscle tissue), health markers (blood&#xD;
      pressure, blood cholesterol), and fecal microbiota. After quality control of the sequenced&#xD;
      reads, the faecal microbiome biodiversity and relative abundance of bacterial taxa will be&#xD;
      gained and biodiversity measures such as the Chao1 score and the Shannon diversity index will&#xD;
      be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afterwards, all data will be deposited in the central database together with those already&#xD;
      obtained during the first part of My-Milk study. The appropriate statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      applied in investigating the impact of early life exposures on later growth, nutritional&#xD;
      status, health and faecal microbiota in participants at the current age of 6-7 years. The&#xD;
      central database will allow (a) protected access to already collected information; (b)&#xD;
      addition of new attributes and (c) export of data for the purposes of statistical analysis.&#xD;
      Database will not contain any personal identifications (subjects will be coded by&#xD;
      identification numbers only). The majority of the collected data from My-Milk study have&#xD;
      already been converted into electronic form. Statistical methodology will comprise of the two&#xD;
      steps: the first exploratory step, which consists of the data checking, graphical displays&#xD;
      and reduction of higher dimensional space into lower dimensional space via multivariate&#xD;
      statistical methods, such as principal component analysis and multivariate scaling; the&#xD;
      second step will be devoted to statistical inference. The appropriate statistical tests will&#xD;
      be used, regression models will be derived taking into account the research hypotheses. The&#xD;
      power of the tests will be calculated and the models will be critically assessed by modern&#xD;
      simulation techniques (e. g. bootstrap approach).&#xD;
