      This study is designed to collect data which will be used to associate changes in EEG,&#xD;
      neurocognitive performance, eNPC and clinical symptoms in concussion subtypes. The study will&#xD;
      recruit males and females, 13-50 years old, from Concussion Centers/Programs, Sports Venues&#xD;
      and Emergency Departments (ED) across the country, over an 18-month period (Phase 2, 12&#xD;
      months for Algorithm Development and Norming, and Phase 3, 6 months for Validation).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Phase 1 of this project (USAMRDC W81XWH-18-C-0157) was focused on building the&#xD;
      automated/electronic NPC capability (eNPC). This protocol is for Phase 2, in which the CI&#xD;
      multimodal brain function biomarker will be extended (Algorithm Development) with the&#xD;
      inclusion of an automated ocular function measurement (AOFM), to expand the capability in the&#xD;
      characterization of concussion. The study will also expand the range of applicability of the&#xD;
      CI to ages 13-50 years old. Phase 2 will also include norming of eNPC across the age range.&#xD;
      Phase 3 of the project will validate the algorithms developed in Phase 2, using the same&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Injured and Matched Control Subjects</arm_group_label>
    <description>Head Injured subjects are defined as those who sustained a closed head injury and meet specified protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria. Matched Control subjects are enrolled based on matching criteria (for e.g. age, gender, and same population i.e. sports vs non-sports) to the head injured subjects. For all head injured and matched control group subjects, the full battery of tests will be performed. The injured pool will begin test procedures when a subject sustains a concussion injury. The matched control pool will follow the same time point/date interval as their matched injured subject. The matched control will be assigned by site to an injured subject and matched by age, gender, and sport (if applicable) or from the same population (if non-sport).</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Healthy Volunteer Subjects</arm_group_label>
    <description>Healthy Volunteer subjects are defined as those who are normal subjects i.e. not head-injured meeting specified protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria.This group of subjects are recruited only for the purpose of collecting data for norming the electronic near point convergence measurement (eNPC). These subjects will only perform a limited battery of BrainScope tests at a single visit and will include data collection regarding their demographics, concussion history, signs and symptoms, sports information, etc. These subjects will not undergo EEG or neurocognitive assessment.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Non-Concussed Head Injured Subjects</arm_group_label>
    <description>A secondary group of non-concussed head-injured controls shall be also recruited who were observed to have a head impact/injury but were not restricted from play within the same game or deemed non-concussed following on-field/sideline evaluation by the standard of care at each site. They will perform the entire BrainScope battery of tests within 5 days after the incident and defined as Day 0 and a follow-up assessment at 15 Days following Day0</description>
