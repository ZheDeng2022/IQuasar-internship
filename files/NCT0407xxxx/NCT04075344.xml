  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Septicaemia is a potential complication of nasogastric (NG) tube feeding contamination&#xD;
      (Leanne, 2014; Anderton, 2000) and a major cause of morbidity and mortality in residential&#xD;
      care home for elders ( RCHEs) (Leanne, 2014). Although health workers (HWs) and personal care&#xD;
      workers (PCWs) are responsible for NG tube feeding and direct care to the residents who are&#xD;
      fed by NG tube feeding under supervision of registered nurses (RNs) and enrolled nurses (ENs)&#xD;
      in RCHEs, HWs and PCWs unfortunately receive limited training regarding infection control (Ho&#xD;
      et al., 2012; NICE, 2012; Duckro et al., 2009; Bankhead et al., 2009). A multimodal ICP could&#xD;
      reduce the incidence of NG tube feeding contamination by improving the knowledge and skills&#xD;
      of RCHE staff members regarding NG tube feeding (Ho et al., 2012). However, because the&#xD;
      intervention described by Ho et al. (2012) was not administered in a randomised manner,&#xD;
      potential confounders that could affect the outcomes of interest were not adjusted. To&#xD;
      overcome that limitation, the proposed work will establish a well-designed multimodal ICP and&#xD;
      explore the effectiveness of this intervention in terms of enhancing the knowledge and skills&#xD;
      regarding NG tube feeding of RCHE staff members and consequently reducing NG tube feeding&#xD;
      contamination after adjusting for potentially important baseline factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research objectives are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To explore the effectiveness of a multimodal ICP for reducing bacterial contamination,&#xD;
           as measured by the total bacterial counts on NG tube hubs and fingertips on both hands&#xD;
           of RCHEs staff, as well as in enteral milk; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the effectiveness of a multimodal ICP for improving the knowledge and&#xD;
           skills of RCHEs staff members regarding infection control measures during NG tube&#xD;
           feeding in RCHEs setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In nasogastric tube (NG tube) feeding, a tube is used to transport enteral nutrition to the&#xD;
      stomach through the nose (Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 2009). This feeding modality is widely&#xD;
      used in the geriatric population, especially for patients with cognitive impairment and oral&#xD;
      feeding problems in a residential care home settings (Rowat, 2015). Approximately 3.5% of&#xD;
      residents in a Hong Kong residential care home for elders (RCHE) were reported to use NG&#xD;
      tubes for long-term feeding (Leung et al., 2000). Contamination of the NG tube hub, defined&#xD;
      as the connection port between the NG tube and enteral feeding administration set, is&#xD;
      considered a risk factor for the acquisition and transmission of microorganisms (Matlow et&#xD;
      al., 2005). NG tube hubs can serve as reservoirs for microorganismal colonisation. For&#xD;
      example, enteral milk contamination results from bacterial spread in contaminated tube hubs&#xD;
      (Matlow et al., 2005; Donskey, 2004). Accordingly, NG tube feeding contamination occurs when&#xD;
      the total bacterial count in enteral milk exceeds 10 to the power 4 colony-forming units per&#xD;
      millilitre (cfu/ml) (Borges, Campos, Cardoso, Andre, &amp; Serafini, 2010). NG tube feeding&#xD;
      contamination is a serious issue, with potential complications including mortality,&#xD;
      septicaemia, bacteraemia, diarrhoea, and pneumonia (Leanne, 2014 &amp; Anderton, 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research indicates that insufficient knowledge about infection control and poor NG&#xD;
      tube feeding skills among RCHE staff would result in the passive transport of bacteria from&#xD;
      contaminated tube hubs to enteral feed (Ho et al., 2012; National Institute for Health &amp;&#xD;
      Clinical Excellence, 2012; Duckro, Blom, Lyle, Weintein, &amp; Hayden, 2009; Bankhead, Boullata,&#xD;
      &amp; Brantley, 2009). Additionally, Ho et al. (2012) demonstrated a strong relationship between&#xD;
      the number of total bacterial counts on the fingertips of RCHE staff, NG tube hubs of the&#xD;
      residents, and enteral milk. In Hong Kong, registered nurses (RNs), enrolled nurses (ENs),&#xD;
      health workers (HWs), and personal care workers (PCWs) provide daily nursing care services to&#xD;
      residents of RCHEs. Specifically, HWs and PCWs provide direct care, such as NG tube feeding,&#xD;
      to residents under the supervision of RNs and ENs. However, PCWs and HWs hold low levels of&#xD;
      knowledge and skills related to NG tube feeding (Ho et al., 2012; Annette, Bourgault, Weaver,&#xD;
      Swartz, &amp; O'Dea, 2007; Howell, 2002) and receive minimal education on infection control&#xD;
      during the care of residents with NG tubes (Hong Kong St. John Ambulance, 2016). Accordingly,&#xD;
      the inadequate skills of RCHE staff in terms of NG tube feeding could lead to bacterial&#xD;
      contamination (Leanne, 2014; Anderton, 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the above evidence, no previous study has described NG tube feeding practices used at&#xD;
      local RCHEs in Hong Kong. Some international studies have revealed that RCHE staff members do&#xD;
      not use non-touch techniques when connecting administration sets to the residents' NG tube&#xD;
      hubs (Beattie &amp; Anderton, 1998). Annette et al. (2007) reported that RCHE staff members&#xD;
      unnecessarily disconnected NG tube feeding systems while repositioning residents and changing&#xD;
      linens. Moreover, although 60-ml syringes are widely recommended for the prevention of&#xD;
      multi-decanting procedures when administrating milk and medications (Roberts et al., 2007;&#xD;
      Bowers, 2000), a previous study found that RCHE staff members repeatedly used 20-ml syringes&#xD;
      during milk and medication decanting procedures (Annette et al., 2007). NICE (2012) advised&#xD;
      the use of sterile water to flush all feeding tubes. However, in one study, RCHE staff used&#xD;
      non-boiled water during NG tube feeding in elderly residents (Allen, 2015). These poor skills&#xD;
      increase the risk of bacterial growth in NG tube feeding systems (NICE, 2012 &amp; Ho et al.,&#xD;
      2102).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous study reported a relationship among NG tube hub contamination, NG tube feeding&#xD;
      contamination, and insufficient NG tube feeding knowledge and skills held by RCHE staff&#xD;
      members (Ho et al., 2012). Therefore, a comprehensive literature search was conducted to&#xD;
      explore the effects of an infection control education programme on NG tube feeding&#xD;
      contamination in RCHEs. Four studies conducted at RCHEs in the United States (Michigan),&#xD;
      Europe (Northern Ireland and France) and Hong Kong satisfied the literature search objectives&#xD;
      (Mody, Krein, Saint, Min, Montoya &amp; Lansing, 2015; Ho et al., 2012; Kathleen, Gavazzi,&#xD;
      Bar-Hen, Carrat, de Wazieres, &amp; Lejeune, 2012; Baldwin, Gilpin, Tunney, Kearney, Crymble, &amp;&#xD;
      Cardwell, 2010). These four studies featured several common characteristics of teaching&#xD;
      contents, including the provision of a multimodal infection control programme (ICP) regarding&#xD;
      hand hygiene education, the proper use of personal protective equipment, and medical device&#xD;
      (NG tube) care to RCHE staff. The studies utilised a combination of multimodal strategies&#xD;
      with varied multimodal ICP contents. Here, 'multimodal' is defined as the involvement of&#xD;
      several modes of activities, whereas 'strategy' is defined as a plan of action intended to&#xD;
      accomplish a specific goal (Free Dictionary Oxford, 2016). Therefore, a multimodal strategy&#xD;
      is needed to improve infection control practice (Pittet et al., 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed multimodal ICP will have a duration of 12 weeks to ensure the sustainability of&#xD;
      knowledge and skills. Six 45-minute sessions will be provided at 2-week intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigator would explore the effectiveness of the multimodal ICP in the&#xD;
      reduction of the total bacterial counts on the NG tube hubs, enteral millk of the residents&#xD;
      and the 10 fingertips of the RCHEs staff by increasing the knowledge and skills of the NG&#xD;
      tube feeding among RCHEs staff with the multimodal ICP.&#xD;
