             exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable or non-measurable disease by RECIST criteria&#xD;
             (version1.1), with radiologic tumor assessments performed within 28 days of the first&#xD;
             dose of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have received at least 2 prior endocrine regimens in any setting&#xD;
             (neoadjuvant, adjuvant or advanced/metastatic) a CDK4/6 inhibitor and up to 3 prior&#xD;
             regimens of cytotoxic chemotherapy in the locally advanced or metastatic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be willing to undergo a biopsy of accessible tumor within 4 weeks prior&#xD;
             to the initiation of study treatment and a follow-up biopsy on treatment for ER IHC&#xD;
             testing and PD studies. (Patients without accessible tumor tissue may be eligible&#xD;
             after discussion with the Medical Monitor.)&#xD;

             setting unless the patient recurred during adjuvant treatment or within the 12 months&#xD;

             is required in the advanced setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have received no more than one prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced&#xD;

             if they have completed their treatment and have recovered from the acute effects of&#xD;
             radiation therapy or surgery prior to first dose of study drug, have discontinued&#xD;
             high-dose corticosteroid treatment for these metastases for at least 4 weeks and are&#xD;
             neurologically stable as judged by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received 4 or more regimens of chemotherapy for locally advanced or&#xD;
             mBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of prior anti-cancer or other investigational therapy within 14 days prior to&#xD;
             the first administration of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiation therapy within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug or prior irradiation to&#xD;
             &gt;25% of the bone marrow. Palliative radiation for the alleviation of pain due to bone&#xD;
             metastasis will be allowed during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Part B:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received more than 1 regimen of chemotherapy for locally advanced or&#xD;
             mBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Part C:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients have received more than one regimen of chemotherapy for advanced/metastatic&#xD;
             disease (regardless of prior adjuvant chemotherapy use) in addition to endocrine&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
