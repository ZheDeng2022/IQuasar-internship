    <textblock>
      BIO-Precision is a post-market study investigating the utility of atrial fibrillation (AF)&#xD;
      detection using BIOTRONIK's subcutaneous cardiac rhythm monitor, BIOMONITOR. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the diagnostic utility of BIOTRONIK's BIOMONITOR for the detection&#xD;
      and confirmation of AF prior to an ablation procedure. Study population includes patients&#xD;
      with paroxysmal AF being evaluated for an AF ablation. Holter monitoring for 48 hours will be&#xD;
      performed after insertion of the BIOMONITOR but prior to AF ablation. This study will enroll&#xD;
      up to 100 subjects, to obtain 60 usable Holter recordings, at 5 study sites within the United&#xD;
      States (U.S.). Study subjects will be followed for three months after the completion of a 48&#xD;
      hr Holter monitor.&#xD;

        The investigator is responsible for screening all potential subjects and selecting those&#xD;
        who are appropriate for study inclusion. Potential subjects will be evaluated to determine&#xD;
        if they meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The subjects selected for participation&#xD;
        should be from the investigator's general patient population according to the inclusion and&#xD;
        exclusion criteria. Patients who require a legally authorized representative will not be&#xD;
        allowed in the study.&#xD;

        interrogation available prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
