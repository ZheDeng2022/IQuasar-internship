             (other than paracetamol/acetaminophen), herbal remedies, megadose vitamins (intake of&#xD;
             20 to 600 times the recommended daily dose) and minerals during the 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
             administration of IP or longer if the medication has a long half life.&#xD;

             period of exclusion begins 3 months after the final dose or 1 month after the last&#xD;
             visit, whichever is the longest. Note: subjects consented and screened, but not&#xD;
             randomized in this study or a previous Phase I study, are not excluded.&#xD;

             they have any ongoing or recent (ie, during the screening period) minor medical&#xD;
             complaints that may interfere with the interpretation of study data or are considered&#xD;
             unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions, and requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         30. Subjects who are vegans or have medical dietary restrictions.&#xD;
