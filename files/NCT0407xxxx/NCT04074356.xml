      The investigator proposes to study electrical activity reflective of esophageal motility in&#xD;
      adults noninvasively by the use of multichannel electroesophagogram (EESG) and&#xD;
      magnetoesophagogram (MESG) recordings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dysphagia, or difficulty with swallowing, is a common symptom affecting nearly 9.4 million&#xD;
      individuals or 4% of the US population. High resolution esophageal manometry is currently&#xD;
      considered the gold standard test for evaluation and diagnosis of esophageal motility&#xD;
      disorders, but given that it requires trans-nasal placement in a conscious patient, this test&#xD;
      is highly uncomfortable and associated with significant patient dissatisfaction. There are&#xD;
      currently no noninvasive tests or markers available to test esophageal function and motility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the upper gastrointestinal system, as in the heart, disruption of the electrical syncytium&#xD;
      in disease produces measurable dysrhythmia. Recent modifications of the standard&#xD;
      electrogastrogram (EGG) that have increased the number of leads to 25 (termed high-resolution&#xD;
      EGG) have allowed enhanced spatio-temporal resolution of electric slow wave activity, and&#xD;
      newer analytic techniques. Additionally, the magnetogastrogram (MGG) overcomes many of the&#xD;
      inherent limitations of the standard EGG. The goal of this proposal is to harness similar&#xD;
      technologies applied to the esophagus to develop high-resolution electroesophagogram (EESG)&#xD;
      and magnetoesophagogram (MESG) as noninvasive clinical methods to quantify esophageal&#xD;
      function and motility disorders, which could guide intervention for a large number of adult&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aims in this proposal are to develop a mathematical model of esophageal function and&#xD;
      characterize phenotypes of esophageal motility disorders using EESG/MESG in healthy controls&#xD;
      and esophageal dysmotility patients and determine how EESG/MESG rhythm and pattern&#xD;
      abnormalities relate to physiologic function.&#xD;
