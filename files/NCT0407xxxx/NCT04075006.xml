    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of a low dose ketamine&#xD;
      infusion used in combination of standard of care in critically ill patients to test whether&#xD;
      ketamine can help to shorten the time of being in breathing tube and ventilator compared to&#xD;
      the standard of care alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ketamine is used to produce sedation and relieve pain to minimize discomfort while a&#xD;
      breathing tube placed in trachea (windpipe) and a machine (ventilator) used in the ICU.&#xD;
      Several publications have shown that a low-dose ketamine in combination to opioids has been&#xD;
      used to relieve acute pain after surgery. Ketamine has a favorable characteristics including&#xD;
      bronchodilation, increase in blood pressure, does not cause constipation , maintain&#xD;
      respiratory reflexes (respiratory spontaneous responses) make it an especially viable&#xD;
      alternative for patients with unstable respiratory and hemodynamic function. However, the&#xD;
      majority of these trials are conducted in a surgical ICU setting, retrospective in nature or&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trials focusing on comparison of ketamine to placebo or two&#xD;
      study drugs (e.g. ketamine versus opioid), despite the fact that most ICU patients are&#xD;
      sedated with a combination of drugs. Moreover, the majority of those trials has a limited&#xD;
      focus on patient-centered outcomes, as the primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess weather ketamine can help to shorten the time of being in&#xD;
      breathing tube and ventilator (duration of mechanical ventilation). This is a prospective,&#xD;
      randomized, active controlled, open-label pilot study to assess the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Analgo-sedative adjuncT keTAmine Infusion iN Mechanically vENTilated ICU patients (ATTAINMENT&#xD;
      trial). The study hypothesis is that low dose ketamine infusion will reduce the duration of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation with an acceptable safety profile compared to standard of care. The&#xD;
      study will include adult ICU patients (&gt; 14 years old) admitted to KFSHRC ICUs within the&#xD;
      previous 24 hours, placed on the ventilator, expected to need breathing tube for longer than&#xD;
      24 hours and placed on KFSHRC sedation and pain protocol. Patients will be separated to 2&#xD;
      groups: The intervention group: will receive a low dose ketamine infusion used in combination&#xD;
      of standard of care. Ketamine will be given as intravenous infusion at a fixed infusion rate&#xD;
      0.12 mg/kg/hr (2 µg/kg/min) in 1st 24hr followed by 0.06 mg/kg/hr (1 µg/kg/min) in 2nd 24hr.&#xD;
      The control group which will receive standard of care in the ICU including propofol and / or&#xD;
      fentanyl and/or midazolam according to KFSHRC ICU sedation and analgesia protocol as chosen&#xD;
      by the treating clinician.The randomization process is computer-generated using block&#xD;
      randomization with a size of 8 patients in each block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of the subjects to be enrolled in this study is 80 and duration of the subject's&#xD;
      participation is 48hrs. Patients will be assessed for duration of mechanical ventilation as a&#xD;
      primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study medication (i.e. ketamine) will be administered until one the following occurs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient has received ketamine for 48 hours (intended duration if the study), or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If ICU team deemed excessive sedation persisted after holding or decreasing the sedating&#xD;
           medication and patient not on target sedation score called RASS,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient died or goal of care changed to comfort care&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patient extubated and sedation weaned off ,&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. an adverse event potentially attributable to the study drug is experienced by a patient&#xD;
           that is deemed, in the opinion of the investigative team to warrant discontinuation of&#xD;
           therapy such as fast heart beat persist &gt;150 beat per min for more than 3 hours, high&#xD;
           systolic blood pressure persist &gt; 180 for more than 3 hours, severe agitation and&#xD;
           pulling off breathing tube or lines, and aggressive behavior to the nursing staff.&#xD;

    <description>To compare The number of patients are in pain score goal. We will use the KFSHRC pain scale being used in our ICU.&#xD;
For Adult communicative patients, we will use a scale from 0-10. The &quot;0&quot; indicates &quot;No pain&quot; and &quot;10&quot; indicates &quot;severe pain&quot;. Values between 1-3 indicate mild pain, values between 4-6 indicate moderate pain while values between 7-10 indicate severe pain.&#xD;
For non-communicative patients, A scale is composed of five categories: Physiology, Facial expressions, Activity (movement), Guarding And Respiratory, will be used. Each Category has a scale 0-2, then the total score is calculated and should be between 0-10. Values between 0-2 indicate no pain, values 3-6 indicate moderate pain while values between 7-10 indicate severe pain.</description>
