    <textblock>
      This is an observational study to identify the prevalence of advanced liver fibrosis among&#xD;
      patients with excessive alcohol intake using a non-invasive method (FibroScan®) and to&#xD;
      characterize the main environmental, genetic and epigenetic factors that could influence the&#xD;
      development of advanced fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will include patients 21 years of age or older with excessive alcohol&#xD;
      intake, with abnormal AST, ALT, GGT and/or bilirubin, and without any evidence of&#xD;
      decompensated liver disease (jaundice, ascites, encephalopathy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver fibrosis will be estimated by FibroScan®. A designed questionnaire for studying&#xD;
      environmental and psychosocial factors will be filled by the included patients, and blood&#xD;
      samples will be obtained to study genetic and epigenetic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients with advance fibrosis will be referred to the specialist for surveillance and&#xD;
      treatment according to current clinical guidelines.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health 2014 from the World Health Organization&#xD;
      indicates that alcohol abuse accounts for 50% of cirrhosis worldwide. Therefore, alcoholic&#xD;
      liver disease (ALD) is a main cause of advanced liver fibrosis globally. ALD encompasses a&#xD;
      range of disorders including simple steatosis, alcoholic steatohepatitis, fibrosis,&#xD;
      cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, patients with underlying ALD and active&#xD;
      drinking can develop an episode of acute-on-chronic liver injury called &quot;alcoholic&#xD;
      hepatitis&quot;, which portends a poor prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients with ALD are identified during the late stages of the disease when liver&#xD;
      decompensation occurs. In fact, a recent global epidemiologic study (GLADIS) showed that ALD&#xD;
      is by far the liver disease that is detected at the latest stages (ratio of early/late&#xD;
      referral negative 8-fold). These results strongly suggest that there is a dire need for the&#xD;
      early detection of ALD patients, which currently is almost nonexistent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A non-invasive method to screen for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis is transient elastography&#xD;
      (FibroScan®). This modality could potentially diagnose silent liver disease among heavy&#xD;
      drinkers, allowing for earlier referral to a specialty liver clinic for further treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual susceptibility to the development of advanced fibrosis among heavy drinkers is&#xD;
      likely determined by a combination of environmental, genetic and epigenetic factors, yet the&#xD;
      mechanisms are largely unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposing the exact risk factors for the progression of subclinical liver disease to advanced&#xD;
      fibrosis and cirrhosis among heavy alcohol users may assist with prognostication and help&#xD;
      influence a patient's decision to abstain from alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of this study is to identify the prevalence of advanced liver fibrosis (F3 y&#xD;
      F4) among patients with excessive alcohol intake using a non-invasive method (FibroScan®) and&#xD;
      refer those who already have evidence of advanced fibrosis (F3-4 stage) to a specialized ALD&#xD;
      clinic for treatment. The secondary goal is, to identify the main psychosocial,&#xD;
      environmental, genetic and epigenetic factors that influence the individual susceptibility to&#xD;
      develop advanced ALD and design a risk algorithm taking into account the interaction between&#xD;
      these factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a prospective observational single center study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects without detection of advanced fibrosis: no follow-up requiered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects with detection of advanced fibrosis: these patients will be referred to the&#xD;
           specialist for surveillance. In this group of patients, the investigators will record&#xD;
           the visits every six months as standard of care during the first year, and in each&#xD;
           visit, a questionnaire will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of the study: The duration of the project is expected to be two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study development: Patients will be recruited within UPMC Presbyterian (Oakland) and UPMC&#xD;
      McKeesport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Screening procedure: Those patients willing to participate in the study will sign the&#xD;
      informed consent before screening process. In this process, inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical and anthropometric data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FibroScan®&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood, liver tissue, urine and saliva collection and testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General features and characteristics of the analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to report baseline characteristics of our study&#xD;
      population as well as the incidence and prevalence of variables of interest. Chi-square test&#xD;
      will be used to compare frequency distributions between subgroups for categorical variables.&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U will be used to compare continuous variables when variables do not follow&#xD;
      normal distributions. Univariate analyses, using Chi-square, Student's t-test and&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test will be used to assess the association between potential factors and&#xD;
      advanced fibrosis. Logistic regression models will be fitted to select the best subset of&#xD;
      predictors for advanced fibrosis. Those factors showing a clinically and statistically&#xD;
      significant association with the outcome in univariate analyses will be selected for the&#xD;
      initial models. The final models will be fitted by using a step-wise forward method based on&#xD;
      model Likelihood Ratios with the same significance level (p&lt;0.05) for entering and dropping&#xD;
      variables. The significance level will be set at p&lt;0.05 for all the analyses. Statistical&#xD;
      analyses will be performed using IBM SPSS Statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators calculated a sample size of 350 subjects. An interim analysis will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct access to data source:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data will be collected into a web-based and HIPAA-compatible database system. The&#xD;
      information will be registered in the electronic record system, Research Electronic Data&#xD;
      Capture (REDCap), which has been validated by the ERIS / EDC Support team to ensure HIPAA&#xD;
      compliance. REDCap is also assessed by the Partners Information Security Risk Assessment Team&#xD;
      to ensure compliance with all Partners HealthCare policies.&#xD;
