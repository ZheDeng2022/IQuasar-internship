  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) can have problems with a variety of organs, such as the&#xD;
      pancreas. The disease can cause tumors of the pancreas. This can result in life-threatening&#xD;
      complications. Researchers want to learn more about these pancreatic tumors and how to better&#xD;
      detect them. This may help them design better future treatment and care for people with VHL&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better understand VHL disease that affects the pancreas and to test whether adding a&#xD;
      certain type of scan (68-Gallium DOTATATE PET/CT) can further detect tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 12 and older with VHL that causes tumors and cysts to grow in the pancreas&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with their medical records and imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an initial evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have their body examined by different doctors. This will depend on what&#xD;
      types of symptoms they have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have images made of their body using one or more machines: They made have a&#xD;
      CT or PET/CT scan in which they lie on a table that moves through a big ring. They may have&#xD;
      an MRI in which they lie on a table that moves into a big tube. They may have an ultrasound&#xD;
      that uses a small stick that produces sound waves to look at the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first visit, participants will be asked to return to the NIH. Some of the tests&#xD;
      performed at the first visit will be repeated. Depending on their disease status, visits will&#xD;
      be once a year or every 2 years for life.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) familial cancer syndrome demonstrate&#xD;
           manifestations in a variety of organs, including the pancreas. Pancreatic manifestations&#xD;
           can range from benign cysts and micro cystic adenomas to neuroendocrine tumors of the&#xD;
           pancreas which are capable of regional and distant metastases. These neuroendocrine&#xD;
           tumors can result in life-threatening complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This protocol is designed to identify VHL patients with pancreatic manifestations and to&#xD;
           follow these patients with serial imaging studies, germ line genetic analysis, discovery&#xD;
           of serum biomarkers, and novel imaging modalities such as 68-Gallium DOTATATE PET/CT&#xD;
           scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To comprehensively and longitudinally evaluate the natural history of patients with VHL&#xD;
      pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and cystic lesions, estimating and defining their clinical&#xD;
      spectrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Patients greater than or equal to 12 years of age diagnosed with VHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic data will be collected from the medical record and patient interview for&#xD;
           each patient participant. Data will be securely stored in a computerized database.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be evaluated by the urology, neurosurgery, brain oncology and/or&#xD;
           ophthalmology personnel as indicated to rule out or manage other manifestations of VHL&#xD;
           such as hemangioblastoma, renal cell cancer, and pheochromocytoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anatomical and functional clinical imaging studies, research blood and urine sample&#xD;
           collection will be performed at each scheduled visit. Research 68-Gallium DOTATATE&#xD;
           PET/CT imaging studies in adult subjects will be performed, no more than once per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical resection of solid lesions of the pancreas will be recommended based on&#xD;
           previously published criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Based on our analysis of likelihood of tumor growth or risk of metastasis, data will be&#xD;
           analyzed every two years and appropriate revisions will be made to the surgical&#xD;
           management guidelines, if indicated by data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Projected accrual will be 40 patients per year for a total of 15 years. Considering some&#xD;
           patients may have a screen failure, we anticipate accruing of 740 patients on this&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
