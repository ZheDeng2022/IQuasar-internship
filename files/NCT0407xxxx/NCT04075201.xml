    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the recombinant&#xD;
      hepatitis B vaccine (Hansenula polymorpha, 10μg), with an open-labelled design in adults and&#xD;
      randomized, double-blinded, and positive controlled design in children and neonates.&#xD;

      This is a phase Ⅰ clinical trial of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (Hansenula&#xD;
      polymorpha,10μg) with an open-labelled design in adults and randomized, double-blinded, and&#xD;
      positive controlled design in children and neonates. The control vaccine was the&#xD;
      commercialized recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (Hansenula polymorpha,10μg) manufactured by&#xD;
      Dalian Hissen Bio-pharm Lnc. Twenty four adults aged from 18 to 49 years will be vaccinated&#xD;
      with one dose of investigational vaccine. Sixty children aged from 1 to 15 years will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive one dose of in investigational vaccine or control&#xD;
      vaccine. Sixty neonates will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive three doses of&#xD;
      investigational vaccine or control vaccine on the schedule of month 0,1,2. Safety profiles 30&#xD;
      days after each dose will be assessed based on all the participants, and immunogenicity will&#xD;
      be assessed based on the enrolled chidren and neonates.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The overall incidence of the adverse reactions after each dose vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>within 30 days after each dose</time_frame>
    <description>Safety index-After each dose, a 30-minute safety observation will be conducted immediately. The body temperature, solicited local and general adverse events (AE) on day 0-7 were reported. The solicited local symptoms include pain, induration, redness, swelling, rash, and pruritus. The solicited general adverse symptoms include allergy, fatigue, irritability, inappetence, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. Unsolicited adverse events on day 0-30 were also reported, which include the unsolicited symptoms happened within 0-7 days, and any symptoms happened within the 8-28 days. Each AE case will be reviewed by the investigator to determine whether it was an adverse reaction (The vaccination-related AE). The incidence of adverse reactions=Number of subjects who have adverse reactions of any symptoms/number of all the subjects whose safety information are collected.</description>
