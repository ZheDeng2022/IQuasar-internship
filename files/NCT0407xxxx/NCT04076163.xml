  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: serious games have been reported as valuable method of learning since a decade.&#xD;
      Even if their evident efficiency hasn't been always reported, their influence on the&#xD;
      learners' motivation has become consensual. The authors aim to assess the efficacy of using&#xD;
      serious games to teach critical appraisal practice to medical students in comparison to&#xD;
      face-to-face learning methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods: the authors will perform a cluster randomised controlled trial&#xD;
      including third-year medical students. Both groups will receive the same initial learning&#xD;
      about elementary principals of evidence-based-medicine. Then, the control group will perform&#xD;
      a critical appraisal of a case report and a recommendation article guided by a checklist and&#xD;
      the intervention group performed a critical appraisal of the same manuscripts using a&#xD;
      home-made serious game. Both groups will be invited to fulfil a multiple-choice-question test&#xD;
      and a satisfaction likert-scale questionnaire.&#xD;

      -  Population: since 2013, 25 students in the third year of medical training are received&#xD;
           in the Department of Pathology every year. The students were divided into 7 groups of 4&#xD;
           to 5 students with an interval period of 2 to 3 weeks between the different groups. The&#xD;
           students were assigned randomly by the faculty of medicine of Tunis. The training period&#xD;
           lasts three weeks according to the university's recommendations. All the students that&#xD;
           were assigned by the faculty and who gave their consent to participate to this study&#xD;
           were included. The students that were performing their training period in other&#xD;
           Departments were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of study: this is a cluster randomised controlled trial. This kind of randomization&#xD;
           will be used because of the university board's assignment. It seems more comfortable to&#xD;
           the tutor to use the same method of learning to every group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention: this interventional and longitudinal study will be performed during a&#xD;
           year-period. The students' groups will be randomly assigned to two groups by using&#xD;
           computerised random number allocation and will be given the same pre and post test to&#xD;
           answer. The test consists in a 7 general multiple-choice-questions in addition to 5&#xD;
           multi-choice questions related to a manuscript. Besides, The trainees will fulfil a&#xD;
           Likert-type-scale satisfaction questionnaire to report their self-assessed competences&#xD;
           and their motivation. Every suggestion will be coted between 1 to 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learning activities: training objectives are listed in the students' university&#xD;
           portfolio. These objectives were performed by the faculty staff and validated by the&#xD;
           pedagogical committee. The objectives were divided into items related to technical&#xD;
           skills, the resolution of problems, ethical attitude and the critical appraisal of a&#xD;
           scientific publication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A diary about the daily activities of the students is available in the e-portfolio of the&#xD;
      students. It contains their repartition in the Department and the different learning&#xD;
      activities. Different methods of learning are displayed in the Department of Pathology&#xD;
      including traditional methods which consisted in lectures dealing with the pathologies&#xD;
      mentioned in the training board, integrative and participative methods consisting in&#xD;
      case-based and problem-based learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The five steps of the evidence-based-practice (EBP) are planned during the third week. During&#xD;
      the 4 initial days, the tutor will initiate the students to the elementary principles of&#xD;
      evidence-based-medicine practice. Learning methods are mainly lecture-based. During the fifth&#xD;
      day, groups that are randomized to the control group will participate to a workshop, which&#xD;
      consisted in a collective critical appraisal session. The students will perform a critical&#xD;
      appraisal of a case report and guidelines entitled: &quot;Spontaneous regression of locally&#xD;
      advanced non small cell lung cancer&quot; and &quot;Early and locally advanced non-small-cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC): ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up&quot;&#xD;
      (7,8). The choice of case report and recommendations was motivated by the fact that the&#xD;
      students have never been practicing critical appraisal. The students will be given a&#xD;
      checklist of the Tunisia medical journal (http://www.latunisiemedicale.com/) in order to&#xD;
      facilitate this practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will practice a critical appraisal of the same manuscript using the&#xD;
      serious game developed by the tutor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious game: the authors developed a simulation-based serious game with design elements&#xD;
           consisting in avatars, scores and explanations. This game was performed using itystudio&#xD;
           software. The different scenes took place into a medical consultation. The students&#xD;
           (players) have to choose the doctor's avatar. A realistic scenario was performed in&#xD;
           order to include the approach of critical appraisal into a realistic health problem. The&#xD;
           scenario performed was a 50-year-old-patient visiting his family doctor to explore an&#xD;
           episode of haemoptysis. This episode was explored and the medical doctor had to announce&#xD;
           the diagnosis of lung cancer to his patient. In order to explain the disease to the&#xD;
           patient and to prepare him to the future investigations and to the treatment modalities,&#xD;
           the doctor had to deal with a case report about a spontaneous regression of a lung&#xD;
           cancer then recommendations of the ESMO. With every article downloaded by the students,&#xD;
           a series of questions were asked and scored. When the students gave the good answers,&#xD;
           the game continued and if they failed the game was over. Every student had the&#xD;
           opportunity to repeat the game. Three competences were evaluated: announcing bad news,&#xD;
           the critical appraisal of a case report and the critical appraisal of recommendations.&#xD;
           Every competency was scored and the player received the final scores represented into 3&#xD;
           axes in the end of the game. The scenario established to perform the game is represented&#xD;
           in figure 2. Some illustrations of the game are represented in figure 3. The game was&#xD;
           also made available through the Department site link:&#xD;
           https://sites.google.com/a/fmt.utm.tn/externes-services-d-anatomie-pathologique-prof-mez&#xD;
           ni/. The major characteristics of the game are represented in table 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistics: statistical tests used to compare the scores between both groups consisted&#xD;
           in student test with alpha levels set at 0.05. The authors used SPSS software (version&#xD;
           20.0).&#xD;
