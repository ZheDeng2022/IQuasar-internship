    <textblock>
      Prolonged mechanical ventilation has been defined as the need for &gt;21 days. The muscle&#xD;
      weakness occurred most commonly in patients with PMV and resulted in increasing time to wean&#xD;
      from mechanical ventilation, and longer stay in hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) involves applying a stimuli to skeletal muscle,&#xD;
      to trigger muscle contraction, and it can be used for the recovery of muscle mass and muscle&#xD;
      strength following prolonged immobilization. NMES also improve microcirculation and systemic&#xD;
      circulation in patients with cardiopulmonary diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to examine the acute effects of NMES on the microcirculation, physiologic response and&#xD;
           metabolic demand in patients with PMV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to investigate the training effects of NMES on microcirculation, muscle strength and&#xD;
           weaning outcomes in patients with PMV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Subjects with PMV are recruited and are randomly assigned into NMES (n=20) or&#xD;
      control group (n=20).The NMES group receive daily NMES for 30 min/session for 10 days. The&#xD;
      assessment of muscle strength and weaning profile were performed before and after&#xD;
      intervention. During the first and the last NMES session, the status of microcirculation and&#xD;
      local muscle tissue oxygenation will be measured by NIRS, and the metabolic status will be&#xD;
      measured by IC. The ventilator weaning rate and length of stay in RCC will be recorded.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Scientific and technologic advances in medicine have resulted in the ability of the medical&#xD;
      team to prolong life. One consequence of life-extending advancements in technology is the&#xD;
      increasing numbers of patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV). Prolonged&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation has been defined as the need for 21 days, of consecutive mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation for six hours/day. The interaction of underlying diseases and prolong bedridden&#xD;
      result in various complication in patients with PMV. Known complications can include: muscle&#xD;
      weakness, atelectasis, and deconditioning. The muscle weakness occurred most commonly in&#xD;
      patients with PMV and resulted in increasing time to wean successfully from mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, and longer stay in hospital. Exercise is effective in improving muscle strength&#xD;
      and physical function in patients with heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD. However, patients with PMV may be too fragile to perform excise. Neuromuscular&#xD;
      electrical stimulation (NMES) involves applying a series of stimuli to skeletal muscle,&#xD;
      primarily to trigger muscle contraction, and it can be used for the recovery of muscle mass&#xD;
      and muscle strength following prolonged immobilization. NMES also improve microcirculation&#xD;
      and systemic circulation in patients with cardiopulmonary diseases. In addition, the&#xD;
      application of NMES increases oxygen consumption of whole body and elicits physiologic&#xD;
      effects that are similar to aerobic exercise. However, the effects of NMES on the PMV&#xD;
      population remain unclear. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a recently developed&#xD;
      noninvasive method of measuring tissue oxygenation, blood flow, and local tissue metabolism.&#xD;
      NIRS combined with a vascular occlusion test is proposed as a tool to assess the&#xD;
      microvascular response. Indirect calorimetry (IC) uses the method of breath-bybreath&#xD;
      monitoring by pneumotachography to measure oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide&#xD;
      production (VCO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to examine the acute effects of NMES on the microcirculation, physiologic response and&#xD;
           metabolic demand in patients with PMV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to investigate the training effects of NMES on microcirculation, muscle strength and&#xD;
           weaning outcomes in patients with PMV. METHODS: Subjects who have been on ventilator&#xD;
           for&gt;= 21 days are recruited form respiratory care center (RCC) and are randomly assigned&#xD;
           into NMES (n=20) or control group (n=20).The NMES group receive daily NMES for 30&#xD;
           min/session for 10 days. The assessment of muscle strength and weaning profile were&#xD;
           performed before and after intervention. During the first and the last NMES session, the&#xD;
           status of microcirculation and local muscle tissue oxygenation will be measured by NIRS,&#xD;
           and the metabolic status will be measured by IC. The mechanical ventilator weaning&#xD;
           outcomes and length of stay in RCC will be recorded. The results of this study help us&#xD;
           to confirm whether the application of NMES is beneficial in the improvement of muscle&#xD;
           strength in patients with PMV, and to furtherly understand the mechanisms. The results&#xD;
           may provide an alternative options for clinicians functional and hospitalization&#xD;
           outcomes in patients with PMV.&#xD;
