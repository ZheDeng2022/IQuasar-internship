      This Phase 2b study will evaluate safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of an RSV vaccine&#xD;
      when given together with Tdap in approximately 710 healthy nonpregnant women 18 through 49&#xD;
      years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be equally split into 5 treatment groups: One of a possible two dose&#xD;
      levels of RSV vaccine (the higher dose level will be formulated with an aluminum hydroxide&#xD;
      adjuvant) with either the Tdap or Placebo, or a Tdap and placebo combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate non-inferiority of the Tdap when co-administered with RSV vaccine&#xD;
      candidate and vice-versa by measuring participants' immune response through appropriate&#xD;
      antibody and component levels 1 month after vaccination.&#xD;

        <description>GMCs of anti-pertussis components: anti pertussis (anti-PT) toxin, anti filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and anti- pertactin (PRN) was measured and reported in descriptive section. LLOQ values for each component was: Anti-PT=0.9 endotoxin units per milliliter (EU/mL), Anti-FHA=2.9 EU/mL, and Anti-PRN=3.0 EU/mL. Assay results below LLOQ were set to 0.5*LLOQ. Descriptive data for this outcome measure was planned to be collected and analyzed only for combined population of participants reported under two RSV vaccine arms: (RSV vaccine 120 mcg with Tdap and RSV vaccine 240 mcg with aluminum hydroxide/Tdap) along with placebo/Tdap arm and not planned to be collected and analyzed for two RSV vaccine arms: (RSV vaccine 120 mcg with placebo and RSV vaccine 240 mcg with aluminum hydroxide with placebo), as pre-specified in protocol. GMRs were reported in statistical analysis section and calculated by dividing GMC of RSV vaccine with aluminum hydroxide with Tdap arm by GMC of placebo/Tdap arm.</description>
