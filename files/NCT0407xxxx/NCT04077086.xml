  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chinese children are some of the most short-sighted in the world, but only one in five&#xD;
      children in poor areas who needs glasses has them. Our team has already shown in other trials&#xD;
      that giving children free glasses leads to better grades and that free glasses have a bigger&#xD;
      impact on grades than factors like parents' education level and the amount of money a family&#xD;
      has. The effect on grades from glasses is greater than from other health services in school,&#xD;
      like giving vitamins. Only about one in three children in rural western China goes on to a&#xD;
      regular, non-vocational high school. The investigators would like to show the Chinese&#xD;
      government strong evidence of what glasses can do to help children continue their education,&#xD;
      in order to help convince the government to carry out national programs to provide free&#xD;
      glasses for children who need them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan: The investigators will choose 130 middle schools at random in Ningxia, western&#xD;
      China, and all children in Years 1 and 2 (one class each) at each school will go at random&#xD;
      into one of two groups: either a group getting free glasses, with support from teachers to&#xD;
      push them to wear the glasses (&quot;Intervention&quot;) or a group getting just glasses prescriptions&#xD;
      (&quot;Control.&quot;) The main study outcome will be the proportion of children going on to academic&#xD;
      (as opposed to vocational) high school, and the study is powered to detect a 10% difference&#xD;
      in this figure between groups.The study will also assess children's test scores, whether they&#xD;
      wear their glasses at school, and how often they use blackboards (which disadvantage&#xD;
      short-sighted children) vs textbooks to learn from. These other outcomes will help us to&#xD;
      better understand the causal pathway between vision and high school attendance. We will also&#xD;
      study the total cost of providing glasses glasses and the teacher support to wear them per&#xD;
      additional student attending academic high school. The hypothesis of this study is that&#xD;
      providing glasses will increase academic high school attendance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research question: Will providing free glasses to myopic rural Chinese students, with a&#xD;
      teacher incentive to promote use, increase academic high school attendance?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Cluster-randomised controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Rural Chinese children have high myopia prevalence, but poor access to glasses.&#xD;
      Our previous trials show giving free glasses significantly improves academic performance,&#xD;
      with greater effect size than parental education or family income, equaling or exceeding&#xD;
      other classroom-based medical interventions. Non-vocational (academic) high school attendance&#xD;
      is only 30% in rural western China. Strong evidence of educational benefit from glasses is&#xD;
      needed to spur adoption of national distribution programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Children in Year 1 and 2 (1 class each) at 130 randomly-selected middle schools in&#xD;
      Ningxia, western China, will be randomized by school to receive free glasses and a&#xD;
      trial-proven teacher-based incentive to promote wear (Intervention) or prescriptions only&#xD;
      (Control). The main outcome 2-3 years later will be high school attendance (powered to detect&#xD;
      10% difference between study groups); secondary outcomes of compliance, test scores and use&#xD;
      of near versus distance classroom learning aids will elucidate biological plausibility of a&#xD;
      causal pathway between myopia correction and learning. Local knowledge and attitudes about&#xD;
      myopia and spectacle use and intervention cost-effectiveness will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods to be employed in the analysis and justification for the choice of sample&#xD;
      size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjusted- and unadjusted-comparison of the difference between study groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Of academic high school attendance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  of mathematics test performance at endline (adjusted for baseline),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  of observed spectacle wear at un-announced examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: Assuming 50% of children will fail vision screening, 70% of these needing&#xD;
      glasses, with loss to follow-up=10%, α=0.05, intra-class correlation=0.15, explained&#xD;
      variation by covariates=0.40, difference between the groups in the main study outcome=10%,&#xD;
      high-school attendance rate in the Control group=30%, a sample size of 130 middle-schools (65&#xD;
      in each group) will provide power=85%.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Study personnel assessing trial outcomes will be masked as to children's study group assignment, which will be simplified by the fact that there will be participants with and without glasses at both Intervention and Control schools. It is not ethical in this setting to provide Control participants with placebo treatment (glasses with zero power lenses), but students, parents and teachers will not be informed of either the overall design of the study or the explicit treatment intervention assignment. Only one school will be selected in each township, minimizing the possibility of cross arm communication and contamination.</masking_description>

    <description>Children at Intervention schools will receive free spectacles of a design they select, based on the child's measured refractive power and dispensed at school by the study optometrist. Additionally, teachers (but not children) in eligible classes will be informed that if 80% spectacle compliance as measured across three separate unannounced inspections was achieved, they will be given an incentive of an conditional cash transfer. The cash transfer will be deposited into the teacher's bank accounts directly.</description>

    <description>Children at Control schools will receive a glasses prescription and letter to the parents informing them of the refractive status of their child, with free glasses provided only at the end of the trial. No teacher incentive will be offered. Service offered to the Control group exceeds standard care, in that no school-based programs of vision screening and refraction currently exist in the study area, or in most of rural China.</description>

    <description>Intervention group children in middle school Years 1 and 2 will receive spectacles at the beginning of the academic year (September 2021). Assuming that the relevant effects of treatment (glasses wear) on the main study outcome are complete once examinations determining high school attendance are finished at the end of Middle School Year 3, Intervention participants will have undergone either 22 months (September 2021 to July 2023 for those recruited in Year 2) or 34 months (September 2021 to July 2024 for those recruited in Year 1) of treatment by the endpoint of the trial.</description>
