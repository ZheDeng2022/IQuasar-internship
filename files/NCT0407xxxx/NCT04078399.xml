  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center, one-arm, prospective, phase II clinical trial with the primary&#xD;
      objective of assessing the effectiveness of azacitidine combined with interferon in the&#xD;
      prevention of recurrence after allogeneic transplantation of myeloid tumors (AML/MDS/MPN) in&#xD;
      the blood system. Sex and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the screening/baseline period, informed consent is obtained and the inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria are checked. Plan to enroll 30 patients, and collect demographic data, medical&#xD;
      history data, vital signs, physical examination, laboratory tests (hematuria, liver and&#xD;
      kidney function; immune indicators: T cell subsets, Treg, etc.), pregnancy test for female&#xD;
      patients And other necessary auxiliary inspections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time to start treatment is: a decrease in chimerism and/or minimal residual disease (MRD)&#xD;
      after myeloid tumor allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;

      Treatment programs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Basic protocol: Azacitidine is administered subcutaneously at 32 mg/m2/d for 5&#xD;
           consecutive days; α-interferon treatment started on day 8 for 3 weeks; 4-6&#xD;
           weeks/treatment with long-acting interferon Gebin). 1-1.5 million U / kg, once a week;&#xD;
           or ordinary alpha-interferon, 200 acres / square meter / d (total ≥ 300MU / d), 5-7 days&#xD;
           a week;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Start time of medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 In the absence of immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporine, the chimeric rate is&#xD;
      decreased and/or MRD-positive: or in the case of immunosuppressive agents such as&#xD;
      cyclosporine, the chimeric rate is fully chimeric and MRD-positive: A-interferon is first&#xD;
      administered. Single-agent intervention, if there was no significant decrease in MRD for 2&#xD;
      consecutive courses (MRD decreased ≤ 50%), azacitidine combined with interferon intervention&#xD;
      was started; 2 In the case of calmodulin immunosuppressant (cyclosporine or tacrolimus), the&#xD;
      chimeric rate decreased and the MRD was negative, the immunosuppressant was rapidly reduced&#xD;
      or discontinued, and the bone marrow was reviewed 2 weeks, if the chimeric rate did not rise.&#xD;
      (decreased or stable), or after two consecutive immunosuppressive adjustments did not reach&#xD;
      complete chimerism, start azacitidine combined with interferon intervention; (3) If&#xD;
      cyclosporine or other immunosuppressive agents are applied before the start of the study,&#xD;
      rapid reduction; dose reduction 1 / 4-1 / 2; if the chimeric rate increases or GVHD occurs,&#xD;
      continue the immunosuppressant adjustment strategy; (4) Stop treatment: acute GVHD above II&#xD;
      degree; patients are intolerant to the study protocol; basic regimen is ineffective after 2&#xD;
      courses of treatment (chimeric rate continues to decline or MRD continues to increase) or&#xD;
      disease recurrence; transplant.&#xD;
