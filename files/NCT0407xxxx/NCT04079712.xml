  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well the combination of XL184 (cabozantinib), nivolumab, and&#xD;
      ipilimumab work in treating patients with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (i.e.,&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumor that does not look like the normal tissue it arose from). Cabozantinib&#xD;
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may help the&#xD;
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread. Giving cabozantinib, nivolumab and ipilimumab may shrink the cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) associated with the combination of XL184&#xD;
      (cabozantinib), nivolumab, and ipilimumab in patients with advanced poorly-differentiated&#xD;
      neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs), after the failure of at least one line of prior therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS). II. To measure the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      the combination of XL184 (cabozantinib), nivolumab, and ipilimumab in patients with advanced,&#xD;
      poorly-differentiated NECs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate disease control rate (DCR). IV. To measure duration of response (DOR). V. To&#xD;
      describe the tumor molecular profile using whole exome sequencing (WES) and correlate it with&#xD;
      treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To describe the tumor molecular profile using ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (RNAseq)&#xD;
      and correlate it with treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To measure the tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T lymphocytes in pre- and on-treatment biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To measure tumor-infiltrating myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in pre- and&#xD;
      on-treatment biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To measure tumor-infiltrating tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) in the pre and&#xD;
      on-treatment biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To measure the expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in tumor cells and&#xD;
      infiltrating immune cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cabozantinib s-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 of cycles 1-4&#xD;
      and days 1-28 of subsequent cycles, nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1,&#xD;
      and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1 of cycles 1-4 only. Treatment repeats every 21 for&#xD;
      4 cycles then every 28 days for subsequent cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, and then every 3&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;

             must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. WOCBP&#xD;
             should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 5 months after the last dose of&#xD;
             study therapy. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity: 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic&#xD;
             gonadotropin [hCG]) within 24 hours prior to the start of study therapy. Women must&#xD;
             not be breastfeeding. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any&#xD;
             contraceptive method with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year. Men who receive study&#xD;
             therapy and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to&#xD;
             contraception for a period of 7 months after the last dose of study therapy. Women who&#xD;
             are not of childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile)&#xD;
             as well as azoospermic men do not require contraception. WOCBP is defined as any&#xD;
             female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization&#xD;
             (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause is&#xD;
             defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of&#xD;
             other biological or physiological causes. In addition, women under the age of 55 must&#xD;
             have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level &lt; 40 mIU/mL. WOCBP&#xD;
             and men who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to&#xD;
             contraception for a period of 5 and 7 months, respectively, after the last dose of&#xD;
             study therapy. These durations have been calculated using the upper limit of the&#xD;
             half-life for nivolumab (25 days) and are based on the protocol requirement that WOCBP&#xD;
             use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 30 days and men who are sexually active with&#xD;
             WOCBP use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 90 days. Should a woman become pregnant&#xD;
             or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study,&#xD;
             she (or the participating partner) must inform the treating physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to swallow tablets&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
             Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a&#xD;

                  who are on a stable dose of LMWH for at least 6 weeks before the first dose of&#xD;
                  study treatment, and who have had no clinically significant hemorrhagic&#xD;
                  complications from the anticoagulation regimen or the tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have had major surgery (e.g., gastrointestinal [GI] surgery or&#xD;
             removal or biopsy of brain metastasis) within 4 weeks before first dose of study&#xD;

             the first dose of study treatment and from minor surgery (e.g., simple excision or&#xD;
             tooth extraction) at least 10 days before the first dose. Patients with clinically&#xD;
             relevant ongoing complications from prior surgery are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have received cytotoxic chemotherapy (including investigational&#xD;
             cytotoxic chemotherapy) or biologic agents (e.g., cytokines or antibodies) within 4&#xD;
             weeks, or nitrosoureas/ mitomycin C within 4 weeks, before the first dose of study&#xD;
             treatment. Patients may continue on bone-modifying agents (denosumab or&#xD;
             bisphosphonates) with caution&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered to baseline from adverse events due to prior&#xD;
             anti-cancer therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) according to Common&#xD;
             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)0.5 unless the adverse&#xD;
             events (AEs) are clinically nonsignificant and/or stable on supportive therapy, with&#xD;
             the exception of alopecia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents. Patients must not have&#xD;
             received any other type of investigational agent within 4 weeks before the first dose&#xD;
             of study treatment to be eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have a corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula&#xD;
             (QTcF) &gt; 500 msec by electrocardiogram (EKG) within 28 days before the first dose of&#xD;
             study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: If a single EKG shows a QTcF with an absolute value &gt; 500 msec, two&#xD;
                  additional EKGs at intervals of approximately 3 min must be performed within 30&#xD;
                  min after the initial EKG, and the average of these three consecutive results for&#xD;
                  QTcF will be used to determine eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should not have known, untreated brain metastases or leptomeningeal&#xD;
             metastases because of poor prognosis and concerns that progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction could confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to agents used in study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to any&#xD;
             monoclonal antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not require concomitant treatment with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g.,&#xD;
             dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine,&#xD;
             phenobarbital, or St. John's wort). Because lists of these agents are constantly&#xD;
             changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference.&#xD;
             As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, patients will be counseled on&#xD;
             the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to&#xD;
             be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or&#xD;
             herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have uncontrolled, significant intercurrent or recent illness&#xD;
             including, but not limited to, the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cardiovascular disorders:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class 3 or 4,&#xD;
                       unstable angina pectoris, serious cardiac arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Uncontrolled hypertension defined as sustained blood pressure (BP) &gt; 140 mm&#xD;
                       Hg systolic or &gt; 90 mm Hg diastolic despite optimal antihypertensive&#xD;
                       treatment within seven days prior to the first dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Stroke (including transient ischemic attack [TIA]), myocardial infarction&#xD;
                       (MI), or other ischemic event, or thromboembolic event (e.g., deep venous&#xD;
                       thrombosis [DVT], pulmonary embolism [PE]) within 6 months before first&#xD;
                       dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  GI disorders including those associated with a high risk of perforation or&#xD;
                  fistula formation:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  The patient has evidence of tumor invading the GI tract, active peptic ulcer&#xD;
                       disease, inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease), diverticulitis,&#xD;
                       cholecystitis, symptomatic cholangitis or appendicitis, acute pancreatitis,&#xD;
                       acute obstruction of the pancreatic duct or common bile duct, or gastric&#xD;
                       outlet obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Abdominal fistula, GI perforation, bowel obstruction, or intra-abdominal&#xD;
                       abscess within 6 months before first dose. Complete healing of an&#xD;
                       intra-abdominal abscess must be confirmed before first dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clinically significant hematuria, hematemesis, or hemoptysis or other history of&#xD;
                  significant bleeding (e.g., pulmonary hemorrhage) within 12 weeks before first&#xD;
                  dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cavitating pulmonary lesion(s) or known endotracheal or endobronchial disease&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Other clinically significant disorders that would preclude safe study&#xD;
                  participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Serious non-healing wound/ulcer/bone fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Uncompensated/symptomatic hypothyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because XL184 (cabozantinib) has the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects, and the effects of nivolumab and&#xD;
             ipilimumab on the developing fetus are not well known. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother,&#xD;
             breastfeeding must be discontinued if the mother is treated with XL184 (cabozantinib),&#xD;
             nivolumab, or ipilimumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might&#xD;
             recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment&#xD;
             including high dose systemic corticosteroids, should be excluded. These include but&#xD;
             are not limited to: immune-related neurologic disease, such as multiple sclerosis,&#xD;
             autoimmune (demyelinating) neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, or myasthenia gravis;&#xD;
             systemic autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), connective&#xD;
             tissue diseases, scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's, ulcerative&#xD;
             colitis, or autoimmune hepatitis. Patients with a history of toxic epidermal&#xD;
             necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or phospholipid syndrome should be&#xD;
             excluded because of the risk of recurrence or exacerbation of disease. Patients with&#xD;
             vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus (DM), or endocrine deficiencies (e.g., thyroiditis)&#xD;
             managed with replacement hormones, including physiologic corticosteroids, are&#xD;
             eligible. Patients wi&#xD;
