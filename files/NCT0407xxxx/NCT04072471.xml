  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-interventional population-based prospective cohort study in multiple databases comparing&#xD;
      patients with gout who initiate lesinurad in combination with an existing xanthine oxidase&#xD;
      inhibitor (XOI) (lesinurad+XOI cohort) to a propensity score-matched cohort of similar&#xD;
      patients from the same data source who continue treatment with XOI monotherapy (XOI mono&#xD;
      cohort). Study will characterize the cardiovascular safety of lesinurad in combination with&#xD;
      XOI in patients with gout aged 18+ years compared with similar patients who continue XOI&#xD;
      monotherapy. Primary objective: to assess the relative incidence of major adverse cardiac&#xD;
      events plus hospitalization for unstable angina (MACE+ events) in patients with gout in both&#xD;
      cohorts. Secondary objectives: to describe the characteristics of the cohorts prior to&#xD;
      matching; to assess the relative incidence of hospitalisation for acute kidney injury between&#xD;
      the matched cohorts; to assess the relative incidence of individual MACE+ components in the&#xD;
      matched cohorts.&#xD;

  <overall_status>Withdrawn</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study was withdrawn as lesinurad was withdrawn from the market in Europe by the market&#xD;
    authorization holder. Hence the commitment to do this PASS was removed by the European&#xD;
    Medicines Agency.&#xD;

    <description>MACE+ is a composite endpoint comprised of: hospitalisation for non-fatal AMI, stroke, or unstable angina and cardiovascular (CV) death. CV death includes the following causes, occurring in or out of the hospital: AMI, sudden cardiac, heart failure, CV procedures, CV haemorrhage, stroke, underlying cerebrovascular cause, other CV causes.</description>

    <measure>Hospitalisation for acute kidney injury (AKI) including renal failure (with AKI as the primary diagnosis)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Confirmed cases of AKI require all three of the following criteria:&#xD;
A diagnosis of renal injury or acute renal injury recorded as a primary hospital discharge diagnosis in the electronic database AND&#xD;
An increase in serum creatinine at hospital admission or within 48 hours of hospital admission defined as follows:&#xD;
Increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 1.5-fold from baseline where baseline is lowest value recorded within 1 year before the hospital admission date OR&#xD;
Decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or actual 24-hour GFR by ≥ 50% from baseline where baseline is highest value recorded within 1 year before the hospital admission date OR&#xD;
Estimated creatinine clearance (eCrCl) &lt; 30 mL/min AND&#xD;
Absence of all the following contraindications for lesinurad patients at any time prior to the index date:&#xD;
A diagnosis code of chronic kidney disease stage IV or greater&#xD;
eCrCl &lt; 30 mL/min recorded at any time prior to the index date</description>

        All patients in this study will be 18 years of age or older, will have had at least 6&#xD;
        months (183 days) of continuous baseline data available before entering one of the cohorts,&#xD;
        and will be current users of XOI monotherapy (i.e., &gt; 1 dispensing/prescription of a study&#xD;
        XOI in the 183-day baseline period prior to the index date and days' supply extending&#xD;
        beyond the index date). The study population will include patients from one primary care&#xD;
        database in Italy (Health Search) and another in Spain (Information System for Research in&#xD;
        Primary Care [SIDIAP]), as well as two US health systems (the HealthCore Integrated&#xD;
        Research DatabaseSM [HIRD] and Medicare).&#xD;
