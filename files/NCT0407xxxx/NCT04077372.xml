  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether standardized implementation of a scripted&#xD;
      template for discussing important issues that arise near the end of life improves the care of&#xD;
      those who have advanced cancer.&#xD;

      Primary Objective: To determine whether the Serious Illness Conversation Guide will improve&#xD;
      the consistency with which providers have and document conversations regarding patients'&#xD;
      goals and priorities as they near the end of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: 1. To assess whether having conversations as per this model will&#xD;
      improve the quality of care near the end of life as determined by appropriate care in&#xD;
      concordance with their goals of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. To assess whether having conversations as per this model will improve patient Quality of&#xD;
      Life (QOL) as per a validated scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. To assess in patients with concordant care whether this model will improve patient QOL as&#xD;
      per a validated scale 4. To assess provider opinions about end-of-life conversations.&#xD;
