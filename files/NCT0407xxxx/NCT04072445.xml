  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well trifluridine/tipiracil and irinotecan work in treating&#xD;
      patients with biliary tract cancer that has spread to other places in the body (advanced) and&#xD;
      has not responded to treatment (refractory). Trifluridine/tipiracil and irinotecan may stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the efficacy of trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride&#xD;
      (trifluridine/tipiracil) in combination with irinotecan hydrochloride (irinotecan) in&#xD;
      patients with refractory biliary tract cancers using progression-free survival (PFS) at 16&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the safety and tolerability of trifluridine/tipiracil in combination with&#xD;
      irinotecan in patients with refractory biliary tract cancers through adverse event&#xD;
      monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Further explore the efficacy of trifluridine/tipiracil in combination with irinotecan in&#xD;
      patients with refractory biliary tract cancers by overall response rates (ORR), disease&#xD;
      control rates (DCR), and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if the number of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) or the level of cell-free&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cfDNA) at baseline is prognostic or predictive to the response&#xD;
      to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine if changes in CTCs or cfDNA correlate with efficacy endpoints. III. To&#xD;
      determine if drug response from a parallel ex vivo trial using patient-derived tumor organoid&#xD;
      correlates with clinical response to trifluridine/tipiracil plus irinotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the role of thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) in predicting the clinical benefit of&#xD;
      trifluridine/tipiracil plus irinotecan and discover potential mechanisms of resistance using&#xD;
      patient-derived tumor organoid and pre-treatment biopsy specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY RESEARCH:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate patients who received prior treatment with fluorouracil (5-FU) independently&#xD;
      from the entire population in the following areas: PFS, safety and tolerability, ORR, DCR,&#xD;
      and OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on&#xD;
      days 1-5 and irinotecan hydrochloride (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 14&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 3 months&#xD;
      for up to 2 years after study registration.&#xD;
