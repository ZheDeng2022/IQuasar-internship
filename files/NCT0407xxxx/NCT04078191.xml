    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject has provided written informed consent with HIPAA (Health Information&#xD;
             Portability and Accountability Act) or equivalent authorization before the initiation&#xD;
             of any study-related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Women and men of childbearing potential must use adequate birth control measures&#xD;
             (e.g., abstinence, oral contraceptives, intrauterine device, barrier method with&#xD;
             spermicide, or surgical sterilization) for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject is at least 18 years of age and was ≥ 18 years of age at the time of RA&#xD;
             diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject has RA as determined by the 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European&#xD;
             League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) Classification Criteria (score of ≥ 6/10 at or&#xD;
             before screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject has a 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) of ≥ 3.2 (includes the&#xD;
             C-reactive protein [CRP] test and visual analog scale [VAS]).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects receiving traditional DMARDs must have been on therapy for ≥ 90 days and at a&#xD;
             stable dose for ≥ 30 days prior to the first imaging visit (Day 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. If the subject is receiving biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD) or&#xD;
             janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor therapy, they have been at a stable dose &gt; 180 days prior&#xD;
             to the first imaging visit (Day 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. If the subject is receiving NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) or oral&#xD;
             corticosteroids, the dose has been at a stable dose for ≥ 28 days prior to imaging.&#xD;
             The corticosteroid dose should be ≤ 10 mg/day of prednisone or an equivalent steroid&#xD;
             dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The subject has a hand or wrist joint with a minimum ultrasound gray-scale synovitis&#xD;
             score of 2 (range 0 to 3).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. The subject is pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject size or weight is not compatible with imaging per the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject has had or is currently receiving radiation therapy or chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject has renal insufficiency as demonstrated by a glomerular filtration rate of&#xD;
             &lt; 60 mL/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject has hepatic insufficiency as demonstrated by ALT (alanine aminotransferase&#xD;
             [SGPT]) or AST (aspartate aminotransferase [SGOT]) greater than 3 times the upper&#xD;
             limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The subject has any severe, acute, or chronic medical conditions and/or psychiatric&#xD;
             conditions and/or laboratory abnormalities that would impart, in the judgment of the&#xD;
             investigator, excess risk associated with study participation or study drug&#xD;
             administration that would deem the subject inappropriate for study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The subject has a known allergy to or has had an adverse reaction to dextran exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The subject has received an investigational product within 30 days prior to the Tc 99m&#xD;
             tilmanocept administration (Day 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The subject has received intra-articular corticosteroids ≤ 8 weeks prior to imaging&#xD;
             (Day 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. The subject has received any radiopharmaceutical within 7 days or 10 half-lives prior&#xD;
             to the administration of Tc 99m tilmanocept (Day 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The subject has an intolerance to anesthetic and antiseptic agents indicated for the&#xD;
             synovial biopsy procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. The subject is currently receiving anticoagulants (oral anti-platelet agents are&#xD;
             permitted) or has a condition that is contraindicated with ultrasound-guided synovial&#xD;
             biopsy e.g., needle phobia.&#xD;
