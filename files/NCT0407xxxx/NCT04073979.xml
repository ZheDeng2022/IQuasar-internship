      The Mistral is an investigational device intended for percutaneous trans-catheter repair in&#xD;
      high risk for surgery individuals suffering from functional Tricuspid Regurgitation (TR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device system is to be used only in accordance with the approved Investigational Plan on&#xD;
      subjects who have signed an informed consent form. Device use is limited to the approved&#xD;
      study investigators.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to clinically demonstrate device acute safety and technical performance&#xD;
      (Primary Endpoints) along with longer FU device safety and effectiveness evaluation&#xD;
      (Secondary Endpoint).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the Acute safety of the implanted Mistral device post procedure and at 30 day&#xD;
           follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the long term Safety of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demonstrate effectiveness of the Mistral device in reducing TR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety: Acute safety. Rate of all SAEs including device related SAEs, all caused&#xD;
           mortality, stroke, MI, cardiac tamponade, surgery for failed percutaneous repair and&#xD;
           non-elective cardiovascular surgery to treat an adverse event. At discharge and 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performance: Mistral Implantation rate of technical success (defined as successful&#xD;
           device implantation with grasped chords from at least two leaflets.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety: Safety at 3,6, 12 and 24 months. Rate of all SAEs including device related SAEs&#xD;
           at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effectiveness: TR reduction post-procedure, at discharge and 30 days, 3,6, 12 and 24&#xD;
           months. Improved NYHA class, 6MWTdistance and KCCQ (quality of life) at 30 days, 3,6, 12&#xD;
           and 24 months.&#xD;
