      Glucagon regulation and response in persons with T1D at the basal state and in response to&#xD;
      various stimuli remains unclear. Dr. Philip Cryer has previously reported that, in T1D young&#xD;
      adults with a course of the disease of 16+9 years, the absence of endogenous insulin&#xD;
      secretion results in increased glucagon secretion after a mixed meal, concluding that&#xD;
      endogenous insulin reciprocally regulates the alpha-cell glucagon secretion and also&#xD;
      suggesting that glucagon dysregulation may play an important role in post-prandial&#xD;
      hyperglycemia in T1D. Interestingly, recent research on human islets have shown that insulin&#xD;
      inhibits counter-regulatory glucagon secretion by a paracrine effect mediated by&#xD;
      SGLT2-dependent stimulation of somatostatin release. An important gap in our knowledge is&#xD;
      whether the timing of prandial insulin doses affects the glucagon response to a hyperglycemic&#xD;
      stimulus in patients with T1D who have undetectable C-peptide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether appropriately timed exogenous insulin can modify the glucagon response to glucose&#xD;
      fluctuations has not been studied. As such, this pilot study aims to characterize the&#xD;
      glucagon response to meal-time hyperglycemia and to compare the difference in glucagon&#xD;
      secretion when mealtime bolus insulin is given before the meal versus after the meal with the&#xD;
      objective of understanding factors that contribute to the peak post-prandial blood glucose&#xD;
      and AUC of blood glucose after a mixed meal in this target population.&#xD;

      Glucagon regulation and response in persons with T1D at the basal state and in response to&#xD;

      inhibits counter-regulatory glucagon secretion by a paracrine effect mediated by&#xD;
      SGLT2-dependent stimulation of somatostatin release. An important gap in our knowledge is&#xD;
      whether the timing of prandial insulin doses affects the glucagon response to a hyperglycemic&#xD;
      stimulus in patients with T1D who have undetectable C-peptide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T1D course. In general, loss of 80% of beta cell function is needed to develop severe&#xD;
      hyperglycemia. Endogenous insulin secretion is almost entirely lost within 3 to 5 years after&#xD;
      the diagnosis . In children with new diagnosis of T1D, glucagon levels were highly associated&#xD;
      with post prandial blood glucose, but not with HbA1c level. It has also been reported that&#xD;
      postprandial hyperglucagonemia worsens significantly while C-peptide secretion declines&#xD;
      during the first year of the disease. Also, in children with greater than five years of T1D,&#xD;
      postprandial glucagon levels increased 160% from one to sixty months after diagnosis (8) and&#xD;
      in those with disease duration of 6.9 + 4 years, glucagon levels were strongly correlated&#xD;
      with post-prandial glucose and mildly correlated with HbA1C levels. A study in T1D adults&#xD;
      performed in China showed that post-prandial glucagon levels were higher in T1D patients in&#xD;
      the first year of the disease compared to those with longer course of the disease, and that&#xD;
      hypoglycemic events were lower in newly diagnosed patients, suggesting that glucagon&#xD;
      secretory function may become impaired with longer duration of the disease. These studies&#xD;
      suggest that glucagon dysregulation could impact glucose control with exogenous insulin, and&#xD;
      that this dysregulation may change with disease duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-prandial hyperglycemia adds to glucose variability, difficulty with insulin dosing and&#xD;
      overall instability of glucose control. A recent analysis from the T1D Exchange study, that&#xD;
      included 4768 participants younger than 26 years with a clinical diagnosis of T1D for at&#xD;
      least 1 year showed that 21% of the participants reported administering insulin several&#xD;
      minutes before, 44% immediately before, 10% during, and 24% after meal. Interestingly,&#xD;
      participants who reported administering insulin during or after a meal were more likely to&#xD;
      report missing â‰¥1 mealtime insulin dose per week compared with those who administered insulin&#xD;
      before meals. In addition, a sub-analysis showed that participants who dose mealtime insulin&#xD;
      in the postprandial period have poorer glycemic control and greater frequency of severe&#xD;
      hypoglycemia. However, despite of these recent results, patients are often advised to give&#xD;
      insulin after eating because caloric intake is uncertain. Understanding the mechanisms behind&#xD;
      the higher post-prandial peak in glucose with delayed insulin administration may help&#xD;
      clinicians guide appropriate timing of insulin administration for T1D patients with long&#xD;
      course of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucagon Regulation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different models have been used to study glucagon regulation. Since both hyperglycemia and&#xD;
      hypoglycemia stimulate alpha cells to produce glucagon, both the lack of intra-islet insulin&#xD;
      and this U-shaped glucagon response contribute to glucose dysregulation in T1D . It has been&#xD;
      reported that in T1D patients with a duration of the disease of 26.4+7.5 years, glucagon&#xD;
      levels increased in response to the OGTT under euglycemic and hyperglycemic conditions,&#xD;
      however the relative contribution of hyperglucagonemia to post-prandial glucose rise in the&#xD;
      presence or absence of preprandial insulin has not been clearly elucidated. Whether&#xD;
      appropriately timed exogenous insulin can modify the glucagon response to glucose&#xD;
      fluctuations has not been studied. As such, this pilot study aims to characterize the&#xD;
      glucagon response to meal-time hyperglycemia and to compare the difference in glucagon&#xD;
      secretion when mealtime bolus insulin is given before the meal versus after the meal with the&#xD;
      objective of understanding factors that contribute to the peak post-prandial blood glucose&#xD;
      and AUC of blood glucose after a mixed meal in this target population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with higher glucagon responses to a mixed meal stimulus will have higher peak&#xD;
           post-prandial glucoses and greater AUC of post-prandial glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Bolus dose insulin given pre-meal (20 min before meal) will result in lower peak&#xD;
           post-prandial glucose, lower AUC and lower post-prandial glucagon levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Bolus dose insulin given post-meal (20 min after meal) will result in higher peak&#xD;
           post-prandial glucoses, higher AUC of post-meal glucose and higher glucagon levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. There will be a correlation between peak post-prandial glucagon response and post-meal&#xD;
           glucose AUC, 0 to 180 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plans The study will be conducted in the (Intensive Research Unit, part of the CTSA)&#xD;

      Laboratory Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Core Laboratory for Clinical Studies at Washington University&#xD;
      (https://research.wustl.edu/core-facilities/core-laboratory-clinical-studies, CLCS) will&#xD;
      measure glucose on the Roche cobas c510 platform using Roche's coupled enzymatic assay&#xD;
      (hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphoate dehydrogenase). The rate of NADPH formation is directly&#xD;
      proportional to glucose concentration and measured photometrically. The interday imprecision&#xD;
      is typically &lt;2.0% CV. CLCS will also measure C-peptide on the Roche cobas e601platform using&#xD;
      Roche's sandwich electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. In this assay a biotinylated&#xD;
      monoclonal C-peptide-specific antibody and a monoclonal C-peptide-specific antibody labeled&#xD;
      with a ruthenium complex bind to C-peptide to form the sandwich. Then, using&#xD;
      streptavidin-coated microparticles, the complex is drawn into the measuring cell and remains&#xD;
      while unbound material is washed away. Application of a voltage to the electrode induces&#xD;
      chemiluminescent emission that is measured by the instrument. Between run precision typically&#xD;
      ranges from 1.9 - 2.7% CV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucagon is measured using a radioimmunoassay kit from Millipore. This is a competitive&#xD;
      immunoassay which uses I-125 labeled glucagon and a glucagon-specific antibody. Its stated&#xD;
      inter-assay precision is 12% CV. Typical within-run precision is 2.0 - 3.0 % CV in our hands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of Data Analysis Data analysis will be performed using STATA 15.1 for Windows&#xD;
      (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas, United States). The sample size calculation assumes&#xD;
      that the peak postprandial glucose will increase by 80 +/-20 mg/dl in the pre-meal insulin&#xD;
      group and 140 +/-20 mg/dl in the post-meal group. So, the expected mean peak of postprandial&#xD;
      glucose will be up to 220 mg/dL for Visit A and mean peak postprandial glucose will be up to&#xD;
      280 mg/dL for Visit B. The sample size will have 80% power to detect a difference between&#xD;
      groups at p&lt;0.05. We have assumed correlation between visits A and B of 0.5. The sample size&#xD;
      was corrected by an anticipated loss of follow up of 10% of the participants. The calculated&#xD;
      sample size is 10 participants with full data sets available for 8 participants. The study&#xD;
      randomization is designed as follows: 5 participants will first attend Visit A, and then&#xD;
      Visit B. The 5 remaining participants will first attend Visit B and then Visit A. AUC of&#xD;
      post-prandial glucose and glucagon and maximum postprandial peak of glucose and glucagon will&#xD;
      be analyzed by using paired T student. Relationships between variables were assessed by a&#xD;
      Spearman's correlation test.&#xD;
