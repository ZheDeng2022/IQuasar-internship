  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary nitrate supplementation has previously been shown to reduce blood pressure in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. The investigators wished to see whether this would be replicated in subjects with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes and age matched healthy controls.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Double blind, randomised placebo control trial, with crossover design comparing the effect of&#xD;
      beetroot juice (rich in nitrate) with placebo (nitrate depleted beetroot juice) on blood&#xD;
      pressure, endothelial function and insulin sensitivity in subjects with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      Healthy age matched subjects will have blood pressure measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of Investigations: Study outcome measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure measured using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (Spacelabs) for 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine albumin excretion rate: in overnight samples using standard radioimmunoassay&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine nitrate excretion will be used as a measure of adherence, and will be measured using an&#xD;
      HPLC assay recently developed at St. Luke's in Professor Winyard's laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microvascular endothelial function assessed by iontophoresis of an endothelial -dependent&#xD;
      (acetylcholine, ACh) and -independent (sodium nitroprusside, SNP) vasodilator and monitoring&#xD;
      of perfusion response using Laser Doppler Perfusion Imaging intra-individual coefficient of&#xD;
      variation is 12% for Ach and 18.7% for SNP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-occlusive reactive hyperaemia: A laser Doppler probe will be attached to the inside&#xD;
      surface of the forearm or the dorsum of the foot and blood flow will be measured for&#xD;
      5-minutes. Following this, a blood pressure cuff will be rapidly inflated to 200mmHg for 5&#xD;
      minutes to occlude blood flow. At the end of the 4 minute occlusion the cuff will be rapidly&#xD;
      deflated and blood flow recorded for 10 minutes post release. This procedure stimulates&#xD;
      microvessels to dilate with a consequent increase in blood flow. Analysis involves detailed&#xD;
      investigation into the shape of the blood flow curve in order to categorize it into one of 3&#xD;
      options: normal; early dominant peak and early non-dominant peak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optical reflectance spectroscopy (ORS) ORS is a non-invasive technique that directly measures&#xD;
      both the changes in blood volume and oxygenation of the skin microcirculation. Visible light&#xD;
      passing through the skin is attenuated in part by the concentration of oxy- and&#xD;
      deoxyhaemoglobin. Assuming the attenuation of light by scattering remains constant, changes&#xD;
      in the concentration of oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin can be calculated from the measured changes&#xD;
      in light attenuation at different wavelengths as it travels through the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin Maximum Hyperaemia (MH): An area of the dorsal aspect of the right foot and the ventral&#xD;
      aspect of the forearm, clear of visible veins or skin lesions, will be heated to a&#xD;
      temperature of 42C for 30 minutes with a small brass heater of 1cm in diameter (Moor&#xD;
      Instruments, Axminster, Devon, U.K.) and the maximum blood flow response is measured using&#xD;
      laser Doppler techniques (single point or laser Doppler perfusion imager. The mean&#xD;
      intra-individual coefficient of variation for the measurement of maximum blood flow is 6.6%&#xD;
      determined from 2 subjects on 5 separate occasions. Using this technique the investigators&#xD;
      have previously observed alterations in skin maximum hyperaemia with type 2 diabetes and in&#xD;
      women with a previous history of gestational diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). NIRS is a non-invasive technique that assesses the change&#xD;
      in blood volume and oxygenation of the microcirculation in different tissue beds including&#xD;
      muscle and brain., it works on the same principles of ORS except that it uses a near-infrared&#xD;
      light source rather then visible light. As near-infrared (760 - 840 nm) has a longer&#xD;
      wavelength than visible light it scatter less and therefore it has an increased depth of&#xD;
      penetration which allows it to assess oxygenation in the muscle or brain where it will be&#xD;
      used in relation to our assessment of cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Insulin sensitivity will be measured at the end of the two treatment phases using a&#xD;
      hyper-insulinaemic isoglycaemic clamp (a modified version of the hyperinsulinaemic&#xD;
      euglycaemic clamp). A primed, constant rate infusion of soluble insulin (2.0 mukg per min)&#xD;
      will be administered for 180min and a variable rate infusion of 20% glucose administered to&#xD;
      maintain isoglycaemia . The isoglycaemic set point will be determined by taking the mean of&#xD;
      two fasting blood glucose measurements which will be taken on the day of vascular testing and&#xD;
      prior to the clamp. The insulin infusion will be prepared in 45 ml of 0.9% NaCI, and 5 ml of&#xD;
      the patient's blood to prevent adsorption of insulin to plastic surfaces. At 5 min intervals,&#xD;
      2 ml blood samples will be collected from a dorsal hand vein. During steady state, M is&#xD;
      calculated from glucose infusion rate and serum insulin concentration according to a simple&#xD;
      mathematical formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flow mediated vasodilatation used as a measure of the production of endothelial nitric oxide&#xD;
      to a standard stimulus (shear). As described previously and following consensus guidelines,&#xD;
      peripheral vascular endothelium-dependent (i.e. NO-mediated) vasodilatation in response to&#xD;
      forearm reactive hyperaemia will be determined by measuring the diameter change of the&#xD;
      brachial artery using linear array B-mode ultrasound and automated edge detection software&#xD;
      (MIA, Iowa, USA). Reactive hyperaemia will be induced by occlusion of blood flow to the upper&#xD;
      forearm using a cuff inflated to 250 mmHg for 5 minutes followed by rapid deflation. Blood&#xD;
      flow during reactive hyperaemia will be measured using an Ultrasound Doppler system for the&#xD;
      calculation and analysis of the shear-rate stimulus. Vascular endothelium-independent&#xD;
      vasodilatation (internal control) will be determined by the brachial artery dilatation to&#xD;
      sublingual nitroglycerine (0.4 mg). The intra-individual coefficient of variation for flow&#xD;
      mediated dilatation is 8.1%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VO2 max testing: Static bicycle exercise tests will be performed to determine oxygen uptake&#xD;
      kinetics during sub-maximal exercise and maximal oxygen uptake using standard procedures.&#xD;
      During the exercise tests, near infra-red spectroscopy will be used to measure the changes in&#xD;
      muscle oxy, deoxy and total haemoglobin which accompany exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive Function Testing: Using the E-prime program (Psychology Software Tools inc) a 30&#xD;
      minute array of cognitive function tests will be devised. The patient will complete these&#xD;
      simple tests on a laptop during the acclimatisation period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma Nitrite and Nitrate Deproteinised samples will be analysed for nitrite and nitrate&#xD;
      concentration using a Sievers nitric oxide analyser (Sievers NOA 280i, Analytix Ltd, Durham,&#xD;
      UK) and a modification of our previous chemiluminescence technique&#xD;
