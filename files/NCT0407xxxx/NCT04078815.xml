  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2014, the authors conducted a survey of key opinion leaders on ethical resuscitation&#xD;
      practices in 31 European Countries. The authors administered a comprehensive questionnaire to&#xD;
      1-2 &quot;experts&quot; from each country; subjectivity-related bias could not be excluded; however,&#xD;
      the questionnaire was actually administered twice over a 6-month period to all participants,&#xD;
      in order to confirm results' reproducibility. The questionnaire spanned across the following&#xD;
      4 domains: A: ethical practices (41 questions); B: access to best available care (39&#xD;
      questions); C: death diagnosis and organ donation (22 questions); and D: emergency care&#xD;
      organization (40 questions). Accordingly, a 142-point scoring system of the responses of the&#xD;
      participants was developed. Country-specific scores varied widely [e.g. score range of 1-41&#xD;
      for the ethical practices (domain A), and of 9-32 for emergency care organization (domain&#xD;
      D)]. The authors also found a significant association between domain A and domain D scores&#xD;
      (r2 = 0.42, P &lt; 0.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the 2014 survey highlighted variability across European countries in their&#xD;
      approach to the ethics of resuscitation/end-of-life care. Results also indicated the presence&#xD;
      of substantial need for improvements in all the aforementioned domains of practice and&#xD;
      emergency care organization On the other hand, such evolution should be substantially&#xD;
      augmented and accelerated by the above-described combination of new guidelines, RCT-based&#xD;
      support of ACP, legislation / governmental policies, and educational activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this study the authors undertake a methodologically improved version of the 2014 survey,&#xD;
      in order to test the following hypotheses: 1) compared to 2014, there may be significant&#xD;
      improvements in overall domain A to D scores for 2019, reflecting improved quality of ethical&#xD;
      practice in the field of resuscitation/end-of-life care; 2) such progress, may be more marked&#xD;
      in countries with &quot;low&quot; (i.e. below-average) domain A to D scores for 2014.&#xD;

      Background and Rationale Recently published ethical practice guidelines focus on shared&#xD;
      decision-making, patient-centred care, family-centred care, and prevention of patient&#xD;
      distress after withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments (LSTs). Furthermore, several, recent&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have provided a robust evidence-base for complex and&#xD;
      resource-demanding interventions such as advance care planning (ACP). ACP is also recommended&#xD;
      by authors of major opinion articles. In addition, new laws, governmental statements, and&#xD;
      educational activities across Europe support an autonomy-oriented end-of-life care.&#xD;

&#xD;
      METHODS Ethics Committee Approval The study protocol will be submitted for approval to the&#xD;
      Regional Ethics and Scientific Committee of Evaggelismos General Hospital of Athens, the&#xD;
      Athens Eye Clinic, and the Athens Polyclinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An eventually obtained approval will be used to support the conduct of the survey study in at&#xD;
      least 31 European countries, which are listed as follows: Austria, Belgium, Bosnia &amp;&#xD;
      Herzegovina, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,&#xD;
      Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Northern&#xD;
      Macedonia, Romania, Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden,&#xD;
      Switzerland, The Netherlands, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. Respondents from additional&#xD;
      European countries (e.g. Ireland) may also be invited to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The informed consent procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following text for potential study participants is proposed (text will be presented in&#xD;
      informed consent format):&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Helsinki declaration], participation in research has the essential&#xD;
      prerequisite of free and voluntary informed consent of the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to Regulation 679/2016 {or General Data Protection regulation (GDPR) of the&#xD;
      European Parliament and of the Council}, &quot;&quot;consent&quot; of the data subject means any freely&#xD;
      given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he&#xD;
      or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the&#xD;
      processing of personal data relating to him or her.&quot; Participation in the current survey&#xD;
      study means that the participant accepts to share his/her knowledge on ethical practices&#xD;
      (domain A), on access to best-quality care (domain B), on death diagnosis and organ donation&#xD;
      (domain C), and on emergency care organization (domain D) in their country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to GDPR, &quot;pseudonymization means the processing of personal data in such a manner&#xD;
      that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use&#xD;
      of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and&#xD;
      is subject to technical and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data are not&#xD;
      attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.&quot; A set of 50 consecutive random&#xD;
      numbers (range, 50-99) will be generated using &quot;Research Randomizer (www.randomizer.org).&#xD;
      Each one of the aforementioned numbers will be assigned to a European country (country code)&#xD;
      drawn according to alphabetic order from the list of participating European countries. Next&#xD;
      to the 2 digits of the country code, a third digit corresponding to the participant's&#xD;
      temporal order of participation relative to other participants from the same country;&#xD;
      participant's temporal order will be determined according to the exact time of completion of&#xD;
      the study questionnaire. This will form the participant's personal, 3-digit, code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on ethical practices and emergency care organization will be stored next to the&#xD;
      participant's personal code in Microsoft Excel format. This electronic Masterfile will be&#xD;
      stored onto the password-protected hard disk of the principal investigator's personal&#xD;
      computer. In addition, next to the participant's personal code, the investigators will enter&#xD;
      the following personal data 1) name; professional qualification(s) (e.g. physician, nurse,&#xD;
      paramedic, other); 2) highest academic or professional rank (e.g. professor, lead clinician,&#xD;
      lead nurse, etc.); 3) professional occupation-more than one possible (e.g. academic teaching,&#xD;
      academic research; hospital emergency department, intensive care unit, emergency medical&#xD;
      service, etc.); and 4) years of professional experience as healthcare provider, academic, or&#xD;
      both. Subsequently, personal codes and names will be copied in a second Excel file, the&#xD;
      Decoding file. Finally, all names will be removed from the Masterfile, whereas the personal,&#xD;
      3-digit codes will be retained. Consequently, the Masterfile will fulfill the criterion of&#xD;
      &quot;pseudonymization.&quot; The Masterfile data will be used for statistical analyses aimed at&#xD;
      testing the study hypotheses. In this context, and within the next 3-4 months, the authors&#xD;
      will resend to the participants the data corresponding to their responses in Excel format so&#xD;
      that they may be able to confirm data accuracy. In addition, the authors will also send to&#xD;
      participants the data corresponding to other respondents from the same country so that the&#xD;
      participant may be able to state whether he/she agrees with others' responses. In the event&#xD;
      of disagreement(s) the authors may request that a participant attempts to reach consensus&#xD;
      with the other respondents from his/her country. However, participants should note that the&#xD;
      reaching of such consensus should not in anyway be considered as &quot;mandatory&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the above, the authors request the participant's free and voluntary consent for&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Collection and storing of the above-mentioned data under password protection&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Inclusion of the above-mentioned data (at least in part) in an Acknowledgment section of&#xD;
           a published article reporting on the results of the survey study&#xD;
&#xD;
      As essential prerequisites for consent validity we ask you to respond to the following&#xD;
      questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Has the participant read / understood the above-presented information? B) Has the&#xD;
      participant had adequate time to consider granting their consent for the use of their&#xD;
      personal data? C) If the participant asked any questions about any aspect of the survey&#xD;
      study, did they receive satisfactory replies from the study investigator? D) Does the&#xD;
      participant understand that he/she may withdraw their consent at any time until the&#xD;
      publication of the survey study results? E) Does the participant understand that after&#xD;
      publication of the study results and dissemination of their personal data, it may become not&#xD;
      possible to reverse such dissemination? F) Does the participant agree with the aforementioned&#xD;
      procedure of pseudonymization and subsequent dissemination of their personal data?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Potential study participants from the European countries will be contacted via e-mail&#xD;
      and invited for an investigators meeting during the 2019 Resuscitation Congress, September&#xD;
      19-21, Ljubljana, Slovenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant inclusion criteria are presented in the relevant section To reduce the risk of&#xD;
      subjectivity-related bias, there will be a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 5 participants from&#xD;
      each one of the aforementioned European countries; responses will not be excluded from the&#xD;
      analyses if originating from less than 3 participants. Following obtainment of consent,&#xD;
      participants will be able to electronically access the questionnaire through Typeform&#xD;
      (www.typeform.com). As an example, the 2014 questionnaire is still accessible at&#xD;
      https://erc.typeform.com/to/dZjrOQ. The study questionnaire is summarized in Table 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As in the authors' 2014 survey study, respondents will have to choose either among 4 options,&#xD;
      i.e. never, sometimes, usually and always or between no and yes. Respondents will also be&#xD;
      asked to comment on domain subsections. Subsequently, responses of never/sometimes and&#xD;
      usually/always will be respectively grouped as no and yes, because never/sometimes does not&#xD;
      and usually/always does reflect common/everyday practice. All data will be entered in an&#xD;
      Excel Masterfile. Participants from each country will be asked to reconfirm their answers&#xD;
      after a period of approximately 3-4 months (procedure detailed above); they will also be&#xD;
      asked whether they agree or disagree with answers provided by other participants of the same&#xD;
      country. In cases of disagreement, the authors will encourage resolution through consensus.&#xD;
      For data analysis, the authors will use a dichotomous quantitizing approach by grading a&#xD;
      positive response with 1 and a negative response with 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As stated above, the authors will encourage consensus-based resolution of discrepancies among&#xD;
      respondents from each country. Full details of each case of discrepant responses will be&#xD;
      recorded. Subsequently, for each survey question and country, mean response grades will be&#xD;
      calculated and used in the data analyses. In the absence of discrepant responses, or&#xD;
      following a consensus, response grades will either have the value of 1 or 0. In cases of&#xD;
      failure to reach consensus, response grades will have non-integer, positive values below the&#xD;
      value of 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outcomes For the 2019 survey, Domain A, B, C, and D subcomponent and total scores will&#xD;
      by calculated by summing up the corresponding response grades; this specific, summation&#xD;
      procedure will not take into account the grades of responses to &quot;new&quot; questions included only&#xD;
      in the 2019 questionnaire (Table 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the presence / absence of statistically significant differences&#xD;
      between 2014 and 2019 in Domain A to D total scores of all participating countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome will be the presence / absence of statistically significant differences&#xD;
      between 2014 and 2019 in Domain A to D total scores of countries with &quot;low&quot; Domain total&#xD;
      scores in 2014. The latter &quot;low&quot; 2014 scores will be defined as Domain total scores lower&#xD;
      than the corresponding, overall mean score values of 2014; more specifically, &quot;low&quot; 2014&#xD;
      total scores for Domain A, B, C, and D will be those not exceeding the values of 18, 7, 12,&#xD;
      and 23, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the above, &quot;high&quot; (or above-average) 2014 total scores for Domains A, B, C, and&#xD;
      D will be those exceeding the values of 18, 7, 12, and 23, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tertiary outcome will be the presence / absence of statistically significant differences&#xD;
      between changes in &quot;low&quot; 2014 Domain total scores from 2014 to 2019, and changes in &quot;high&quot;&#xD;
      2014 Domain total scores from 2014 to 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of Statistical analyses As previously, the normalities of the distributions of domain&#xD;
      and subcomponent scores will be determined by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Data will be reported&#xD;
      as number, number (percentage), and mean±SD or median (interquartile range), as appropriate.&#xD;
      Comparisons pertaining to the primary, secondary, and tertiary outcome will be conducted&#xD;
      using an independent samples t-test or the Mann Whitney exact U test as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As previously, bivariate linear regression will be performed to explore possible associations&#xD;
      between the 2019 Domain A and D total scores. These analyses will include 1) the 2019 total&#xD;
      scores calculated as reported above; and 2) the 2019 total scores after the addition of the&#xD;
      grades of the responses to the &quot;new - 2019-only&quot; questions. All analyses will be performed&#xD;
      using SPSS version 24.&#xD;
