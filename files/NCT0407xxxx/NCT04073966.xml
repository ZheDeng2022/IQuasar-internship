  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastases are a source of much morbidity and mortality in adults with primary solid&#xD;
      malignant tumors. With improvements in systemic therapy that prolong survival but have&#xD;
      limited central nervous system penetration, patients with brain metastases are at increasing&#xD;
      risk of developing and experiencing long-term side effects from treatment of brain&#xD;
      metastases. The overarching goal of this study is to better understand the determinants of&#xD;
      RT-associated changes in white and gray matter function and associated neurocognitive&#xD;
      decline.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The proposed study aims to provide novel and useful information for clinicians, both to help&#xD;
      predict potential neurocognitive changes following SRS, and as a possible guide for SRS&#xD;
      treatment alteration, whether through adjustment of dose or beam arrangements in relation to&#xD;
      white matter tracts. In this observational pilot study of 20 patients, the association&#xD;
      between RT-associated brain injury and neurocognitive function will be quantitatively&#xD;
      assessed longitudinally over one year following SRS. The study team hypothesizes that, over&#xD;
      this time, (1) there will be radiation dose-dependent reductions in regional white matter&#xD;
      tract integrity and reduction in functional connectivity in the default mode network of gray&#xD;
      matter, (2) there will be measurable decline in neurocognitive function, and (3) there will&#xD;
      be an association between severity of radiation-induced brain injury on MRI and magnitude of&#xD;
      neurocognitive functional decline. This association will relate, in part, to the location(s)&#xD;
      affected.&#xD;
