  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial testing a peri- and post-discharge pharmacist-led medication&#xD;
      management intervention on post-discharge utilization, including both readmissions and&#xD;
      emergency department visits within 30 days of discharge. The intervention incorporates&#xD;
      evidence addressing three main areas: medication reconciliation, medication adherence, and&#xD;
      polypharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study uses a pragmatic trial randomized at the patient level and conducted in two large&#xD;
      hospitals to achieve the following aims, each of which has been designed using the RE-AIM&#xD;
      framework:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To test the effect of PHARM-DC on post-discharge utilization among patients most at&#xD;
      risk for post-discharge ADEs: recently discharged older adults taking &gt;10 medications or &gt;3&#xD;
      high-risk medications using a prospective, randomized, pragmatic multi-site study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To study barriers and facilitators of implementing PHARM-DC using a qualitative study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To analyze the costs of PHARM-DC, including the incremental cost per readmission&#xD;
      averted and the net incremental cost from the health system perspective using a&#xD;
      time-and-motion study and a cost-effectiveness analysis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are three components to this study: (1) the prospective, randomized, controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT), which includes a pharmacist-led hospital discharge care intervention, (2) the&#xD;
      qualitative study, which involves focus groups and interviews, and (3) a cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      study, which involves a review of the literature and a time-and-motion study component.For&#xD;
      all three studies, there are two sites: CSMC and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.&#xD;
      Additionally, Dr. Kennelty of University of Iowa will participate in the qualitative study.1.&#xD;
      For the RCT: Eligible patients will be identified through the use of a daily Epic report&#xD;
      using inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients will be randomized by a study coordinator to the&#xD;
      intervention arm or control arm. For the control arm, patients will receive usual care, which&#xD;
      includes medication reconciliation at hospital admission. For the intervention arm, pharmacy&#xD;
      staff will address medication reconciliation at hospital discharge, medication review, and&#xD;
      medication adherence. Most intervention activities will occur during the hospital stay or&#xD;
      during a post-discharge phone call. We estimate a total number of 4,888 patients per study&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. For the qualitative study: This is a qualitative study employing focus groups aimed at&#xD;
      understanding implementation barriers and facilitators. Dr. Kennelty and study staff will&#xD;
      conduct 3-day site visits to hold focus groups and/or interviews regarding intervention&#xD;
      expectations, how the intervention is being implemented, barriers/facilitators to adoption&#xD;
      and implementation, and adaptations made during delivery. Towards the end of the trial, Dr.&#xD;
      Kennelty and study staff will use phone interviews to determine any changes to the&#xD;
      implementation of PHARM-DC that occurred during the RCT, as well as to understand whether and&#xD;
      how institutions will address the maintenance of PHARM-DC after the study ends. We estimate&#xD;
      that up to 180 people may participate in this qualitative study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. For the cost-effectiveness study: This is a time-and-motion study aimed at understanding&#xD;
      how much time during the day pharmacists spend on activities related to the hospital&#xD;
      discharge (and post-discharge) interventions. During the trial, we will use time and motion&#xD;
      methodology to understand how much pharmacist time is needed for PHARM-DC. Coupled with data&#xD;
      on post-discharge utilization, this will enable us to conduct economic analyses.&#xD;

    <description>Pharmacists will address medication reconciliation, medication adherence, and polypharmacy issues as appropriate. Pharmacists will rely most on their prior training, but study investigators will also encourage the use of documentation templates with reminders, Beers list, deprescribing, motivational interviewing, the Medication Adherence and Literacy tool, and post-discharge phone calls.&#xD;
Pharmacists will assess patient needs and customize accordingly. All patients will receive one discharge counseling visit and one post-discharge phone call, but pharmacists will find that some patients need further phone calls, interventions, referrals, or other interactions. Some or all of the pharmacist activities may take place over the phone.</description>
