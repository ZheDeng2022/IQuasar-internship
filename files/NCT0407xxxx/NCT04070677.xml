  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation-induced esophagitis is an acute, dose-limiting toxicity in oncologic treatment.&#xD;
      Since it can lead to interruption of treatment, hospitalization, and even death, clinicians&#xD;
      should be aware of this condition as an adverse effect of oncologic therapies, in order to&#xD;
      prevent interruption of treatment, as it has been associated with reduced survival. ZIVEREL®&#xD;
      is a new, over-the-counter medical device that comes as an oral solution in a 10-ml stick&#xD;
      pack. It is composed of hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, and poloxamer 407 and Women&#xD;
      plays a role in the symptomatic relief of esophagitis induced by radiotherapy alone or&#xD;
      radiochemotherapy in oncologic patients. ZIVEREL® acts naturally and exerts a protective&#xD;
      action by reinforcing the effect of the elements that make up the extracellular matrix, where&#xD;
      the connective tissue provides the architecture, proteoglycans maintain the fluid-electrolyte&#xD;
      balance, and glycoproteins maintain the intracellular substrate responsible for cell-cell&#xD;
      reactions and cell-matrix reactions. The objective of this study is to evaluate whether&#xD;
      administration of ZIVEREL® diminishes the grade of acute radiation-induced esophagitis and&#xD;
      the incidence of severe esophagitis in oncologic patients treated with radiotherapy or&#xD;
      radiochemotherapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hyaluronic acid is a glycosaminoglycan formed by glucuronic acid and N acetylglucosamine&#xD;
      disaccharide units. It is found mainly in the extracellular matrix of the loose connective&#xD;
      tissue and is associated with several key processes, including cell signaling and repair, as&#xD;
      well as with tissue generation, morphogenesis, and structural organization of the&#xD;
      extracellular matrix itself. In clinical terms, its role is well known in conditions such as&#xD;
      mouth ulcers, where its barrier effect relieves symptoms. Chondroitin sulfate forms part of&#xD;
      the glycosaminoglycan group in the extracellular matrix, which is in turn formed by&#xD;
      D-glucuronic acid and N-acetylgalactosamine. It has been shown to protect the epithelium of&#xD;
      the esophageal mucosa by shielding the epithelial areas damaged by acid, thus diminishing&#xD;
      catabolic activity and inhibiting proteolytic enzymes (e.g., metalloproteases, collagenase,&#xD;
      or elastase). Chondroitin sulfate also regulates several inflammatory mediators (TNF-α,&#xD;
      IL-1β, COX-2, PGE2, and NFκB) and reduces the synthesis of nitric oxide, which is involved in&#xD;
      the inflammatory cascade. Polaxamer 407 is a bioadhesive component that acquires the active&#xD;
      ingredients of ZIVEREL® adhere to the damaged mucosa and are not dragged away by the&#xD;
      ingestion of food and liquids.&#xD;

    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 (version 3). The QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items.&#xD;
Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale.&#xD;
All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems</description>
