  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective at preventing HIV infection but requires&#xD;
      high levels of medication adherence, particularly among women. The purpose of this proposal&#xD;
      is to evaluate the clinical impact and mechanisms of a family-based storytelling intervention&#xD;
      (vs. couples counseling) to improve PrEP adherence and retention among at-risk&#xD;
      pregnant/lactating women and their HIV-infected male partners in rural Mozambique. This&#xD;
      potentially high impact intervention provides the opportunity to test a culturally relevant&#xD;
      approach to PrEP engagement; if proven feasible and effective, family-based storytelling for&#xD;
      PrEP engagement could be adopted to reduce HIV incidence among pregnant/lactating women and&#xD;
      eliminate mother-to-child transmission (MTCT).&#xD;

      Project Summary: Pregnancy and the postpartum period are associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      HIV acquisition. HIV acquisition is of particular concern during pregnancy and while the&#xD;
      mother is breastfeeding given the associated increased risk of mother-to-child transmission&#xD;
      (MTCT). Approximately 10% of pregnant women attending antenatal care (ANC) in Mozambique are&#xD;
      in serodiscordant relationships (HIV-negative woman/ HIV-positive man). High rates of MTCT&#xD;
      (14%; 12,000 infants/ year) may be affected by the high rate at which pregnant women&#xD;
      seroconvert after their first ANC visit. Beginning in 2018, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)&#xD;
      was available to serodiscordant couples, yet only 44% of pregnant women were retained in care&#xD;
      at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our current R01-funded project, Partners-based HIV Treatment for Seroconcordant Couples&#xD;
      (R01MH113478), is testing a couple-based intervention for HIV-positive expectant parents&#xD;
      living in extremely rural communities. Our Men for Health intervention (&quot;Homens para Sa√∫de+&quot;-&#xD;
      HoPS+) consists of (1) couple-based HIV care and treatment; (2) couple-centered education;&#xD;
      and (3) expert-patient support. Preliminary data the HoPS+ study suggest that couple-based&#xD;
      counseling and education is more successful at reducing maternal depression than individual&#xD;
      care. However, couple-based sessions have not led to significantly greater improvements in&#xD;
      HIV knowledge or social support. Given the importance of these factors on treatment&#xD;
      adherence, this grant would allow us to revise the peer engagement strategy to increase&#xD;
      knowledge transfer and engender partner support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose testing the impact of a peer-delivered oral storytelling&#xD;
      intervention to increase retention in, and adherence to, PrEP/ART among expectant&#xD;
      serodiscordant couples. People are 7 times more likely to remember a story compared to facts&#xD;
      alone. Couples are also highly influenced by their immediate and extended families; &gt;95% of&#xD;
      patients disclose their HIV status to members of their family. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that the use of oral storytelling will facilitate learning and encourage family support and&#xD;
      advocacy. The investigator will compare this model to couple-based education and counseling.&#xD;
      This innovative intervention tests a culturally relevant approach to improve ART/PrEP&#xD;
      delivery. The investigators propose a rigorous individually randomized controlled trial at&#xD;
      one of our current HoPS+ sites where 11% of expectant couples were serodiscordant in 2018.&#xD;
      The investigators will randomize 35 HIV-uninfected pregnant women and their HIV-infected&#xD;
      partners to either the intervention or control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Specific Aims of this study are: (1) Compare the effect of a storytelling intervention&#xD;
      (vs. couples-based counseling) on participant knowledge, motivation, and behavioral skills&#xD;
      associated with PrEP retention and adherence; and (2) Evaluate the impact of a storytelling&#xD;
      intervention on adherence to PrEP/ART medications. Our team of Mozambican and U.S.&#xD;
      investigators has a proven record of international HIV research success, specific recent&#xD;
      experience with partner-based HIV and PrEP delivery, and experience with the use of&#xD;
      theater/storytelling to change HIV-related behaviors.&#xD;
