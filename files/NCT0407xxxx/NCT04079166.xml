  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if a new treatment called SCIB1 can be used safely&#xD;
      when added to pembrolizumab (Keytruda), a standard therapy approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      advanced melanoma (skin cancer). Pembrolizumab is an antibody treatment for cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also look to see if SCIB1 can increase the likelihood that melanoma patients&#xD;
      will respond to pembrolizumab, and also if SCIB1 can help to make those responses last&#xD;
      longer. Pembrolizumab is considered a standard treatment for patients with advanced melanoma.&#xD;
      SCIB1 is considered experimental. SCIB1 has been given to melanoma patients in an earlier&#xD;
      study. It was generally well-tolerated, and researchers saw some signs that it may help to&#xD;
      stimulate the immune system, which is a way in which the body can fight the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is expected to enroll up to 44 melanoma patients worldwide.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single arm Phase 2 study to determine the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      SCIB1 administered to patients with advanced melanoma using an electroporation device (the&#xD;
      TDS-IM v2.0 device) when added to pembrolizumab (Keytruda), a standard treatment already&#xD;
      approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plan for this study is for SCIB1 to be given for up to 85 weeks, in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab according to the current label.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving the first dose of SCIB1, the patient will receive SCIB1 at 4, 7, 13 and 25&#xD;
      weeks, then every 12 weeks until Week 85. Pembrolizumab treatment will be started 1 week&#xD;
      after the first dose of SCIB1 and given every 6 weeks up to Week 85.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab will be given by an injection into the patient's vein. The injection, known as&#xD;
      an infusion, usually takes about 30 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each occasion, SCIB1 will be given by two injections into a muscle in a different limb,&#xD;
      e.g., one into the upper arm and the other into the thigh. Instead of a normal needle and&#xD;
      syringe, a small, hand-held device, TDS-IM v2.0, will be used to inject SCIB1 into the&#xD;
      muscles. The site of SCIB1 administration will alternate on each occasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The injection device is designed to increase the amount of SCIB1 that is delivered to the&#xD;
      muscle cells. The liquid containing SCIB1 will be delivered through the injection needle.&#xD;
      Immediately after the injection, the device will give an electrical impulse to the muscle&#xD;
      through the four thin wires at the site of the injection. The impulse will last for less than&#xD;
      one tenth of a second. A short video will be shown to the patient before the first injection&#xD;
      is given to show the patient what will happen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before treatment starts and after consent has been given, all patients will undergo screening&#xD;
      tests (to be completed within 28 days of treatment initiation) to ensure the patient is&#xD;
      eligible to take part. For screening, the patient will need to undergo tissue typing, a&#xD;
      melanoma tumor biopsy will be required if an adequate sample for testing was not previously&#xD;
      performed, an eye examination, blood and urine samples taken for clinical laboratory tests,&#xD;
      pregnancy status (for female patients only), tests of their immune functions, a physical&#xD;
      examination including their vital signs, performance status and an electrocardiogram (ECG), a&#xD;
      computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan plus a visual&#xD;
      inspection and photographing of any skin lesions, skin fold thickness measurement, and&#xD;
      medical history collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the 85-week treatment period, the patient will visit the hospital 25 times and have two&#xD;
      telephone/video calls. They will then have an end of treatment (EOT) visit approximately 4&#xD;
      weeks after the last dose of SCIB1 or pembrolizumab (whichever occurs last) and a final&#xD;
      post-treatment follow-up visit 12 weeks after the last dose of study treatment (SCIB1 or&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, whichever occurs last). The evaluations and procedures that will be carried&#xD;
      out at each visit are all detailed in the study information sheets given to the patient&#xD;
      before consent is taken. At some of these visits, blood samples will be taken for&#xD;
      immunological tests. Female participants of childbearing potential will undergo pregnancy&#xD;
      testing during screening, at the start of treatment, 7 weeks after the first dose of SCIB1,&#xD;
      every 6 weeks until the end of the treatment period and at the EOT visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At certain visits, all patients will have physical examinations and have their skin lesions&#xD;
      assessed and photographed. At all visits, patients will be asked about other medications they&#xD;
      are taking and about any adverse effects they might have experienced since their previous&#xD;
      clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the treatment burden for patients has also been reduced&#xD;
      where possible by conducting remote assessments via telephone or video conference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving their last dose of SCIB1 or pembrolizumab (whichever occurs last), all&#xD;
      surviving participants will be followed up by attending clinic visits for tumor assessments&#xD;
      (including CT/MRI scans) every 12 weeks for a period of 97 weeks (~2 years) from the first&#xD;
      dose of SCIB1, unless disease progression occurs or a new anticancer treatment is initiated.&#xD;
      If disease progression does occur or a new anticancer treatment is initiated, follow-up every&#xD;
      12 weeks (up to Week 97) may be conducted by a healthcare professional by telephone/video&#xD;
      conference call or during a routine clinic visit. At each assessment questions will be asked&#xD;
      about the following: survival, development of infection, immunological reactions,&#xD;
      participation in any other clinical trials and subsequent exposure to highly potent&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;

    <description>The plan for this research study is for SCIB1 to be given for up to 85 weeks, in combination with pembrolizumab according to the current label.&#xD;
After receiving the first dose of SCIB1, the patient will receive SCIB1 at 4, 7, 13 and 25 weeks, then every 12 weeks up to Week 85. Pembrolizumab treatment will be started 1 week after the first dose of SCIB1 and given every 6 weeks.&#xD;
Pembrolizumab will be given by an infusion into the patient's vein. This normally takes about 30 minutes to complete.&#xD;
On each occasion, SCIB1 will be given by two injections into a muscle in a different limb, e.g. one into the upper arm and the other into the thigh. Instead of a normal needle and syringe, a small, hand-held electroporation device (TDS-IM v2.0) will be used to inject SCIB1 into the muscles.</description>
