  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization (WHO) defines three levels of problematic alcohol use;&#xD;
      hazardous drinking (HD) (which puts a person at risk of developing health/social problems),&#xD;
      harmful drinking (where health/social problems are already occurring), and alcohol dependence&#xD;
      (where serious problems have already occurred). Although HD and harmful drinking affects a&#xD;
      larger proportion of the population (and causes many more problems) than alcohol dependence,&#xD;
      Indian health policy focuses mainly on institutional delivery of care for alcohol dependence.&#xD;
      Extensive evidence globally demonstrates the effectiveness of Brief Interventions (BIs) in&#xD;
      reducing drinking in HD. However, in India, barriers to providing such treatments are the&#xD;
      inequitable distribution of trained healthcare professionals and concerns about the cultural&#xD;
      generalisability of interventions developed in the West. Mobile phone technology like SMS&#xD;
      (Short Messaging Service) and interactive voice response (IVR) can deliver BIs to large&#xD;
      numbers of HDs, quickly and at low cost, as demonstrated in smoking cessation interventions.&#xD;
      Furthermore, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that following a systematic methodology&#xD;
      to culturally adapt psychosocial interventions increases acceptability by recipients and&#xD;
      delivery agents, and feasibility of delivery. The overall objective of AMBIT is to develop a&#xD;
      contextually appropriate BI for HD that can be delivered using mobile phone technology to&#xD;
      overcome barriers to access in low resource settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary formative research has informed the development of the first version of the&#xD;
      treatment package, which was tested through a case series, by refining the intervention&#xD;
      content and delivery through an iterative process, to develop the final intervention. This&#xD;
      pilot Randomised Control Trial (RCT) will aim to empirically evaluate the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability, as well as preliminary impact of the BI, and fine-tune the procedures for a&#xD;
      definitive RCT. It therefore does not have clear hypotheses, but instead different primary&#xD;
      objectives, which are listed in the following.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the feasibility of delivering the mobile-based BI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the acceptability of delivering the mobile-based BI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To inform sample size calculation (based on preliminary estimate of effectiveness) and&#xD;
           refine procedures for a definitive RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To refine the mobile-based BI package for a definitive RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess the impact of the mobile-based BI, on treatment outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The AMBIT study is aimed at developing and evaluating a mobile based BI for hazardous&#xD;
      drinkers in Goa-India. The first version of the treatment package was developed through&#xD;
      formative research, and tested through a case series, to develop the final intervention. This&#xD;
      pilot Randomised Control Trial (RCT) will aim to empirically evaluate the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability and preliminary impact of the BI, and fine-tune the procedures for a definitive&#xD;
      RCT. This protocol will serve as a research framework for the implementation of the proposed&#xD;
      pilot RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the feasibility of delivering the mobile-based BI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the acceptability of delivering the mobile-based BI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To inform sample size calculation (based on preliminary estimate of effectiveness) and&#xD;
           refine procedures for a definitive RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To refine the mobile-based BI package for a definitive RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess the impact of the mobile-based BI, on treatment outcomes. METHODS Study&#xD;
           sample- A sample of 120 participants will be recruited; approximately evenly spread out&#xD;
           across all study settings and interventions. The sample size is not based on formal&#xD;
           power calculations as the study is not designed to test a hypothesis. The sample size&#xD;
           estimations have been made based on our previous experiences of pilot RCTs and deemed&#xD;
           sufficient to achieve the goals of understanding the acceptability, feasibility, and&#xD;
           preliminary impact of an intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Procedure- In all three settings, researchers, who will identify hazardous&#xD;
      drinkers through appropriate screening procedures. Eligible participants will be invited to&#xD;
      join the study if they provide voluntary consent to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In educational institutions and workplaces: At educational institutions and workplaces&#xD;
      participant recruitment will be nested within the health and wellness camp (previously tested&#xD;
      during the formative research phase), that includes screening for two other health-related&#xD;
      issues (Perceived Stress and Physical Activity) aside from AUD screening. This is done to&#xD;
      overcome resistance to entering screening for an alcohol-related program, due to cultural&#xD;
      stigma around alcohol consumption. It is expected that by introducing screening for a range&#xD;
      of health issues, this issue will be mitigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In PHCs: The researchers will perform universal screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will also be done through referrals from the following sources:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self: Potential participants will learn about our program through advertising (e.g.&#xD;
           banners, posters and leaflets) and then approach a researcher for screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gatekeepers: (e.g. At Colleges: Faculty/Students; At workplaces: Human Resource [HR]&#xD;
           officials/peers; At PHC's: Medical officers and PHC staff): The researchers will seek&#xD;
           assistance from these gatekeepers to build awareness about the project, and refer&#xD;
           potential participants to the researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening tools: All participants will be screened using the AUDIT to identify hazardous&#xD;
      drinking (Saunders, 1993). Other tools that will be used as part of the 'Health and Wellness&#xD;
      Camp' will include the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) (Booth, 2000),&#xD;
      and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (Cohen, Kamarck, &amp; Mermelstein, 1983).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AUDIT is a 10 item screening tool developed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) for the&#xD;
      detection of AUD. It has been validated in India (Pal et al., 2004), used in cross-national&#xD;
      studies, and used in the study setting (Nadkarni, 2017). For a previous study, the AUDIT has&#xD;
      been translated into Konkani (Goan vernacular), using a systematic translation-back&#xD;
      translation method with two teams of translators, followed by an item-by item analysis and&#xD;
      selection by consensus (Silva et al., 2003). The AUDIT is used to identify AUDs and&#xD;
      categorise it into hazardous drinking (score of 8-15), harmful drinking (16-19) and dependent&#xD;
      drinking (&gt;20) The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a widely used instrument for measuring&#xD;
      perception of stress. It has been empirically validated (Lee et al, 2012) with college&#xD;
      students and workers and translated into 25 languages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) is widely used to measure health&#xD;
      related physical activity, and has acceptable measurement properties for use in many settings&#xD;
      and in different languages, and is suitable for use among young and middle-aged adults (15-69&#xD;
      years).(Lee et al, 2011)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible participants will be informed about the study, taken through the informed&#xD;
      consent process and requested to provide written consent to participate. The researcher will&#xD;
      ensure that any queries about the intervention are resolved. All consent procedures will be&#xD;
      audio-recorded with the permission of the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Procedure- Stratified randomisation will be used. Consenting eligible participants&#xD;
      will be stratified into three strata, based on the recruitment site- educational&#xD;
      institutions, workplaces and PHCs. Consenting participants from each stratum will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive our intervention (AMBIT), face-to-face BI or active control. An&#xD;
      independent data manager will generate a randomisation list and participants will be&#xD;
      randomised using Sequentially Numbered Opaque Sealed Envelopes to maximise allocation&#xD;
      concealment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline measures administered to consenting participants include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Data about potential confounders through a socio-demographic form, such as age, gender,&#xD;
           employment status, educational status, and marital status. In addition, we will collect&#xD;
           information required for the delivery of the intervention such as preferred days/time to&#xD;
           receive the SMS/IVR, preference for SMS and/or IVR (For the participants receiving the&#xD;
           mobile-based intervention)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. TLFB (Time Line Follow Back method): The TLFB is a calendar method of collecting data&#xD;
           about quantity and frequency of drinking. The TLFB has high test-retest reliability and&#xD;
           concurrent validity has been established in various types of AUD. The TLFB has been used&#xD;
           in previous research at the study site (Nadkarni, 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adding to the primary and secondary outcomes mentioned in other parts of this registration,&#xD;
      process indicators will be collected. These include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of participants screened for AUDs in each setting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number and proportion of participants screened positive for HD on AUDIT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number and proportion of participants consenting for the treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number and proportion of dropouts during the 8 week treatment (Dropouts are defined as&#xD;
           participants choosing to stop receiving the intervention messages)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reasons for refusal to participate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reasons for drop-out&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of participants choosing SMS vs IVR vs both&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of participants that listen to the complete IVR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of participants with high engagement (defined as response to more than 50% of&#xD;
           messages).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number and proportion of participants completing outcome assessment Nested qualitative&#xD;
           study- Qualitative outcome interviews will also be conducted with a sub-sample of&#xD;
           participants after outcome assessment to gain insight into the impact of the&#xD;
           mobile-based BI on the hazardous drinker. We will purposively select treatment&#xD;
           completers and drop-outs, those who reduce drinking and those who do not, to understand&#xD;
           their perceptions of the treatment and suggestions to improve the intervention. An&#xD;
           interview guide will be developed which focuses on understanding acceptability,&#xD;
           feasibility and perceived impact of the mobile based BI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study researchers will submit a daily log on the challenges faced in recruitment at each site&#xD;
      to the project coordinator during recruitment. Researchers will also send information on the&#xD;
      number of participants recruited each day to the project data manager as per the daily case&#xD;
      reporting form. The coordinator will provide daily supervision via phone call, review the&#xD;
      daily logs and visit each site weekly. Any challenges will be addressed by the Project&#xD;
      Coordinator over the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As soon as a participant is recruited to the mobile-based BI, contact information (excluding&#xD;
      name) along with relevant details such as treatment preferences will be shared with VIAMO's&#xD;
      project manager. The project data manager will be responsible to upload participant details&#xD;
      on VIAMO's platform within 24 hours post-recruitment. Upon receiving study participant&#xD;
      details through the VIAMO platform, VIAMO's project manager will be responsible to initiate&#xD;
      mobile based intervention with participants no later than 48 hours upon receiving participant&#xD;
      details. Accordingly, every participant will receive the mobile based BI for 8 weeks. The&#xD;
      data manager and program coordinator will monitor the delivery of the intervention for each&#xD;
      participant and export data from the VIAMO platform on a weekly basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data transfer and storage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      oBaseline and outcome data will be collected by the Researcher using the tablet devices which&#xD;
      will have pre-programmed check rules. The treatment data will be exported via the VIAMO&#xD;
      platform as an excel file on a weekly basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      oAll data from the VIAMO platform and tablet data will be downloaded weekly on a dedicated&#xD;
      computer with internet connection and updated antivirus software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      oCSV data files will be downloaded by site and merged using a CSV file merge utility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      oThe merged file will be saved in a folder (categorised by the week) and backed up on to the&#xD;
      server. The weekly file will be additionally backed up on an external hard drive as an&#xD;
      additional safety measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      oThe Data Manager will be responsible for counting and checking the forms received from the&#xD;
      sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      oA log of missing forms or incomplete data (if any) will be reported to the concerned&#xD;
      researcher by the Data Manager and the same will be received within two working days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      oVerified paper forms will be entered into STAR software system running on desktops or on an&#xD;
      excel spreadsheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      oAll CSV files will be converted into Excel/SPSS/Stata file format.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Storage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant details and confidential information collected on the consent form will be safely&#xD;
      stored in a cupboard, which will be locked and the keys will be in the custody of the Data&#xD;
      Manager. Secure transfer of the forms from the data team to outcome evaluations team will be&#xD;
      done by the data entry assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative- Baseline characteristics of individuals who consented and did not consent, and&#xD;
      participants who did and did not complete outcome assessments, as will baseline&#xD;
      characteristics of participants in the intervention arms versus those in the control arm,&#xD;
      will be presented as proportions or means. The process indicators will be presented&#xD;
      consistent with CONSORT guidelines (Moher et al, 2001) including a trial flow chart. The&#xD;
      primary analysis will be intention-to-treat at the 2 month end-point regardless of treatment&#xD;
      adherence, adjusted for baseline AUDIT. Regression analysis will be conducted for the&#xD;
      treatment outcomes. Effect sizes will be reported as mean differences and standardised mean&#xD;
      differences with 95% confidence intervals for continuous outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative- Thematic analysis will be used to analyse the qualitative data from the outcome&#xD;
      interviews, using Nvivo version 11. Analysis will involve generation of codes from raw data.&#xD;
      Themes will be derived by retrieving pieces of data pertaining to codes and by examining&#xD;
      their meaning in relation to the research questions (acceptability of the content and&#xD;
      delivery of the mobile-based BI, engagement barriers, impact on drinking).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTPUT At the end of the pilot RCT, data obtained will be used to frame a contextually&#xD;
      adapted BI for HD that can be further tested for cost effectiveness in a definitive RCT. The&#xD;
      learnings from the pilot RCT will be synthesised to refine procedures for a definitive RCT&#xD;
      and the preliminary understanding of effect sizes will be used to plan sample size for a&#xD;
      subsequent definitive RCT.&#xD;
