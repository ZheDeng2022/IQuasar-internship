  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study aimed to determine the alcohol intake symptoms and alcohol metabolism&#xD;
      before and 12 months after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) by evaluating blood alcohol content (BAC)&#xD;
      and urinary alcohol metabolite levels against the amount of alcohol consumed to reveal the&#xD;
      occurrence of any AUD..&#xD;

      The sample size was selected based on the number of obese patients who underwent SG at our&#xD;
      Bariatric Center of Excellence IFSO-EC over the last 12 months, and the end-time of&#xD;
      evaluation was estimated independently due to the lack of high evidence-based studies, such&#xD;
      as randomized trials or meta-analyses, focusing on the impact of alcohol on the bariatric&#xD;
      population. Considering the requirement of 200 patients to obtain a 95% confidence level, a&#xD;
      sample size of 30 patients was selected to achieve a confidence interval (margin of error) of&#xD;
      16.54. Data were collected and analyzed as mean and standard deviation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria were patients aged 21-60 years with BMI of 35-49 kg/m2 who were planned to&#xD;
      undergo primary SG and agreed to participate in the study and undergo evaluation before and&#xD;
      after SG. Exclusion criteria were non-drinker, previous history of alcoholism, T2D diagnosed&#xD;
      based on the ADA criteria for diabetes 2016, hepatic cirrhosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis&#xD;
      or hepatitis C/cirrhosis, previous resective gastrointestinal surgery (elective or emergent),&#xD;
      previous bariatric procedures, and cholelithiasis (symptomatic or asymptomatic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of wine to be consumed was calculated based on the patient's total water body mass&#xD;
      at the time of measurement (0-6-12 months) because alcohol is distributed throughout the&#xD;
      entire water body mass without adhering to plasma proteins and its solubility in fat and&#xD;
      bones is undetectable. The amount of wine (mL) was calculated using the following formula&#xD;
      reported by Maluenda et al.: 3.6 × total body water (TBW). Body mass composition was measured&#xD;
      using BIA 101 ASE (Akern SRL, Firenze, Italy) after 2-h fasting and emptying the bladder and&#xD;
      analyzed using the Bodygram Plus software V.1.0 (Akern SRL, Firenze, Italy). The red wine&#xD;
      Madreselva containing 14% of alcohol per liter, which is certified for standard alcohol level&#xD;
      at packaging and durability of over 3 years, was kindly provided by the local factory Casal&#xD;
      del Giglio. At time 0, BAC was measured using an ethanol assay kit (DiaSys Diagnostic Systems&#xD;
      GmbH) at 15, 30, and 60 mins and then every 30 min after alcohol intake until the ethanol&#xD;
      level of 0 g/L was obtained. Six hours of fasting before and after wine consumption were&#xD;
      observed. Blood examination was repeated at 6 and 12 months after SG. At time 0 and 12 months&#xD;
      after SG, the urinary metabolite (ethanol and acetaldehyde) levels were evaluated after&#xD;
      urinary bladder filling for 2 h and the liver function [albumin, aspartate aminotransferase&#xD;
      (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), bilirubin, lactate&#xD;
      dehydrogenase (LD), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), uric acid, and INR] was evaluated to detect&#xD;
      alcohol-induced changes. Each patient's subjective attitude to alcohol consumption was&#xD;
      evaluated at 0- and 12-months using alcohol use disorder identification test (AUDIT); score ≥&#xD;
      8 was considered to indicate alcohol dependence and those patients were excluded as per the&#xD;
      study criteria. The perception of symptoms, including the most common symptoms of&#xD;
      alcoholization (euphoria and diaphoresis) and intoxication (anxiety, nausea/vomiting, and&#xD;
      flushing), after alcohol consumption was evaluated using a newly developed symptom&#xD;
      alcoholization post obesity surgery (SAPoS) scoring system (not validated). This scoring&#xD;
      system was created based on the experience gained during clinical check-ups and investigates&#xD;
      the symptoms occurring after alcohol consumption. The data on BAC at 0-6-12 months, urinary&#xD;
      metabolite levels at 0-12 months, and SAPoS scores at 0-6-12 months were compared.&#xD;
      Differences were considered statistically significant at p &lt; 0.05&#xD;
