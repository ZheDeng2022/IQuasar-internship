      This proposal's objective is to investigate the effects of a high-intensity intermittent&#xD;
      stair climbing program on insulin resistance in individuals with obesity and at risk of type&#xD;
      2 diabetes (T2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity (defined as body mass index ≥ 30kg/m2) is a major risk factor for T2D. The connection&#xD;
      between obesity and T2D involves the development of insulin resistance (IR). Exercise&#xD;
      training is an effective non-pharmacological approach to prevent and treat IR. Despite the&#xD;
      efficacy of exercise training on ameliorating IR, most individuals do not achieve the minimum&#xD;
      recommended levels of physical activity and cite &quot;lack of time&quot; and difficulty in accessing&#xD;
      exercise facilities as barriers to exercise. Proposed as a time-efficient alternative,&#xD;
      high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which consists of short periods of high-intensity&#xD;
      efforts alternated with brief periods of recovery, is an efficient strategy to improve IR.&#xD;
      However, most HIIT protocols have been studied in laboratory-based settings requiring access&#xD;
      to specialized equipment (i.e. treadmills, cycle ergometers) and are not practical for the&#xD;
      general population. The use of high-intensity intermittent stair climbing may be a suitable&#xD;
      exercise strategy from an accessibility perspective. With evidence to suggest improvements in&#xD;
      IR following HIIT in individuals with obesity or T2D, the application of a similar approach&#xD;
      using high-intensity intermittent stair climbing to directly assess changes in IR in a&#xD;
      population at risk of T2D populations is warranted. Completion of this study will help&#xD;
      elucidate if an easy to implement, time-efficient and low-cost exercise training program&#xD;
      improves insulin resistance in individuals at risk of T2D.&#xD;

      Significance The obesity epidemic is a worldwide public health problem. Recent data indicate&#xD;
      that over 650 million adults around the world (~13%) are considered obese. Obesity is one of&#xD;
      the major risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and 90% of T2D cases are&#xD;
      attributable to excess fat mass. The connection between obesity and T2D is believed to be&#xD;
      intrinsically related to insulin resistance (IR). IR is characterized by a blunted effect of&#xD;
      insulin on decreasing circulating blood glucose at the whole-body level and/or a lower&#xD;
      response of certain tissues to the action of insulin. For example, skeletal muscle is&#xD;
      responsible for ~70% of insulin-stimulated postprandial glucose uptake and plays a key role&#xD;
      in the maintenance of whole-body insulin sensitivity and glycemic homeostasis. Additionally,&#xD;
      IR is one of the earliest detectable defects preceding hyperglycemia, present up to 10 years&#xD;
      before diabetes is diagnosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the cause of obesity-induced IR is complex and multifactorial, the beneficial&#xD;
      effects of exercise training in preventing and treating IR are well established. In&#xD;
      individuals with IR, an improvement in insulin action on skeletal muscle glucose metabolism&#xD;
      is one of the main effects induced by exercise training. For example, previous research&#xD;
      demonstrated that a single session of exercise reduced cellular stress, which may contribute&#xD;
      to exercise-induced increases in insulin sensitivity. Despite the efficacy of exercise&#xD;
      training on IR, the majority of individuals do not achieve the minimum recommended levels of&#xD;
      physical activity: 30 minutes or more of moderate intensity physical activity at least 5 days&#xD;
      a week, or 20 minutes of vigorous physical activity at least 3 days a week, or a combination&#xD;
      thereof, in addition to activities of daily living. Of note, lack of time and difficulty in&#xD;
      accessing facilities for exercise are commonly cited as barriers to physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which consists of short periods&#xD;
      of intense exercise (≥ 80% of maximal heart rate) alternated with periods of active recovery&#xD;
      or rest, is a relatively time-efficient training strategy to improve metabolic health and has&#xD;
      been considered more enjoyable than moderate-to-vigorous intensity continuous training. HIIT&#xD;
      increases skeletal muscle oxidative capacity and induces physiological remodeling like the&#xD;
      changes promoted by continuous moderate-intensity aerobic training. HIIT appears effective in&#xD;
      improving insulin sensitivity, particularly in those at risk of, or with, T2D. A previous&#xD;
      study using 10 x of 60-seconds of cycling intervals (∼90% of maximal heart rate) interspersed&#xD;
      with 60-seconds of active recovery, three times per week over a period of two weeks, reduced&#xD;
      hyperglycemia and increased skeletal muscle oxidative capacity in patients with T2D. Recently&#xD;
      published data has shown that an 8-week HIIT program resulted in lower IR in individuals with&#xD;
      obesity and also promoted greater expression of proteins related to oxidative metabolism in&#xD;
      skeletal muscle. Although HIIT may be an efficient option to improve insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
      glycemic control in individuals at risk of T2D, most HIIT studies have been conducted&#xD;
      primarily in traditional laboratory setting and may not be practical for the general&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation The common approach to study the effects of exercise are either using treadmills&#xD;
      or cycle ergometers. These approaches have limited translation to a &quot;real word&quot; scenario.&#xD;
      Among the barriers generally reported for a regular physical activity program are lack of&#xD;
      time, difficulty in accessing facilities for exercise, and low motivation. The goal of the&#xD;
      proposed study is to investigate the effects of a HIIT program using a suitable exercise&#xD;
      alternative (stair climbing) on IR in individuals with obesity and at risk of T2D. Stair&#xD;
      climbing can be considered an activity of daily living and is easily accessible. Previous&#xD;
      studies have shown that one short bout of stair climbing (&lt;6 min) acutely increased&#xD;
      postprandial glucose uptake in middle-aged men with impaired glucose tolerance and older T2D&#xD;
      subjects. Another study showed 6 weeks of a brief high intense intermittent stair climbing&#xD;
      program was effective improving cardiorespiratory fitness in healthy individuals but did not&#xD;
      improve IR. More recently, a preliminary study examined the effect of 6 weeks of brief&#xD;
      intermittent stair climbing exercise on glycemic control in people with T2D. The authors&#xD;
      reported that the protocol (3 x 1-minute bouts of repeatedly ascending and descending a&#xD;
      single flight of stairs) was insufficient to induce improvements in glucose control. In this&#xD;
      context, the volume was too low (approximately 50 stairs) and there was no progression of&#xD;
      training volume over time. Additionally, the authors counted for the time descending the&#xD;
      stairs as part of the 1-minute bout which may have reduced even more the time spent ascending&#xD;
      the stairs. To address these limitations, the proposed study will implement a more prolonged&#xD;
      protocol with progressive increase in exercise volume and will only count the time spent&#xD;
      ascending the stairs. To the best of the author's knowledge, no study has tested this&#xD;
      approach using HIIT in individuals with obesity and a risk of T2D. Findings from this study&#xD;
      will help to translate research-based evidence to clinical practice and contribute to prevent&#xD;
      or treat individuals at risk of T2D with a nonpharmacological and low-cost approach. This&#xD;
      topic is within the &quot;Cell and Organism&quot; New Mexico - Idea Network of Biomedical Research&#xD;
      Excellence (NM-INBRE) focus area to advance the understanding of human health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach The study is an 8-wk within-subject intervention design where participants will be&#xD;
      tested pre and post intervention. 20 participants (10 males and 10 females) will be recruited&#xD;
      from the local community through poster advertisement and one-to-one interaction. Before&#xD;
      agreeing to participate in the study, the participants will given written informed consent,&#xD;
      which will be approved by the institutional review board of the local institution. Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria include body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2; homeostasis model assessment for insulin&#xD;
      resistance (HOMA-IR) ≥ 2.71; no fear of being totally submerged underwater; freedom from&#xD;
      orthopedic injuries, diagnoses of T2D or glucose intolerance, known acute or chronic&#xD;
      diseases, and current use of anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic or other drugs known to affect&#xD;
      metabolism. Subjects that meet the initial requirements will have a fasting blood draw.&#xD;
      Individuals with altered glucose metabolism (fasting plasma glucose &gt;126 mg/dL) will be&#xD;
      excluded. The researchers will ensure the inclusion of males and females from differing&#xD;
      ethnic background. The required sample size was calculated a priori based on changes in the&#xD;
      HOMA-IR using an alpha level of 0.05 and power of 80%. Prior to exercise training,&#xD;
      participants undergo: a fasting blood draw for blood glucose and insulin measurements,&#xD;
      anthropometrics and body composition analysis, and a maximal graded exercise test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise training protocol consist of 8 weeks of HIIT using stair climbing with a&#xD;
      frequency of 3 times a week, totaling 24 training sessions. For the first week of the stair&#xD;
      training exercise program subjects will meet at UNM's Teaching Education Building (Stair Case&#xD;
      2). The following 7 weeks subjects can perform the exercise program at a staircase most&#xD;
      convenient to them and approved by the research team. The warm-up will consist of 2 minutes&#xD;
      of ascending and descending the stairs at a comfortable pace. The high-intensity intermittent&#xD;
      exercise will be comprised of 6-12 x 30-seconds bout of ascending at an all-effort at a&#xD;
      moderate pace. A 30- seconds walking recovery will occur between the exercise bouts. After&#xD;
      the exercise session the subject will walk during a 2-minute cool down. Every session will&#xD;
      last between 10 to 15 minutes. The number of bouts (6-12) will be increased progressively&#xD;
      over the weeks. During the first (week 1) and final week (week 8) of the exercise program&#xD;
      subjects will be monitored by a trained exercise physiologist. During these supervised&#xD;
      visits, heart rate and rating of perceived exertion (OMNI scale) will be measured at the end&#xD;
      of each stair climbing bout and after active recovery. Subjects will have the option to&#xD;
      request further monitoring if desired. Weeks 2 through 7 OMNI will be self-recorded by the&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements Insulin resistance - After a 10-hour fast and at least 72 hours before and after&#xD;
      the training, venous blood samples will be collected for the measurement of blood glucose and&#xD;
      insulin. HOMA-IR (calculated by [glucose (mmol)] x [insulin (µU/ml)] ÷ 22.5) will be&#xD;
      determined from the fasting glucose and insulin concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric and body composition measurements - Height and body mass will be measured&#xD;
      using an analog scale with coupled stadiometer. BMI will be calculated using height in m and&#xD;
      body mass in kg. Relative body fat (%BF) values will be determined through underwater&#xD;
      weighing (UWW) at measured residual lung volume. The highest 3 UWW trials ± 100 g will be&#xD;
      averaged and used for computation of body volume. Body volume will be corrected for residual&#xD;
      lung volume using the dry-land oxygen dilution technique so that body density can be computed&#xD;
      and converted into %BF formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximal Oxygen Consumption - Maximal oxygen consumption will be measured using a maximal ramp&#xD;
      graded test protocol conducted on a treadmill. The speed will be increased every 60s at an&#xD;
      individual rate, which will be based on the participant's exercise history questionnaire&#xD;
      (Veterans Specific Activity Questionnaire), to induce fatigue within 8 to 12 minutes. Expired&#xD;
      gases will be analyzed using a metabolic cart. Heart rate (HR) will be recorded continuously&#xD;
      using a HR transmitter strap (S810i series, Polar, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculations and Statistical Analyses Data will be presented as mean ± standard deviation. A&#xD;
      statistical software will be used for statistical analysis. The Shapiro-Wilk test will be&#xD;
      used to analyze the data normality. Area under the curve (AUC) for insulin and glucose will&#xD;
      be calculated using the Trapezoidal method. For study 1, a Student t test will be used to&#xD;
      analyze the effects of training (pre vs post). For study 2, a two-way analyses of variance&#xD;
      (ANOVA) will be used to test the effect of the two exercise protocols (factor 1 = pre and&#xD;
      post 8 weeks of training and factor 2 = single session vs multiple sessions). If&#xD;
      statistically significant F values are observed, a Tukey post hoc test will be performed. The&#xD;
      alpha level is set at P ≤ 0.05 for statistical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential problems and strategies: Dropout and compliance are limitations in exercise&#xD;
      training interventions. The researchers will provide training session on three different&#xD;
      times a day (early morning, afternoon and evenings) to accommodate people with different&#xD;
      schedules. Also, participants will be compensated for time.&#xD;
