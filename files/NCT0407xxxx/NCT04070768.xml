    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib Study to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Venetoclax in&#xD;
      combination with Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin(GO) in subjects with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia. Using a standard 3+3 design, subjects will receive once cycle of combination&#xD;
      therapy. After one cycle of combination therapy, subjects showing response will continue on&#xD;
      to one cycle of consolidation therapy with GO\Veneoclax. Subjects who respond to combination&#xD;
      therapy will continue on maintenance Venetoclax until progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose-limiting toxicity, defined as an adverse event related (possible, probably, or definite)&#xD;
      to Venetoclax and/or Gemtuzumab fulfilling one of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hematologic toxicity: treatment-related grade 3 or worse neutropenia and/or&#xD;
           thrombocytopenia due to bone marrow hypocellularity present at the end of cycle one (day&#xD;
           28) with an additional 28 days allowed for count recovery (i.e. present at day 56);&#xD;
           specifically grade 3 or worse neutropenia or thrombocytopenia with the bone marrow&#xD;
           documented to be free of leukemic infiltration. Note: patients who enter the study with&#xD;
           grade 3 or worse cytopenias will not be evaluable for hematologic dose-limiting&#xD;
           toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-hematologic toxicity: any grade 3 or worse treatment-related toxicity occurring&#xD;
           within the first cycle (excluding grade 3-4 infections during cycle one).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also evaluate the Overall Response Rate, Anti-leukemic activity, Relapse-free&#xD;
      Survival (RFS), event-free survival (EFS) , and overall survival (OS). The study will&#xD;
      evaluate quality of life using the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of&#xD;
      Cancer 30 item questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30).&#xD;

             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of&#xD;
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient&#xD;
             inappropriate for enrollment in this study.&#xD;
