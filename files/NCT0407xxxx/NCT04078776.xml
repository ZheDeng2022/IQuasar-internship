  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the systemic and white adipose tissue inflammatory profile of&#xD;
      individuals who are classified as lean and obese. Blood and white adipose tissue samples will&#xD;
      be collected in the fasted state to assess inflammatory status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence to suggest that markers of inflammation in the blood and white adipose&#xD;
      tissue increase with increasing levels of obesity. However, the white adipose tissue total&#xD;
      protein content and phosphorylation of proteins involved in inflammatory pathways has not&#xD;
      previously been compared between lean and obese individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesise that obese individuals will have increased levels of&#xD;
      inflammation in the blood and white adipose tissue, compared to their lean counterparts.&#xD;
