  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on the clinical efficacy of ALK inhibitors in ALK+NSCLC, NCCN guidelines recommend ALK&#xD;
      molecular testing of lung cancer patients, to select patients for ALK-targeted therapy.&#xD;
      However, molecular testing via tissue biopsy cannot always be performed on NSCLC patients,&#xD;
      potentially limiting access of effective treatment to the subset of patients who are able to&#xD;
      undergo current testing procedures that utilize tissue biopsies. Obtaining an adequate tissue&#xD;
      biopsy specimen for NSCLC presents a number of challenges. In particular, the method for&#xD;
      diagnosis of lung cancer depends on the location, size, and type of suspected lung cancer,&#xD;
      and the presence or absence of metastases. Common procedures for centrally located tumors&#xD;
      include bronchoscopy and sputum cytology, which frequently yield insufficient tumor tissue&#xD;
      for comprehensive mutation testing. In addition, 75% of patients are diagnosed with&#xD;
      late-stage disease and often present with multiple comorbidities. Biopsies in these patients&#xD;
      can lead to complications such as pneumothorax, hemoptysis, other bleeding complications, and&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary decompensation. As a result of these factors, a physician treating a patient&#xD;
      who presents with a significant burden of disease as well as significant comorbidities may&#xD;
      rightly consider whether it is in the best interest of the patient to undergo a risky and&#xD;
      potentially unsuccessful procedure. Thus, there exists a major unmet clinical need for&#xD;
      testing procedures that do not require tumor tissue. The purpose of this phase II study is to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of brigatinib in patients with advanced NSCLC harboring ALK rearrangement&#xD;
      that are selected using predictive biomarkers identified via blood-based assays.&#xD;
