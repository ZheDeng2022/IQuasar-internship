  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomised controlled trial with a crossover design. For early and continuously treated&#xD;
      patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) that are adherent. Two 12-week periods where patients&#xD;
      consume either casein glycomacropeptide (CGMP) based protein substitute or a free amino acid&#xD;
      (AA) based protein substitute. 4 week wash out period in between. The protein substitutes&#xD;
      will be consumed daily together with the patient's regular low protein diet.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomised controlled trial with a crossover design conducted at several&#xD;
      international study centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population is early and continuously treated patients with PKU that are adhering to&#xD;
      their prescribed diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be given both a CGMP based protein substitute and a free AA based&#xD;
      protein substitute as their main protein source on two different 12-week periods in a&#xD;
      crossover design. The two periods will be separated by a 4 week wash out period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protein substitutes will be consumed daily together with the patient's regular low&#xD;
      protein diet during the intervention periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective The primary objective of the study is to investigate the effects of a CGMP&#xD;
      based formula compared to an AA based formula upon mean plasma Phe levels after 12 weeks of&#xD;
      daily intake in patients with PKU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives The secondary objectives of the study are to investigate if a CGMP based&#xD;
      formula compared to an AA based formula in PKU patients provides any long-term health&#xD;
      benefits concerning gut health, inflammation, oxidative stress and product acceptability.&#xD;
