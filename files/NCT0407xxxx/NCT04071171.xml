  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the BiPhox-Trial are to demonstrate, that the use of Biphozyl® as a&#xD;
      replacement fluid in adult critically ill acute kidney injury (AKI) patients, results in a&#xD;
      lower rate of pH excursions and of bicarbonate (HCO3-) excursions compared to the use of&#xD;
      Phoxilium® during the studied continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) interval with&#xD;
      regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the BiPhox-Trial are to evaluate the time to pH level&#xD;
      normalization and the HCO3- substitution rates after initiation of CVVH treatment. Further,&#xD;
      to demonstrate that the use of Biphozyl® as a replacement fluid in adult critically ill AKI&#xD;
      patients, results in a more stable acid-base-status as well as improved respiratory situation&#xD;
      due to lower intracorporeal HCO3- and carbon dioxide levels compared to the use of Phoxilium®&#xD;
      during the studied CVVH interval with RCA.&#xD;

      After being fully eligible by meeting all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria,&#xD;
      participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups, either the Phoxilium® - Group or&#xD;
      Biphozyl® - Group. After randomization, patients receive either Phoxilium® or Biphozyl® for&#xD;
      CVVH initiation and maintenance as a replacement fluid during the first 48 hours (h) of&#xD;
      treatment. After the first 48h of CVVH with either Phoxilium® or Biphozyl® a cross-over&#xD;
      follows, with another 48h of CVVH with the opposite replacement fluid (Phoxilium® switched to&#xD;
      Biphozyl® or Biphozyl® switched to Phoxilium®). In comparison, all patients should receive&#xD;
      one session of CVVH with 96h. Resulting from 48h of CVVH with Phoxilium® and 48h of CVVH with&#xD;
      Biphozyl® as a replacement fluid. The order is determined by randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticoagulation is always delivered as pre-filter RCA with Regiocit® (Gambro Lundia AB,&#xD;
      Sweden). For antagonisation of Regiocit®, a calcium solution (calcium chloride, with or&#xD;
      without magnesium chloride) will be used post-filter.&#xD;
