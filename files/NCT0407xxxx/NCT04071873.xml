  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) has the potential to dramatically decrease HIV transmission&#xD;
      worldwide. In Tanzania, HIV prevalence is ~5%, with 1.6 million people living with HIV/AIDS;&#xD;
      it is the leading cause of hospitalization and death among Tanzanian adults. However, less&#xD;
      than 50% of HIV-infected Tanzanian adults know their status.Successful implementation of&#xD;
      community-based services requires an understanding of the social and cultural context that&#xD;
      influence community engagement with HIV services. Specifically, many HIV endemic regions are&#xD;
      also medically pluralistic communities, where multiple explanatory frameworks for health and&#xD;
      disease co-exist. In these areas, HIV testing and ART clinical care do not occur in&#xD;
      isolation; traditional healers are commonly utilized instead of or concurrently with&#xD;
      biomedical services. Therefore, the success of decentralized, community-based HIV services&#xD;
      must be founded upon a thorough understanding of medical pluralism, and engagement with&#xD;
      traditional healers as stakeholders in community health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the feasibility of involving traditional healers in HIV testing,&#xD;
      and pilot an intervention to expand HIV testing within communities that use traditional&#xD;
      medicine in Mwanza, Tanzania.&#xD;

      This study has two specific aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tailor a point of care HIV testing intervention for delivery in northwestern Tanzania, using&#xD;
      data from 1) qualitative interviews and 2) community engagement strategies. Interviews with&#xD;
      traditional healers, traditional and biomedical clients, and HIV clinic staff will illustrate&#xD;
      local variables impacting HIV testing engagement. A community advisory board with stakeholder&#xD;
      members will guide program implementation, tailoring protocols to maximize uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduct a cluster-randomized pilot of the HIV testing intervention. This pilot will offer HIV&#xD;
      testing at five traditional healer practice sites, compared with a control group of five&#xD;
      healers providing education on community HIV resources..&#xD;
