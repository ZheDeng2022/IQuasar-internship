      As required for new medications approved by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, safety and&#xD;
      efficacy information should be provided for a minimum of 600 patients treated in the setting&#xD;
      of routine practice during 4 years following approval (until 19 September 2022). Out of all&#xD;
      the enrolled patients, at least 120 cases (20%) will be followed up until the 52nd week to&#xD;
      see the long term safety of Xeljanz.&#xD;

      This is an open-label, non-comparative, non-interventional, prospective, and multi-center&#xD;
      study conducted in Korean health care centers by accredited physicians (ie, investigators).&#xD;
      The study population will be adult patients with moderately to severely active UC who have&#xD;
      had an inadequate response or intolerance to the basic treatments or biological agents.&#xD;
      Clinical Severity of Ulcerative Colitis is classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on&#xD;
      the Mayo score or partial Mayo score. Xeljanz will be administered according to the &quot;Dosage&#xD;
      and Administration&quot; of the approved labeling. There is no visit or activity mandated by this&#xD;
      study. The investigator will collect patient data and record the information on each&#xD;
      patient's case report form (CRF).&#xD;

    <description>General efficacy will be determined into 4 categories by the investigator based on clinical impression and patient's Mayo or partial Mayo score.&#xD;
The 4 categories are as follows&#xD;
Improved : Symptoms of ulcerative colitis have improved or showed adequate maintenance effect after taking Xeljanz Unchanged : Symptoms have not changed much since taking Xeljanz Aggravated : Symptoms have worsened after taking Xeljanz Not assessible : Reason written down seperately</description>

    <time_frame>At 8, 16, 24, 52 weeks after the first treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Mayo score or partial Mayo score is calculated. Mayo Score is defined as sum of the following scores. Partial Mayo score excludes findings of endoscopy.&#xD;
A. Stool frequency 0 : Normal number of stool&#xD;
1-2 stools more than normal&#xD;
3-4 stools more than normal&#xD;
â‰¥5 stools more than normal&#xD;
B. Rectal bleeding 0: No blood seen&#xD;
Streaks of blood with stool less than half the time&#xD;
Obvious blood with stool most of the time&#xD;
Blood alone passed&#xD;
C. Findings of endoscopy 0: Normal or inactive disease&#xD;
Mild disease (erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability)&#xD;
Moderate disease (marked erythema, absent vascular pattern, friability, erosion)&#xD;
Severe disease (spontaneous bleeding, ulceration)&#xD;
D. Physician's global assessment 0: Normal&#xD;
Mild&#xD;
Moderate&#xD;
