    <textblock>
      This study will be a 12-month, prospective, multicenter, open-label, non-comparative,&#xD;
      non-randomized clinical investigation conducted at 8 to 14 sites. A total of 383 subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled to achieve approximately 268 treated subjects, resulting in at least 241&#xD;
      evaluable subjects at the point of refractive stability. After signing the informed consent,&#xD;
      subjects meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria in both eyes may be scheduled for&#xD;
      surgery. The follow-up visit schedule will be the same for each operative eye.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Signed informed consent and HIPAA authorization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. At least 40 years of age at enrollment (date informed consent signed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The refractive error of both subject's eyes, based on the iDesign refraction selected&#xD;
             for treatment (&quot;4.0 mm Rx calc&quot; at 12.5 mm), must be myopic with or without&#xD;
             astigmatism up to -6.00 D spherical equivalent (SE), with cylinder up to -3.00 D and&#xD;
             minimum pre-operative myopia in their non-dominant eye at least as great as their&#xD;
             targeted myopic retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. At least one eye must require a myopic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Anticipated stromal bed thickness of at least 250 microns based on preoperative&#xD;
             central corneal pachymetry minus the maximum treatment depth to be ablated (as&#xD;
             calculated by the iDesign plus the intended flap thickness).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Distance Best Spectacle Corrected Visual Acuity (BSCVA) of 20/20 or better.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Require an add power of +1.25 D or more but not greater than +2.00 D at 40 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Less than or equal to ±0.50 D difference between cycloplegic and manifest refraction&#xD;
             sphere.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. A stable refractive error (based on a previous exam, medical records, lensometry, or&#xD;
             prescription that is at least 12 months prior to the preoperative manifest&#xD;
             refraction), as defined by a change of less than or equal to&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  0.50 D in MRSE (sphere and cylinder).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects with a history of contact lens wear within the last 4 weeks must discontinue&#xD;
             lens wear in order to demonstrate refractive stability according to the following&#xD;
             (refractive stability is defined as a change of not more than 0.50 D in manifest&#xD;
             refraction sphere and cylinder as well as mean keratometry between measurements):&#xD;
             After the Informed Consent process has been completed and subjects are enrolled in the&#xD;
             study:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Rigid or extended wear contact lenses (toric or spherical) must be removed for at&#xD;
                  least 3 weeks and soft contact lenses (toric or spherical) for at least 2 weeks&#xD;
                  prior to the first refraction used to establish stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  After abstaining from contact lens wear for designated time, two consecutive&#xD;
                  manifest refractions and keratometric readings must be conducted at least 7 days&#xD;
                  apart&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  I If the subject/eye meets the refractive stability criteria, contact lens wear&#xD;
                  is not permitted for 2 weeks prior to surgery except as required to test&#xD;
                  monovision acceptance as described below in the Study Procedures, Contact Lens&#xD;
                  Trial section NOTE: Refractive stability needs to be confirmed only once during&#xD;
                  preoperative assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Agreement between manifest refraction (adjusted for optical infinity) and iDesign&#xD;
             System refraction chosen for treatment, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Spherical Equivalent: magnitude of the difference is less than 0.625 D.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cylinder: magnitude of the difference is less than or equal to 0.5 D.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cylinder Axis Tolerance: If either the manifest cylinder entered into the iDesign&#xD;
                  System or the iDesign cylinder selected for treatment is less than 0.5 D, there&#xD;
                  is no requirement for axis agreement. When both cylinders have a magnitude of at&#xD;
                  least 0.5 D, the axis tolerance as determined by the iDesign system is linearly&#xD;
                  reduced from 15 degrees (0.5 D) to 7.5 degrees (7.0 D) based on the average&#xD;
                  magnitude of both cylinders. Note: If the axis tolerance is not in the calculated&#xD;
                  range, the iDesign system will produce a warning and this exam may not be used&#xD;
                  for treatment planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Willing and capable of complying with follow-up examinations for the duration of the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Women who are pregnant, breast-feeding, or intend to become pregnant during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Women who were pregnant or nursing may not be enrolled until 6 months after&#xD;
             either delivery or have stopped nursing and there is documented refractive stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Concurrent use of systemic (including inhaled) medications that may impair healing,&#xD;

             months of treatment, and amiodarone hydrochloride (Cordarone®) within 12 months of&#xD;
             treatment. NOTE: The use of inhaled or systemic corticosteroids, whether chronic or&#xD;
             acute, within the past 6 months is deemed to adversely affect healing and subjects&#xD;
             using such medications are specifically excluded from eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of any of the following medical conditions, or any other condition that could&#xD;
             affect wound healing: collagen vascular disease, autoimmune disease, immunodeficiency&#xD;

             not limited to unstable thyroid disorders and diabetes), lupus, and rheumatoid&#xD;
             arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             NOTE: The presence of diabetes (either type 1 or 2), regardless of disease duration,&#xD;
             severity, or control, will specifically exclude subjects from eligibility.&#xD;

             electronic device.&#xD;

             from limbus), retinal detachment/repair, clinically significant lens opacity, clinical&#xD;
             evidence of trauma, corneal opacity within the central 9 mm and visible on topography,&#xD;
             prior strabismus surgery, strabismus, or at risk for developing strabismus, or with&#xD;
             evidence of glaucoma or propensity for narrow angle glaucoma or suspected glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
             NOTE: Subjects with glaucoma, regardless of medication regimen or control, or an IOP&#xD;
             greater than 21 mmHg at screening, are specifically excluded from eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Evidence of keratoconus, corneal dystrophy or irregularity, or abnormal topography.&#xD;
