  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the best dose of M3814 when given together with radium-223&#xD;
      dichloride or with radium-223 dichloride and avelumab and to see how well they work in&#xD;
      treating patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer that had spread to other places in&#xD;
      the body (metastatic). M3814 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Radioactive drugs, such as radium-223 dichloride, may carry&#xD;
      radiation directly to tumor cells and not harm normal cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as avelumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may&#xD;
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. This study is being done to&#xD;
      find out the better treatment between radium-223 dichloride alone, radium-223 dichloride in&#xD;
      combination with M3814, or radium-223 dichloride in combination with both M3814 and avelumab,&#xD;
      to lower the chance of prostate cancer growing or spreading in the bone, and if this approach&#xD;
      is better or worse than the usual approach for advanced prostate cancer not responsive to&#xD;
      hormonal therapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of peposertib (M3814) in combination with&#xD;
      radium-223 dichloride or in combination with radium-223 dichloride and avelumab in patients&#xD;
      with advanced metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) based on dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicities (DLTs) in the doublet or triplet combinations. (Phase 1) II. Radiographic&#xD;
      progression free survival (rPFS) will be evaluated based on both skeletal and extraskeletal&#xD;
      progression following Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) methodology. (Phase 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the time to the first symptomatic skeletal event [SSE]. II. To determine the&#xD;
      safety of radium-223 dichloride, M3814, and avelumab combination treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. IV. To evaluate progression free survival&#xD;
      (PFS) and overall survival (OS). V. To evaluate symptomatic skeletal events (SSE) per&#xD;
      standardized case report form (CRF) distinguishing between pathologic and non-pathogenic&#xD;
      fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To explore patient-reported symptomatic adverse events (AE) for tolerability of each&#xD;
      treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To examine the radium-223 dichloride bio-distribution and absorbed dose in each bone&#xD;
      metastatic lesions as well as elsewhere in the body including critical organs using&#xD;
      dosimetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To perform molecular profiling assays on malignant and normal tissues, including, but not&#xD;
      limited to, whole exome sequencing (WES), and messenger ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing&#xD;
      (RNAseq), in order to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. Identify potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers beyond any genomic alteration by&#xD;
      which treatment may be assigned, and Ib. Identify resistance mechanisms using genomic&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic (DNA)- and RNA-based assessment platforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To contribute genetic analysis data from de-identified biospecimens to Genomic Data&#xD;
      Commons (GDC), a well annotated cancer molecular and clinical data repository, for current&#xD;
      and future research; specimens will be annotated with key clinical data, including&#xD;
      presentation, diagnosis, staging, summary treatment, and if possible, outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To bank plasma and peripheral immune cells from patients to assess predictive biomarkers&#xD;
      of response at the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN) biorepository at&#xD;
      Nationwide Children's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To correlate change in level of total alkaline phosphatase, bone-specific alkaline&#xD;
      phosphatase, and serum osteocalcin to rPFS and OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of peposertib, followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive radium-223 dichloride intravenously (IV) over 1 minute on day 1.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive radium-223 dichloride as in Arm A and peposertib orally (PO) once&#xD;
      daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) on days 3-26. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM C: Patients receive radium-223 dichloride IV as in Arm A and peposertib PO QD or BID as&#xD;
      in Arm B. Patients also receive avelumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 of cycles 2-6.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3&#xD;
      months for up to 2 years.&#xD;

             appropriate with radiation and/or surgery before starting on trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar&#xD;
             chemical or biologic composition to radium-223 dichloride, M3814, or avelumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to discontinue medications or substances that are potent inhibitors,&#xD;
             inducers or sensitive substrates of CYP3A4/5 or CYP2C19 prior to study treatment are&#xD;
             ineligible. Medications or substances that are strong inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 or&#xD;
             CYP2C19 must be discontinued at least 1 week prior to first M3814 dose. Strong&#xD;
             inducers of CYP3A4/5 or CYP2C19 must be stopped at least 3 weeks prior to the first&#xD;
             dose. Drugs mainly metabolized by CYP3A with a narrow therapeutic index as judged by&#xD;
             the Investigator must stop at least 1 day prior to first M3814 dose. Because the lists&#xD;
             of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a&#xD;
             frequently- updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent&#xD;
             procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other&#xD;
             agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is&#xD;
             considering a new over-the- counter medicine or herbal product. The primary&#xD;
             elimination mechanism of avelumab is proteolytic degradation, thus there are no&#xD;
             contraindicated medications with respect to avelumab. Radium-223 dichloride should not&#xD;
             be given concurrently with abiraterone plus prednisone/prednisolone&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have an active infection requiring systemic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not use immunosuppressive medication =&lt; 7 days of registration, EXCEPT&#xD;
             for the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injection (e.g.,&#xD;
                  intra-articular injection)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses =&lt; 10 mg/day of prednisone or&#xD;
                  equivalent&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT scan&#xD;
                  premedication)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who cannot discontinue concomitant H2 blockers or proton-pump inhibitors&#xD;
             (PPIs). Patients may confer with the study doctor to determine if such medications can&#xD;
             be discontinued. These must be discontinued &gt;= 5 days prior to study treatment.&#xD;
             Patients do not need to discontinue calcium carbonate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving sorivudine or any chemically related analogues (such as brivudine)&#xD;
             are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a known history or present osteonecrosis of the jaw&#xD;
