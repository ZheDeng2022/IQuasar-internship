    <textblock>
      This research is studying the preventative use of topical 0.1% tazarotene gel daily in&#xD;
      addition to best practice standards to reduce the development of hand-foot skin reaction&#xD;
      (HFSR).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved tazarotene for specifically for&#xD;
      hand-foot skin reaction but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -aiming to determine if the use of tazarotene gel daily, in addition to best practice&#xD;
      standards:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reduces the development of HFSR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  decreases modification of regorafenib dose due to HFSR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improves health-related quality of life associated with HFSR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  decreases stress associated with HFSR&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumors with a&#xD;
             plan to initiate regorafenib, or having started regorafenib in the last 48 hours, via&#xD;
             dose escalation protocol describe in the ReDOS study in CRC. The ReDOS study&#xD;
             recommends this dose escalation of regorafenib:80mg daily x 1 week, 120mg daily x 1&#xD;
             week, 160mg daily times one week, off week, then 160mg daily goal, or maximum&#xD;
             tolerated dose thereafter. This is not a separate study; this is the current standard&#xD;
             of care for regorafenib dosing. In addition, to compare across the cohorts, patients&#xD;
             must be ambulatory with full use of all 4 distal extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have sufficient organ and marrow function in the opinion of the&#xD;
             treating investigator. This can be based on lab reports from an outside facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for the duration of study participation Tazarotene is known to be&#xD;
             teratogenic, although the dose required with topical application to affect the&#xD;
             developing human fetus is unknown. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform&#xD;
             her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and 4 months after completion of administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regorafenib use in combination with another TKI (unless regorafenib was started in the&#xD;
             last 48 hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or non-compliance with contraception (4 weeks before, during and for at&#xD;
             least 3 ovulatory cycles after treatment cessation). Pregnant women are excluded from&#xD;
             this study because tazarotene is category X with the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nursing or lactating: Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with tazarotene,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of hypervitaminosis A&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other systemic retinoids needed for another condition (ie. Isotretinoin for&#xD;
             inflammatory acne, acitretin for psoriasis, bexarotene for CTCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Need for treatment dose systemic steroids or systemic immunosuppressive agents (i.e.,&#xD;
             for autoimmune disease or cerebral edema) at the time of enrolment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psoriasis or other autoimmune disease requiring skin directed or systemic therapy&#xD;
             known to impact keratinocyte proliferation (UV therapy to the hands or feet, TNF&#xD;
             inhibitors, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active skin disease of the hands or feet with redness, scaling or blisters prior to&#xD;
             enrolment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had any systemic chemotherapy or immunotherapy within 4 weeks&#xD;
             prior to entering the study AND who have not recovered from adverse events on the&#xD;
             hands and feet due to the agents administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents to treat HFSR.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, uncontrolled lower&#xD;
             extremity edema, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure,&#xD;
             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations&#xD;
             that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
