      Plasma mtDNA analysis aids in predicting pancreatic necrosis in severe acute pancreatitis&#xD;
      patients.After the onset of severe acute pancreatitis, pancreatic necrosis and the content of&#xD;
      mtDNA in plasma will increase, showing a significant positive correlation.&#xD;

      Acute pancreatitis is an acute inflammatory disease of the pancreas characterized by the&#xD;
      sudden onset of abdominal pain, elevated serum amylase, and edema or necrosis of the&#xD;
      pancreas. The clinical course of AP is generally mild; however, nearly 25% of patients&#xD;
      progress into severe AP which consists of organ failure and/or pancreatic necrosis. Although&#xD;
      advances in the diagnosis and management have been made, AP remains a major health issue to&#xD;
      the society. PNec is a major complication of AP which manifests as non-opacified parenchyma&#xD;
      with intravenous contrast, as identified via contrast-enhanced CT scan. Patients with PNec&#xD;
      are more likely to develop pancreatic infection and suffer a greater risk for mortality .&#xD;
      Currently, CECT scans remain the &quot;gold standard&quot; to diagnosis PNec clinically. However, the&#xD;
      extent of PNec is best seen about 3 days after the presentation of disease and may be missed&#xD;
      in early CT scan. In addition, repeated CT scanning is not convenient to monitor changes in&#xD;
      necrosis, most notably for those who are receiving mechanical ventilation or&#xD;
      hemofiltration.The clinical diagnosis of AP is based on the presence of the following&#xD;
      features: abdominal pain; serum amylase and/or lipase levels three times higher than the&#xD;
      upper limit of normal; and characteristic findings of AP on CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific plasma biomarkers in predicting pancreatic necrosis (PNec) are needed in treating&#xD;
      acute pancreatitis (AP). Aims To investigate the prognostic value of plasma mitochondrial DNA&#xD;
      fragments (mtDNA) in patient with AP for PNec. Methods AP patients with symptoms onset within&#xD;
      72 h were prospectively enrolled.The conclusions elevated plasma mtDNA content in AP patients&#xD;
      may be used as a more accurate early predictor of PNec in contrast to traditional CRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normally,human mtDNA is strictly contained in mitochondria and not exposed to the innate&#xD;
      immune system even following cell apoptosis. However, in times of cell death elicited by&#xD;
      stress (e.g., trauma and sepsis), mtDNA is released into systemic circulation and leads to an&#xD;
      array of inflammatory reactions. Elevated mtDNA levels have been reported in a variety of&#xD;
      clinical situations, including trauma, severe sepsis, and cancer. As PNec is caused by&#xD;
      intracellular activation of digestive enzymes and autodigestion, we assumed that circulating&#xD;
      mtDNA levels could be used as a biomarker for early detection of PNec.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research methods and steps:cell culture and mtDNA extraction、mtDNA detection、statistical&#xD;
      analysis、results.&#xD;

    <description>Mitochondrial DNA is the genetic material in mitochondria. Mitochondria can produce energy (ATP) for cells, which is a special form of ribonucleic acid found in mitochondria of cells. Mitochondria are organelles that provide energy (ATP) to cells. There are usually many DNA molecules in a mitochondria.&#xD;
They carry their own DNA--mtDNA, and mutations in these genes can cause mitochondrial diseases. Although the symptoms of the disease are changeable, organs that consume more energy, such as brain, muscle and heart, are usually affected. Since mitochondria are transmitted through egg cells, related diseases will be inherited from the mother.</description>
