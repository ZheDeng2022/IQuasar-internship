  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to begin an exercise program combined with behavioral&#xD;
      counseling for patients who are hospitalized with a cystic fibrosis exacerbation. The&#xD;
      exercise program will begin during the hospital stay. Beginning an exercise program during&#xD;
      this period of reduced mobility and isolation may be an ideal time to deliver a structured&#xD;
      exercise prescription along with a behavioral program to promote long-term adherence to&#xD;
      exercise (structured physical activity) . Hospitalized patients have an acute awareness that&#xD;
      their lung function is declining and may be more motivated and open to changing their&#xD;
      behavior and adding exercise to their treatment regimen.&#xD;

      During the hospitalization (T0 to T1; Figure 1, next page), participants will perform&#xD;
      supervised exercise 6 days/wk. On each of these days, there will be a 5-10 min warm up&#xD;
      consisting of low intensity execises for lower and upper exermity muscles. The total time per&#xD;
      week will be between 2.5 and 3.5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three days/wk will consist of aerobic exercise (&quot;frequency&quot;). The various &quot;modes (types)&quot; for&#xD;
      this exercise include 1) overground ambulation (including stairs), 2) treadmill ambulation,&#xD;
      3) stationary cycling, or 4) repetitive body-weight exercises (e.g., &quot;jumping jacks&quot;). The&#xD;
      &quot;time (duration)&quot; of these sessions will be 20-30 min/day. The &quot;intensity&quot; will be moderate&#xD;
      (40-60% of heart rate reserve and/or perceived dyspnea/exertion of 3-5) to vigogous (60-85%&#xD;
      of heart rate reserve and/or perceived dyspnea/exertion of 6-8). Participants will be given a&#xD;
      HR monitor and specific &quot;target&quot; HR ranges based on their resting HR in standing and their&#xD;
      age predicted maximal HR (NOTE: maximal exercise testing will not be performed); they will&#xD;
      also be familiarized and instructed in use of the Borg CR10 scale to rate perceived&#xD;
      dyspnea/exertion Participants should be able to &quot;talk comfortably&quot; during moderate intensity&#xD;
      exercise, while talking should be &quot;somewhat challenging&quot; during vigorous efforts; HR, as well&#xD;
      as perceived exertion/dyspnea and &quot;talk test&quot; will be monitored throughout each supervised&#xD;
      session by trained personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On alternate days, participants will perform supervised resistance exercise training (3&#xD;
      days/wk; &quot;frequency&quot;). The various &quot;modes (types)&quot; for this exercise include 1) body-weight&#xD;
      exercises (e.g., lunges, squats, jumping, situps, pushups) and/or 2) resistance bands and&#xD;
      dumbbells; exercises will target upper extremity, trunk/core, and lower extremity muscles&#xD;
      (NOTE: specific inspiratory muscle training will not be performed). The &quot;intensity&quot; of these&#xD;
      exercises will be at approximately 12-15 repetition max (that is, on the 3rd set of an&#xD;
      exercise, the participant should have difficulty performing more than 12-15 quality (good&#xD;
      form) repetitions of the exercise. An appropriate number of exercises will be selected such&#xD;
      that the exercise &quot;duration (time)&quot; will be 20-30 min/day.&#xD;

    <description>The proposed study is prospective single-arm feasibility clinical trial that will enroll 12 hospitalized patients with CF in accordance with consensus criteria.&#xD;
Standard care for an acute CF exacerbation includes i.v. antibiotics and airway clearance therapies for 10-14 days. Routine care following hospitalization is an outpatient CF clinic visit 2-4 weeks after discharge, and then regular follow up every 2-3 months.&#xD;
In addition, to standard care in the hospital, study participants will receive a 1) tailored exercise prescription, 2) daily, individual, supervised, aerobic and strength/power training, as well as 3) daily behavioral counseling focused on topics related to long-term adherence to exercise (details below).</description>
