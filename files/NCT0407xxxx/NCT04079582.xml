  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients on hemodialysis have low levels of magnesium. Magnesium is needed to keep the&#xD;
      heart, kidneys, and other organs working properly. Patients with low serum magnesium&#xD;
      concentration have a higher risk of death, heart issues, muscle cramps and fractures. There&#xD;
      are several reasons why patients on dialysis have low levels of magnesium-these include poor&#xD;
      diet, medication interference, and the dialysis procedure itself, which leaches small amounts&#xD;
      of magnesium from the blood during each treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One way to make sure that patients on dialysis are getting enough magnesium is to increase&#xD;
      its concentration in the dialysate. The investigator would like to do a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial to determine the effect of increasing the concentration of magnesium in the dialysate&#xD;
      on the risk of people on dialysis dying or being admitted to the hospital due to heart&#xD;
      issues. The investigator thinks increasing the magnesium in the dialysate will help patients&#xD;
      live longer, have fewer hospitalisations related to heart disease and patients may also&#xD;
      experience less cramping associated with dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This simple adjustment to the dialysis procedure can be done at little cost and may even&#xD;
      reduce overall healthcare costs. If the investigator can show that increasing magnesium in&#xD;
      the dialysate improves patients' health, then it could become the standard of care for all&#xD;
      patients on dialysis.&#xD;

      1. Statement of the health problem or issue&#xD;
&#xD;
           In end-stage kidney disease, dialysis is needed to remove toxins and electrolytes that&#xD;
           would otherwise accumulate in a patient's blood. The fluid used in dialysis, the&#xD;
           dialysate, contains magnesium, and the lower the concentration of dialysate magnesium,&#xD;
           the more magnesium is removed from a patient's body during dialysis. Understanding the&#xD;
           optimal amount of magnesium to include in the dialysate is crucial as magnesium&#xD;
           regulates more than 300 enzymes in the body and is vital to heart, muscle, and bone&#xD;
           health.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In Canada, the dialysate is prepared by central suppliers and contains magnesium in&#xD;
           concentrations of 0.38, 0.5, or 0.75 mmol/L. In the absence of clinical trial evidence,&#xD;
           there is no consensus on what magnesium concentration is best, and all 3 concentrations&#xD;
           are used today in Canadian hemodialysis centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objective of the project&#xD;
&#xD;
           In outpatients receiving conventional hemodialysis, to determine if providing a higher&#xD;
           versus lower dialysate magnesium concentration (0.75 vs. ≤0.5 mmol/L) as a centre policy&#xD;
           alters outcomes important to patients and their providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Outline&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a pragmatic, two-arm, parallel-group, cluster-randomized, open-label,&#xD;
           multicentre, comparative-effectiveness trial that will be embedded into routine care in&#xD;
           hemodialysis centres in Canada. Centres will be randomized to set the hemodialysate&#xD;
           magnesium concentration to be 0.75 mmol/L or ≤0.5 mmol/L in the intervention and control&#xD;
           groups, respectively. Patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis at these centres will&#xD;
           be followed for study outcomes during the trial follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The trial is highly pragmatic to facilitate high intervention adherence and extensive&#xD;
           uptake of the findings; pragmatic features include (i) broad eligibility criteria and a&#xD;
           large representative sample of hemodialysis centres and patients, (ii) intervention&#xD;
           implementation within routine clinical care delivered by dialysis unit personnel rather&#xD;
           than researchers, (iii) follow-up of patient outcomes using routinely collected data&#xD;
           sources, (iv) an intent-to-treat analysis using all available data, and (v) outcomes&#xD;
           highly relevant to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What is unique/innovative about the project?&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigator usually needs to study a large number of patients in a clinical trial&#xD;
           to reliably understand the effects of a treatment. Normally, a study with 15,000&#xD;
           patients would cost more than $15 million dollars to conduct; however, this study will&#xD;
           provide a reliable answer to the question being asked and cost less than $4 million.&#xD;
           This is because the investigator will use data that is already being collected by the&#xD;
           healthcare system. For example, when a patient is hospitalized for a heart attack or&#xD;
           stroke, this information is recorded in a secure healthcare database. The investigator&#xD;
           will be able to analyze these healthcare data at the end of the study (and link patient&#xD;
           outcomes to the type of dialysis treatment received (i.e. treatment or control). This&#xD;
           innovative study design means that the study will be much larger (but cost much less)&#xD;
           than a traditional clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This pragmatic trial includes all patients who receive chronic in-centre hemodialysis&#xD;
           patients in participating centres. High-risk patients with multiple comorbidities,&#xD;
           including cognitive impairments or disabilities, who are often excluded from trials&#xD;
           because of their high-risk status are eligible for participation in the Dialysate&#xD;
           Magnesium trial. By including patients from a variety of medical, ethnic, geographic,&#xD;
           and socioeconomic backgrounds, the results of the trial should be broadly generalizable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. What is the impact of the proposed research?&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with severe kidney failure (10,000 in Ontario and &gt;2 million worldwide),&#xD;
      hemodialysis provides a life-saving treatment option; however a tragic 20-40% of patients die&#xD;
      within one year of starting hemodialysis. The dialysate is a critical component of&#xD;
      hemodialysis, yet little evidence is available to guide its optimal formulation. Dialysate&#xD;
      magnesium in particular has received little scientific attention until recently, with new&#xD;
      research suggesting that a higher dialysate magnesium concentration may benefit patients.&#xD;
      Outcomes that may be improved include mortality, cardiovascular outcomes, and muscle cramps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While it is possible to raise the concentration of serum magnesium through oral supplements,&#xD;
      using dialysis to do this is simpler and safer. It has no additional cost, does not add to a&#xD;
      patient's pill burden, is not dependent on an adherent patient taking their pills, and avoids&#xD;
      the gastrointestinal side effects of oral magnesium supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the investigator is able to demonstrate that a higher dialysate magnesium concentration&#xD;
      improves patient outcomes, this formulation can be readily adopted to improve the care of ∼2&#xD;
      million patients receiving hemodialysis worldwide.&#xD;
