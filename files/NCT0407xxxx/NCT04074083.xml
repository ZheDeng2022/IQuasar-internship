    <textblock>
      The research hypothesis is that sick children attending primary health care (PHC) clinics who&#xD;
      are managed by IMCI-trained health workers (HWs) using electronic Integrated Management of&#xD;
      Childhood Illness guidelines (e-IMCI) receive better quality of care compared to children&#xD;
      managed by HWs using conventional paper-based IMCI (pIMCI). The aim of the study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of e-IMCI to improve care for sick children under five years&#xD;
      attending PHC clinics in one district in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess feasibility and acceptability of eIMCI implementation in PHC clinics&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare clinic-based management of sick children using e-IMCI with a gold standard&#xD;
           IMCI assessment, and those managed using p-IMCI to a gold standard IMCI assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the cost effectiveness of e-IMCI compared to p-IMCI implementation in PHC&#xD;
           clinics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of sick children receiving all medications indicated among children managed&#xD;
           by HWs using eIMCI and HWs using pIMCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of sick children with risk/high risk of Tuberculosis, HIV or HIV exposed,&#xD;
           and/or malnutrition correctly identified among children assessed using eIMCI and&#xD;
           children assessed using pIMCI, compared to a gold standard IMCI assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incremental cost-effectiveness of eIMCI implementation vs standard of care (pIMCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will employ a prospective two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial. Sample size:&#xD;
      a total of 30 clinics in one district will be randomly selected to participate and allocated&#xD;
      to the intervention (eIMCI) group (n=15) and control (pIMCI) group (n=15). One IMCI trained&#xD;
      HW will be randomly selected from each clinic to participate. Six observations will be&#xD;
      conducted with each participating health worker Intervention HWs will receive an IMCI update&#xD;
      and computer training based on eIMCI. Control HWs will receive a similar update using pIMCI.&#xD;
      Both groups will receive support visits and intervention HWs will receive additional&#xD;
      computer/IT support. Health worker knowledge will be assessed pre and post training using a&#xD;
      self-administered questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of care will be assessed in both groups using exit interviews with mothers and review&#xD;
      of child health records. In addition, gold standard IMCI assessments will be conducted by an&#xD;
      IMCI expert to determine correct findings. Assessment and management of the child by the IMCI&#xD;
      expert will be compared to that of the participating HW to determine quality of care&#xD;
      provided.&#xD;

      Research Hypothesis The research hypothesis is that sick children attending primary health&#xD;
      care (PHC) clinics who are managed by IMCI-trained health workers (HWs) using electronic&#xD;
      Integrated Management of Childhood Illness guidelines (e-IMCI) receive improved quality of&#xD;
      care compared to children managed by HWs using conventional paper-based IMCI (pIMCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim To evaluate the effectiveness of e-IMCI to improve care for sick children under five&#xD;
      years attending PHC clinics in one district in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the feasibility and acceptability of implementation of e-IMCI in primary&#xD;
           health care clinics&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the clinic-based management of sick children using e-IMCI with a gold&#xD;
           standard IMCI assessment, and those managed using p-IMCI to a gold standard IMCI&#xD;
           assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the cost effectiveness of e-IMCI compared to p-IMCI implementation in&#xD;
           primary health care clinics&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study oversight Study activities will be overseen by a eIMCI steering group. This will&#xD;
           include representatives from KZN Department of Health, UKZN, Ilembe district and ELMA&#xD;
           foundation. The steering committee will meet three times per year for the duration of&#xD;
           the project to review progress of project activities and provide oversight and advice&#xD;
           where appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Research methodology The study will employ a prospective two-arm cluster randomized&#xD;
           controlled trial (RCT) to test the hypothesis that implementation of eIMCI will&#xD;
           effectively improve quality of care for sick children under five years attending PHC&#xD;
           clinics. A total of 30 clinics in one district will be randomly selected to participate,&#xD;
           with 15 clinics each randomly allocated to the intervention (eIMCI) and control (pIMCI)&#xD;
           groups. One IMCI trained HW will be randomly selected from among all IMCI trained HWs in&#xD;
           each clinic to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study site The study will be undertaken in the Ilembe District in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN),&#xD;
           South Africa. This district was selected in partnership with the KZN Department of&#xD;
           Health. There are four hospitals, including one regional hospital, two community health&#xD;
           centres, and 31 primary health care (PHC) clinics. All PHC clinics are reported to have&#xD;
           at least one IMCI trained health worker.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ilembe health district is situated in KZN, and contains one small urban area and a large&#xD;
           deep rural area, and serves a population of approximately 663 000 people living in&#xD;
           around 198 000 households. Ilembe district comprises 4 sub-districts namely KwaDukuza,&#xD;
           Ndwedwe, Mandeni and Maphumulo Ilembe is characterised by high rates of poverty and&#xD;
           unemployment, and high prevalence of Tuberculosis and HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
           There are two study populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  IMCI trained HWs&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mothers of sick children aged &lt; five years attending the clinic. Sampling &amp;&#xD;
                recruitment PHC clinics: Simple random sampling will be used to select 30 PHC&#xD;
                facilities to participate in the study from all 31 clinics in Ilembe district.&#xD;
                Simple randomization will be used to assign clinics in the intervention or control&#xD;
                groups (n=15 per group). Clinics with no IMCI trained nurses will not be eligible&#xD;
                to participate and will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
           IMCI trained nurses: Simple random sampling will be used to select one IMCI trained&#xD;
           nurse in each clinic to participate in the study from all eligible IMCI trained nurses&#xD;
           working in the clinic. However, two IMCI trained nurses in selected clinics will&#xD;
           participate in the intervention, with the intention that e-IMCI will be implemented in&#xD;
           the entire clinic, rather than just selecting a single individual to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mothers of children under five-years: Systematic sampling will be used to select mothers&#xD;
           attending the clinic with children who are aged under five years to participate in the&#xD;
           study. All mothers with sick children waiting in the queue each day will be identified.&#xD;
           In order to reduce observer bias, sampling of children will be undertaken in a&#xD;
           systematic way that 1) spaces out the number of children selected, and 2) is&#xD;
           unpredictable to reduce the possibility that the observed HW can identify which child&#xD;
           will be reviewed. We will finalise this process depending on the size of the clinic, and&#xD;
           number of children seen daily, with the aim of observing two- three sick children each&#xD;
           day of observation. Observations in each clinic will continue for one week (4-5 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample size Sample size calculation is based on the primary outcome measure, which is&#xD;
           the proportion of children who receive all treatments indicated and is powered to detect&#xD;
           a difference of 20% in the proportion of children receiving all treatments in the&#xD;
           intervention and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample sizes of 90 in group one and 90 in group two, which were obtained by sampling 15&#xD;
           clusters (PHC clinics) with 6 subjects (observed children) each in the intervention&#xD;
           group, and 15 clusters with 6 subjects each in the control group to achieve 81% power to&#xD;
           detect a difference between the group proportions of 0.2000. The group two proportion is&#xD;
           0.7000. The group one proportion is assumed to be 0.7000 under the null hypothesis and&#xD;
           0.9000 under the alternative hypothesis. The test statistic used is the two-sided Z test&#xD;
           (unpooled). The significance level of the test was 0.0500.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Description of the intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The intervention will be undertaken in Ilembe District in KwaZulu-Natal. Training and&#xD;
           support visits will be overseen and conducted by implementation staff in partnership&#xD;
           with staff from the DoH.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Development of an eIMCI/pIMCI training course:&#xD;
&#xD;
           An eIMCI training course will be developed with two components 1) basic computer skills&#xD;
           training 2) case studies to develop eIMCI skills Structured piloting of an eIMCI&#xD;
           training course will be undertaken to ensure that participants receive enough training&#xD;
           to reach competency.&#xD;
&#xD;
           the pIMCI training will be developed with the same case studies using a paper-based&#xD;
           approach to ensure that study participants receive exactly the same IMCI training in&#xD;
           intervention and control clinics, so that the groups differ only in respect of how IMCI&#xD;
           is used (computer based vs paper-based).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Deployment of computers:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ahead of implementation of the eIMCI intervention computers and printers will be&#xD;
           purchased and deployed in the child health/IMCI consulting room in all intervention&#xD;
           clinics. This computer will be available for use of any IMCI trained health worker&#xD;
           consulting with sick children during the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Facilitators for district based training:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Training will be conducted by implementation staff assisted by local DoH trainers in&#xD;
           Ilembe district. These trainers will be trained ahead of the district training using the&#xD;
           course developed in the pilot. Although district DoH staff may assist with training we&#xD;
           plan to involve as few staff members as possible to mimimise bias and contamination&#xD;
           given that many DoH staff are routinely visiting both intervention and control clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Training of participating health workers (eIMCI and pIMCI):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Two IMCI trained health workers will receive training in each clinic (N= 30 HWs in each&#xD;
           arm). This will be the selected participant plus another IMCI trained health worker in&#xD;
           the clinic (if there is one available). Participants will receive either a paper-based&#xD;
           update of pIMCI or eIMCI training.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Both computer skills and IMCI knowledge will be assessed at beginning and end of the&#xD;
           training.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Support visits (IMCI and IT) Following the training, there will be two IMCI support&#xD;
           visits for all IMCI trained health workers (eIMCI and pIMCI). This will assist eIMCI&#xD;
           participants to transfer their new skills to the workplace and will address any initial&#xD;
           problems of participants. This will be a structured visit using case studies and will be&#xD;
           mirrored for pIMCI participants using paper to ensure participants in both groups&#xD;
           receive similar support.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A cellphone based group (WhatsApp group) will be set up to provide support for IT&#xD;
           problems to eIMCI participants if they experience any problems with the computer or the&#xD;
           programme. If IT problem cannot be resolved over the phone an IT support specialist will&#xD;
           visit the clinic to assist the participant. The IT support role will be conducted by&#xD;
           external IT experts .&#xD;
&#xD;
           Any study personal who are involved in the evaluation of the study will be separate from&#xD;
           the training / intervention component.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collection (quantitative) Preparation: Before the start of the RCT the study team&#xD;
           will work with the Maternal Child and Womens' health directorate and with the Ilembe&#xD;
           District Health Management Team to prepare the district for implementation of the&#xD;
           research study. All participating clinics will be visited before the start to inform the&#xD;
           operational manager about the study, identify IMCI trained health workers who are&#xD;
           eligible to participate, and thereby create a sampling frame from which IMCI trained HWs&#xD;
           will be selected. Background information will be collected about provision of child&#xD;
           health services at each clinic and resources available at the clinic, for example&#xD;
           equipment, staff, drugs etc including any history of recent drug stock outs at the&#xD;
           clinic. The appropriate site for deployment of the computer will be identified. A&#xD;
           further visit may be required for the purpose of selecting participants and placing the&#xD;
           computer in the clinical area.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Tracking of implementation of eIMCI: Data collection will commence six weeks after the&#xD;
           start of eIMCI/pIMCI implementation in the clinic. This implementation period will allow&#xD;
           participants to gain confidence in using eIMCI and to receive support visits. The&#xD;
           training and data collection will be staggered to ensure a similar duration of the&#xD;
           implementation period among all participants. The following data will be tracked in&#xD;
           eIMCI clinics over the six-week period of implementation and for a total of six months&#xD;
           post implementation: proportion of children seen by eIMCI trained health workers where&#xD;
           the eIMCI system is used; number and nature of IT problems experienced by eIMCI nurses;&#xD;
           how IT problems were addressed; number of additional visits for IT support; any stock&#xD;
           outs of medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Field worker selection and training: Data will be collected by a team of data&#xD;
           collectors, comprising one expert IMCI practitioner and one field worker, in each of the&#xD;
           intervention and control clinics. Data collection teams will collect data either in&#xD;
           intervention or control clinics, to minimize bias there will be no cross over between&#xD;
           the two groups. The data collection teams will receive training for two weeks on data&#xD;
           collection processes, which will include piloting of the data collection techniques in a&#xD;
           clinic in another district not implementing eIMCI. In addition, expert IMCI&#xD;
           practitioners will receive any updates or refreshers in IMCI assessment that are deemed&#xD;
           appropriate to ensure they are able to provide a competent gold standard assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collection activities: The data collection period for each participating health&#xD;
           worker will be arranged to ensure that the selected HW is on-duty and seeing sick&#xD;
           children. Data collection teams will be deployed in each participating clinic for&#xD;
           one-week (four to five working days) to collect data. During the data collection period&#xD;
           all sick children in the queue to be seen by the observed health worker will be&#xD;
           identified, and each day a systematic sampling process will be used so that care is&#xD;
           reviewed for 2-3 children . A minimum of six case reviews will be done for each&#xD;
           participating health worker. The total number of sick children seen by the observed HW,&#xD;
           and the time each child spends in the consulting room will be recorded during the period&#xD;
           of data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data will be collected using a combination of exit interviews with mothers, review of&#xD;
           the patient held records and review of medication received or prescribed. In addition,&#xD;
           each child will be reassessed to provide a gold-standard IMCI assessment against which&#xD;
           the HWs management can be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data sources:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Health worker knowledge and skills assessment pre and post training in both groups&#xD;
           Electronic monitoring of eIMCI use from the software Tracking tool for assessing time&#xD;
           spent in the consulting room Exit interviews Reviews of patient held records Gold&#xD;
           standard IMCI assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data Collection (qualitative) A series of qualitative data collection activities will be&#xD;
           conducted to assess feasibility and acceptability of eIMCI implementation before, during&#xD;
           and after eIMCI implementation in participating intervention clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In-depth interviews/reference groups will be conducted in IsiZulu for mothers and in&#xD;
           English for HWs by experienced researchers. All in-depth interviews will be audio&#xD;
           recorded. All the interviews will be transcribed and translated into English in&#xD;
           preparation for data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Reference groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Before the implementation of eIMCI a series of four reference groups will be conducted&#xD;
           with IMCI trained professional nurses in clinics in another district not implementing&#xD;
           eIMCI. A group of IMCI trained nurses who routinely provide services to sick children in&#xD;
           a given clinic will be brought together to participate in a focus group discussion&#xD;
           (FGD). The aim of the reference groups is to explore the experiences of providing care&#xD;
           to children in PHC clinics, how child health services are provided, and what the current&#xD;
           challenges are with providing services to sick children and with IMCI implementation. We&#xD;
           will then introduce and demonstrate the eIMCI programme, and nurses will be asked to&#xD;
           comment on potential implementation of this approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Using this approach we will be able to use experiences and responses from nurses to&#xD;
           identify and anticipate challenges of feasibility and acceptability of implementing&#xD;
           eIMCI. In addition we will be able to explore overall challenges related to IMCI&#xD;
           implementation which may be equally relevant to eIMCI. If appropriate, implementation of&#xD;
           the e-IMCI roll out may be adapted to address these concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In-depth interviews with mothers:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In-depth interviews will be conducted with mothers managed by a health worker using&#xD;
           eIMCI to explore their experience of having the health worker use eIMCI during the&#xD;
           consultation. Mothers will be eligible to participate if she reports that the HW&#xD;
           consulted the computer during the consultation. Topics to be explored will include&#xD;
           experiences during the eIMCI consultation, and how the use of the computer was perceived&#xD;
           by mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           One mother will be selected for an in-depth interview (IDI) from eight randomly selected&#xD;
           clinics during the period of data collection (n=8 participants). If necessary, in-depth&#xD;
           interviews will be continued until no further themes emerge.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In depth interviews with IMCI trained HWs implementing eIMCI:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Health workers using eIMCI will be selected for in-depth interviews in six randomly&#xD;
           selected clinics on completion of data collection. We will purposively select three&#xD;
           eIMCI participants who used eIMCI for a high proportion of their assessments (&gt;80%&#xD;
           consultations with sick children) and four participants who implemented eIMCI poorly&#xD;
           (&lt;50% consultations) to identify barriers and enablers for IMCI implementation. If&#xD;
           necessary, in-depth interviews will be continued until no new themes emerge.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In addition, three further IDIs will be conducted with good implementers 6 months after&#xD;
           completion of data collection to explore issues of sustainability and enablers and&#xD;
           barriers to implementation in the long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Consultation observations:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In order to explore how eIMCI implementation affects the nurse- mother relationship&#xD;
           during the consultation, a series of observations will be undertaken by an expert IMCI&#xD;
           practitioner on the study team who is also a trained qualitative researcher.&#xD;
           Consultations will observed among nurses using pIMCI and eIMCI (10 observations per&#xD;
           group) and a checklist will be used to record information about nurse- mother&#xD;
           interactions during the consultation. These observations will be conducted after the&#xD;
           quantitative data collection is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ethical considerations General All participants, both IMCI trained health workers and&#xD;
           mothers, will provide written informed consent. Consent forms will be prepared in both&#xD;
           the local language (isiZulu) and English, they will be read aloud to each potential&#xD;
           participant by a trained researcher and any questions will be addressed. All&#xD;
           participants will be informed that participation is voluntary for both community health&#xD;
           workers (CHW) and mothers; and that mothers have a right to withdraw from the study at&#xD;
           any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For any mother who is unable to write, a thumbprint will be obtained. Consent forms will&#xD;
           not be linked with the study information, and these will be kept separate from the data.&#xD;
           All signed consent forms will be kept in a locked cupboard for a period of five years&#xD;
           after the study is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During data collection If during the interview and assessment process of the child, the&#xD;
           IMCI fieldworkers observes that the mother did not receive all the treatment the child&#xD;
           needs, the fieldworker will ensure that the mother gets all the treatment needed for the&#xD;
           baby according to the reassessment done by the IMCI trained fieldworker. This will be&#xD;
           arranged in such a way to minimize the bias that could result if the HW was aware of&#xD;
           correction being made, and to avoid undermining the HW in the eyes of the mother.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mothers of sick children who are referred to hospital will be interviewed if it does not&#xD;
           interfere or disrupt treatment given to children; and the mother agrees to be&#xD;
           interviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           On completion of data collection the intervention team will work with staff in the&#xD;
           district to continue to roll out eIMCI and ensure that control clinics will also have&#xD;
           the opportunity to benefit from eIMCI. Computers used in the evaluation will be donated&#xD;
           to the clinics for ongoing eIMCI implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To maintain anonymity and confidentiality in qualitative data, participants' identity&#xD;
           will be protected through the use of pseudonyms or codes. Participants will be made&#xD;
           aware of the fact that data will be used for report writing, conference presentation and&#xD;
           thesis writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data analysis The quantitative data will be analysed using STATA. Qualitative data will&#xD;
           be analysed using NVIVO software, framework analysis with pre-determined themes will be&#xD;
           used in the process of analysing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cost and cost effectiveness analysis A cost and cost effectiveness analysis will be&#xD;
           undertaken. The cost analysis will take a provider perspective and provide an estimate&#xD;
           of incremental financial costs associated with delivering eIMCI. The provider&#xD;
           perspective is favoured ahead of the societal perspective as the costs incurred by&#xD;
           mothers across the two approaches to delivery are unlikely to differ significantly. The&#xD;
           incremental cost of the eIMCI, rather than the full cost, is favoured as it will provide&#xD;
           an estimate of the required increase in funding associated with a roll-out of eIMCI,&#xD;
           compared to continuing only with the current approach to IMCI. A financial perspective&#xD;
           is opted for ahead of an economic costing, as this will provide relevant information for&#xD;
           budgeting. Start-up costs, such as computers and training, will be included, but all&#xD;
           research costs will be excluded and only the costs associated with implementation&#xD;
           considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The costing for the incremental cost effectiveness analysis will also be from the&#xD;
           provider perspective, but will differ from that used in the simple cost analysis in a&#xD;
           number of ways. For the cost effectiveness analysis, financial and broader economic&#xD;
           costs will be included. For example, the inclusion of resources not paid for as part of&#xD;
           the intervention, but which are diverted to support the intervention. Moreover, the&#xD;
           incremental costs will be measured relative to the supported pIMCI provided at the&#xD;
           control clinics, as opposed to the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Using the data on the primary outcome measure, and the cost analysis conducted for the&#xD;
           purpose, the incremental cost effectiveness of eIMCI will be estimated: the cost per&#xD;
           additional sick child receiving all medications indicated. This calculation provides an&#xD;
           estimate of the returns associated with the additional investment in eIMCI.&#xD;
