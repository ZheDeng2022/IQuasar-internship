  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the relative bioavailability of the AZD7594 nebulized&#xD;
      formulations (test) and the dry powder formulation (reference).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study results will provide information on the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile following use&#xD;
      of the 2 devices to be used in further clinical development.&#xD;

      This study will be an open-label, randomised, 3 period, 3-treatment, crossover study in&#xD;
      healthy subjects (males and females), performed at a single clinical unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comprise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A screening period of maximum 28 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three treatment periods during which subjects will be resident from the morning (fasting&#xD;
           conditions) of the day before dosing with AZD7594 (Day -1) until at least 48 hours after&#xD;
           dosing; discharged on the morning of Day 3;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two ambulatory visits (Day 4 and Day 5) within each treatment period; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A final visit 10 to 14 days after the last administration of AZD7594.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be a minimum washout period of 10 days between each dose administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 24 subjects will be randomised to receive single doses of AZD7594 on 3 occasions,&#xD;
      under fasted conditions (overnight fast of at least 10 hours):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment A: 0.7 mg (delivered dose) AZD7594 via nebulizer, test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment B: 1.6 mg (delivered dose) AZD7594 via nebulizer, test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment C: 720 μg (delivered dose) AZD7594 via dry powder inhaler (DPI), reference&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be involved in the study for approximately 10 to 12 weeks.&#xD;
