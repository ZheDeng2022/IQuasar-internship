  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare B-cell variant of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is&#xD;
      confined to the brain, leptomeninges, spinal cord, and eyes. The optimum treatment for&#xD;
      patients with recurrent PCNSL remains challenging and at present there is no universally&#xD;
      accepted therapeutic approach . The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of camrelizumab [a programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor] for recurrent patients&#xD;
      with primary CNS lymphoma.&#xD;
