  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every day, a significant number of children and young people in Norway experience violence,&#xD;
      abuse, or other potentially traumatizing events. These children are at risk of developing&#xD;
      serious health problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression,&#xD;
      behavioral problems, and drug dependency. Moreover, when left unaddressed, trauma experiences&#xD;
      in childhood can have long-term implications for work- and educational participation as well&#xD;
      as later subjection to violence. Provision of accessible and situationally adaptable&#xD;
      treatments can therefore have great benefits for children, families, and communities at&#xD;
      large.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, the investigators will introduce the method of Stepped-Care Trauma-Focused&#xD;
      Behavioral Cognitive Therapy (SC-TF-CBT) in a selection of 15 municipalities across Norway.&#xD;
      SC-TF-CBT is a parent-led - therapist-assisted low-threshold method aimed at treating&#xD;
      children exposed to abuse, sexual assault, or other trauma and who are at risk of developing&#xD;
      more severe trauma-related difficulties (Salloum, et al. 2014). This is the first test of the&#xD;
      method outside the US. The project's main aim is therefore to evaluate the feasibility and&#xD;
      efficiency of the treatment in a Norwegian context through a pre-post design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following questions are to be explored:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How does the SC-TF-CBT model fit the Norwegian health care culture and service system?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. When testing Stepped-Care in a Norwegian context, the model is set to involve both the&#xD;
           municipal and specialist service levels. Severe cases will be stepped up/transferred to&#xD;
           the specialist level for TF-CBT treatment. How do these transitions work for the&#xD;
           participating families, and what are the experiences and perspectives of practitioners&#xD;
           and service-leaders regarding coordination and collaboration between service levels?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Do the children, parents, and therapists like working with the method?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Do recipients of the treatment (children and parents) report symptom improvement?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Which children and parents seem to benefit the most from the method, and who do not?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stepped-Care Trauma-Focused Behavioral Cognitive Therapy (SC-TF-CBT) is a semi home-based&#xD;
      treatment for children at risk of developing PTSD, where the child's caregiver takes on the&#xD;
      role as helper under the guidance of a trained therapist. The treatment runs over a course of&#xD;
      approximately 12-15 weeks and has two phases. In cases where symptom improvement is evident&#xD;
      after 6-9 weeks, the following 6 weeks is a maintenance phase. In the maintenance phase, the&#xD;
      child and caregiver will continue with some of the exercises found helpful and engage in&#xD;
      pleasant activities together, while receiving follow-ups by the therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases where symptoms persist, however, the treatment is stepped up to TF-CBT. In the&#xD;
      Norwegian context, in contrast to the US, stepping up will imply that responsibility for the&#xD;
      treatment is transferred from the municipal service level to a Child and Youth Psychiatric&#xD;
      Policlinic (BUP). In this particular way, the treatment scheme is adapted to the local&#xD;
      context, while ensuring continuity as intended by the developers. Examining how this&#xD;
      transition is experienced, how the transition is reasoned for and organized, and the&#xD;
      transitions correspond with treatment needs are therefore important objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first stage of this trial project involves providing SC-TF-CBT training to 45 therapists&#xD;
      (primarily clinical psychologists with experience in trauma treatment and working with&#xD;
      children/ families) in the 15 municipalities across Norway. Training is carried out by&#xD;
      specialists in psychology at NKVTS in collaboration with the University of South Florida&#xD;
      (USF). Following the training, the therapists will receive referrals as usual, but will be&#xD;
      equipped with an additional treatment method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While protocols exist for two age categories (3-6 and 7-12), this project focuses on children&#xD;
      between the ages of 7-12. In total, about 75 children (and caregivers) will participate in&#xD;
      the study. This estimate takes into account a possible dropout rate of about 30 percent. In&#xD;
      order to produce sufficiently strong analysis, including mediator analysis, the&#xD;
      investigators' calculations indicate that the study requires 58 children to complete the&#xD;
      SC-TF-CBT program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregivers and children participating in the study will be asked to provide information about&#xD;
      symptoms and treatment experiences at several points throughout the treatment trajectory. The&#xD;
      therapist will collect information by way of assessment forms available for completion on&#xD;
      iPads. The therapists will also submit evaluations throughout the trajectory of each family&#xD;
      by way of online assessment forms and 3 months after treatment completion. Audio recordings&#xD;
      from treatment session will be used to determine fidelity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To attain data on entire trajectories, from pre-screening through completed treatments, the&#xD;
      quantitative data will be supplemented by qualitative, semi-structured interviews with&#xD;
      children, caregivers, and therapists. The interviews are to take place upon treatment&#xD;
      completion, after approximately 12-15 weeks. A similar time-frame will be adopted for&#xD;
      interviews with families transferred to the specialist service level, who will complete one&#xD;
      interview after completion/interruption of Step 1, and then a short second interview 12 weeks&#xD;
      after starting treatment in specialist health services, to explore the experiences with the&#xD;
      transition. Additionally, to assess the long-term effects of the treatment, the investigators&#xD;
      will invite a sample of children and caregivers for follow-up interviews 3-4 months after&#xD;
      completion.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline (T0), 6-9 weeks (T2), 12-15 weeks (T3), 24-27 weeks (T4)</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Assessment of Trauma Paths and Symptoms (CATS) (Sachser et al., 2017). The investigators use a revised edition of CATS, based on DSM5 and ICD-11. CATS consists of 15 questions about stressful or scary experiences, 20 questions measuring level of post-traumatic stress responses (to be answered if &quot;yes&quot; on one of the first 15 items), and 5 questions about the social/ performance consequences of experienced problems. Both the Children's version and the Caregiver version of CATS 2.0 contain the same questions, but formulated according to their different points of view. The 15 questions about trauma events are answered by indicating &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no.&quot; The 20 items about symptomatology are scored from 0 (never) to 3 (almost all the time). The final 5 items are indicated with &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no.&quot; In order to measure change, the questions will be completed at three points in time by caregivers and children, respectively.</description>

    <time_frame>T1 (start-up), 6-9 weeks (T2), T3 (12-15 weeks), 24-27 weeks (T4)</time_frame>
    <description>17D is a validated health-related quality of life survey for children aged 8-11 years (but can be used for 7-year-olds with the aid of an adult) (Apajasalo et al., 1996). The form consists of 17 questions that deal with both physical and mental health. On each of the 17 questions (dimensions) the respondent indicates the appropriate level on each dimension). The scale runs from 1-5, with 5 indicating better outcome. Each dimension has been ascribed a utility weight, which is used to calculate an overall score across dimensions. Quality of life is determined by a single index (17D score) on a 0-1 scale, where 1 is the better outcome.</description>

    <description>Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM) is one of three related instruments (acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility) developed to fill a need for measures to predicting outcomes, for instance when a treatment is about to be introduced in a new context (Weiner et al., 2017). According to the developers, the measures can be used together or separately. The present research will use the measures, which are scored separately, together to predict how Stepped-Care TF-CBT might suit a Norwegian context. Translation (back-translations) to Norwegian was done by NKVTS. Each measure has 4-items that are scored from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree). Average scores are calculated for each measure. The questions will be posed one time to all participating therapists, prior to recruiting first family for SC-TF-CBT.</description>

    <description>The Child and Adolescent Social Support Scale (CASSS 2000) is a scale consisting of four modules. In this study only one of the modules will be included; the children's self-reported experience of social support from the parents. This sub-scale consists of 12 questions. CASSS is a validated instrument for 8-11 year olds (Malecki &amp; Demaray, 2002). The research group has translated the scale in collaboration with the developers, with independent translation back to English (back-translation) to ensure the quality. The 12 items are scored from 1 (never) to 6 (always).</description>

    <description>Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) and Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) consists of one single question each and are used to make a simple assessment of the condition and level of functioning in children at the first meeting and subsequently to assess changes in condition and functioning at later meetings. Both the children and the caregivers will respond, in addition to the therapist (Busner &amp; Targum, 2007). The wording of the questions can easily accommodate different types of patients. CGI has been used in a variety of populations, including children receiving Stepped Care TF-CBT (Salloum et al., 2014), patients with social anxiety (Zaider, Heimberg, Fresco, Schneier, &amp; Liebowitz, 2003) and bipolar disorder (Spearing, Post, Leverich, Brandt, &amp; Nolen, 1997). CGI-S is scored 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (extremely ill). CGI-I is scored from 8 (extreme/serious worsening) to 1 (no symptoms).</description>

    <description>ERF originally consists of 5 questions (Borkovec &amp; Nau, 1972). The first 3 questions have previously been used to assess the expectations and trust of Stepped Care TF-CBT prior to initiation of the intervention (Salloum et al., 2014). The questions were adapted from Borkovec and Nau (1972). The project group has made a cross-checked translation of the US version to Norwegian. Items 1-4 are scored from 1 (not at all) to 10 (very). Item 5 is scored on an 11-point scale from 0% to 100% expected improvement.</description>

    <description>Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC-17) is a measure of child behavior to be filled out by parents. PSC-17 is a short-form of PSC-34 and contains questions that will measure the attention (such as ability to concentrate), externalizing behavior (such as outward behavior) and internalizing behavior (like anxiety). The PSC-17 has proved to be a good measure compared to longer scales (Gardner, Lucas, Kolko, &amp; Campo, 2007). The scale has been translated into Norwegian by the research group and the Norwegian text has been translated back to English to check the translation (back-translation). The 17 items are scored from 0 (never) to 2 (often).</description>
