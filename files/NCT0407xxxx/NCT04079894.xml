      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People would like to live longer while still staying healthy, active and able to enjoy life.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, many elderlies get symptoms that prevent them from this. A disease with such&#xD;
      symptoms is Lumbar Spinal Stenosis (LSS), which comes with severe pain and reduction of&#xD;
      walking ability. One of the main goals when treating patients with spinal stenosis, is to&#xD;
      increase their walking ability in everyday life. As of today, there is no adequate&#xD;
      measurement instrument for the task. Many have encountered step counters in mobile phones or&#xD;
      as wristbands. Unfortunately, they are not validated and tested in playing the part of a&#xD;
      scientific instrument when measuring walking in patients with spinal stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research project will develop the step counter- e.g. accelerometer, to be an accurate&#xD;
      and feasible measurement of walking activity in daily living. The measure is expected to be&#xD;
      sensitive enough for therapy evaluation. This will enable researchers to make relevant and&#xD;
      informed interventions on increasing walking ability. Furthermore, the measure is expected to&#xD;
      grant further research into its diagnostic possibilities and prognostic uses, where it could&#xD;
      become a valuable clinical tool. By developing the accelerometer measure, health care and&#xD;
      health policies can be guided towards effectively helping spinal stenosis patients to an&#xD;
      active everyday life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to develop a valid and feasible measure of walking ability in&#xD;
      patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed in three phases. In the first phase, the accelerometer&#xD;
      measurement method will be developed and tested in a standardized environment. In the second&#xD;
      phase, patients with lumbar spinal stenosis and healthy participants will be instructed to&#xD;
      wear an accelerometer for seven days during their normal everyday life. Furthermore, they&#xD;
      will be asked to perform a walking test and fill out questionnaires. In the third phase,&#xD;
      previously included patients which have received decompressive surgery to relieve symptoms of&#xD;
      LSS, will be invited to come to the clinic for a follow-up three months after surgery. The&#xD;
      follow-up will repeat the accelerometer measures, walking test and questionnaires performed&#xD;
      in the second phase.&#xD;

      Background People live longer than ever before. This desirable progress puts healthy ageing&#xD;
      on the agenda, people would like to live longer while still staying healthy, active and able&#xD;
      to enjoy life. Unfortunately, many elderlies get symptoms that prevent them from this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A disease with such symptoms is Lumbar Spinal Stenosis (LSS), which mainly afflicts people&#xD;
      over 60 years old. It comes with pain in back and legs that worsens by standing and walking,&#xD;
      with pain relief upon sitting and bending forward. This puts a considerable strain on&#xD;
      patients' walking ability, with patients experiencing problems with exercising and leisure&#xD;
      activities. Physical activity is significantly reduced, a recent study shows that those&#xD;
      persons spend 82% of their time in sedentary mode, compared to 35% in healthy adults over 60&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Walking ability in clinical research regarding LSS patients is assessed mainly by Patient&#xD;
      Reported Outcomes (PROs) and walking tests. The PRO most used is the Oswestry Disability&#xD;
      Index (ODI), other PROs include the Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire (SSSQ) and the Roland&#xD;
      Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ). PROs have the disadvantage of being subjective, with&#xD;
      factors influencing the answers such as response shift and psyche. There is also research&#xD;
      that suggests that the patients' perspective is not fully described by these questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several objective walking tests are used to assess walking ability. The Self-Paced Walking&#xD;
      test has been suggested as the gold standard. They provide continuous data and are objective&#xD;
      but may be time consuming. They report patients' walking capacity- defined as patients'&#xD;
      walking ability in a standardized setting on a single testing occasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The question is, how do the PROs and the walking tests relate to walking activity in daily&#xD;
      living, also called walking performance? It seems the ODI associates to walking tests, the&#xD;
      ODI might thereby be reflecting walking capacity. It is not known if the PROs or the walking&#xD;
      tests reflect walking performance. There are multiple factors which influences walking&#xD;
      performance. For example, personal factors, contextual factors, and diseases like lumbar&#xD;
      spinal stenosis. Treatment for spinal stenosis could improve the results of a walking test,&#xD;
      but not necessarily increase walking ability in daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge is scarce on walking performance in patients with LSS. Accelerometers have been&#xD;
      used for measuring physical activity and steps in a wide range of research areas, including&#xD;
      LSS. They are small wearable sensors that register accelerations. The raw data on&#xD;
      accelerations can then be transformed by mathematical algorithms into variables, such as&#xD;
      number of steps taken. Studies on accelerometer-based step counts in older people have shown&#xD;
      it to be an accurate measure. But the accuracy of the step count depends much on where the&#xD;
      accelerometer is placed, how the raw accelerometer data is transformed and traits of the&#xD;
      person wearing it, such as gait speed, gait impairments and age. Some studies have used&#xD;
      accelerometers to measure step count in LSS patients. But the method for accelerometer&#xD;
      monitoring in patients with LSS is not yet fully developed, validated and standardized. There&#xD;
      is no research investigating the optimal anatomical placement for accurate step detection&#xD;
      using the selected population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify what interventions helps patients with lumbar spinal stenosis to increase walking&#xD;
      ability in their daily living, a valid and ready-to-use measure of walking performance is&#xD;
      needed. Only then can research on LSS effectively help patients to a healthy and active&#xD;
      ageing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aim and Objectives The aim of the study is to develop a valid and feasible&#xD;
      accelerometer-based outcome measure of walking performance in patients with lumbar spinal&#xD;
      stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has four main objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first objective is to develop an accelerometer measurement method that provides an&#xD;
           accurate and feasible outcome measure of walking in a standardized environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second objective is to test the validity of the outcome measure by examine whether&#xD;
           it can discriminate between walking performance in healthy subjects and patients with&#xD;
           lumbar spinal stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The third objective is to further test the validity by evaluate the accelerometer&#xD;
           outcome measure in the context of patients' walking capacity, commonly used PRO's and&#xD;
           self-reported walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The fourth objective is to test the outcome measures' ability to evaluate change before&#xD;
           and after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study Design The study will be performed in three phases. Phase A: In this phase the&#xD;
      accelerometer measurement method will be developed and tested in a standardized environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 patients will be instructed to wear four accelerometers and fill out questionnaires. The&#xD;
      accelerometers will be placed on the thigh, the ankle, the hip and lower back, while going&#xD;
      through a standardized movement protocol which will consist of the following: Walking in a&#xD;
      hospital corridor until stopped by symptoms (e.g. performing an SPWT), sitting down and&#xD;
      standing up and cycling on an exercising bike. The standardized movement protocol will be&#xD;
      recorded by filming the patients' legs, in the hospital corridor distances will be recorded&#xD;
      by simultaneously filming distances marked on the floor. Data from the film (number of steps,&#xD;
      time-stamps) will be extracted and double checked by a research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The accelerometer data from the first 15 patients will be used to optimize a model for&#xD;
      analyzing accelerometer data and determine the most favorable placement of the accelerometer.&#xD;
      This model will then be tested for accuracy in the last 15 patients and further developed if&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The model will be optimized to assess accurate step count and recording of starts and stops&#xD;
      in walking (length of continuous walking). Step count will be considered accurate when under&#xD;
      10% error and cycling not being falsely recorded as walking. Recording of continuous walking&#xD;
      will be considered accurate when a minimum of ten steps can be detected. Pauses between walks&#xD;
      will be considered adequately detected if a pause of minimum 10 seconds can be detected. The&#xD;
      method will be considered feasible if administration and analysis of the accelerometer can be&#xD;
      executed in less than 15-20 minutes per patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase B: 95 patients with lumbar spinal stenosis and 25 healthy participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to wear an accelerometer for seven days during their normal everyday life.&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to fill-out a short questionnaire on wearer experience upon returning&#xD;
      the accelerometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The accelerometer data from patients will be analyzed exploratively, where the&#xD;
      characteristics of the patients' walking is formed into outcome measures, including number of&#xD;
      steps and length of continuous walking. This outcome measures will in turn be drawn from the&#xD;
      accelerometer data from healthy participants and compared to the patients results. In&#xD;
      addition, questionnaires and clinical data will be collected and a walking test (SPWT)&#xD;
      performed while the patient wears an accelerometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the data collected, construct validity will be examined through testing a set of a&#xD;
      priori hypotheses, which describes how the accelerometer should be correlating to a number of&#xD;
      measures, if it measures walking correctly. The most important hypotheses to prove will&#xD;
      mainly be between the SPWT results and the accelerometer data recorded during the SPWT, and&#xD;
      the accelerometer measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase C: The patients from phase B which have had decompressive surgery performed to relieve&#xD;
      symptoms of LSS will be invited to come to the clinic for a follow-up three months after&#xD;
      surgery. The follow-up will repeat the accelerometer measures, walking test and&#xD;
      questionnaires performed in phase B. This will enable to test if the outcome measure can&#xD;
      evaluate change in walking, before and after treatment, and there by examine if it is&#xD;
      suitable for monitoring treatment effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Eligible patients will be asked to participate as part of the consultation.&#xD;
      Interested patients will receive a new appointment another day for inclusion with oral and&#xD;
      written consent and testing. Patients will be included consecutively in Phase B, for optimal&#xD;
      external validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Statistical Analysis The first phase with a standardized walking protocol&#xD;
      will include 30 participants. 30 patients are sufficient to show a statistically significant&#xD;
      correlation of 0,9 or higher, between steps filmed and steps detected by the accelerometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on data from previous studies measuring step counts in healthy older adults and&#xD;
      patients with LSS, 9 healthy participants will be able show a statistically significant&#xD;
      difference between the mean of healthy participants and patients (p&lt;0.05 and power 80%) at a&#xD;
      sampling ratio of 0,3 (n. healthy participants/ n. patients). 12 healthy participants will be&#xD;
      included to account for missing data and drop outs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlation between the ODI and accelerometer measured step count and continuous walking has&#xD;
      been shown to range from around 0.3 to 0.5. Walking tests have been shown to correlate above&#xD;
      0.5. A sample size of 85 patients is needed, to show a correlation of 0.3 or higher as&#xD;
      significantly different from 0, with p&lt;0.05 and power of 80%. Sample size when examining&#xD;
      associations between measurements in phase B and C will therefore be 95 to account for drop&#xD;
      outs and missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Project&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be completed in the course of three years. Facilities and Organization The&#xD;
      study will take place at the Spine Center of Southern Denmark, Lillebælt Hospital,&#xD;
      Middelfart, where more than 1000 patients are diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis each&#xD;
      year. Approximately 300 of those patients receive decompressive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in accordance with the Helsinki-II declaration. Participants will&#xD;
      be thoroughly informed verbally and in writing and asked for a written consent. The&#xD;
      participant can choose to leave the study at any point, without any consequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on all processing of personal data in this project will be added to the records&#xD;
      of the Region of Southern Denmark according to the GDPR article 30. Data collected by&#xD;
      accelerometers are uploaded directly, i.e., the project does not engage any cloud-based&#xD;
      surveillance systems involving third parties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination and Publication Policy The results will be part of a PhD thesis. Articles will&#xD;
      be written in compliance with the STROBE statement and STARD checklist and sought published&#xD;
      in international scientific journals, such as the European Spine Journal, regardless of the&#xD;
      nature or the results. The method will be evaluated during phase A. Presentation of research&#xD;
      findings will be sought to be done at international congresses. The accelerometer method&#xD;
      developed will be freely available to other researchers.&#xD;
