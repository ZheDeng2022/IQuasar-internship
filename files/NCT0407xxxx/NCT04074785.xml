        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed GBM at first or second recurrence after concurrent&#xD;
             chemoradiotherapy. Patients with an initial diagnosis of a lower-grade glioma are&#xD;
             eligible if a subsequent biopsy was determined to be GBM. GBMs either from the initial&#xD;
             resection or at repeat resection at recurrence must be analyzed by next-generation&#xD;
             exome sequencing (NES) and RNA-sequencing and must have the following aberrations:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Heterozygous or homozygous loss of CDKN2A and/or CDKN2B&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gain or amplification of CDK4 and/or 6&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Patients with GBMs having loss of function of RB1 are EXCLUDED.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Imaging confirmation of first tumor progression or regrowth as defined by the RANO&#xD;
             criteria. A minimum of 12 weeks must have elapsed from the completion of radiotherapy&#xD;
             to study entry to minimize the potential for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes&#xD;
             related to radiation necrosis that might be misdiagnosed as progression of disease,&#xD;
             unless there is a new lesion outside the radiation field or unequivocal evidence of&#xD;
             viable tumor on histopathological sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ≥ 60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroids within 5 days prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For women who are of child-bearing potential or surgically sterile (absence of ovaries&#xD;
             and/or uterus) and who are sexually active: to use an adequate method of contraception&#xD;
             (oral contraceptives, intrauterine contraceptive device, barrier method of&#xD;
             contraception in conjunction with spermicidal jelly) during the treatment period and&#xD;
             for at least 6 months after last dose of study drug. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For male patients who are partners of premenopausal women: agreement to use a barrier&#xD;
        method of contraception during the treatment period and for at least 6 months after the&#xD;
        last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female of child-bearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation,&#xD;
             having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the&#xD;
             following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e.,&#xD;
                  has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have undergone recent surgery for recurrent or progressive tumor are&#xD;
             eligible provided that:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgery must have confirmed the recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A minimum of 28 days must have elapsed from the day of surgery to study entry. For&#xD;
             core or needle biopsy, a minimum of 7 days must have elapsed prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Craniotomy or intracranial biopsy site must be adequately healed and free of drainage&#xD;
             or cellulitis, and the underlying cranioplasty must appear intact at the time of&#xD;
             randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be willing and able to provide written informed consent and to comply&#xD;
             with the study protocol as judged by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recovered (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events CTCAE]&#xD;

             from prior therapies include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≥ 28 days elapsed from the administration of any investigational agent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≥ 28 days elapsed from the administration of any prior cytotoxic agents, except ≥ 42&#xD;
             days from nitrosoureas&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Prior treatment with Novo-TTF therapy is allowed at initial diagnosis, but must be&#xD;
        discontinued prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to swallow oral medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
