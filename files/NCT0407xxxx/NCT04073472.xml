  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of using allogeneic bone&#xD;
      marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to treat people with an ileal pouch anal&#xD;
      anastomosis (IPAA) who develop a fistula in the setting of Crohn's disease of the pouch.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) remains the procedure of choice for&#xD;
      patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). IPAA allows at risk tissue to be removed with&#xD;
      restoration of intestinal continuity while maintaining favorable long-term functional&#xD;
      outcomes and quality of life. While less than 30% of patients experience short-term&#xD;
      postoperative morbidity following IPAA, up to 15% of pouches will ultimately fail due to&#xD;
      technical or inflammatory complications, the majority of which manifest as a fistula from the&#xD;
      pouch to the perianal or vaginal locations. Pouch failure due to a fistula tract is&#xD;
      notoriously difficult to treat. Despite immunosuppressive medications and attempts at local&#xD;
      repair, most patients will end up with a pouch excision and permanent ostomy. This can be a&#xD;
      devastating outcome in some patients as it impacts body image and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pelvic sepsis following original IPAA has been reported in 5% to 25% of patients, and is the&#xD;
      leading cause of pouch failure due to the development of pelvic fibrosis and decreased&#xD;
      distensibility of the pouch, ultimately resulting in poor pouch function. One of the leading&#xD;
      causes of pelvic sepsis and development of a pouch fistula is Crohn's Disease (CD) of the&#xD;
      pouch. While the majority of pouches are constructed for UC, up to 25% of patients with an&#xD;
      IPAA will end up having a change in diagnosis from UC to CD or development of de novo CD of&#xD;
      the pouch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first report of successful healing of a Crohn's fistula with mesenchymal stem cells&#xD;
      (MSCs) was in 2003. Since them great enthusiasm has spurred several phase I phase II, and&#xD;
      phase III trials designed to study the safety and efficacy of MSCs for perianal CD, all of&#xD;
      which have reported encouraging results with regard to safety and efficacy. With over 300&#xD;
      patients now treated, there is a large body of evidence supporting the local delivery of MSCs&#xD;
      to heal perianal Crohn's fistulas. Peri-pouch fistulas are similar to Crohn's perianal&#xD;
      fistulas except that instead of the rectum containing the internal opening of the fistula,&#xD;
      the internal opening is in the ileal pouch, constructed in place of the rectum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the high safety profile and relative success in treating perianal Crohn's disease with&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells, the investigators are using a GMP grade allogeneic bone marrow&#xD;
      derived MSC cell line to establish safety and secondarily monitor for healing in patients&#xD;
      with ileal pouch fistulas in the setting of Crohn's disease of the pouch. This trial will use&#xD;
      allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to produce regenerative signals.&#xD;
      The specific rationale for MSCs in IPAA is based upon 1) their anti-inflammatory properties;&#xD;
      2) published experience of MSC in this condition and perianal Crohn's fistula demonstrating&#xD;
      efficacy and safety; 3) existence of cGMP methods for their isolation and growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll adult men and women who have undergone IPAA at least six months prior&#xD;
      and now have a peri-pouch fistula related to Crohn's disease of the pouch. Patients who are&#xD;
      refractory to conventional medical therapy will be considered. Patients enrolled will be&#xD;
      those that meet current indications.&#xD;
