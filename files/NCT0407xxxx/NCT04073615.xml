      Comparing the efficacy of rivoceranib and trifluridine/tipiracil administered individually as&#xD;
      monotherapies, as well as a rivocernib plus trifluridine/tipiracil combination therapy in the&#xD;
      treatment of mCRC that is unresponsive to traditional chemotherapies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This a multicenter open-label study comparing safety, tolerability and efficacy of&#xD;
      rivoceranib monotherapy, trifluridine/tipiracil monotherapy and the combination of&#xD;
      rivoceranib plus trifluridine/tipiracil in subjects with mCRC. Subjects with histologically&#xD;
      or cytologically definitive adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum who have progressed&#xD;
      following standard of care therapy for colorectal cancer will be randomly assigned (1:1:2) to&#xD;
      rivoceranib, trifluridine/tipiracil or rivoceranib plus trifluridine/tipiracil treatment&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of an initial phase 1b portion to assess the safety of and determine&#xD;
      the RP2D of rivoceranib in combination with trifluridine/tipiracil. A subsequent phase 2&#xD;
      portion will assess the primary endpoint of PFS by investigator assessment.&#xD;
