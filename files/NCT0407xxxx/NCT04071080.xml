    <textblock>
      During this study, participants will ingest 100 mg of fluorescein disodium or a placebo (no&#xD;
      drug) mixed in GatoradeTM. Participants will then provide a urine sample after 10, 15, 20 or&#xD;
      30 minutes to see if the investigator can detect fluorescein fluorescence (light) in the&#xD;
      urine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every year, millions of dollars are spent on urine drug testing. Urine samples are generally&#xD;
      provided in an unwitnessed fashion. Only a small percentage of samples involve direct&#xD;
      observation of urination. The authenticity of the provided sample greatly affects its&#xD;
      clinical utility and/or the validity of the test results. Direct observation of urination can&#xD;
      be unpleasant and humiliating for people. For the institution, there are increased costs (for&#xD;
      example, staff, insurance) and risks regarding impropriety when direct observation is&#xD;
      utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are being asked to take part in a research study of an approved drug called&#xD;
      FluoresciteTM. FluoresciteTM is an intravenous drug (administered into a vein) that has been&#xD;
      approved by Health Canada. The active ingredient in FluoresciteTM is fluorescein disodium&#xD;
      (10% fluorescein disodium in sterile water).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluorescein disodium has been used medically for over fifty years. It is a fluorophore (emits&#xD;
      light, similar to a yellow glowstick) that is most commonly used in ophthalmology (the study&#xD;
      and treatment of disorders and diseases of the eye). It is currently used in angiography (to&#xD;
      view blood vessels), or topically for staining the eye's cornea. FluoresciteTM or fluorescein&#xD;
      disodium has not been approved by Health Canada for oral administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this study, participants will ingest 100 mg of fluorescein disodium or a placebo (no&#xD;
      drug) mixed in GatoradeTM. The Investigator will then ask the participant to provide a urine&#xD;
      sample after 10, 15, 20 or 30 minutes to see if he can detect fluorescence (light) in the&#xD;
      urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop a new standardized protocol for urine sampling that will increase sample&#xD;
           authenticity and make the situation between the patient/physician more pleasant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of orally ingested fluorescein disodium.&#xD;
