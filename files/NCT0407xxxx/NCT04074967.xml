    <textblock>
      In this study, the Phase Ib portion aims to establish safety and tolerability of ARRY-614&#xD;
      with either nivolumab or ipilimumab and to determine a recommended phase II dose of ARRY-614&#xD;
      in combination with either nivolumab or nivolumab+ipilimumab immunotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      selected advanced solid tumors. The Phase II portion will estimate the efficacy of ARRY-614&#xD;
      in combination with either nivolumab or ARRY-614 + nivolumab+ipilimumab immunotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with with NSCLC, HNSCC, melanoma and RCC and melanoma.&#xD;

      This phase Ib/II study of PO administered ARRY-614 in combination with checkpoint&#xD;
      immunotherapy. In phase Ib, this includes ARRY-614 plus nivolumab or ARRY-614 +&#xD;
      nivolumab+ipilimumab in patients with selected advanced solid tumors. In phase II, this&#xD;
      includes ARRY-614 in combination with nivolumab in a combined cohort of NSCLC and HNSCCC as&#xD;
      well as two arms with patients having either melanoma and RCC, where ARRY-614 will be&#xD;
      combined with nivolumab+ipilimumab. The objective of the Ib phase is to determine the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and recommended phase II dose of ARRY-614 with either nivolumab or&#xD;
      nivolumab+ipilimumab combination therapy. The objective of Phase II is to determine best ORR&#xD;
      in the three separate phase II arms: ARRY-614 plus nivolumab+ipilimumab in melanoma or RCC as&#xD;
      well as ARRY-614 plus nivolumab in a combined cohort of NSCLC and HNSCC. The recommended&#xD;
      phase II dose will be informed by the phase Ib safety study of ARRY-614, the plasma PK of&#xD;
      ARRY-614 and the metabolite, AR00451575, and the PD effects of ARRY-614 in pre and post dose&#xD;
      peripheral blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase Ib, trial participants will take ARRY-614 continuously in 4-week cycles (± 3 days).&#xD;
      Nivolumab and nivolumab+ipilimumab therapy will be dosed according to FDA-approved or&#xD;
      compendium supported dosing schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase II, a similar dosing schedule will be pursued once the recommended phase II dose of&#xD;
      ARRY-614 has been determined with nivolumab or nivolumab+ipilimumab. ARRY-614 will be given&#xD;
      on a daily PO schedule in 4-week cycles (± 3 days).&#xD;

          -  Have known symptomatic brain metastases requiring steroids. Patients with previously&#xD;
             diagnosed brain metastases are eligible if they have completed their treatment and&#xD;
             have recovered from the acute effects of radiation therapy or surgery prior to study&#xD;
             entry, have discontinued corticosteroid treatment for these metastases for at least 1&#xD;
             week and have radiographically stable disease for at least 1 month prior to study&#xD;
             entry. Note: up to 10 mg per day of prednisone equivalent will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a history of another primary cancer that is active requiring treatment,&#xD;
             progressing or for which the investigator believes will make disease assessment&#xD;
             unreliable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Underwent major surgery within 4 weeks of Day 1 or have not recovered from&#xD;
             post-surgery toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an active infection requiring systemic anti-infective therapy or with an&#xD;
             unexplained fever &gt;38.5°C within 7 days of Day 1 (at the discretion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, patients with tumor fever may be enrolled).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any known hypersensitivity to any of the components of ARRY-614 or&#xD;
             anti-PD1/ipilimumab combination therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have significant active cardiac disease within 6 months prior to the start of study&#xD;
             treatment, including New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV congestive&#xD;
             heart failure); myocardial infarction; unstable angina; and/or stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have known LVEF &lt;40% by ECHO scan (or by other methods according to institutional&#xD;
             practice) obtained within 28 days prior to the start of study treatment (testing is&#xD;
             not otherwise mandatory).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have known active hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) infections. Patients with a&#xD;
             sustained viral response to HCV treatment or immunity to prior HBV infection will be&#xD;
             permitted. Patients with chronic HBV that is adequately suppressed per institutional&#xD;
             practice will be permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, including recent&#xD;
             (within 12 months of Day 1) or active suicidal ideation or behavior, or a laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or&#xD;
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of&#xD;
             study results and, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the subject&#xD;
             inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have known active inflammatory gastrointestinal disease, chronic diarrhea, previous&#xD;
             gastric resection or lap band dysphagia, short-gut syndrome, gastroparesis, or other&#xD;
             conditions that limit the ingestion or gastrointestinal absorption of drugs&#xD;
             administered PO. Gastroesophageal reflux disease under medical treatment is allowed&#xD;
             (assuming no drug interaction potential).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have been committed to an institution by an order issued either by the judicial or&#xD;
             administrative authorities.&#xD;
