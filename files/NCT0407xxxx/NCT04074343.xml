    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib single-arm, open-label clinical trial determining the feasibility and&#xD;
      efficacy of TAS-102 and irinotecan in subjects with advanced gastric and gastroesophageal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma. These are subjects who are not candidates for curative treatments and who&#xD;
      have received at least one prior line of chemotherapy with a fluoropyrimidine and platinum&#xD;
      agent.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Progression-free Survival at 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>This is defined as the percentage of subjects who are free of progression 6 months after study treatment start. Progression is defined as death, radiographic progression or clinical deterioration attributed to disease progression as judged by an investigator. Radiographic progression is defined using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of an least 5 mm and/or appearance of new lesions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Grade 3-5 Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the tolerability of administering TAS-102 in combination with Irinotecan in patients with advanced recurrent or unresectable gastric and gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma for the first 2 cycles of study treatment. Toxicity and adverse events are based on the CTCAE (NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) Version 5.0.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Response Rate as Assessed by RECIST v1.1 Criteria of Patients Who Received TAS-102 and Irinotecan</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of registration until first date of disease progression, toxicity, delay of treatment, or withdrawal of treatment, whichever came first, an average of 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the overall response rate to the combination of TAS-102 and Irinotecan. Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as confirmed complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1): Complete Response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) is defined as a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions. ORR = CR + PR</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival of Patients Who Received TAS-102 and Irinotecan</measure>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed gastric or&#xD;
             gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic disease not amenable to curative&#xD;
             intent surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have progressed, or not tolerated, at least one line of treatment with a platinum&#xD;
             and/or fluoropyrimidine containing regimen. At least one cycle of combination&#xD;
             chemotherapy including a platinum (oxaliplatin, cisplatin, carboplatin) and/or&#xD;
             fluoropyrimidine (capecitabine or 5-Fluorouracil) based regimen for advanced disease.&#xD;
             Combination regimens with platinum/fluoropyrimidine containing a taxane and or a&#xD;
             checkpoint inhibitor are allowed. Patients progressing within six months of&#xD;
             perioperative chemotherapy or definitive chemoradiation for localized disease are&#xD;
             eligible. Patients who have exhausted all other standard of care options are also&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Performance status: ECOG performance status ≤2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. leukocytes : ≥ 3,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. absolute neutrophil count: ≥ 1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. platelets: ≥ 80,000/mcl&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. total bilirubin: within normal institutional limits&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of TAS-102 on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic&#xD;
             dose are unknown. For this reason and because topoisomerase inhibitors are known to be&#xD;
             teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following completion&#xD;
             of therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;

             1. A female of child-bearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation,&#xD;
             having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the&#xD;
             following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e.,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Ability to swallow tablets&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.&#xD;

             resolved to grade 1 or baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases due to poor prognosis and because they often&#xD;
             develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of&#xD;
             neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to TAS-102, irinotecan or other agents used in study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with irinotecan or TAS-102&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of another primary cancer within the last 3 years with the exception of&#xD;
