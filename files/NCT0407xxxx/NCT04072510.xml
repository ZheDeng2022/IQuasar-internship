  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Self-esteem group is a novel, manualised group programme designed for adolescent inpatients&#xD;
      with eating disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does the self-esteem group improve self-esteem in adolescent inpatients with eating&#xD;
      disorders? Are any changes in self-esteem maintained at 4 week follow-up after the group?&#xD;
      Does eating disorder psychopathology improve more during admission for those who complete the&#xD;
      self-esteem group compared to those who do not complete the group?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low self-esteem has been established as a strong predictor of onset, maintenance and relapse&#xD;
      in eating disorders. For patients with low self-esteem, change can be particularly difficult&#xD;
      to achieve. The intensity of their low self-esteem leads them to strive to control their&#xD;
      eating, weight and shape to gain a sense of self-worth and the pervasive negative view of&#xD;
      themselves results in them seeing little or no prospect of recovery. This suggests treatment&#xD;
      of low self-esteem is clinically and financially important. Studies have shown cognitive&#xD;
      behavioural based group therapies improve self esteem in adults with eating disordersÍ¾&#xD;
      however research including adolescents is limited. This research will contribute to the&#xD;
      evidence base for self-esteem interventions in adolescents and inform the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      new treatment. The research will be funded by Newbridge House, an inpatient unit for children&#xD;
      and adolescents with eating disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inpatients at Newbridge House aged 11 - 18, fulfilling DSM-V criteria for an eating disorder&#xD;
      will be recruited.Participants will be randomly allocated to a case or control group. Cases&#xD;
      will receive the 6 week self-esteem group in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) and will be&#xD;
      compared with controls who receive TAU. Both groups will complete a questionnaire pre-group,&#xD;
      post-group and 4 weeks post-group. Admission and discharge questionnaires routinely collected&#xD;
      will be examined to assess change in eating disorder psychopathology.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low self-esteem has been established as a strong predictor of onset, maintenance and relapse&#xD;
      in eating disorders. For patients with low self-esteem, change can be particularly difficult&#xD;
      to achieve, with the potential for prolonged admissions and increased burden of illness to&#xD;
      the individual and their family or carers. Significant low self-esteem can contribute to&#xD;
      increased striving to control eating, weight and shape to gain a sense of self-worth.&#xD;
      Furthermore, it can serve to maintain pervasive negative self- regard and a sense of little&#xD;
      or no prospect of recovery. This suggests treatment of low self-esteem is both clinically and&#xD;
      financially important. Studies have shown that cognitive behavioural based group therapies&#xD;
      can improve self-esteem in adults with eating disorders; however research including&#xD;
      adolescents is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will contribute to the evidence base for self-esteem interventions in adolescents&#xD;
      through evaluating the effectiveness of a new treatment. The self-esteem group intervention&#xD;
      evaluated in this study is a novel, manualised group therapy programme designed specifically&#xD;
      for adolescent inpatients with eating disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will be funded and supported by Newbridge House, inpatient unit for children and&#xD;
      adolescents with eating disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does delivery of a manualised self-esteem group intervention improve self-esteem in&#xD;
      adolescent inpatients with eating disorders?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Are any changes in self-esteem maintained at 4 week follow-up after the group? Does eating&#xD;
      disorder psychopathology improve more during the 10 week period for those who complete the&#xD;
      self-esteem group compared to those who do not complete the group?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to generate hypotheses about whether the group intervention is effective in&#xD;
      improving self-esteem and/or eating disorder psychopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be inpatients aged 11-18 who fulfil DSM-V criteria for an eating disorder,&#xD;
      meet the framework of inclusion and exclusion criteria and are receiving treatment at&#xD;
      Newbridge House child and adolescent inpatient eating disorder unit. A convenience sampling&#xD;
      method will be used and participants will be randomly allocated using an Excel formula to&#xD;
      either a 'case' group to complete TAU plus self-esteem group or a 'control' group to only&#xD;
      complete TAU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A control group (TAU) was included in order to compare outcomes of those who complete PBI&#xD;
      with outcomes of those who do not. This is because the principal aim of the study is to&#xD;
      generate evidence of the potential effectiveness of this novel treatment. This is especially&#xD;
      necessary given that the research site is an inpatient unit and all participants will be&#xD;
      receiving other therapies alongside the treatment being tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty participants will be recruited in total (twenty in each group). As this is a pilot&#xD;
      study no power calculation could be conducted and this sample size was agreed as sufficient&#xD;
      to generate data to inform a power calculation for future research. Participants will be&#xD;
      identifiable by a unique code created using the letters 'TAU+SE' or 'TAU' followed by a&#xD;
      number relating to the order in which they were recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be approached by an Assistant Psychologist when they reach 85% of&#xD;
      their healthy weight to introduce the research and seek consent for participation in the&#xD;
      study. For patients under the age of 16, informed parental consent and patient assent will be&#xD;
      sought. For patients over 16 only informed patient consent will be sought. Patients under 16&#xD;
      will not take part in the study unless both parental consent and patient assent has been&#xD;
      received. Patients and parents will be given up to 7 days to decide whether to give consent&#xD;
      to participate in the study. Those who consent will then be allocated to the treatment or&#xD;
      control group using the excel formula. Once 4 people have been allocated to the treatment&#xD;
      group they will begin the self-esteem group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To gather evidence for the research questions, a between subjects design (Self-esteem vs no&#xD;
      self-esteem) will be used with treatment as the independent variable. The case group will&#xD;
      receive TAU as well as the self-esteem group and the control group will just receive TAU. The&#xD;
      outcomes from self-report questionnaires completed post-group, 4 week follow-up and at&#xD;
      discharge will be compared between the case and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dependent variables are self-esteem and eating disorder psychopathology as measured by&#xD;
      self-report questionnaires. This experimental design has been chosen as it allows for the&#xD;
      comparison of self-esteem vs no self-esteem. The choice of this design was influenced by a&#xD;
      desire to gather evidence to generate hypotheses about this novel treatment and to inform a&#xD;
      full scale study to test the effectiveness of this treatment for adolescents with eating&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timetable All stages will take place on site at Newbridge House only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE 1 (Recruitment) Patients will be approached to take part in the study when they reach&#xD;
      85% of their healthy weight. An assistant psychologist will meet with patients meeting the&#xD;
      framework of inclusion and exclusion criteria to read through the research information sheet&#xD;
      and request informed written consent. For patients under 16 written, informed consent and&#xD;
      patient assent will be sought and parents will be given an information sheet and consent form&#xD;
      prior to commencement of the study. For those over the age of 16 written informed consent&#xD;
      will be sought only from patients. Patients and parents will be given 7 days to consider&#xD;
      their decision to consent to participate in the research. Patients will not be recruited as a&#xD;
      participant unless consent has been obtained from the person with parental responsibility and&#xD;
      assent has been obtained from the patient, if under 16. If both are not obtained, the patient&#xD;
      will not be recruited for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients for whom we receive consent will then be randomly allocated to either the case or&#xD;
      control group using an Excel formula. Patients who do not consent, or for whom parental&#xD;
      consent is not received, will receive TAU which will be identical to that delivered to&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE 2 (Week 1) All participants will be asked to complete a set of self-report&#xD;
      questionnaires in week 1 (baseline) when they start the group for case participants and when&#xD;
      they have consented for the research for control participants. For participants in the case&#xD;
      group, the self-esteem group will then commence and take place alongside TAU. For&#xD;
      participants in the control group, TAU will continue as normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE 3 (Week 6) Stage 3 will take place 6 weeks after completion of baseline measures. All&#xD;
      participants will complete a second set of measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE 4 (Week 10) Stage 4 will take place 10 weeks after completion of baseline measures. All&#xD;
      participants will complete a third set of measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE 4 (Date analysis) Stage 5 will take place after all 40 participants have been recruited&#xD;
      and completed the study, thus ending the data collection stage. Assistant psychologists on&#xD;
      site will then input the raw data from completed outcome measures onto an SPSS spreadsheet.&#xD;
      Data will then be analysed and interpreted by a qualified statistician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE 6 (Report write up) Stage 6 will take place after completion of data analysis. The&#xD;
      final report will then be written and submitted for publication by those involved in the&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis As a pilot study, the primary aim of the data analysis phase will not be&#xD;
      to definitively test whether the self-esteem group is effective or not but to generate&#xD;
      evidence of its potential effectiveness if progressed onto a full trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to do this we will use analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to estimate the difference in&#xD;
      self-reported self-esteem at week 6 and week 10, between conditions, controlling for baseline&#xD;
      self-reported self-esteem as a covariate. The difference in self-reported self-esteem scores&#xD;
      will be reported (adjusted for baseline levels) within 95% confidence intervals to indicate&#xD;
      the potential effectiveness of the self-esteem intervention in comparison to TAU. Primary&#xD;
      analysis will be on an intention-to-treat basis. The assumptions or normality and homogeneity&#xD;
      of variance will be assessed. Normality assumes that the scores are normally distributed&#xD;
      (bell-shaped) and will be assessed using the One-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Homogeneity&#xD;
      of variance assumes that both groups have equal error variances and will be assessed using&#xD;
      Levene's Test for the equality of error variances. The relationship between the covariate and&#xD;
      the dependent variable should be linear and will be assessed with a scatterplot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary analysis will explore the difference in self-reported eating disorder&#xD;
      psychopathology at discharge between the case and control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drop-out rates between the self-esteem and TAU groups will also be assessed to explore the&#xD;
      acceptability of treatment condition. We plan to conduct these analyses using the latest&#xD;
      version of IBM SPSS statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will comprise of 6 sessions of group self-esteem therapy which uses a&#xD;
      cognitive behavioural approach. The therapy has been manualised into a 76 page treatment&#xD;
      protocol and will be administered by Assistant Psychologists employed at Newbridge House&#xD;
      receiving weekly supervision from a Clinical Psychologist. The self-esteem group is based on&#xD;
      Melanie Fennel's cognitive behavioural model of low self-esteem addressing thoughts, feeling&#xD;
      and behaviours. The group aims to improve self-esteem and build positivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sessions are structured and laid out in the following overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 1, Session 1: What is self-esteem and an introduction to CBT Week 2, Session 2: How&#xD;
      might low self-esteem develop? Week 3, Session 3: Negative automatic thoughts Week 4, Session&#xD;
      4: Challenging negative automatic thoughts Week 5, Session 5: Creating new coping strategies&#xD;
      Week 6, Session 6: Building positivity&#xD;
