  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to pilot test the effect of a tablet-based cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral intervention (Tab-CBI) application on older adults' a) daily steps, b) fatigue&#xD;
      level, c) self-efficacy, and d) quality of life at Week 1 (baseline), Week 4 (intervention&#xD;
      completion), Week 6 (booster), Week 8 (follow-up #1), and Week 10 (follow-up #2) in a sample&#xD;
      of 24 older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that (a) individuals receiving Tab-CBI will have increased&#xD;
      daily step counts, decreased fatigue level, greater perception of self-efficacy and quality&#xD;
      of life than those receiving current RA fatigue management, and that (b) the effects will be&#xD;
      sustained up through 4 weeks of follow-ups after the intervention completion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study uses an experimental pre- and post-test repeated measures design. After eligible&#xD;
      participants sign an informed consent form, the participants will be screened for inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria using two surveys (PROMIS Fatigue-8a, Mini-Cog) and verbally asking&#xD;
      about age, presence of Arthritis diagnosis, Wi-Fi availability, engagement of regular&#xD;
      exercise, presence of any non-ambulatory condition that limits walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria are randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      intervention (Tab-CBI, n=12) or comparison group (n=12). The Tab-CBI group receives a&#xD;
      one-on-one introductory session which covers details about the study purpose and procedures,&#xD;
      description of Tab-CBI, and instructions of how to operate a tablet, an accelerometer, and a&#xD;
      videoconferencing tool. At the end of the session, participants are given a tablet preloaded&#xD;
      with the Tab-CBI application and an accelerometer. During the study period, the participants&#xD;
      will receive four weekly educational sessions plus one booster session at 2 weeks after the&#xD;
      intervention conclusion. The educational modules were developed based on the principles of&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy. The key elements of the modules include activity-pacing,&#xD;
      adjustment of goal-setting to the current physical condition, setting priorities and&#xD;
      structured planning of a simple walking activity and time off, and cognitive restructuring of&#xD;
      activity demands. Participants will record daily which steps taken by syncing the&#xD;
      accelerometer to the tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparison group receives fatigue management which are currently offered to the patients&#xD;
      and will be instructed to maintain usual activity during the study period. The control group&#xD;
      participants also receive an accelerometer to count steps, but without a tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both groups take surveys for four outcomes (dally steps, fatigue, perceived&#xD;
      self-efficacy, and perceived quality of life) and four potential covariate measures (pain,&#xD;
      depression, sleep, and comorbidity) through a tablet computer (for intervention group) or&#xD;
      paper-based surveys (for comparison group). Data are collected at Week 1 (baseline), Week 4&#xD;
      (intervention completion), Week 6 (booster), Week 8 (follow-up #1), and Week 10 (follow-up&#xD;
      #2).&#xD;
