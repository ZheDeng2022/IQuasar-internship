    <textblock>
      Background. Blue lenses that filter out red light have been proposed as a new therapeutic&#xD;
      alternative for patients with PSE, such as the lens Zeiss Clarlet Z1. This lens only allows a&#xD;
      small overall quantity of visible light, and particularly a minimum percentage of red light,&#xD;
      to pass through. However, these characteristics entail two main pitfalls: reduced&#xD;
      applicability in high- latitude regions and lack of transmission for the red and yellow&#xD;
      colors. The latter would mainly expose patients to the other colors that compose the visible&#xD;
      light, and particularly to the blue visible light. This exposure might be damaging for their&#xD;
      eyes in the long term, as it has been reported in some studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim. To determine whether four new lenses with different spectral characteristics are not&#xD;
      inferior in efficacy to Z1 to reduce the PPRs in patients with PSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants. Patients between 5-18 years with suspected or confirmed PSE, referred to the&#xD;
      Neurophysiology Service at Birmingham Children's Hospital (BCH) for an EEG with IPS/pattern&#xD;
      stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives &amp; Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.A) Primary Objective: To evaluate the reduction/suppression produced by four new lenses in&#xD;
      the PPRs shown by patients with PSE during an EEG with IPS/pattern stimulation, and compare&#xD;
      it with the reduction provoked by the Z1 lens in the same individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. B) Primary Outcome: reduction/suppression in both the PPR and the standardized&#xD;
           photoparoxysmal response range (SPR) for IPS and pattern stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A) Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To obtain feedback from the patients who acquire a pair of our lenses regarding&#xD;
                tolerability, overall adherence to treatment and improvement in the quality of&#xD;
                life.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Comparison of the reduction/suppression in the PPRs between our lenses and the Z1&#xD;
                lens in those retrospective patients with PSE seen between 2008-2017 at the Aston&#xD;
                Brain Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.B) Secondary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mean score obtained in adherence to treatment, tolerability, reduction in seizure&#xD;
           frequency and autonomy according to the patient/parents or carers satisfaction&#xD;
           questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction/suppression in both the PPR and the standardized photoparoxysmal response&#xD;
           range (SPR) for IPS and pattern stimulation in those patients recruited at the Aston&#xD;
           Brain Center.&#xD;

      1. BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
           Photosensitive epilepsy (PSE) is the most common of reflex epilepsies and represents&#xD;
           approximately 10% of all new cases of epilepsy in the age range 7-19 years (Harding &amp;&#xD;
           Jeavons, 1994). Photosensitivity is the nuclear feature of PSE, in which seizures are&#xD;
           provoked by light stimuli or visual patterns, such as lines, gratings or checkerboards&#xD;
           (Yalçin, Kaymaz, &amp; Forta, 2000)(Fisher, Harding, Erba, Barkley, &amp; Wilkins, 2005).&#xD;
           Therefore, usual external triggers of seizures in the daily life of patients with PSE&#xD;
           are sunlight and screens, like televisions (TVs), video games and computer displays.&#xD;
           Photic/pattern sensitivity can be detected on the electroencephalogram (EEG) by the&#xD;
           presence of a specific abnormality, called the 'photoparoxysmal response' (PPR), which&#xD;
           is usually evoked by intermittent photic stimulation (IPS) or pattern stimulation,&#xD;
           respectively (Quirk et al., 1995). Red color (wavelength around 600-700nm) has been&#xD;
           proposed to be the most provocative stimulus among the primary colors to trigger&#xD;
           photosensitivity/pattern-sensitivity in these patients (Fisher et al., 2005)(Guerrini &amp;&#xD;
           Genton, 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
           There are certain preventive measures to avoid triggering external stimuli which are&#xD;
           particularly useful in PSE patients, but pharmacological treatment is required when&#xD;
           seizures are not controlled by preventive measures or when photic or pattern-induced&#xD;
           seizures coexist with spontaneous seizures. However, adverse effects of antiepileptic&#xD;
           drugs (AEDs) and the relapse percentage after medication withdrawal, which may be nearly&#xD;
           50% (Verrotti et al., 2014), drove investigators to seek other therapeutic alternatives,&#xD;
           such as the use of blue lenses that filter out red light. To date, the most extensively&#xD;
           investigated lens has been Zeiss Clarlet Z1, which abolished PPRs in 75.9% of 610&#xD;
           patients (Giuseppe Capovilla et al., 2006). This effect was accounted for by the&#xD;
           spectroscopic profile of Z1, that shows the minimal transmittance for the spectrum of&#xD;
           red color (600-700 nm) (G Capovilla et al., 1999) and a luminous transmittance for the&#xD;
           visible spectrum (τν) around 7%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           However, Z1 transmittance characteristics have two main limitations for its use in&#xD;
           everyday life: 1) it is a very dark lens and not practical in high-latitude regions,&#xD;
           where the number of sunlight hours is reduced; 2) its lack of transmission in the red&#xD;
           and yellow parts of the spectrum determines that people using Z1 are almost completely&#xD;
           exposed to blue visible light, which has been associated with the appearance of&#xD;
           ophthalmological diseases in the long term, such as age-related macular degeneration&#xD;
           (AMD) (&quot;blue-light hazard&quot; phenomenon) (Mainster, 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
           In light of these limitations, we hypothesized that a new type of lenses created by&#xD;
           improving some spectral characteristics of Z1 could also be helpful for patients with&#xD;
           PSE. This is the reason why we have designed four new lenses at the Aston Brain Center&#xD;
           (ABC, Aston University) in collaboration with the Aston University Vision Sciences&#xD;
           Department. These new lenses were firstly tested in those patients with PSE referred to&#xD;
           the ABC between 2008-2017, when this center was the referral site in West Midlands to&#xD;
           perform an EEG with photic/pattern stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To date, no lens has demonstrated similar efficacy to Z1 with improved transmittance&#xD;
           characteristics. Our new lenses may become an alternative or adjuvant therapy for&#xD;
           paediatric and adult patients with PSE, leading to a reduction in the necessary dose of&#xD;
           medication, with consequently less probability of adverse effects and an overall&#xD;
           improvement in the quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. AIM AND OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to demonstrate that our lenses are not inferior in efficacy to reduce&#xD;
      the PPRs in comparison with Z1 in a sample of children and adolescents with PSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of these four lenses&#xD;
           in suppressing the PPRs evoked by IPS and/or pattern stimulation in a sample of&#xD;
           pediatric patients with PSE recruited at the Birmingham Women's and Children's NHS&#xD;
           Foundation Trust (BWCH), and compare their results with those obtained with Z1 in the&#xD;
           same patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Our secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To collect the retrospective information (clinical and EEG data) of those PSE&#xD;
                patients who were seen between 2008 and 2017 at the ABC, where the lenses were&#xD;
                firstly tested before moving the equipment to the BWCH.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To obtain feedback from the patients who finally acquire a pair of our lenses in&#xD;
                relation to the overall adherence to treatment, tolerability and improvement in the&#xD;
                quality of life. To achieve this objective, we will send a patient satisfaction&#xD;
                questionnaire (PSQ) to these patients approximately 6 months after purchasing the&#xD;
                lenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
                4. DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-arm clinical trial. We will carry out two types of study: a prospective&#xD;
      (forward) study recruiting patients at BWCH and also a retrospective (backwards) study&#xD;
      collecting those patients seen at the ABC between 2008 and 2017. In both studies, data&#xD;
      analysis will take place at Aston University after being pseudonymized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1. Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective study (BWCH, Aston University):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients (either males or females) from 5 to 18 years with suspected or confirmed diagnosis&#xD;
      of generalised epilepsy with photosensitivity or photosensitive epilepsy (PSE) who are&#xD;
      referred to the Neurophysiology Service at BCH for an EEG with IPS/pattern stimulation to&#xD;
      confirm the diagnosis or check evolution, whether they are taking AEDs or not. Participants&#xD;
      will be able to maintain concentration during the procedure, follow simple commands given by&#xD;
      the NHS PI and have the capacity to assent (under 16 years) or consent (16-18 years) to&#xD;
      participate after checking that they have understood the purpose of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective study (Aston University):&#xD;
&#xD;
      •Selection criteria followed in the retrospective study conducted at the ABC were the same,&#xD;
      except for the age criterion, since adult patients were also seen at the ABC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2. Trial Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective study (BWCH, Aston University):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On the first visit to the BWCH, a standardised procedure for EEG with IPS&#xD;
           (Kasteleijn-Nolst Trenité et al., 2012) will be performed, followed by stimulation with&#xD;
           visual patterns (stationary vertical grids at different spatial frequencies on a&#xD;
           screen). If PPRs are shown in response to IPS/pattern stimulation, lenses will be tested&#xD;
           to evaluate the relative reduction produced by our lenses &amp; Z1 on the PPRs evoked by&#xD;
           IPS/pattern testing. This reduction will be determined by the change in both the type of&#xD;
           PPR and the standardized photoparoxysmal response range (SPR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If our lenses are effective and patients/families decide to acquire one of them, they&#xD;
           will be asked to fill in a Likert-scale PSQ approximately 6 months after purchasing the&#xD;
           lenses. This information will provide us with some feedback on the overall adherence to&#xD;
           treatment, tolerability and improvement in the quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2.2) Retrospective study (Aston University): it will consist in the same procedures as the&#xD;
      prospective study, but in this case the PSQ was not sent to patients/families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. DATA ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum sample size of 76 patients was obtained based upon data collected from a previous&#xD;
      pilot study, taking into consideration a power value of 80%, an alpha value of 5% and a&#xD;
      non-inferiority margin of 0.03.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient, we will compare the reduction/suppression on both the PPR and the SPR&#xD;
      between the different lenses (α=0.05). PSQ results will be expressed by the percentages of&#xD;
      patients/parents who marked a particular response in these multiple-choice questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missed data (patients who finally drop out of the study) will not be considered for analysis&#xD;
      purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures conducted will comply with the Declaration of Helsinki as revised in 2013, the&#xD;
      Data Protection Act 1998 and Local Information Governance protocols. Consent will be sought&#xD;
      from parents/legal guardians and patients over 15 years, as well as assent in the case of&#xD;
      younger patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only pseudonymized raw data will be available for sharing outside of the department as the&#xD;
      analysis is to be performed by the PI-based at the sponsor site (Aston University). Data&#xD;
      storage will be in keeping with the Trust Information Governance policies.&#xD;
