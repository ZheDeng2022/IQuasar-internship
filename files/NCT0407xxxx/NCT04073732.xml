  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In June 2016, the Health Reform Office in the State Council released &quot;the Announcement about&#xD;
      Guiding Opinions of Promoting Family Physician Contract Services&quot;. Family Physician Contract&#xD;
      Service is an important tool to change the health service models in primary care&#xD;
      organizations in China. The relationship between patients and physicians can be regarded as&#xD;
      principles and agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physician agency theory has been used to study physician behaviors in economics and&#xD;
      management. Family physician contract services regulate the principle-agent relationship&#xD;
      between patients and physicians using a formal contract, and there are lots of potentials to&#xD;
      employ the physician agency theory to study family physician contract services in China. In&#xD;
      theoretical aspects, the present project will study the analysis frameworks and methods of&#xD;
      family physician contract services in China under the capitation and global budget payment&#xD;
      mechanisms after systematically reviewing Chinese and English literatures about the physician&#xD;
      agency theory. In empirical aspects, the present project will collect data from family&#xD;
      physician contract services and examine the effects of specific contract forms, incentives,&#xD;
      and fees on family physician behaviors and their impacts on health status and medical&#xD;
      expenditures of hypertensive and diabetic patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      1. From a theoretical point of view, using the physician agency theory to construct a&#xD;
           family physician contract services and a family physician (team) behavior theory&#xD;
           analysis framework and research method system suitable for China's national conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. From the empirical point of view, from the demand side, analyze the needs of the family&#xD;
           physician contract service, the status quo, and the behavior of the visit; from the&#xD;
           supplier, understand the behavior changes and satisfaction of the family physician&#xD;
           (team) after the implementation of the family physician contract service Degree&#xD;
           situation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. From an empirical perspective, from the level of primary medical institutions, use the&#xD;
           sample area data to analyze the impact of family physicians' signing services on the&#xD;
           number of visits and medical expenses;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. From an empirical perspective, using the constructed theoretical analysis framework to&#xD;
           analyze the implementation of the Chinese family physician contract service, including&#xD;
           incentive mechanism (income, incentive performance salary and contract service fee),&#xD;
           family physician team composition, family bed service, etc. The impact, especially on&#xD;
           the quality and quantity of services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. From the empirical point of view, taking the key monitoring population (hypertension&#xD;
           patients as an example) as a sample, further study the family physicians' contractual&#xD;
           services, the changes in the practice behavior of family physicians to the key&#xD;
           monitoring population (hypertension, diabetes patients), health outcomes, medical&#xD;
           expenses The effect is to propose policy recommendations for family physicians'&#xD;
           contracting services and physicians' behavior in the new medical reform in the future.&#xD;
