  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II, open-label, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and efficacy of RO7227166 in participants with relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (r/r NHL). RO7227166 will be administered by intravenous (IV) infusion&#xD;
      in combination with obinutuzumab and in combination with glofitamab. A fixed dose of&#xD;
      obinutuzumab (Gpt; pre-treatment) will be administered seven days prior to the first&#xD;
      administration of RO7227166 and seven days prior to the first administration of glofitamab.&#xD;
      This entry-into-human study is divided into a dose-escalation stage (Part I and Part II) and&#xD;
      a dose expansion stage (Part III).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Depending upon study part: a history or status of a histologically-confirmed&#xD;
             hematological malignancy that is expected to express CD19 and CD20; relapse after or&#xD;
             failure to respond to at least two prior treatment regimens; and no available&#xD;
             treatment options that are expected to prolong survival&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have at least one measureable target lesion (&gt;/= 1.5 cm) in its largest dimension&#xD;
             by computed tomography scan&#xD;

             Investigator's determination, providing the participant has more than one measurable&#xD;
             target lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of &gt;/= 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adverse events from prior anti-cancer therapy must have resolved to Grade &lt;/= 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate liver, haematological, and renal function&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The contraception and abstinence requirements are intended to prevent exposure of an&#xD;
             embryo to the study treatment. The reliability of sexual abstinence for male and/or&#xD;
             female enrollment eligibility needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the&#xD;
             clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. Periodic&#xD;
             abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post-ovulation methods) and&#xD;
             withdrawal are not acceptable methods of preventing drug exposure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participants: A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not&#xD;
             pregnant and not breastfeeding, and if at least one of the following applies: women of&#xD;
             non-childbearing potential (WONCBP); women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) who&#xD;
             agree to remain abstinent or use two highly effective contraceptive methods with a&#xD;
             failure rate of &lt;1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 18 months&#xD;
             after obinutuzumab or 3.5 months after the last dose of RO7227166, 2 months after last&#xD;
             dose of glofitamab, or 3 months after the last dose of tocilizumab, whichever is&#xD;
             longer. Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include&#xD;
             bilateral tubal occlusion/ ligation, male sexual partner who is sterilized,&#xD;
             established proper use of hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation,&#xD;
             hormone-releasing intrauterine devices and copper intrauterine devices. Hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptive methods must be supplemented by a barrier method; have a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test (blood) within the 7 days prior to the first study treatment&#xD;
             administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male participants: During the treatment period and for at least 3 months after&#xD;
             obinutuzumab, or 3.5 months after the last dose of RO7227166, 2 months after the last&#xD;
             dose of glofitamab, or 2 months after the last dose of tocilizumab whichever is&#xD;
             longer, agreement to: Remain abstinent or use contraceptive measures such as a condom&#xD;
             plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of &lt; 1%&#xD;
             per year, with a partner who is a women of childbearing potential. With pregnant&#xD;
             female partner, remain abstinent or use contraceptive measures such as a condom to&#xD;
             avoid exposing the embryo; refrain from donating sperm during this same period&#xD;
