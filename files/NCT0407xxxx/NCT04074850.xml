  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A better understanding of the injury patterns, injury severity, risk profiles, consequences&#xD;
      and impact of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) in the elderly population is necessary due to the&#xD;
      increasing incidence and prevalence of TBI in this population and its high economic impact on&#xD;
      society. Therefore, this study aims at describing the long-term consequences of TBI. In order&#xD;
      to achieve that goal, injury patterns, injury severity and risk profiles for TBI in the&#xD;
      elderly will be mapped. Moreover, a retrospective assessment of brain damage, co-morbidities&#xD;
      and post-traumatic history, and a prospective assessment of cognitive functions and quality&#xD;
      of life in a 20 years range after TBI will be performed. Finally, a statistical correlation&#xD;
      of TBI and different types of neurodegenerative diseases, and an economic costs analysis will&#xD;
      be done. All the obtained results will be used to develop a new prognostic tool for the&#xD;
      course of the outcomes of TBI in the elderly population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A database of over 1200 patients will be created by the retrospective capture of the&#xD;
      following data in UZ Leuven database:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injury mechanisms data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to create a map of injury patterns, severity and criteria that allow for identifying&#xD;
      which accident circumstances ageing adults should reasonably be protected against, including&#xD;
      a kinematics tolerance curve for the elderly brain that can be used for protection purposes,&#xD;
      a retrospective analysis of data related to injury mechanisms, registered in the patient's&#xD;
      clinical records, will be performed for the cohort of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data regarding the following parameters will be retrospectively collected in UZ Leuven&#xD;
      database for the studty cohort: age, sex, cause of injury, GCS, pupillary reactivity,&#xD;
      hypoxia, hypotension, hypothermia and Marshall CT classification at the time of admission.&#xD;
      Moreover, Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) at 6 months after the accident, obtained in the&#xD;
      context of routine clinical practice, will also be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data will be correlated with the results obtained during the injury patterns, injury&#xD;
      severity and risk profiles mapping, in order to better understand what accident types are&#xD;
      most risky to eventually result in poor outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economic data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to know what is the economic impact that TBI in the elderly has on society, hospital&#xD;
      costs for the clinical management in the study cohort will be retrospectively extracted from&#xD;
      the financial database of UZ Leuven.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these data will be anonymized and no informed consent will be used in this part of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current status assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this part of the project, all the patients ≥65 years old admitted to UZ Leuven due to TBI&#xD;
      between 1999 and 2019, and fulfilling previously explained inclusion and exclusion criteria,&#xD;
      will be contacted through a phone call by an investigator of this project, and offered to&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UZ Leuven administration (MIR) has access to a central national database, so the list of&#xD;
      patients will be screened prior to the start of the phone calls in order to exclude the&#xD;
      patients that are deceased and avoid calling them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The informed consent form will be distributed among the patients via post or e-mail,&#xD;
      depending on their preferences. Patients will have to send the signed informed consent form&#xD;
      back to the researchers via post or e-mail in order to be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the researchers receive the signed informed consent form, patients will be called again&#xD;
      and they will have the cognitive and quality of life evaluation, which consists of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Cognitive evaluation: the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) tool will be used&#xD;
      to study cognitive functions in the cohort. It is a 11-items screening test for cognitive&#xD;
      functions, including word list memory, orientation, attention, repetition, conceptual&#xD;
      knowledge and nonverbal praxis. The necessary time to perform it is 10 min or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the patients' level of education will be asked, registered and correlated with&#xD;
      clinical data, cognitive functions and quality of life outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep quality assessment: the sleep quality in our cohort will be assessed using the&#xD;
           Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life evaluation: the Quality of Life after Brain Injury (QOLIBRI) tool will&#xD;
           be used to assess the quality of life in the cohort. It is a 37-item questionnaire with&#xD;
           six subscales that measure quality of life in the domains of cognition, self, daily life&#xD;
           and autonomy, social relationships, emotions, and physical problems. The approximate&#xD;
           time necessary to fill this questionnaire in is 10 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the investigators get the signed informed consent, injury mechanisms data, clinical data&#xD;
      and clinical-care related economic data will be collected from UZ Leuven database and&#xD;
      correlated to the cognitive, sleep quality and quality of life outcomes. Also, for all the&#xD;
      patients in the study cohort that live in the surrounding areas of Leuven and have UZ Leuven&#xD;
      as a reference hospital after TBI, a retrospective revision of the clinical records will be&#xD;
      performed for the identification of diagnosis for neurodegenerative diseases that developed&#xD;
      after TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous statistical figures, the investigators expect to have a cohort of over 500&#xD;
      patients for this current status assessment.&#xD;
