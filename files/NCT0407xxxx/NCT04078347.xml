  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective observational study was to evaluate the changes of skin&#xD;
      temperature after the paravertebral block measured by infrared thermography.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Methods: Patients scheduled for elective surgery with paravertebral block will receive&#xD;
      infrared thermography measures 5 min before the block and continous to 20 min after the&#xD;
      block. The sensitivity, specificity of infrared thermography as diagnostic methods will be&#xD;
      determined by receiver operator characteristic analysis.&#xD;

    <description>Pinprick test was evaluated at 20 min after Paravertebral block. Pinprick sensation was assessed using a 22-gauge short bevel needle from T2 to T10 at midclavicular line bilaterally . Pinprick response was recorded quantitatively as 1 (sensation) or 0 (no sensation/numb). Successful block was defined as the pinprick score was 0 at 20 min after block. Otherwise, it was defined as a failed block.</description>
