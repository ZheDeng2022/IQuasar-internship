      To address the critical scientific gaps in PrEP safety for transgender youth and to plan for&#xD;
      appropriate implementation of PrEP in transgender youth communities, the study will be&#xD;
      conducted in 3 integrated phases. In Phase 1, a pharmacokinetic (PK) study exploring the&#xD;
      interactions of cs-HT for both TW and TM youth on TDF/FTC will be conducted. Simultaneously,&#xD;
      in Phase 2, ethnographic data via focus groups (FGs) and in-depth interviews (IDIs) to inform&#xD;
      the development of a tailored intervention to improve uptake and adherence to PrEP for&#xD;
      transgender youth will be collected. In Phase 3, a small demonstration trial of PrEP use in&#xD;
      transgender youth, utilizing the ethnographically developed intervention to improve uptake&#xD;
      and adherence, while also monitoring renal and bone safety outcomes will be implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project has the following important specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To evaluate the differential PK of TDF/FTC in a cohort of transgender youth on cs-HT&#xD;
      by conducting a PK trial of daily TDF/FTC among 24 TW taking estradiol and 24 TM taking&#xD;
      testosterone (ages 15-24 years) using video-based directly observed therapy (DOT) to insure&#xD;
      daily adherence and maximize drug exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To develop a culturally, developmentally, and gender-affirmative intervention to&#xD;
      increase uptake of and adherence to PrEP among TW and TM youth that is grounded in theory&#xD;
      (Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills Model of Behavior Change, Gender Affirmation,&#xD;
      Empowerment Theory) and incorporates the PK data from Aim 1. Investigators will conduct FGs&#xD;
      with young TW (N=20-30) and TM (N=20-30) and conduct IDIs with participants from the PK study&#xD;
      (Total N=10-14). Investigators will solicit continuous input and feedback from TW and TM on&#xD;
      the project's Youth Advisory Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To conduct a small randomized controlled trial within a PrEP demonstration project&#xD;
      comparing the newly developed intervention with standard of care (SOC) in TW (N=50) and TM&#xD;
      (N=50) ages 15-24 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transgender women (TW) are one of the most vulnerable populations for acquiring HIV&#xD;
      infection, and the scant available data on transgender men (TM) suggests they are also at&#xD;
      risk. TW have accounted for only 0.2% of all participants in bio-behavioral HIV prevention&#xD;
      trials using pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and TM have typically not been included. TW and&#xD;
      TM adolescents have received even less attention in PrEP trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC), the FDA-approved PrEP drug,&#xD;
      would not be expected to interact with cross-sex hormone therapy (cs-HT; estradiol and&#xD;
      testosterone) based on known mechanisms and data from studies with hormonal contraceptives,&#xD;
      there are no data that prove this. Given this lack of data, TW and TM youth on cs-HT have&#xD;
      decreased PrEP uptake and adherence due to concerns that PrEP may reduce the effectiveness of&#xD;
      cs-HT. To address these critical scientific gaps in PrEP safety for transgender youth and to&#xD;
      plan for appropriate implementation, the investigators propose the following study in 3&#xD;
      integrated phases. In Phase 1, investigators will conduct a PK study exploring the&#xD;
      interactions of cs-HT for both TW and TM on TDF/FTC. Simultaneously, in Phase 2,&#xD;
      investigators will collect ethnographic data via focus groups and in-depth interviews to&#xD;
      inform the development of a tailored gender-affirmative intervention to improve uptake and&#xD;
      adherence to PrEP in transgender youth. In Phase 3, investigators will conduct a small&#xD;
      demonstration trial of PrEP use in TW and TM youth, utilizing the ethnographically developed&#xD;
      intervention to improve uptake and adherence, while also monitoring renal and bone safety&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
