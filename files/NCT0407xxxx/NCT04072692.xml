  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to comprehend the association between the trigger digit and&#xD;
      carpal tunnel syndrome based on the quantification of the tendon and nerve characteristics.&#xD;
      It includes three parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first part is an observational study. The aim of the first part is to attempts to measure&#xD;
      the gliding and morphological characteristics of the flexor tendons and median nerve in the&#xD;
      longitudinal or cross-sectional directions via the ultrasonographical images incorporating&#xD;
      with the motion capture experiment of the wrist and fingers. The gliding and morphological&#xD;
      features of the tendons and nerve will be compared under different postures or movement&#xD;
      patterns of the wrist and hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part is an interventional study. The aim of the first part is to establishes a&#xD;
      novel hybrid rehabilitation protocol which combines the tendon gliding exercise with nerve&#xD;
      mobilization to treat either the trigger digit or the carpal tunnel syndrome. A randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to investigate the short-term treatment effect and the follow-up examination&#xD;
      will be carried out as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third part is an observational study. The aim of the first part is to investigate the&#xD;
      effects of carpal tunnel release on the hand performances from functional perspectives. In&#xD;
      addition, a novel wrist orthosis will be developed to eliminate the bowstringing effect of&#xD;
      the flexor tendons after carpal tunnel release.&#xD;

    <description>The program includes pre-test, 8 times training, post-test and follow-up test.&#xD;
For pre-test, subjects perform the specific hand movement under different exerting force conditions and 4 different angles of phalangeal joints and be asked to do Phalen test, Grip strength test, Pinch test and SWMT test. It takes 40 minutes.&#xD;
For post-test, the same procedure is repeated again after completing all training.&#xD;
For follow-up, the same procedure is repeated again 6 months after completing all training.&#xD;
After pre-test, 8 times hybrid rehabilitation training are asked. There are two times in a week, and all training will be completed in one month. Each time will take forty minutes.</description>
