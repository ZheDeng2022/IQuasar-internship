  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the 6-month outcome of the&#xD;
      Selution Sirolimus-coated Balloon for the treatment of long tibial occlusive disease (TASC C&#xD;
      and D) in patients with Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extensive arterial occlusion significantly reduces arterial perfusion, and may eventually&#xD;
      lead to Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). The pathology gives rise to symptoms such as ischemic&#xD;
      pain, slow healing wounds at lower extremity and gangrene. It places patients with&#xD;
      multi-segment occlusion at high risks of amputations and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment methods for such long occlusive lesions are limited. Traditionally, the&#xD;
      standard of care would be surgical revascularization. This is because lesion length have bee&#xD;
      identified in several studies as an independent risk factor for the development of restenosis&#xD;
      after angioplasty and/or stenting. However, thanks to recent advances in endovascular&#xD;
      techniques, such as the utilization of subintimal technique for crossing long segment&#xD;
      occlusions, it is now possible to employ endovascular techniques for suitable patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The re-establishment of an in-line flow, even if only temporary, can allow tissue healing,&#xD;
      which is vital in achieving limb salvage. In addition, the use of Drug Coated Balloons (DCB)&#xD;
      and Drug Eluting Stents (DES) can potentially reduce restenosis rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there are few studies that have evaluated the performance of DCB in lesions that are&#xD;
      longer than 10cm. We hope to evaluate the performance of the Selution DCB when used in&#xD;
      treatment of such lesions.&#xD;
