  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study's primary objective is designed to assess the safety and tolerability, and&#xD;
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of both itacitinib and tocilizumab when given in&#xD;
      combination to patients with steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease (SR-aGVHD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's secondary objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the day 28 response rate (ORR) [complete response (CR), very good partial&#xD;
           response (VGPR), and partial response (PR)] of the combination of itacitinib and&#xD;
           tocilizumab for the treatment of SR-aGVHD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the time to response and duration of response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the incidence of primary disease relapse while on study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the incidence of infections including viral reactivation, bacterial infections&#xD;
           and fungal infections while on study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), non-relapse&#xD;
           mortality, GVHD-related mortality of study subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the proportion of patients who successfully discontinue steroids by 6 months&#xD;
           and 12 months after therapy initiation&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of acute and chronic GVHD consists mostly of steroids which has changed very&#xD;
      little over the past 40 years. Response to current therapy for GVHD is far from perfect; only&#xD;
      about 50% of patients respond to therapy and many of those responses are not durable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is a phase I study dose de-escalation study where up to 6 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled into each dose level (2 levels), followed by an expansion cohort at the MTD. The&#xD;
      goal of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of itacitinib&#xD;
      and tocilizumab. Once the MTD is determined, the investigator will enroll 10 additional&#xD;
      patients as an expansion cohort to further define the safety profile of the combination and&#xD;
      estimate its response rate.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pregnant, breast-feeding, or unwilling or unable to avoid pregnancy or fathering a&#xD;
             child. Pregnant women are excluded from this study as animal studies have shown that&#xD;
