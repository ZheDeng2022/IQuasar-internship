  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hay fever affects 1 in 4 of the UK population and has significant effects on the quality of&#xD;
      life of sufferers. Allergy to grass pollen is the most common cause. A detailed understanding&#xD;
      of the mechanisms involved during allergic reactions to pollens in hay fever sufferers may&#xD;
      provide improvements in diagnosis, drug treatment and assessment of their response to&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controlled exposures to allergens such as grass pollen can provide important information on&#xD;
      the mechanisms of allergic inflammation and may be used to assess the success of anti-allergy&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasal allergen challenge (NAC) is a useful tool in the investigation of allergic rhinitis,&#xD;
      including grass pollen-induced seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever). NAC is performed by&#xD;
      installation of a very small amount of grass pollen extract into the nose in order to&#xD;
      reproduce mild and short-lived symptoms such as nasal itch, sneezing, runny nose and nasal&#xD;
      congestion that you experience in a more severe form during natural exposure to grass pollen&#xD;
      during the summer. Nasal allergen challenge has allowed us to explore the mechanism of hay&#xD;
      fever and to provide a rapid and reliable method for investigating new potential treatments&#xD;
      for hay fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasal allergen Challenge is a very well-standardised and safe procedure that has been&#xD;
      performed within the department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology at Imperial College and&#xD;
      Royal Brompton Hospital for many years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately the grass pollen extract ('Aquagen') that we have routinely used for nasal&#xD;
      challenge has been discontinued and is therefore no longer available. The present study&#xD;
      involves testing an alternative source of the grass pollen extract in the form of 'Grazax'&#xD;
      which is a freeze-dried tablet that is highly standardised and should enable us to give an&#xD;
      identical amount of grass pollen extract for the purpose of nasal challenge. We plan a&#xD;
      'head-to-head' comparison of the two extracts in nasal challenge in order to confirm that the&#xD;
      two sources of allergen are equivalent thereby enabling us to use Grazax as the source of&#xD;
      grass pollen extract for our nasal challenge studies in the future.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Nasal allergen challenge (NAC) is a useful tool in the investigation of allergic rhinitis,&#xD;
      including grass pollen-induced seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever). We have experience in&#xD;
      using NAC to investigate the clinical and immunological effects of allergen exposure and in&#xD;
      using NAC as a surrogate outcome to assess the efficacy of treatments for allergic rhinitis.&#xD;
      The procedure is safe and well tolerated. In order for NAC to be a valid tool, it is&#xD;
      essential that the allergen extracts used are standardised in terms of concentration and&#xD;
      stability in solution. We have previously used an extract of Timothy Grass (Phleum pratense)&#xD;
      pollen, Aquagen (ALK-Abello, Denmark). Aquagen is supplied as a dry powder, to be&#xD;
      reconstituted prior to use by dissolving in an albumin-based diluent. Unfortunately, Aquagen&#xD;
      production has been discontinued, but the identical allergen is now available as Timothy&#xD;
      Grass lyophilisate tablet, Grazax (ALK-Abello), an approved and licensed product for&#xD;
      treatment of severe seasonal allergic rhinitis. Grazax consists of purified, freeze-dried&#xD;
      Timothy Grass pollen extract, plus only three excipients, gelatin (from fish), mannitol and&#xD;
      sodium hydroxide. Preliminary investigations have shown that Grazax tablets can be dissolved&#xD;
      in saline to produce identical concentrations of allergen to Aquagen, with the same stability&#xD;
      profile in vitro. We anticipate therefore, that the clinical effect when used for nasal&#xD;
      allergen challenges would be equivalent to the use of Aquagen for a given allergen&#xD;
      concentration. In this study we intend to confirm that nasal symptoms produced during the NAC&#xD;
      with either Aquagen or Grazax will be equivalent. We will recruit volunteers with grass&#xD;
      pollen-induced hay fever to undergo NAC with each allergen source, sequentially. In an open,&#xD;
      randomised-order, cross-over study. The primary outcome will be patient-reported nasal&#xD;
      symptoms (according to a standardised scoring system) in the 60 minutes after each nasal&#xD;
      challenge.&#xD;
