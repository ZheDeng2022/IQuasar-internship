  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Other than optimizing medical management of cardiac risk factors, and reducing radiotherapy&#xD;
      (RT) dose to the heart, there currently exist no interventions to mitigate or reverse the&#xD;
      adverse cardiac effects of RT. Aerobic exercise has been demonstrated to improve patient&#xD;
      quality of life, cardiac outcomes, and cardiorespiratory fitness in patients with cancer&#xD;
      receiving cardiotoxic systemic therapies, but the effects of aerobic exercise on patients at&#xD;
      high risk for radiation induced heart disease (RIHD) who are not receiving cardiotoxic&#xD;
      chemotherapies, such as patients with lung and esophageal cancers, is unknown. In addition,&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation has not been tested in patients with lung or esophageal cancers.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention consists of a prescribed course of home-based cardiac rehabilitation: 36 sessions, three times a week, one hour each, over a period of 12 weeks.&#xD;
Each customized exercise session includes three phases:&#xD;
a 5- to 10-minute warm-up which consists of stretching, flexibility movements, and aerobic activity which gradually raises the heart rate to the desired level&#xD;
a conditioning or training phase, which consists of 20 to 45 minutes of continuous or discontinuous aerobic activity&#xD;
a cool down for 5 to 10 minutes consisting of low-intensity exercise that permits a gradual recovery from the conditioning phase&#xD;
The patient will complete a brief questionnaire on the teleHeart application after completing each exercise session on how well they tolerated the exercise. The patient's CR team will receive daily updates from the patient's teleHeart application. Based on feedback from the application, the CR team may modify the patient's exercise program going forward.</description>

    <description>-Patients will be evaluated by the clinical team at The Heart Care Institute (HCI). They will receive a heart rate monitor, blood pressure monitor, and weight scale that they will take home with them. They will receive training on how to use the heart rate monitor and blood pressure monitor. They will receive training on how to record their exercises and weights in the teleHeart application by an exercise physiologist from HCI. Within 6 weeks of completion of standard of care radiation therapy or cytotoxic chemotherapy (whichever is last), they will be prescribed a course of home-based CR by a cardiologist at HCI and be instructed on the regimen by an exercise physiologist from HCI.</description>
