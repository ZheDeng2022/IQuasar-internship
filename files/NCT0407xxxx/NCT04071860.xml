  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep apnoea (SA) is a common condition in adults and children that causes disturbed sleep&#xD;
      and daytime symptoms. It is characterised by disrupted breathing with disturbed sleep&#xD;
      patterns. In adults this can lead to dangerous daytime sleepiness affecting for example&#xD;
      driving performance. In children it may lead to hyperactivity in the day and poor school&#xD;
      performance. There are a number of techniques for diagnosing the disorder but they can affect&#xD;
      the quality of sleep which sometimes makes them inaccurate. Most are unsuitable for small&#xD;
      children who cannot understand the value of the tests and tend to remove the monitoring wires&#xD;
      and devices in the night. This study aims to validate a new non contact device &quot;Safescan&quot;,&#xD;
      based on low power radar technology, which can be put under a bed and record breathing&#xD;
      patterns with no measuring device in contact with the sleeper. In this initial study the&#xD;
      device will be validated in adults, against the gold standard of polysomnography (PSG) in the&#xD;
      sleep laboratory at Royal Papworth Hospital.&#xD;
