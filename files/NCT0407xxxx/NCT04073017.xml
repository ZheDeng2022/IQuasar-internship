  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase II basket study evaluating the ability of enterade® to reduce&#xD;
      bowel frequency in neuroendocrine tumor (NET) patients with carcinoid syndrome and&#xD;
      non-carcinoid syndrome.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To assess the ability of enterade to reduce bowel movement frequency in NET patients with&#xD;
      and without carcinoid syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess subject-reported health-related quality of life measures in subjects before&#xD;
           and after compound administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the side effect profile and tolerability of the compound as measured by&#xD;
           the number of total 8-oz enterade® bottles consumed throughout the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate changes in serum electrolytes before and after administration of the&#xD;
           compound.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess differences in intravenous fluid requirement and/or hospitalizations for&#xD;
           dehydration in patients between observation period and active enterade® period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate differences in utilization of standard-of-care anti-diarrheal medications in&#xD;
           patients between observation period and enterade® period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare subjective bloating and flatulence in patients before and after&#xD;
           administration of the compound.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate changes in patient weight before and after administration of the compound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess changes in serum and stool inflammatory markers before and after the study&#xD;
           compound.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate changes in fecal lactoferrin before and after study compound administration.&#xD;

    <time_frame>At 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The FACIT-D is a questionnaire composed of 5 categories (physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being and additional concerns). Each category has 6-11 questions which are scored on a 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much) scale. Groups of categories are scored differently. For example in the additional concerns, emotional well-being and physical well-being categories, a higher score reflects poorer quality of life. In the family well-being and functional well-being categories, a higher score indicates better outcomes.</description>

             with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had enterade® within the past 3 months.&#xD;
