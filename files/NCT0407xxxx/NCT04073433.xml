    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multi-site study is to collect information to support the safety profile&#xD;
      of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy and to collect quantitative data on mood, psychological&#xD;
      status, self-compassion, professional quality of life, and professional burnout in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers after MDMA administration within a therapeutic setting. This exploratory study&#xD;
      will permit an understanding of the acute effects of the drug in a specific and relevant&#xD;
      setting for use in therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) produces changes in feelings and thoughts. It&#xD;
      appears to have a unique pharmacological profile distinct from psychostimulants and classical&#xD;
      hallucinogenic (psychedelic) compounds. Its unique properties have led to interest in using&#xD;
      it in combination with psychotherapy. So far, studies in healthy volunteers have examined the&#xD;
      effects of MDMA in a laboratory setting rather than a psychotherapeutic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase 1, randomized, placebo-controlled study MT1 was designed to collect safety and&#xD;
      quantitative data on mood, psychological symptoms, personality traits, and interpersonal&#xD;
      closeness in therapists learning to conduct MDMA-assisted psychotherapy or MDMA research&#xD;
      among 120 healthy volunteers. The MT1 study was also designed to expand the knowledge of&#xD;
      therapists training to conduct MDMA-assisted psychotherapy research. In the MT1 study,&#xD;
      several participants submitted optional written narratives with impressions that&#xD;
      participating in MDMA-assisted psychotherapy helped them professionally and personally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase 1, open-label, multi-site research study is designed to build upon the MT1 study&#xD;
      to further assess the psychological effects and safety of manualized MDMA-assisted&#xD;
      psychotherapy, while supporting the expansion of knowledge for treatment providers who are&#xD;
      learning to conduct MDMA-assisted psychotherapy or MDMA research. This study is intended to&#xD;
      look further into the personal and professional benefits spontaneously reported in narratives&#xD;
      to the site team from the MT1 study participants. This will be done by collecting changes in&#xD;
      self-compassion, burnout, professional quality of life, psychological inflexibility, and mood&#xD;
      using validated measures in a larger sample of treatment providers, allowing for effect size&#xD;
      calculations. Compassion fatigue and burnout are associated with job-related stress and are&#xD;
      known to impact professional quality of life. In addition, continued training for new&#xD;
      treatment providers, including the option for their own MDMA experience, is vital as the&#xD;
      research for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD expands in the United States. This study is&#xD;
      not a registration study.&#xD;
