  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with recurrence after radiotherapy are often encountered in clinical&#xD;
      practice.Patients with recurrence after radiotherapy are less likely to undergo surgery or&#xD;
      secondary radiotherapy, and the guidelines recommend only systemic therapy, although the&#xD;
      effective rate is relatively low.For patients with local recurrence without distant&#xD;
      metastasis, local treatment is still significant.Radioactive I-125 Seed Implantation (RISI)&#xD;
      treatment is to I-125 Radioactive nuclide directly inside the implanted tumors, make its rays&#xD;
      to continuous destruction of tumor cells, have inside the tumor target high dose, low dose of&#xD;
      normal tissue around, and its radiation is low dose rate, in theory, more conducive to the&#xD;
      protection of the normal tissue, more suitable for salvage treatment of recurrence after&#xD;
      radiotherapy lesions.Some retrospective studies on RISI treatment of NSCLC showed that the&#xD;
      local control rate was up to 25%-80%, and there were few reports of toxic and side effects,&#xD;
      suggesting that it had good efficiency and safety.Therefore, for patients with recurrent&#xD;
      NSCLC after chest radiotherapy, RISI may be considered.And template technology, 3 d printing&#xD;
      is a new kind of technology in recent years, can be individualized and human body surface,&#xD;
      the guide posts on the the direction of the puncture needle can be accurately controlled, the&#xD;
      current data show that in the template with CT guided by solid tumors as well had&#xD;
      significantly higher accuracy, as the actual target dose of basic postoperative can reach the&#xD;
      design request of the preoperative planning, so the application of 3D printing template helps&#xD;
      to further improve the operation efficiency and safety, also has potential promotion effect&#xD;
      to curative effect.The purpose of this study was: (1) to observe the efficacy, toxic and side&#xD;
      effects of RISI in the treatment of recurrent NSCLC after radiotherapy under the guidance of&#xD;
      3D printing template assisted CT, and to evaluate its safety and effectiveness;(2) to explore&#xD;
      the relationship between the efficacy, toxicity and side effects of RISI dose in the&#xD;
      treatment of recurrent NSCLC after radiotherapy;(3) analyze the relevant influencing factors&#xD;
      affecting the effect/toxicity of RISI in the treatment of recurrent NSCLC after radiotherapy.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study was to observe the efficacy and adverse reactions of RISI in the&#xD;
      treatment of recurrent NSCLC after radiotherapy, and to evaluate its safety and efficacy.To&#xD;
      explore the relationship between the efficacy, toxicity and side effects of recurrent NSCLC&#xD;
      treated with different RISI doses after radiotherapy.To analyze the relevant influencing&#xD;
      factors affecting the efficacy/toxicity of RISI in the treatment of recurrent NSCLC after&#xD;
      radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a non-randomized, prospective, single-arm, cohort study.Patients meeting the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria were enrolled consecutively in the order of admission and treatment, and a&#xD;
      total of 30 patients were expected to be enrolled.The therapeutic dose range of I-125 was&#xD;
      140-160Gy, and the prescribed dose was intended to be divided into 15 cases of 140-150Gy and&#xD;
      150-160Gy, respectively. The specific situation was subject to the actual postoperative&#xD;
      verified dose.&#xD;
