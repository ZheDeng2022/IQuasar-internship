    <textblock>
      In a randomized, doubleblind and placebo-controlled trial we assess both clinical and&#xD;
      cellular effects of atorvastatin in patients with liver cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      162 participants will be allocated to atorvastatin 10-20 mg or placebo for 18 months.&#xD;
      Clinical outcomes of survival, hospitalizations and safety will be evaluated. Also, the trial&#xD;
      will investigate cellular functions in the liver by mass spectrometry proteomics, and single&#xD;
      cell transcriptomics as well as exploring atorvastatin effects on different fenotypes by&#xD;
      metagenomics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Introduction Several studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of statins in vascular&#xD;
      and heart disease. Statins have antithrombotic effects, decrease oxidative stress and&#xD;
      inflammation at the vessel wall, and improve endothelial dysfunction by increasing Nitric&#xD;
      Oxide (NO) production in endothelial cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statins may also inhibit fibrogenesis in cirrhotic rats. In recent years, a series of pilot&#xD;
      studies have assessed the effects of simvastatin on portal hypertension and risk of variceal&#xD;
      bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only a few studies have evaluated the efficacy of statins in cirrhosis of mixed etiology and&#xD;
      decompensated cirrhosis. High quality clinical trials have focused on the hemodynamic effects&#xD;
      of simvastatin on portal hypertension. Evidence supporting the use of statins in a real-world&#xD;
      clinical setting, and data on the effects on inflammation and generation of fibrosis in the&#xD;
      liver in humans is in high demand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting The trial will take place in university hospitals with tertiary referral from&#xD;
      other hospitals, departments and general practice. Patients referred to the outpatient&#xD;
      clinics or hospitalized in the Gastro Unit, Amager Hvidovre Hospital (AHH) and Department of&#xD;
      Hepatology and Gastroenterology, Aarhus University Hospital (AUH), all Denmark are eligible&#xD;
      for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Part One&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrolment of the first 48 participants an evaluation of the trial feasibility will&#xD;
      performed on the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) recruitment rates, ii) allocation of adequate resources to the trial, iii) safety for the&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Part One will deliver data to conduct a pilot study on the exploratory endpoints of&#xD;
      inflammation, proteomics and metabolomics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The substudy will apply the following methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial analyses of biological material are performed blinded based on studyID, without&#xD;
      revealing allocation to atorvastatin or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison between groups are performed by blinded allocation, meaning that analysis are&#xD;
      performed as: group A versus group B, without prior knowledge of which group received the&#xD;
      active drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific evaluation and clinical translation of study results and data are only performed&#xD;
      after revelation of which group received the active drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Part Two&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the steering committee find all three conditions: recruitment, resources and safety&#xD;
      adequate, the trial will continue into Part Two, with enrolment up to 162 participants as&#xD;
      required to balance the clinical endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for discontinuation of intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discontinuation of trial drug will be performed in case of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant withdraws informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants reach a primary endpoint (death or liver transplantation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant experiences serious adverse events that cause a risk to the&#xD;
           participant's life or viability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant develops toxicity, intolerance or allergy associated with intervention&#xD;
           medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The trial participant is admitted to hospital for other morbidity that is incompatible&#xD;
           with further treatment with atorvastatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blinding is revealed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A trial participant will be classified as dropped out of the study if the participant&#xD;
           has ingested less than 55 % of atorvastatin or placebo at days 180.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods Data will be analyzed as repeated measures Analysis of variance (ANOVA).&#xD;
      Independent groups will be compared using unpaired T-test or non-parametric tests depending&#xD;
      on normality distribution of data. Survival analysis will be performed by Cox-regression&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be performed as per protocol and as intention to treat analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data will not be replaced but left blank in statistical analysis. For intention to&#xD;
      treat analyses on repeated measures, the last available value will be carried forward to last&#xD;
      value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior data may indicate that the median survival time on the control treatment is 35 months.&#xD;
      If the true hazard ratio (relative risk) of control subjects relative to experimental&#xD;
      subjects is 0.52, we will need to study 70 experimental subjects and 70 control subjects to&#xD;
      reject the null hypothesis that the experimental and control survival curves are equal with&#xD;
      probability (power) 0.85. The Type I error probability associated with the test of this null&#xD;
      hypothesis is 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With an expected drop-out rate of fifteen percent, we plan to enroll in total 162&#xD;
      participants in Study Part One and Two, to reach the clinical endpoint of survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Auditing The trial will be approved by the Danish Authorities of Health and Medicine, and may&#xD;
      be subject to auditing by this institution, independent of the sponsor and investigators.&#xD;
      Investigator allows direct access to source data and documents (including patient records)&#xD;
      used in the trial for monitoring, auditing and/or inspection from GCP-units and The Danish&#xD;
      Medicines Agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bio bank A biobank containing blood and liver tissue is established for the trial. The bio&#xD;
      bank contains both samples for planned analyses, and in case of excess material, samples will&#xD;
      be stored in a bio bank for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All investigations and results derived from the bio bank for future research will serve the&#xD;
      purpose of improving the life and health of patients with liver cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research ethics approval Registration by the Danish Data protection Agency was conducted&#xD;
      April 9, 2019. Application for approval at the Scientific Ethics Committees of the Capital&#xD;
      Region of Denmark was approved by: September 3, 2019, with ammendments approved by: January&#xD;
