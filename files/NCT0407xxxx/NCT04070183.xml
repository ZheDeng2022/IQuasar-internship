  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to study the effects of Physician Orders for Scope of Treatment (POST)&#xD;
      Facilitation in a randomized controlled trial in a population of community dwelling older&#xD;
      adults who qualify for POLST facilitation, including those with normal cognition and those&#xD;
      with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The POLST paradigm, which stands for Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment, was&#xD;
      developed to address inconsistencies between care received and patient and family wishes for&#xD;
      treatment, with an aim to increase concordant care. The POLST paradigm is nationally&#xD;
      recognized and implemented in a number of states under different names. In Indiana, for&#xD;
      example, it is called &quot;Physician Orders for Scope of Treatment&quot; (POST). Because of this, all&#xD;
      patient facing materials will refer to POST, however, we use the terms POST and POLST&#xD;
      interchangeably in this proposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POLST affects delivery of medical interventions and improved concordance between patient&#xD;
      preferences and care received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test the effect of high quality POLST Facilitation delivered in the home compared to&#xD;
           attention control on:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a.discordance between preferences for treatment and treatments received in the&#xD;
           subsequent 12 months (primary outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test the effect of POLST Facilitation on intermediate outcomes including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The proportion of patients with a completed POLST form in the electronic medical&#xD;
                record within 3 months of POLST Facilitation&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Decision quality regarding ACP as measured by the Decisional Conflict Scale, the&#xD;
                advance care planning (ACP) Engagement Survey,and the POLST knowledge survey&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To test the effect of a POLST Facilitation on secondary outcomes of cost and end-of-life&#xD;
           care including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Receipt of life-sustaining interventions or hospice within the 30 days prior to&#xD;
                death, for patients who die during the year after POLST Facilitation&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The psychological well-being (anxiety, depression,and post traumatic stress) of&#xD;
                surrogate decision makers after the patient's death&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The cost effectiveness of POLST Facilitation for the prevention of ICU admissions&#xD;
                and hospitalizations&#xD;

    <description>Advanced steps is initiated as a component of quality end-of-life care for frail elders and those whose death in the next 12 months would not be unexpected. The AS planning conversation is focused on goals of care to make timely, proactive, and specific end-of-life decisions. Ideally, these decisions are converted into medical orders that can be followed throughout the continuum of care. The Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) program is the nationally recognized model for this stage of planning.</description>
