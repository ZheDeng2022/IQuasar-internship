  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the research is to determine if participants who receive physical therapy&#xD;
      (physiotherapy) including soft tissue mobilization, dry needling, Heavy slow load&#xD;
      (eccentric-concentric) exercise (with hand weights specific to the biceps muscle) and a&#xD;
      comprehensive rotator cuff and scapular stabilization program achieve greater reductions in&#xD;
      pain and disability in the short (3-4 weeks) and long term (6 months) compared to those who&#xD;
      receive soft tissue mobilization and a comprehensive rotator cuff and scapular stabilization&#xD;
      program. Both treatment approaches are within the standard of care for physical therapists,&#xD;
      the aim being to determine the most effective treatment approach. Study participants will be&#xD;
      recruited form clinicians and flyers within the university/hospital organization where the&#xD;
      study is taking place. Participants will be asked to attend 6 physical therapy visits and&#xD;
      complete 6 surveys about their pain and disability.&#xD;

      The overall purpose of the pilot study is to test the feasibility of methods and procedures&#xD;
      for later use to conduct a large study to determine if patients who receive physical therapy&#xD;
      including dry needling, heavy slow load exercise and a comprehensive rotator cuff and&#xD;
      scapular stabilization program achieve greater reductions in pain and disability in the short&#xD;
      (4 weeks) and long term (6 months) compared to those who receive soft tissue mobilization and&#xD;
      a comprehensive rotator cuff and scapular stabilization program. A secondary purpose is to&#xD;
      search for possible effects and associations between variables that may be worth following up&#xD;
      in a subsequent, larger study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: 1) Individuals with biceps tendinopathy who receive an intervention of soft&#xD;
      tissue mobilization, dry needling (DN), heavy slow load exercise (HSLE) and a comprehensive&#xD;
      rotator cuff and scapular stabilization program will demonstrate significant differences in&#xD;
      disability and pain scores compared to the control group as measured by the:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Form (ASES.) This improvement&#xD;
           will be a minimum mean difference of 8 points (standard deviation, 12 points) between&#xD;
           groups which would indicate a clinically meaningful improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand (DASH)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Numeric Pain Rating Score (NPRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Shoulder Hand and Disability Index (SPADI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age 18-64 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Primary complaint of anterior shoulder pain in the area of the LHBT&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinical exam findings (must have positive findings for at least 1/2 of the following).&#xD;
           Several tests have been described for isolating pathology of the LHBT, however&#xD;
           literature has shown that none of these tests are specific enough in isolation to&#xD;
           confirm the diagnosis9 and Speed's test and Yergason's test do not perform consistently&#xD;
           and they do not generate a large change in post-test probability.59 Additionally, better&#xD;
           diagnostic utility is accomplished when 2 highly sensitive tests and one highly specific&#xD;
           test60 however, Speed's and Yergason's tests are both specific. Therefore, it was&#xD;
           decided that 1/2 specific tests would still be potentially inclusive of the pathology&#xD;
           since neither of the tests is specific enough to confirm diagnosis either combined or in&#xD;
           isolation.9,61 A test cluster of Speed's test combined with biceps palpation was&#xD;
           reported to have a sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 49%.12&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Speed's i. Speed's test (sensitivity 32%, specificity 75% for biceps pathology) was&#xD;
           performed by having the clinician extend the elbow, supinate the arm and elevate the&#xD;
           humerus with resistance to approximately 60 degrees; a positive test is pain in the&#xD;
           bicipital groove region.62-64 b. Yergason's i. Yergason's test (sensitivity 43%,&#xD;
           specificity 79% for biceps pathology) was performed by having the clinician flex the&#xD;
           elbow to 90 degrees with a pronated forearm. The clinician would then have the patient&#xD;
           resist supination with pressure at the patient's wrist. A positive test is pain in the&#xD;
           area of the bicipital groove.65,66&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pain with palpation in area of the LHBT. Positive pain with palpation in the region of&#xD;
           the LHBT and intertubercular groove has been found to be diagnostic for bicipital&#xD;
           tendinopathy (sensitivity 27-53%, specificity 54-66%). 9,41,67&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patient identification of pain in the area of the proximal biceps tendon.8,9&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. NPRS of at least 3/10 at worst in the past week a. A minimal score of 3/10 was utilized&#xD;
           in a case series on individuals with bicipital tendinopathy who were treated with DN and&#xD;
           eccentric-concentric exercise.30 In addition, anecdotally these patients tend to have&#xD;
           low but persistent pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. History of biceps tendon injection in the past 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. History of rotator cuff surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. History of biceps tenodesis or tenotomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. History of bleeding disorder or anti-coagulation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis (as defined by 50% loss of range of motion in 2 out of&#xD;
           3 of the following motions: Shoulder flexion, abduction and external rotation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Known underlying non-modifiable medical condition (e.g. tumor, fracture, metabolic&#xD;
           disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Two or more positive neurological signs consistent with nerve root compression&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Known allergy to metal&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Participant reported aversion to needles&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 groups;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Dry Needling/Heavy Slow Load Exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Heavy Slow Load Exercise (Control)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the intervention 1 (DN+HSLE) group will attend physical therapy one to two&#xD;
      sessions per week for up to 4 weeks for a total of 6 sessions. Each treatment session will&#xD;
      last for a total of 45 minutes. A standardized physical therapy program will be used and will&#xD;
      include soft tissue mobilization to the shoulder and biceps tendon followed by DN, HSLE and a&#xD;
      standardized exercise program. The DN will be performed with disposable stainless-steel&#xD;
      needles (.3 X 40mm; Seirin; Weymouth, MA) inserted into the skin over the most painful and/or&#xD;
      thickened areas of the tendon, confirmed with palpation. Prior to insertion of the needle the&#xD;
      overlying skin will be cleaned with alcohol. The needle will be inserted into the tendon. The&#xD;
      technique will be a fast-in and fast-out technique described by Chiavaras et al.26 for 20-30&#xD;
      repetitions per session in up to 3 areas. A HSLE program of the biceps muscle/tendon will&#xD;
      follow each DN session and will be performed daily for the course of treatment and will be&#xD;
      performed as described by McDevitt et al.30&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the control group will attend physical therapy one to two sessions per week&#xD;
      for up to 4 weeks for a total of 6 sessions. Each treatment session will last for a total of&#xD;
      45 minutes. A standardized physical therapy program will be used and will include soft tissue&#xD;
      mobilization to the shoulder and biceps tendon and a standardized exercise program. Neither&#xD;
      dry needling nor heavy slow load exercise will be integrated into the &quot;control&quot; plan of care.&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed to do all activities that do not increase symptoms and avoid&#xD;
      activities which aggravate symptoms as advice to maintain usual activity has been found to&#xD;
      assist in recovery from shoulder pain. Both groups will be treated with a stretching and&#xD;
      strengthening program. The rotator cuff and scapular stabilization strengthening and&#xD;
      flexibility program&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals will complete the first 3 weeks of the study (either DN +HSLE or control) and&#xD;
      will be asked to complete outcome measures (ASES, NPRS, DASH, SPADI, Medication usage, PSFS,&#xD;
      GROC, PASS) at 3, 12 weeks, and 6 months, following the initiation of therapy for follow-up&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
