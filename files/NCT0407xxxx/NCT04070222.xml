    <textblock>
      Mode of delivery affects the success rate of assisted reproductive techniques (ART). In this&#xD;
      case study, the investigators will evaluate changes in the bacterial ecology and inflammatory&#xD;
      markers of the female uterus with different delivery modes. We will investigate whether the&#xD;
      dominate endometrial microflora is interrupted by the Cesarean section in the infertile women&#xD;
      undergoing ART, and the potential mechanism will also be further explored prospectively.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The highly prevalence of cesarean section rate in China had drawn great attention world&#xD;
      widely. Post-cesarean section scar diverticulum ( PCSD) is a poor healing of the local&#xD;
      incision after Cesarean section which happened in19.4%~88% of patients. The cavity is formed&#xD;
      by the original incision connected with the uterine cavity. Patients with diverticulum are&#xD;
      often accompanied by prolonged menstruation and uterine effusion, which may accompany with&#xD;
      endometrial inflammation and impair embryo implantation rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though Cesarean section plays an important role in the treatment of dystocia and also&#xD;
      decreasing perinatal mortality, it may impact natural conception and the success rate of ART&#xD;
      in secondary infertile patients. Data from other researchers have revealed that Cesarean scar&#xD;
      may related to poor pregnancy outcome during ART treatment. We have retrospectively analyzed&#xD;
      the pregnancy outcome of ART treatment in patients who have had live birth previously from&#xD;
      January 2014 to May 2018. The biochemical pregnancy rate, embryo implantation rate and&#xD;
      clinical pregnancy rate are all lower in patients with Caesarean section compared to patients&#xD;
      after natural labour, the clinical data is even worse in patients with PCSD. The results&#xD;
      suggest a close correlation between the outcome of assisted reproductive therapy and the&#xD;
      uterine condition. Further evaluations are required related to whether the dominate&#xD;
      endometrial microflora is interrupted by the Cesarean section in the infertile women&#xD;
      undergoing ART, and the potential mechanism will also be explored accordingly. A&#xD;
      single-center, prospective, case-control study will be carried out.&#xD;

    <description>Three groups of patients will be enrolled: Natural labour group, Cesarean scar group and Cesarean with diverticulum (PCSD) group;&#xD;
Hysteroscopy will be carried out for uterine cavity examine and the specimen collection for further microflora analysis and inflammation marker detection;&#xD;
ART will be carried out with standard protocol and the clinical outcome will be recorded;&#xD;
The primary outcome of the study is the comparation of species and communities of uterine microflora and inflammatory markers of the female uterus among three groups. The secondary outcome is biochemical pregnancy rate, clinical pregnancy rate, embryo implantation rate and live birth rate.</description>
