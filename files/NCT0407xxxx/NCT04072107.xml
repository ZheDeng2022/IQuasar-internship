      The investigators aim to investigate whether incorporating on-treatment EBV DNA surveillance&#xD;
      for monitoring tumor responses to treatment and for guiding individuliased treatment&#xD;
      adaptation can improve prognosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patient . For patients with&#xD;
      detectable EBV DNA after one cycle of IC, which then drops to undetectable levels during the&#xD;
      following IC cycles (intermediate responders/intermediate relapse risk), the investigators&#xD;
      aim to investigate whether additional adjuvant metronomic capecitabine would benefit this&#xD;
      subgroup. For patients with detectable EBV DNA after three cycles of IC or with EBV DNA&#xD;
      bounce during the induction phase (insensitive to IC/high relapse risk), the investigators&#xD;
      aim to investigate whether concurrent administration of anti-PD-1 therapy during the&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a unique head and neck cancer characterized by an extremely&#xD;
      unbalanced global distribution. The highest incidence is observed in endemic regions, such as&#xD;
      southern China and Southeast Asia, with an age-standardized rate of 3.0 per 100,000 in China&#xD;
      to 0.4 per 100,000 in Caucasian populations. The fast progress of modern imaging and the&#xD;
      application of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has improved the local control rate&#xD;
      significantly. Distant metastasis has become the major cause of treatment failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2018 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline recommends concurrent&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) ± induction chemotherapy (IC)/adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) as the&#xD;
      standard treatment for stage II-IVa disease (category 2A). While it is worth noting that&#xD;
      there is extensive heterogeneity among patients with NPC, and even among patients with the&#xD;
      same disease stage, the risk of relapse varies. More importantly, patients can have differing&#xD;
      sensitivity to RT and chemotherapy. The abovementioned reasons result in over-treatment in&#xD;
      some patients with relatively low relapse risk; intensive treatments lead to unnecessary&#xD;
      toxicities, and greatly affect quality of life (QoL). On the other hand, the current&#xD;
      treatment strategy may be not optimal for patients with high relapse risk or who are not&#xD;
      sensitive to traditional chemoradiotherapy. Therefore, there is an urgent need for&#xD;
      identifying and applying promising biomarkers, real-time monitoring of patient responses to&#xD;
      treatment, predicting relapse risk, and guiding real-time treatment adaptation for&#xD;
      individualized therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
