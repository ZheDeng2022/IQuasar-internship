    <textblock>
      The Multi-OutcoMe EvaluatioN of radiation Therapy Using the Unity MR-Linac Study (MOMENTUM)&#xD;
      is a multi-institutional, international registry facilitating evidenced based implementation&#xD;
      of the Unity MR-Linac technology and further technical development of the MR-Linac system&#xD;
      with the ultimate purpose to improve patients' survival, local, and regional tumor control&#xD;
      and quality of life.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Radiation therapy has become indispensable in cancer treatment. However, it is&#xD;
      associated with severe side effects. Innovation in radiation therapy has resulted in the&#xD;
      development of MR-guided radiation therapy (MRGRT) which allows high precision radiotherapy&#xD;
      under real time MR visualization. High precision MRGRT has the potential of dose escalation&#xD;
      and margin reduction and may potentially lead to higher cure rates and less toxicity. MRGRT&#xD;
      can be delivered by the MRI guided Linear Accelerator (MR-Linac) which integrates a&#xD;
      state-of-the-art linear accelerator, 1.5T diagnostic quality MRI and an online adaptive&#xD;
      workflow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The Multi-OutcoMe EvaluatioN of radiation Therapy Using the MR-Linac Study&#xD;
      (MOMENTUM) aims to accelerate the technical and clinical development of Anatomic and Biologic&#xD;
      MRGRT and facilitate the evidence-based introduction of the MR-Linac into clinical practice.&#xD;
      In MOMENTUM, technical and clinical data are gathered in order to optimize software, evaluate&#xD;
      treatment outcomes, toxicities and progression free, disease free, and overall survival per&#xD;
      disease site, and create a repository of anatomical and biological MR sequences to develop&#xD;
      new features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A multi-institutional, international observational cohort study. Study&#xD;
      population: Cancer patients â‰¥ 18 years receiving treatment and/or imaging on an MR-Linac&#xD;
      machine are eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: MOMENTUM will collect technical and clinical patient data.&#xD;
      The technical patient data is defined as data generated by (the use of) the MR-Linac and will&#xD;
      include data collection during scans performed during routine care as well as research MRIs.&#xD;
      Clinical data will be categorized into six classes: demographic, disease characteristics,&#xD;
      treatment classifiers, toxicity outcomes, cancer control outcomes and PROs.&#xD;

    <description>Patient reported health related quality of life is captured through a questionnaire the Generic European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30. They include 5 functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social), three symptom scales, a global health scale, and six single items. All of these scales and items measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high score on functional or global health status scale represents a high/healthy level of functioning. A high score for a symptom scale represents a high level of symptomatology.</description>

    <description>Generic patient reported quality of life is captured by The EuroQol (EQ)-5D-5L questionnaire. This includes a descriptive system questionnaire and visual analogue scale (VAS). The descriptive system scores five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) from 1 to 5 where 1 means having no problems, and 5 means extreme problems or unable to participate. The digits can be combined in a 5-digit code to describe the overall health status. For example, 12111. The VAS records the overall current health on a vertical visual analogue scale from 0 to 100, respectively 'the worst health you can imagine' to 'the best health you can imagine'.</description>
