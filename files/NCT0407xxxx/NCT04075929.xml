  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the effects of short and long high intensity interval training (HIT) conducted&#xD;
      with the same total accumulated duration on physiological- and performance parameters during&#xD;
      a 4-week training period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies among elite athletes have documented the importance of large amounts of training&#xD;
      volume in order to perform at a high level in endurance sports. It is also well documented&#xD;
      that both low intensity training (LIT), moderate intensity training (MIT) and high intensity&#xD;
      training (HIT) should be included in the overall training efforts. It is well documented that&#xD;
      HIT has a positive effect on the aerobic endurance among both elite athletes and recreational&#xD;
      athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the fact that there is general agreement that HIT is an important part of the overall&#xD;
      training, it is unclear how this part of the training should be organized in order to&#xD;
      optimize the training effects. The adaptions of endurance performance seem to depend on both&#xD;
      the intensity and the accumulated duration of the HIT sessions. Therefore, the aim of this&#xD;
      study was to compare the effects of SI and LI training, including equal accumulated HIT&#xD;
      duration, during a 4-week intervention period, conducted as 4x8-min with 2-min recovery&#xD;
      periods, 4x(12x40/20-sec) with 2-min recovery periods and 4x(8x40/20-sec) with 2-min recovery&#xD;
      periods, in different physiological- and performance parameters among well-trained cyclists.&#xD;

    <description>The cyclists were allowed to perform ad libitum low intensity (LIT) in addition to high intensity (HIT) sessions that were determined to each group. The cyclists completed 12 supervised HIT sessions during the intervention period, three HIT sessions per week with at least 48 hours between each HIT-session. All HIT sessions were performed as supervised group training sessions. Each HIT session started with an individual 30 minutes' warm up at low intensity (55-70% HRmax) interspersed by freely chosen progressive sprints. For all groups the power output during the recovery periods was 50 % of the power output used during work intervals. The cyclists in all groups were instructed to perform each interval session at their maximal sustainable intensity. Each session ended with 15-20 minutes' cool down (55-70% HRmax). All HIT sessions were supervised and performed in groups on the University of Agder's (UiA) premises at Spicheren fitness center in Kristiansand.</description>
