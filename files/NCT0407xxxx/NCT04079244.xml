  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study focuses on preoperative anxiety in children and non-drug methods to reduce&#xD;
      anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During surgery under general anesthesia, children may be anxious because of separation from&#xD;
      their parents, fear of anesthesia, or loss of control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to reduce the anxiety of the child, anesthesiologists sometimes use an anxiolytic&#xD;
      medicine. This premedication can reduce the anxiety of children. However, side effects are&#xD;
      often observed as rebound anxiety after the operation or a delay to discharge from hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, alternative methods to premedication have been studied to reduce the anxiety&#xD;
      of children. For example, video games and cartoons are distraction methods. Studies have&#xD;
      shown that using a video game or cartoon during the waiting phases (in the room, when&#xD;
      traveling, in the permutation room) reduces the anxiety of children and with the same&#xD;
      efficiency as anxiolytic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of a tablet game and a&#xD;
      cartoon to reduce the anxiety of children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study takes an interest on the problem of the well-being of children during an&#xD;
      outpatient surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children are often anxious before a surgery under general anesthetic because of unfamiliar&#xD;
      environments, separation from parents, loss of control or uncertainty about anesthesia. 50%&#xD;
      to 70% of children develop anxiety after surgery. Anxiety before surgery are associated with&#xD;
      behavioral changes in postoperative like increase in anxiety, sleep or eating disturbances&#xD;
      and with postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reduce this preoperative anxiety, the use of anxiolytics (hypnovel, hydroxizyne) is the&#xD;
      most commonly used method. But this premedication remains controversial (paradoxical effects&#xD;
      with rebound of anxiety, loss of explicit memorization).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to examine two non-pharmacological and non-invasive methods&#xD;
      (technological distraction through video games and animated cartoons) that seem to be&#xD;
      effective in reducing preoperative anxiety and its postoperative repercussions. Much studies&#xD;
      show the benefits of preoperative distraction method to reduce children's anxiety, such as&#xD;
      cartoons, video games, puzzles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is now necessary to understand the processes underlying the relationship between the&#xD;
      preoperative anxiety and distraction method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video games and cartoons are supposed to foster a high level of cognitive engagement in&#xD;
      children, which would allow them to focus less on the anxiogenic elements of the operating&#xD;
      context and thus reduce their preoperative anxiety. This state of cognitive engagement is&#xD;
      called flow. Flow is defined as a state in which person is so involved in an activity that&#xD;
      nothing else matters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the paediatric anaesthesia department of the University Hospital Rennes Sud, the&#xD;
      playful video game &quot;Le HÃ©ros C'est Toi&quot; is systematically offered to children aged 3 to 10&#xD;
      years to accompany them throughout the course of care during outpatient surgery. This has&#xD;
      been a standard practice since 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, the aim is to examine the links between the state of flow, generated by a&#xD;
      playful application on tablet or animated cartoon, and the preoperative anxiety of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day of the intervention surgery, the study is proposed to the parents and the children on&#xD;
      their arrival. If the participants are in favor, the consent documents are given to them.&#xD;
      Patient inclusion is ongoing, after verification of inclusion criteria, parental consent and&#xD;
      signed consent. The attribution to the game-video or cartoon group is carried out according&#xD;
      to a randomization by block &quot; week &quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At their arrival in ambulatory care service, when child is in the room a first video&#xD;
      recording is made in order to examine the anxiety of the child. Then tablet with the video&#xD;
      game or animated cartoon is made available to the child. The tablet is available to the child&#xD;
      until anesthetic induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four others video recording are made :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  before the child leaves for the waiting room to examine the flow state of the child&#xD;
           until the separation with the parents to examine the anxiety of the child,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  when the child is in the waiting room to examine the flow state of the child&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  and during the anesthetic induction to examine the anxiety of the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the children are in the operating room, parents must complete questionnaires to&#xD;
      evaluate anxiety-trait of the children and anxiety-state of the parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pain's score and the emergence delirium of the child on waking are recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day after the intervention, a call is made to parents to examine the postoperative&#xD;
      behavioral changes of the children. Two other calls are made a week after and a month after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the anxiety-state of the child on video recording we use an observational grid,&#xD;
      the mYPAS To examine the anxiety-trait of the child we use the questionnaire PAS-R To examine&#xD;
      the anxiety-state of the parents we use the questionnaire STAI-S To examine the pain of the&#xD;
      child on waking we use an observational grid FLACC To examine the emergence delirium of the&#xD;
      child on waking we use an observational grid, the EPAD To examine the flow state on video&#xD;
      recording of the child, we use an observational grid. This tool is currently psychometrically&#xD;
      tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the postoperative behavioral change, we use the questionnaire PHBQ&#xD;

The tool used is the mYPAS. It is an observation based-method. Observation grid is composed of five dimensions : activity, vocalizations, emotional expressivity, state of apparent arousal, use of parents. The observer chooses a score for the five dimensions based on the criteria provided in the grid.&#xD;
The tool used is the Flow Observation Grid. It is an observation based-method. Observation gri dis composed of three dimensions : concentration, joy, frustration. The observer chooses a score for the three dimensions based on the criteria provided in the grid.</description>
