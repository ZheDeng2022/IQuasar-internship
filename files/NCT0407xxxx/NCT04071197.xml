      Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) is a group of disorders that can present&#xD;
      early in life with cholestasis and intractable pruritus. Their treatment poses a great&#xD;
      challenge, with medical treatment is not successful in many cases. Moreover, the available&#xD;
      non-transplant surgeries carry many side effects and different degrees of efficacy. Partial&#xD;
      external biliary diversion, internal biliary diversion, and ileal exclusion still lack&#xD;
      widespread experience with many side effects. Nasobiliary stent placement has little&#xD;
      tolerability, especially in younger age. Gastrobiliary tube is a novel modality for external&#xD;
      biliary diversion in such patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) is a group of disorders that can present&#xD;
      early in life with cholestasis and intractable pruritus. They result primarily from defective&#xD;
      transporters of different bile constituents on the canalicular membrane. The mildest form of&#xD;
      these defective transporters can present by what is called benign recurrent intrahepatic&#xD;
      cholestasis (BRIC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently both disease categories that represent the severest (PFIC) and mildest (BRIC)&#xD;
      forms of these transporters are better nomenclated as bile canalicular transport disorders,&#xD;
      as some cases can start early as BRIC and later in life progress the PFIC phenotype.&#xD;
      Moreover, a continuous spectrum of severity is present between what were previously known as&#xD;
      PFIC and BRIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the severest forms are not treated effectively they can have devastating outcomes reaching&#xD;
      death. On the other hand, those known as BRIC can have severe attacks with unremitting&#xD;
      pruritus that could be prolonged and sometimes persistent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Their treatment poses a great challenge, with medical treatment is not successful in many&#xD;
      cases. Moreover, the available non-transplant surgeries carry many side effects and different&#xD;
      degrees of efficacy. Partial external biliary diversion is not always successful and has&#xD;
      disfiguring effects and the stoma can have many side effects. Internal biliary diversion and&#xD;
      ileal exclusion still lack widespread experience and encouraging results due to sometimes&#xD;
      lack of efficacy and others due to side effects. Nasobiliary stent placement was tried in&#xD;
      previous cases with a promising outcome, but with little tolerability, especially in younger&#xD;
      age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In spite liver transplant is the last resort for failing cases, the availability of&#xD;
      successful non transplant therapy would be the preferable one if it is with adequate efficacy&#xD;
      and little side effects. The innovative intervention proposed in this study is expected to&#xD;
      have a good efficacy due to total biliary diversion rather than the partial ones obtained by&#xD;
      other surgeries. Moreover, it avoids the disfiguring impact of the jeujenal stoma. More&#xD;
      importantly, it can be removed at any time and be used at the times of severe flare of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
