      This study aims to study the incidence of retinal detachment in the nearsighted myopic after&#xD;
      phakoemulsification lens surgery and use of posterior chamber foldable soft implants with a&#xD;
      follow-up of 5 years and preliminary results at 3 years.&#xD;

      Major advances have been made in the field of lens surgery over the last 20 years which has&#xD;
      significantly reduced the per and postoperative complications of this surgery. Retinal&#xD;
      detachment remains the most feared complication of this surgery in the nearsighted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently an increasing popularity in the international ophthalmic community for the&#xD;
      correction of ametropia, particularly nearsightedness, by ablation of the non-cataracted&#xD;
      lens, referred to as refractive lensectomy. However, no recent study reports the&#xD;
      complications of this procedure with the use of modern surgical techniques.&#xD;

      phakoemulsification lens surgery and use of posterior chamber foldable soft implants with a&#xD;
