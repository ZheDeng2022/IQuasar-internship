  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to analyze whether the &quot;liquid biopsy&quot; model could increase the specificity of&#xD;
      detecting men with an aggressive (defined as Gleason score ≥ 7) prostate cancer and thereby&#xD;
      reduce the proportion of men who undergo prostate biopsy, while at the same time maintaining&#xD;
      the same sensitivity to detect aggressive prostate cancer as the PSA test alone. Using blood&#xD;
      and urine biomarkers together with an algorithm, which incorporates the clinical data, we aim&#xD;
      to identify patients who have a high risk of having an aggressive prostate cancer. By&#xD;
      performing this non-invasive test we expect that we can reduce need for prostate biopsy and&#xD;
      reduce the detection of patients with an indolent prostate cancer (defined by Gleason score ≤&#xD;
      6). Thereby we aim to reduce the side effects of transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy of the&#xD;
      prostate and side-effects of living with an indolent cancer.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Prostate biopsy is currently the standard of care for prostate cancer diagnosis,&#xD;
      oftentimes reflexed after the detection of an elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA).&#xD;
      Unfortunately, prostate biopsy is not without potential complications, which include&#xD;
      discomfort, pain, bleeding, and infections ranging from cystitis to septic sepsis and even&#xD;
      death. Bleeding has been reported in 6-13% of patients undergoing prostate biopsy, while&#xD;
      0.3-4% experience admission with sepsis. Furthermore, some newly diagnosed prostate cancers&#xD;
      are indolent while other may be more aggressive with metastatic potential, with resultant&#xD;
      risk of death. A PSA level ≥4.0 ng/ml is frequently used as a threshold warranting a biopsy&#xD;
      evaluation. Elevated PSA level may reflect benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), inflammation,&#xD;
      or malignancy. Some series suggest that only 20-30% of patients with PSA 4 - 10 ng/ml, have&#xD;
      prostate cancer, resulting in a high number of patients undergoing an unnecessary biopsy. We&#xD;
      recently reported the ability of &quot;Liquid Biopsy&quot; to predict the presence of aggressive&#xD;
      prostate cancer using a combination of biomarkers detected in urine and peripheral blood&#xD;
      plasma. Concluding that &quot;Liquid Biopsy&quot; can predict the presence of aggressive prostate&#xD;
      cancer (GS ≥7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM With this study we want of compare &quot;Liquid Biopsy&quot;, defined by our blood and urine panel&#xD;
      against prostate biopsy in a large-scale randomized manner including men referred for a&#xD;
      biopsy due to the suspicion of prostate cancer over the age of 70 (elderly).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE The primary objectives of this study are to test the ability of the &quot;liquid biopsy&quot;&#xD;
      to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Detect as many patients with aggressive prostate cancer as the standard method (PSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reduce the number of prostate biopsy sets taken and thereby reduce the number of&#xD;
           patients detected with indolent prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The economic effect of implementation of the test with regard to reduced biopsies taken,&#xD;
           iatrogenic infectious disease and reduced control of indolent prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The association of the liquid biopsy to tumor grade and tumor volume in biopsied men.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The Quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Progression and survival: overall survival, prostate cancer specific survival, PSA&#xD;
           recurrence, time to metastases, time to castration resistance&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Safety&#xD;
