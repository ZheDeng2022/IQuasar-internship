  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is about a medicine called TAK-981 given with rituximab, used to treat adults with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory CD20-positive Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has 2 parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To check for side effects from treatment with TAK-981 given with rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To check how much TAK-981 participants can tolerate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To check if participants with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or follicular lymphoma&#xD;
           respond well to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive TAK-981 and rituximab in 21-day cycles. They will continue&#xD;
      treatment for about 12 months unless their condition gets worse (disease progression), they&#xD;
      cannot tolerate the treatment, or they leave the study for certain reasons.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-981 in combination with rituximab. The&#xD;
      study will include a dose escalation phase (Phase 1) and an expansion phase in select NHL&#xD;
      indications (Phase 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 130 participants, approximately 35 participants in Phase&#xD;
      1 and approximately 95 participants in Phase 2. The participants with indolent or aggressive&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory (r/r) NHL in Phase 1 will identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      and/or pharmacologically active dose (PAD). PAD can be defined retrospectively once MTD is&#xD;
      reached and it can below MTD or coincide with it. In the dose escalation phase, the starting&#xD;
      dose of TAK-981 will be 10 mg. The RP2D will be determined based on the available safety,&#xD;
      preliminary pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic information data, and after any early&#xD;
      antitumor activity observed along with the statistical inference from the Bayesian Logistic&#xD;
      Regression Modeling (BLRM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the Phase 2 will be enrolled once the Phase 1 of the study is completed, and&#xD;
      MTD and/or PAD is determined. Phase 2 will explore the efficacy and safety of TAK-981 in&#xD;
      combination with rituximab in participants with select r/r NHL types and indications.&#xD;
      Participants in Phase 2 will be enrolled in one of the three treatment arms based on Cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort A: r/r DLBCL Progressed to CAR T-cell therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort B: r/r DLBCL with no CAR T-cell Prior Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort C: r/r FL Progressed to Systemic Therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States and Canada. The overall time&#xD;
      to participate in this study is approximately 48 months. Participants will make multiple&#xD;
      visits to the clinic, and will attend the end of treatment (EOT) visit 30 days after&#xD;
      receiving their last dose of drug or before the start of subsequent systemic anticancer&#xD;
      therapy, whichever occurs first for a follow-up assessment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Each participant must meet all the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the&#xD;
        study:&#xD;

             intermediate features between DLBCL and Burkitt's lymphoma or with intermediate&#xD;
             features between DLBCL and Hodgkin lymphoma, FL grade 3B, and aggressive B-cell&#xD;
             lymphoma unclassifiable who must have previously received rituximab, cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
             doxorubicin (hydroxydaunorubicin), vincristine, (Oncovin) and prednisone (R-CHOP) (or&#xD;
             equivalent anti-CD20 containing therapy) and 1 additional line of therapy in the r/r&#xD;
             setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
             o. iNHL (including FL of grades 1-3A and marginal zone lymphoma) refractory to&#xD;
             rituximab or to any other anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, who have received at least&#xD;

             indicated for other medical conditions such as inhaled steroid for asthma, topical&#xD;
             steroid use, or as premedication for administration of study drug or contrast.&#xD;
             Participants requiring steroids at daily doses &gt;20 mg prednisone equivalent systemic&#xD;
             exposure daily, or those who are administered steroids for lymphoma control or white&#xD;
             blood cell count lowering are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. With baseline prolongation of the Fridericia-corrected QT interval (QTcF) (example,&#xD;

             P-glycoprotein (Pgp) inhibitors. To participate in this study, such participants&#xD;
             should discontinue use of such agents for at least 2 weeks (1 week for CYP3A4/5 and&#xD;
