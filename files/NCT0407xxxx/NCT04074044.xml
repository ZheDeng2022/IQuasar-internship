      Millions of women experience involuntary loss of urine called urinary incontinence (UI). UI&#xD;
      can be slightly bothersome or totally debilitating. Women experience UI twice as often as&#xD;
      men. Urinary incontinence can also be a persistent condition caused by underlying physical&#xD;
      problems or changes, including pregnancy and childbirth. UI symptom severity progress&#xD;
      dynamically and are also sustained over time. High quality evidence shows that pelvic floor&#xD;
      muscle training (PFMT) during pregnancy effectively reduces the risk of UI during pregnancy&#xD;
      and the postpartum period. There is a critical need for a low cost and easily accessible&#xD;
      program to prevent UI in pregnancy and postpartum that can reach a large number of women. A&#xD;
      mobile health application that teaches UI preventive program during pregnancy has the&#xD;
      potential of being a cost effective tool to reach a large number of pregnant women. The&#xD;
      Bladder Health Mobile Application (BHmApp) will teach pregnant women new habits and exercises&#xD;
      that will keep their bladder healthy during pregnancy and decrease the risk of UI during this&#xD;
      period of a woman's life that is considered high risk for developing UI. In this pilot study,&#xD;
      it is proposed to evaluate the understand and effectively use the BHmApp, and the feasibility&#xD;
      of using the BHmApp during pregnancy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence (UI) is the involuntary and unintentional leaking of urine. Over 20&#xD;
      million of women experience UI, approximately 34% (range 25-45%) of all US women are affected&#xD;
      indicating a significant healthcare concern with both financial and quality of life&#xD;
      implications. The financial cost of UI in the United States (U.S) exceeds $65 billion per&#xD;
      year (in year 2007 dollars), and it is projected that the cost will be $82.6 billion in&#xD;
      2020.Women with UI feel shame about this condition, report poor self-esteem, and are at&#xD;
      increased risk of depression. Pregnancy is a high-risk time for developing stress UI, urine&#xD;
      leakage with physical effort, with a reported prevalence of 35-67% during pregnancy and 31%&#xD;
      postpartum. Pregnancy also places women at increased risk of developing UI later in life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High quality evidence shows that pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) during pregnancy&#xD;
      effectively reduces the risk of UI during pregnancy and the postpartum period by 39-59%. A&#xD;
      recent Cochrane review examined the evidence for PFMT based on 38 trials involving 9,892&#xD;
      women from 20 countries. The authors concluded that in continent pregnant women, performing&#xD;
      antenatal PFMT may decrease the risk of UI in late pregnancy and in the mid-postnatal period&#xD;
      greater 3 to six months postpartum. However, evidence shows that many women in the U.S. do&#xD;
      not receive effective PFMT. PFMT to prevent UI is not routinely offered or well taught to&#xD;
      pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a critical need for a low cost and easily accessible program to prevent UI in&#xD;
      pregnancy and postpartum that can reach a large number of women. Such a program could reduce&#xD;
      the financial and psychological impact of UI on pregnant women, lower the risk of UI with its&#xD;
      associated negative outcomes and address a priority area identified by National Institute of&#xD;
      Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). A mobile health application that teaches&#xD;
      UI preventive program during pregnancy has the potential of being a cost effective tool to&#xD;
      reach a large number of pregnant women. The plan is to offer PFMT, the Knack (squeeze before&#xD;
      you sneeze trick), bladder training (BT) with urge suppression and healthy bladder education&#xD;
      (fluid modification, bowel habits) using a mobile health application that allows women to&#xD;
      learn and practice these new habits anytime and anywhere that is convenient to them. In the&#xD;
      pilot studies, as supported by other studies, it was learned that the main obstacles to&#xD;
      preventing UI by means of PFMT are the feasibility of group classes and low adherence to the&#xD;
      exercise routine. Mobile health application (mApp) offers an innovative approach to improve&#xD;
      feasibility. PFMT mApps showed effectiveness in women with stress UI and improved adherence&#xD;
      to PFMT in women with UI. Additionally, stress UI self-management that includes PFMT with&#xD;
      mApp has been shown to be cost-effective. Measurement of adherence to behavioral protocols&#xD;
      has often been overlooked in research. Few studies provide information about how adherent&#xD;
      women were with PFMT and the literature is sparse on methods to identify barriers and improve&#xD;
      adherence. Adherence to PFM exercises during pregnancy was reported to be between 16%-69%,&#xD;
      and adherence rates 4-6 weeks after delivery were 43%-83%. Common reasons for not doing PFMT&#xD;
      during pregnancy and postpartum include exercises are: forgetting, being too busy, and the&#xD;
      belief they have become unnecessary due to the absence of symptoms. Using a mobile App is an&#xD;
      innovative way to address these obstacles. To help women overcome these particular barriers,&#xD;
      this study proposes a Bladder Health mobile application (BHmApp) that will use various forms&#xD;
      of reminders, provide exercise aids, link daily exercises to environmental cues, and&#xD;
      integrate exercises into the patient's everyday activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To support adherence, the BHmAPP will communicate realistic expectations, make it clear that&#xD;
      it may take weeks to months for symptom improvement, and it may be irregular, with &quot;good&quot;&#xD;
      days and &quot;bad&quot; days. The BHmApp can provide support by tracking and reinforcing progress,&#xD;
      identifying and addressing barriers, and encouraging persistence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last year, the team worked on designing and building the BHmApp aimed to teach&#xD;
      pregnant women new habits and exercises that will keep their bladder healthy during pregnancy&#xD;
      and decrease the risk of UI during this period of a woman's life that is considered high risk&#xD;
      for developing UI. In this pilot study, it is proposed to evaluate the ability to comprehend&#xD;
      the tool and take appropriate actions using the BHmApp, and the feasibility of using the&#xD;
      BHmApp during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BHmApp is designed to: effectively engage pregnant women prior to development of UI and&#xD;
      associated bladder symptoms, teach them new health habits that will decrease their risk of UI&#xD;
      and associated bladder symptoms and increase their ability to keep their bladder healthy. The&#xD;
      proposed project is innovative in the following ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. BHmApp focus is the prevention of UI. Currently, there are many mApps that teach PFMT to&#xD;
           treat UI, most use simple instruction protocols, use the same protocol for all patients,&#xD;
           and end up working the same way as simple verbal instruction. This BHmApp protocol is&#xD;
           designed for pregnant women, offering training for PFMT, Knack, BT and urge suppression&#xD;
           and bladder health strategies, allows women to connect with a bladder health coach to&#xD;
           ask questions, offers notification reminders of exercise time, and a way for women to&#xD;
           record and track adherence to PFMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The BHmApp is built specifically for pregnant women. With pregnancy being the high-risk&#xD;
           time in a woman's life to develop UI, there is a need for a UI prevention program that&#xD;
           can reach large numbers of women at low cost. The BHmApp is designed to teach pregnant&#xD;
           women these new habits and skills, and offers a new opportunity in the effort to prevent&#xD;
           UI. This BHmApp takes into consideration the physiologic changes in a woman's body&#xD;
           during pregnancy, and the restrictions to certain exercises and habits during pregnancy.&#xD;
           For example, bladder health is not practiced until 4 weeks after delivery and PFMT is&#xD;
           done in sitting position after 20-weeks gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The BHmApp format allows participants to access the health information at any time, and&#xD;
           anywhere that is convenient for them. Pregnancy is a busy period of time in a woman's&#xD;
           life, with increased healthcare visits, preparing for new baby, and an increased chance&#xD;
           of fatigue and insomnia. Offering a chance to gain new knowledge and learn new habits&#xD;
           through short (2-3 minutes) lessons, that can be accessed at a woman's convenience,&#xD;
           would significantly increase the chances of learning these important skills and habits&#xD;
           during pregnancy.&#xD;
