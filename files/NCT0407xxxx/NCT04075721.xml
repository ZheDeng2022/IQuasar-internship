    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics and early efficacy signs of M3258 as a single agent and co-administered with&#xD;
      dexamethasone in participants with Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study was discontinued given the changed therapeutic landscape, lack of recruitment and&#xD;
