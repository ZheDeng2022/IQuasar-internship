      The purpose of this study is to compare the change of global cognitive performance after 52&#xD;
      weeks of intervention among participants with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF)&#xD;
      receiving rivaroxaban versus a vitamin K antagonist (warfarin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to compare, among participants with NVFA receiving rivaroxaban&#xD;
      versus warfarin :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the changes of global cognitive performance after 26 weeks of intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the changes of executive functions after 26 and 52 weeks of intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the changes of episodic memory after 26 and 52 weeks of intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the volumetric changes of the brain after 26 and 52 weeks of intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the changes of independence and autonomy after 26 and 52 weeks of intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the changes of serum vitamin K concentration after 26 and 52 weeks of intervention&#xD;

      Detailed Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are commonly used for their role in hemostasis by interfering&#xD;
      with vitamin K cycle decreasing the bioavailability of the vitamin K active form. In addition&#xD;
      to a role in blood coagulation, vitamin K participates in brain health and function by&#xD;
      regulating the synthesis of sphingolipids, a constituent of the myelins sheath and the&#xD;
      neurons membrane, and through the biological activation of vitamin K-dependent proteins&#xD;
      (VKDPs) involved in neuron survival. Epidemiological studies have reported a positive&#xD;
      association between higher serum vitamin K concentration and better verbal episodic memory&#xD;
      performance in older adults, and an inverse association between dietary vitamin K intakes and&#xD;
      behavioural disorders and cognitive complaint. The clinical implication is that the use of&#xD;
      VKAs, which deplete the active form of vitamin K, may be responsible for Central Nervous&#xD;
      System (CNS) disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CNS abnormalities were observed in newborns exposed in utero to VKA. Similarly, the&#xD;
      investigators and other researchers reported that the use of VKAs (especially fluindione) was&#xD;
      directly associated with cognitive decline (notably executive dysfunction) and hippocampal&#xD;
      atrophy in older adults, even while taking into account the history of atrial fibrillation,&#xD;
      stroke and vascular brain changes. These cross-sectional and longitudinal studies were yet&#xD;
      limited by their observational design. Clinical trials are now warranted to explore the&#xD;
      effect on cognition of VKAs against direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), whose indications are&#xD;
      similar but whose mechanism does not interfere with vitamin K. The favorable impact of the&#xD;
      use of DOACs compared to VKA in the incidence of dementia was also observed in a US&#xD;
      retrospective population-based study of patients managed per routine clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that VKAs have a deleterious impact on cognition and brain&#xD;
      morphology compared to DOACs, due to the decrease in vitamin K bioavailability. A review of&#xD;
      the published clinical trials comparing the effects of VKAs and DOACs, especially&#xD;
      rivaroxaban, shows that cognition and brain volume were not assessed as outcomes in these&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
