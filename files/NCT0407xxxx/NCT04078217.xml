      The study will aim to determine whether a technology-based personalized home exercise program&#xD;
      delivered asynchronously and supervised remotely by a kinesiologist is more effective in&#xD;
      improving gait than a similar home-based exercise program without technology nor remote&#xD;
      supervision. The main hypothesis is that the proposed intervention with the technology will&#xD;
      provide significant improvements in gait performance and higher adherence/satisfaction over&#xD;
      the non-supervised exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will be composed of people with Parkinson's disease. They will have the same&#xD;
      evaluation pre and post intervention, the same number of visits from the kinesiologist to&#xD;
      deliver the exercise program at home. The difference is the information gathered from the&#xD;
      technology; for example, the completion level of each training, success or failure of&#xD;
      selected exercises, connection to exercise session, etc. In addition, kinesiologist can&#xD;
      remotely adjust difficulty of exercise and take action quickly if the participant hasn't&#xD;
      logged in the training system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total duration for a participant is 16 weeks: pre-evaluation at home and at lab, 12 weeks&#xD;
      home-based exercise program, post-evaluation at home and lab (same as before exercise&#xD;
      program).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre- and post-evaluation: 7 days wearing an Apple watch to measure mobility in participant&#xD;
      environment (participant is met at home and continues normal activities), than comes to lab&#xD;
      to undergo physical and balance tests, and scans to analyse body composition (fat, muscle and&#xD;
      bone structures). Participant needs to be in &quot;off&quot; state when arriving at the lab; not have&#xD;
      taken the morning PD medication. Will take it at the lab with breakfast, after the first&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;

      The specific aims of this project are: a) to determine whether a technology-based&#xD;
      personalized home exercise program delivered asynchronously and supervised remotely by a&#xD;
      kinesiologist is more effective in improving gait than a traditional home-based exercise&#xD;
      program, b) to assess the system acceptability and satisfaction, c) to examine and compare&#xD;
      the impact of both approaches on several secondary outcome measures related to mobility, PD&#xD;
      symptom, and quality of life. This study is a prospective randomized controlled&#xD;
      single-blinded clinical trial of efficacy of a technology asynchronous assisted supervised&#xD;
      tele-exercise program compared to an a traditional home-based exercise program with a&#xD;
      booklet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group (CONT): The participants (n=21) included in control group will follow a&#xD;
      non-supervised home-based exercise program (booklet format). The exercise program will&#xD;
      include 3 physical activity sessions per week for 12 consecutive weeks. This exercise regimen&#xD;
      has been shown to be adequate to improve functional capacities in elderly and feasible. Each&#xD;
      exercise session will last 40-45 minutes and includes: 1) 5 minutes of warm-up exercises; 2)&#xD;
      15-18 minutes of mobility and balance exercises (e.g. high knees, lateral launches, side&#xD;
      steps); 3) 15-18 minutes of strengthening and coordination exercises (e.g. weight transfer&#xD;
      and squats, leg extension and balance, lateral shifting, horizontal flexion and extension)&#xD;
      and; 4) 5 minutes for cool down/stretching. This exercise protocol was developed based on&#xD;
      general guidelines for the prescription of exercises to older adults and, validated in a&#xD;
      previous study. The exercise booklet will be introduced and supervised for the first sessions&#xD;
      by a trained kinesiologist. Follow-ups by phone will happen at sessions 6, 12 and 18. During&#xD;
      these follow-up calls, if the answers are &quot;yes&quot; to the 3 following questions (1. Did the&#xD;
      participant perform during the last weeks all the exercise sessions? 2. Did the participant&#xD;
      feel safe when performing exercises? 3. Did the participant find easier to perform the&#xD;
      exercises compared to the last contact?), then the participant will be invited, but not&#xD;
      obligated, to increase the level of difficulty using the option indicated in the booklet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JIN Group (n=21): The JIN group (n=21) will receive an individualized asynchronous supervised&#xD;
      home-base exercise program using the Jintronix System, 3 times/week for 12 weeks (36&#xD;
      sessions). This exercise regimen has shown to be adequate to improve functional capacities in&#xD;
      elderly. Briefly, the Jintronix Rehabilitation System (JRS) uses Microsoft Kinect cameras to&#xD;
      track patient's movements in 3D during exercises. They are programmed as games that are&#xD;
      visualized on a television and for which performance feedback is provided to the participant.&#xD;
      Developed by Jintronix system designers in partnership with researchers, the system provides&#xD;
      an interactive exergame environment to execute, specialized exercises through specific&#xD;
      instructions and real-time feedback. The Jintronix system which includes a computer, the&#xD;
      software and a motion capture device will be installed at participants' homes on their own&#xD;
      television. A trained kinesiologist will install the system and supervise the exercise&#xD;
      program. Participants will be trained to use the system with help of the kinesiologist during&#xD;
      the visits. Each exercise session will last 40-45 minutes and includes: 1) 5 minutes of&#xD;
      warm-up exercises; 2) 15-18 minutes of mobility and balance exercises (e.g. high knees,&#xD;
      lateral launches, side steps); 3) 15-18 minutes of strengthening and coordination exercises&#xD;
      (e.g. weight transfer and squats, leg extension and balance, lateral shifting, horizontal&#xD;
      flexion and extension) and; 4) 5 minutes for cool down/stretching. Based on the Web-portal&#xD;
      daily reports on the performance of the exercise program, the kinesiologist will do online&#xD;
      adjustment of the degree of difficulty of the individualized exercises by increasing the&#xD;
      number of repetitions, number of series, intensity and range of motion and provide feedback&#xD;
      to the participant. This will ensure individualized adaptations and progress throughout the&#xD;
      12-week intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The JIN group will use the Jintronix rehabilitation software to exercise at home whereas the&#xD;
      CONT group will use an exercise booklet. Both groups will be free to exercise on the 3 days&#xD;
      and times that best suit their schedule, with a mandatory minimum of one day off between&#xD;
      sessions. In addition, to counteract human interaction bias, both exercise groups will have&#xD;
      the same number and type of contact. The first weeks following the baseline evaluation, 3 to&#xD;
      4 in-person home visits are required to ensure proper and safe execution of exercise protocol&#xD;
      (both groups) and the capacity to use the technology (JIN group only). In addition to these&#xD;
      visits, 3 follow-up phone calls will be given to allow the kinesiologist to ensure safety and&#xD;
      adherence. An emergency contact number will be given to participants for any questions&#xD;
      regarding the exercise regimen during the 12-week intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study workflow and monitoring: After a phone screening to ensure eligibility and obtaining an&#xD;
      oral consent to participate, participants will follow 2 baseline visits: 1 at their home and&#xD;
      1 at the &quot;Université du Québec à Montréal&quot; (UQAM). Before the home visit, subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized into control (CONT) or Jintronix® (JIN). During the first visit at home,&#xD;
      participants will sign an informed consent form. Afterward, the visit will be divided in 2&#xD;
      parts. The first part will serve to complete validated questionnaires (Parkinson's Disease&#xD;
      Questionnaire, Short Falls Efficacy Scale-International and Life Space Assessment). The&#xD;
      second part is to install the wearable equipment for mobility assessment (Apple watch® and&#xD;
      location beacons). Participants will wear the sensor for at least 7 consecutive days.&#xD;
      Afterwards, participants will return wearable sensors and location beacons at the UQAM visit.&#xD;
      They will arrive in the morning in &quot;off&quot; state (abstinence of medication 12h before&#xD;
      appointment) to undergo the motor evaluation, which is the 6-minute walk test, and the Short&#xD;
      Physical Performance Battery test. After these, participants will take their medication with&#xD;
      a breakfast at the lab. While waiting to be &quot;on&quot; state, investigators will perform the body&#xD;
      composition (DEXA) and muscle composition scans (Ct-scan). When the medication is fully in&#xD;
      effect, functional capacity and 6-min walk tests will be re-assessed. This will provide us&#xD;
      comparison measures. All evaluations will be repeated at the end of the exercise intervention&#xD;
      using the same sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: Primary outcome measure is the average gait speed assessed during a 6-minute&#xD;
      walk test. Based on previous studies, obtaining clinically significant improvement in gait&#xD;
      speed needs to show a gain of 0.2m/sec after intervention. Data using the proposed technology&#xD;
      yielded significant improvement (JIN:+0,2±0,12m/s vs CONT:0,05 ±0,09m/s; p=0.025). Thus,&#xD;
      obtaining a power of 0.80, an alpha of 0.05, with an effect size of 0.5 (which is&#xD;
      significantly smaller that the investigators previously obtained (1.37)), this project would&#xD;
      need a total sample size of 28 participants (14 per group) to detect clinically significant&#xD;
      differences in gait speed changes between two groups. However, considering an attrition rate&#xD;
      of 20% (3 out of 14 in each group) and to improve chances to achieve adequate power for&#xD;
      secondary outcomes, a sample of 21 participants per group (n=42) will be used. Even if&#xD;
      adequate power is not achieved for the secondary outcomes' measures, sample sizes between 24&#xD;
      and 50 are sufficient to calculate the standard deviation of outcome measures gathered during&#xD;
      a feasibility study, to estimate the sample size required for hypothesis testing in a&#xD;
      randomized control trial (RCT). Thus, calculations will ensure a sufficient power analysis&#xD;
      for the primary outcome measure and position the investigators to establish the variability&#xD;
      on secondary measures for a larger RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses: Descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, ranges, normality,&#xD;
      and proportions) will be determined for all study variables. The primary outcome, gait speed,&#xD;
      will be assessed using a two-way mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) where group is the&#xD;
      between factor and time is the within factor. Tukey post hoc or Friedman test will be used&#xD;
      based on data characteristics. Categorical variables related to the outcome measures (i.e.&#xD;
      clinical scales and diary) will be analyzed using χ2 or Fisher exact tests for baseline&#xD;
      comparisons. The change in each outcome variable (before and after training) will be modeled&#xD;
      in an unadjusted 1-factor (group) analysis of variance, to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      interventions. Wearable sensor data will be averaged over multiple days and compared using a&#xD;
      two-way mixed model ANOVA as described above, similar to other secondary outcome measures&#xD;
      (i.e. DEXA, CT-Scan, etc.). Tukey post hoc or Friedman test will be used based on data&#xD;
      characteristics. To examine changes in variability, standard deviations will be averaged over&#xD;
      multiple days and compared using the same approach. Finally, exploratory analyses will be&#xD;
      performed to examine 1) if the JIN intervention allows to improve on/off periods, 2) the&#xD;
      possible effect of age, sex or medication dose on exercise adaptations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation: Patients with PD are likely to experience a decrease in their daily physical&#xD;
      activity (PA) because of physical impairments, fatigue, and apathy. PA is a complement to&#xD;
      pharmacological interventions to manage the inherent decline in function associated with the&#xD;
      disease. It is well known that PA interventions induce positive effects on physical&#xD;
      capacities and more specifically on gait, mobility, posture and balance. However, engaging&#xD;
      older adults in PA through different modalities of exercise programs to obtain these benefits&#xD;
      is a challenge, as more than half of older adults are inactive physically and patients with&#xD;
      PD are even more than older adults. Supervised exercise programs are needed to motivate and&#xD;
      engage patients with PD in becoming more physically active in structured and safe ways.&#xD;
      Providing access to supervised exercise programs for patients is difficult as they have&#xD;
      mobility constrains and they rely on others for their travel. Home Exercise Programs (HEPs)&#xD;
      offer potential benefits but are often lacking close supervision and interaction with a&#xD;
      healthcare professional. The use of a supervised in-home PA program driven and supported by&#xD;
      an exergame such as Jintronix© has the potential to be more impactful and meaningful to&#xD;
      patients than traditional HEPs. It can be used independently by them in their own home and do&#xD;
      not require the presence of a professional to perform physical activity training. This allows&#xD;
      patients to perform exercise as they wish (schedule, day, on/off period etc.) which overall&#xD;
      will increase their adherence to the PA program and promote self-engagement and&#xD;
      self-management of their PD. The technology provides a unique way to engage patients in PA&#xD;
      while ensuring supervision and communication with a health care professional. The proposed&#xD;
      works will also innovate by using an ecological mobility measurement approach based on&#xD;
      wearable sensors to capture gait and activity metrics under real life conditions for&#xD;
      multiples days and link this to medication use. The combination of sensors used (inertial&#xD;
      sensor at the ankle, and interior and exterior location sensors) and their packaging into&#xD;
      highly usable and wearable form factors is highly innovative and unique. The proposed&#xD;
      instrumentation for the measurement approach offers a lot of potential to study the impacts&#xD;
      of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions on real life functions and&#xD;
      activities of patients. It could be of interest to other parties involved in clinical trials&#xD;
      on interventions for PD.&#xD;
