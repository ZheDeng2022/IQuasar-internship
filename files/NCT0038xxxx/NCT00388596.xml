  <brief_title>A Study Of SB-751689, Atorvastatin, Ketoconazole, And Rosuvastatin In Health Postmenopausal Women.</brief_title>
  <official_title>An Open-Label, Partially Randomized, Interaction Study to Evaluate the Effects of SB-751689 on the Pharmacokinetics of Rosuvastatin and Atorvastatin or the Effects of Ketoconazole on the Pharmacokinetics of SB-751689 in Healthy Postmenopausal Female Subjects</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first purpose of this study is to determine if taking SB-751689 along with Rosuvastatin&#xD;
      (CRESTOR) or Atorvastatin (LIPITOR) will change how Rosuvastatin or Atorvastatin are absorbed&#xD;
      and eliminated from the body. Rosuvastatin and Atorvastatin are prescription medications used&#xD;
      to treat patients with high cholesterol. Patients who would take SB-751689 for osteoporosis&#xD;
      might also take Rosuvastatin or Atorvastatin for high cholesterol. In an earlier study,&#xD;
      SB-751689 was shown to lower the blood levels of Rosuvastatin when the two drugs were taken&#xD;
      at the same time. Lower blood levels of Rosuvastatin could mean that it would not be as&#xD;
      effective in lowering cholesterol. In this study SB-751689 will be taken alone, Rosuvastatin&#xD;
      will be taken alone, SB-751689 and Rosuvastatin will be taken together, and SB-751689 will be&#xD;
      taken 12 hours before Rosuvastatin is taken. This study will help determine if the two drugs&#xD;
      should be taken 12 hour apart to prevent lower Rosuvastatin blood levels. Atorvastatin will&#xD;
      be taken alone and at the same time as SB-751689 to determine if Atorvastatin blood levels&#xD;
      are lower when taken at the same time as SB-751689.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second purpose of this study is to determine if taking another drug called Ketoconazole&#xD;
      (Nizoral) along with SB-751689 will change how SB-751689 is absorbed and eliminated from the&#xD;
      body. Ketoconazole is a prescription medication used to treat patients with fungal and yeast&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
