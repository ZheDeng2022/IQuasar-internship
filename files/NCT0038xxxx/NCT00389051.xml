    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the tolerability, pharmacokinetics and antitumor&#xD;
      effect of bendamustine hydrochloride (SyB L-0501) in patients with indolent B-cell&#xD;
      Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Indolent B-cell Non-hodgkin's lymphoma is treated mainly with radiation and chemotherapy&#xD;
      using a combination of chemotherapies, such as purine-analogues and CHOP (cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
      doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone). After the approval of an antibody therapy agent&#xD;
      RituximabÂ®, it alone or combination with CHOP has been introduced. Bendamustine hydrochloride&#xD;
      has a unique structure compared with the marketed agents, and has an innovative mechanism of&#xD;
      action. Thus, it is expected that Bendamustine hydrochloride will provide new alternatives&#xD;
      for patients with indolent B-cell Non-hodgkin's lymphoma.&#xD;
