    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the Life Recovery Systems Thermosuit(R) System&#xD;
      is able to quickly and conveniently cool patients who are comatose after resuscitation from&#xD;
      cardiac arrest.&#xD;

      The primary purpose of this study is to clinically evaluate the use of a new cooling device&#xD;
      (the LRS ThermoSuit(R) System) to cool patients who are comatose following resuscitation from&#xD;
      cardiac arrest. This device cools by circulating cold water directly against the skin of the&#xD;
      patient. Cooling to a state of mild hypothermia (32 to 34 degrees C, maintained for 12 to 24&#xD;
      hours) is recognized by the American Heart Association, European Resuscitation Council, and&#xD;
      the Canadian Association of Emergency Care Physicians as a promising therapy for such&#xD;
      patients, and is likely to be most effective if administered quickly following resuscitation.&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that this new device will cool patients much more quickly than by&#xD;
      historical means. Patients will be monitored for physiologic parameters such as body&#xD;
      temperature during the cooling therapy, and will be tracked for neurological outcomes&#xD;
      following treatment.&#xD;

             ventricular tachycardia, pulseless electrical activity, or asystole.&#xD;

          -  Estimated or known age &gt; 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intubation, ventilation and placement of esophageal probe.&#xD;
