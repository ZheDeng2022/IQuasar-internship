  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of the drug perifosine for patients who have no standard treatment options.&#xD;
      This study is designed to identify which cancer types respond to perifosine, and determine&#xD;
      which regimen of perifosine is most effective in each one. Patients with either solid tumors&#xD;
      or with lymphomas for whom this protocol represents reasonable or optimal treatment will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either perifosine 100 mg daily or 900 mg weekly until disease&#xD;
      progression. Based on currently available data it is anticipated that these doses should be&#xD;
      easily tolerated by most patients.&#xD;

      This is an exploratory phase IIA trial with unique elements of design and patient selection&#xD;
      with an aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify responsive tumor types that were not predicted from preclinical and Phase I&#xD;
           studies,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if tumors are more likely to stabilize than shrink, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify a dose with almost no toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether response (or stabilization) can be observed on either a daily or&#xD;
           weekly schedule, or both. Since the efficacy goal of the study is to look for any&#xD;
           evidence of activity with perifosine, the daily and weekly arms will be combined when&#xD;
           assessing response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Response to therapy will be based on either tumor regression (objective response,&#xD;
           partial or complete) OR stabilization of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not anticipated that this study will provide &quot;proof of principle&quot; regarding the use of&#xD;
      perifosine or serve as a pivotal trial for regulatory purposes. Information obtained from&#xD;
      this study will be used to design additional trials that will be more definitive in nature.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of either a&#xD;
             lymphoma or solid tumor for which there is no established therapy that, in the opinion&#xD;
             of the treating physician, will prolong the patient's survival or have a larger net&#xD;
             effect on the patient's quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The physician must believe that the patient's course and the growth rate of the tumor&#xD;
             are such that the patient would feel comfortable continuing treatment for at least 12&#xD;
             weeks even if there were a transient period of modest tumor growth (defined as less&#xD;
             than 30%) during the first weeks following the initiation of perifosine treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a life expectancy of more than 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be eligible for any other available perifosine study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In general, patients should have received no more than two prior cytotoxic&#xD;
             chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have measurable or non-measurable disease. If the outcome for a patient&#xD;
             is to be based on response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)&#xD;
             criteria, the patient must have at least one measurable lesion that can be accurately&#xD;
             measured in at least one dimension and fit one of the following criteria: longest&#xD;
             diameter &gt;= 20 mm using conventional techniques or &gt;= 10 mm with spiral computed&#xD;
             tomography (CT) scan. The dimensions of all target lesions that will be used to&#xD;
             determine objective response along with the date of last measurement and the method of&#xD;
             measurement (e.g. physical examination, spiral CT, conventional CT) must be recorded&#xD;
             on the enrollment form prior to the patient's first treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the outcome for a patient is to be based on an increase in time to progression, the&#xD;
             following will apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The time to progression on the systemic treatment administered just prior to&#xD;
                  enrollment in this trial must be carefully documented and should be 12 weeks or&#xD;
                  more.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  There must have been a baseline tumor evaluation in which all sites of likely&#xD;
                  metastases, based on signs and symptoms, were evaluated at the beginning of this&#xD;
                  pre-protocol baseline time interval. (A total body CT scan or magnetic resonance&#xD;
                  imaging [MRI] will usually suffice but are not required to meet this criterion).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  During the 12+ weeks in which the patient was progression-free, there must have&#xD;
                  been no symptoms or signs of new metastases that warranted an evaluation,&#xD;
                  undertaken or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Progression of prior metastases or the appearance of new metastases must be&#xD;
                  documented at the end of the progression-free 12+ week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  This prior progression-free interval must be recorded on the enrollment case&#xD;
                  report form prior to the patient's first treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should have a performance status of 0 to 1 according to the ECOG criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function. Adequate organ and marrow&#xD;
             function are described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  hematocrit (HCT) &gt;= 28% (with or without growth factor support)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine &lt;= 2.5 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin &lt;= 1.5x upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  transaminase &lt;= 2.5x upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recovered from acute toxicity related to prior therapy including&#xD;
             surgery or radiotherapy, excluding alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with breast cancer or prostate cancer who discontinue endocrine therapy prior&#xD;
             to entry into this study must wait for a minimum of 1 month and then be reassessed for&#xD;
             a withdrawal response prior to starting perifosine. However, it is not a requirement&#xD;
             that endocrine therapies be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to ingest oral medications or to obtain them through a&#xD;
             gastrostomy tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written&#xD;
             informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Rapidly progressing disease, as defined by progression within 12 weeks of initiation&#xD;
             of the previous regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any other investigational agents or devices&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have recently (within 8 weeks) begun a new cancer treatment (e.g.,&#xD;
             bisphosphonates) that will be continued concomitantly with perifosine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to perifosine (miltefosine or edelfosine)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection and psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from&#xD;
             the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with perifosine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of unstable or newly diagnosed angina pectoris, recent&#xD;
             myocardial infarction (within 6 months of enrollment), or New York Heart Association&#xD;
             class II-IV congestive heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients who are pregnant or lactating are ineligible.&#xD;
