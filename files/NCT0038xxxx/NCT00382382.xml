    <textblock>
      Using a new and more detailed approach to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) recently developed&#xD;
      in our lab, the investigators hope to learn more about irregularities in the brain that are&#xD;
      related to autism. The investigators are especially interested in brain regions that&#xD;
      contribute to repetitive behaviors in children with autism. Repetitive behaviors include&#xD;
      stereotyped motor movements (hand-flapping), self-injurious behaviors (head hitting),&#xD;
      compulsions (lining up toys), insistence on things staying the same, and difficulty with&#xD;
      change. These behaviors often interfere with learning, can disrupt daily functioning, and can&#xD;
      lead to other behavioral problems. Two specific aims will be accomplished:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To examine the integrity of white matter pathways in high functioning autistic&#xD;
      children. The investigators hypothesize that autism is associated with specific white matter&#xD;
      abnormalities in the cerebellum and other motor circuits. Additionally, the investigators&#xD;
      expect to confirm and expand on previous reports of cerebral abnormalities by using newly&#xD;
      developed DTI methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine whether there is a relationship between white matter abnormalities and&#xD;
      the occurrence of restricted repetitive behaviors in children with autism. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that differences in the occurrence and type of restricted repetitive behaviors&#xD;
      between autistic individuals are correlated with specific regional white matter&#xD;
      abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from the proposed experiments should contribute to current knowledge of brain&#xD;
      abnormalities in autism and their relationship to restricted repetitive behaviors, and may be&#xD;
      relevant to understanding the mechanisms underlying motor deficits in this disorder.&#xD;

      Using a new and more detailed approach to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) recently developed&#xD;
      in our lab, the investigators aim to confirm and expand upon previous findings of white&#xD;
      matter abnormalities throughout the brain in individuals with autism. The investigators have&#xD;
      chosen to focus particularly on cerebellar and motor pathways in consideration of the&#xD;
      prevalence of motor deficits in autism as well as brain structural studies that have&#xD;
      indicated cerebellar abnormalities in autistic children. Finally, a proposal to investigate a&#xD;
      possible functional association between white matter structure and the expression of&#xD;
      restricted repetitive behaviors in autistic children, by correlating measures of white matter&#xD;
      integrity with behavioral assessments indicating the severity of various forms of restricted&#xD;
      repetitive behaviors. Two specific aims will be accomplished. Aim 1: To examine the integrity&#xD;
      of white matter pathways in high functioning autistic children. The hypothesis is that autism&#xD;
      is associated with specific white matter abnormalities in the cerebellum and other motor&#xD;
      circuits. Additionally, it is expect to confirm and expand on previous reports of cerebral&#xD;
      abnormalities by using newly developed DTI methods. Aim 2: To determine whether there is a&#xD;
      relationship between white matter abnormalities and the occurrence of restricted repetitive&#xD;
      behaviors in children with autism. The hypothesis is that differences in the occurrence and&#xD;
      type of restricted repetitive behaviors between autistic individuals are correlated with&#xD;
      specific regional white matter abnormalities. Results from the proposed experiments should&#xD;
      contribute to current knowledge of brain abnormalities in autism and their relationship to&#xD;
      restricted repetitive behaviors, and may be relevant to understanding the mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying motor deficits in this disorder.&#xD;
