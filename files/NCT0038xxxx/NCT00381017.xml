  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3b, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multi-center, multi-national&#xD;
      study of low-dose maintenance Peg interferon alpha-2b (Peg-Intron®) in subjects with human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus-hepatitis C virus (HIV-HCV) co-infection. The primary objective is to&#xD;
      compare at end of study the efficacy of Peg-Intron® monotherapy (0.5 µg/kg subcutaneously&#xD;
      once weekly for 24-36 months) versus standard supportive care, using the time to any of the&#xD;
      following clinical events (death, decompensation, liver transplant, hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      [HCC]) as endpoints.&#xD;
