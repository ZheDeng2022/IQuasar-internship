    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn whether ondansetron is safe and effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of alcohol dependence. We also want to learn whether the study drug ondansetron&#xD;
      combined with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy will assist researchers to determine whether&#xD;
      having a certain gene is responsible for determining how a person benefits or does not&#xD;
      benefit from the use of ondansetron for alcohol dependence.&#xD;

      This is a 13 week outpatient clinical trial. Participants will either receive ondansetron or&#xD;
      placebo and behavioral therapy. There is a 1, 2, and 3 month post-study follow up&#xD;
      visit.Screening for this study is initially done over the telephone and takes 15-20 minutes.&#xD;
      If participants are eligible after the initial screen, they will be invited to come in for a&#xD;
      more thorough in house screen which takes about 5 to 6 hours. The screening will include a&#xD;
      physical exam, review of medical, alcohol and drug histories and blood collection. If&#xD;
      participants are found to be eligible after the in house screen, they will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      13 week outpatient clinical trial.&#xD;
