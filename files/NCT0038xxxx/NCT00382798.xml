    <textblock>
      This is an adaptive Phase I study to evaluate RO5024048 in the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy Volunteers (Part 1 - Single Ascending Dose Study) -Enrollment completed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infected patients who have failed interferon therapy&#xD;
           (Part 2- Multiple Ascending Dose Study)-Enrollment Completed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HCV genotype 1-infected patients who are treatment naive, to be dosed in combination&#xD;
           with PEG-IFN and RBV (Part 3 - Combination Dose Study)-Currently Enrolling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HCV genotype 2-3 infected patients who have previously been treated with interferon but&#xD;
           who did not respond, to be dosed in combination with PEG-IFN and RBV (Part 3 -&#xD;
           Combination Dose Study)- Currently enrolling&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to determine if RO5024048 is safe and well-tolerated in healthy people and in&#xD;
      people infected with hepatitis C virus. The amount of RO5024048 in the blood will be measured&#xD;
      during the study and the amount of hepatitis C virus in the blood after each dose will also&#xD;
      be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Part 3 of the study, RO5024048 will be given with PEG-IFN and RBV, two drugs currently&#xD;
      used and approved for the treatment of HCV.&#xD;

      Part 3: During Part 3 of the study, HCV gentoype 1-infected patients who are treatment-naive&#xD;
      (have not been treated for HCV) will be enrolled. Up to 75 patients (3 groups of 25) will be&#xD;
      dosed for 28 days with RO5024048, PEG-IFN, and RBV. The first dose of RO5024048 to be given&#xD;
      in Part 3 will be 500 mg BID, the second dose will be 1500 mg BID, and the third group will&#xD;
      be 1000 mg BID. Standard doses of PEG-IFN and RBV will be used during Part 3. Doses of&#xD;
      PEG-IFN and RBV will be modified if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An 4th group of 25 HCV genotype 2 or 3-infected patients who have been previously treated&#xD;
      with interferon but who did not respond will also be enrolle in part 3. The dose given to&#xD;
      this 4th group will be 1500 mg BID, in combination with standard doses of PEG-IFN and RBV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following 28 days of combination dosing with RO5024048, PEG-IFN, and RBV, patients will be&#xD;
      dosed an additional 28 days (through Day 56 of the study) with just PEG-IFN, and RBV. After&#xD;
      completing 56 days under this study, patients who participate in Part 3 will be optionally&#xD;
      enrolled into a standard of care protocol with PEG-IFN and RBV, to be conducted by Roche.&#xD;
      Patients who opt to enroll into the standard of care protocol will be given up to 40 weeks of&#xD;
      PEG-IFN and RBV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective for Part 3 is to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of RO5024048 in treatment-naive HCV Genotype 1-infected patients, and in non-responder HCV&#xD;
      Genotype 2/3-infected patients, after once or twice daily dosing in combination wtih PEG-IFN&#xD;
      and RBV for 28 days on an outpatient basis. The secondary objective of Part 3 (COMBO) is to&#xD;
      evaluate the short-term decrease in viral load in treatment-naive HCV Genotype 1-infected&#xD;
      patients, and in non-responder HCV Genotype 2/3-infected patients, after once or twice daily&#xD;
      dosing of RO5024048 in combination with PEG-IFN and RBV for 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 (closed for enrollment): Single ascending dose study&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Part 1, 5 escalating single oral doses of RO5024048 or placebo were given to 40&#xD;
      healthy volunteers, when fasted (have not eaten any food for at least 10 hours). The doses&#xD;
      given were 500 mg, 1500 mg, 4500 mg, 6000 mg, and 9000 mg. Another group of 6 volunteers was&#xD;
      given 1500 mg with food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of Part 1 was to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (amount of drug in the blood) of RO5024048 under fasting conditions. The secondary objective&#xD;
      of Part 1 was to explore the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of RO5024048.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: (Closed for enrollment) Multiple ascending dose study&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Part 2 of the study, 40 HCV-genotype 1-infected patients were given multiple-ascending&#xD;
      oral doses of RO5024048 or placebo for 14 days. The doses given were 750 mg once daily, 1500&#xD;
      mg once daily, 750 mg twice daily, and 1500 mg twice daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of Part 2 was to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of RO5024048 in HCV Genotype 1-infected patients after daily or twice daily dosing for 14&#xD;
      days. The secondary objective was to evaluate the decrease in viral load in HCV Genotype&#xD;
      1-infected patients after daily or twice daily dosing of RO5024048 for 14 days&#xD;
