      The purpose of the study is to determine if short term (6 months) treatment with statins to&#xD;
      lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in vascular disease patients with carotid plaque will be&#xD;
      associated with a measurable reduction in carotid plaque volume using 3 Tesla MRI. The&#xD;
      researchers will correlate the change in plaque volume to degree of LDL lowering. The&#xD;
      researchers will also study if brief treatment will lead to change in plaque composition. The&#xD;
      researchers will compare the change in plaque volume measured by 3T MRI with plaque burden&#xD;
      measured by ultrasound.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atherosclerotic vascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States.&#xD;
      Atherosclerosis develops with increasing plaque burden and eccentric arterial wall expansion&#xD;
      or remodeling, later leading to luminal obstruction. More than 90% of patients with CAD have&#xD;
      carotid plaques. Statins have been shown to cause plaque regression in the carotid and&#xD;
      coronary arteries. However, there is ongoing controversy about how low the target LDL should&#xD;
      be in atherosclerotic patients. The benefits of aggressive LDL lowering with higher statin&#xD;
      doses are counterbalanced by the potential for liver and muscle toxicity. High field (3&#xD;
      Tesla) MRI is a promising new modality for measuring plaque volume with high spatial&#xD;
      resolution. It is not clear whether increasing statin dose will lead to plaque volume&#xD;
      reduction in the short-term (6 months) that can be measured by this new modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to determine if LDL lowering using statins in vascular&#xD;
      disease patients with carotid plaque will be associated with measurable reduction in carotid&#xD;
      plaque volume in the short term (6 months) using 3T MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The four secondary aims of the study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the short term carotid plaque volume change using high field MRI in vascular&#xD;
      disease patients whose statin dose was increased (dose increased) versus those whose statin&#xD;
      dose was maintained (dose maintained).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if increasing statin dose in patients with carotid plaque will lead to&#xD;
      measurable change in carotid plaque composition in the short term (6 months) using 3T MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the carotid plaque volume change using 3T MRI with change in plaque burden score&#xD;
      using carotid ultrasound .&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the relationship between change in plaque volume with change in lipid levels&#xD;
      (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL) and change in inflammatory markers (cytokines, high sensitivity&#xD;
      CRP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is significant because it will provide insight into optimal statin treatment for&#xD;
      atherosclerotic disease. It will also test a new modality for measurement of plaque burden. A&#xD;
      reliable and sensitive test with high spatial resolution that accurately measures change in&#xD;
      plaque volume will be helpful in assessing response to treatment and as a tool for future&#xD;
      clinical trials in assessing efficacy of new treatment modalities that may reduce the need&#xD;
      for expensive, long term studies that rely on clinical events for outcome measurement.&#xD;
