    <textblock>
      Gamma tocopherol (gt) is a naturally occurring form of vitamin E that is found in many foods,&#xD;
      and is also commercially available as a vitamin supplement. The purpose of this Phase 1&#xD;
      research study is to see if two doses of gt, 600mg and 1200mg, are safe (do not cause&#xD;
      gastrointestinal distress or other problems), and can cause changes in your blood levels of&#xD;
      gt and other antioxidants. This study will also examine if there is a difference in response&#xD;
      between asthmatic and non-asthmatic adults when taking the same dose of gt. Phase 1 research&#xD;
      studies like this one are not intended to be a treatment, but are a scientific investigation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is designed as an open label study of the effect of 600 mg and 1200mg gamma tocopherol&#xD;
      (gt), orally administered daily for 8 days, on serum antioxidant levels in asthmatics and&#xD;
      healthy volunteers. Each course of gamma tocopherol will be followed by a 7-8 day wash out&#xD;
      period and serum testing to ensure that blood levels are back to baseline prior to starting&#xD;
      the next course. The gamma tocopherol will be obtained from Yasoo Health Inc and contains&#xD;
      623mg gt per 830 mg gelatin capsule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allergy skin testing to a battery of allergens common to the region will be performed to&#xD;
      determine the state of atopy both prior to drug administration and after the 8 day course.&#xD;
      Allergic volunteers will be asked to abstain from taking any antihistamines during the 3 days&#xD;
      prior to the skin testing. Repeat allergy testing will not be performed on subjects unable to&#xD;
      hold antihistamines for health reasons, or on non-allergic volunteers who demonstrate no&#xD;
      response to baseline testing. Spirometry will be performed to determine the current level of&#xD;
      lung function. Subjects will be asked to refrain from taking vitamin supplements,&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications and other dietary supplements.&#xD;
