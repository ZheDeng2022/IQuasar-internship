  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving radiation therapy&#xD;
      together with bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin works in treating patients with&#xD;
      unresectable stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer at high risk for hemoptysis&#xD;
      caused by bevacizumab. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. It may&#xD;
      also prevent hemoptysis caused by bevacizumab. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab,&#xD;
      can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them.&#xD;
      Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of non-small cell lung cancer by blocking blood flow to&#xD;
      the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Giving radiation therapy together with bevacizumab and chemotherapy may kill more&#xD;
      tumor cells&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the safety of prophylactic chest radiotherapy, bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and&#xD;
      carboplatin in patients with unresectable stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer at high&#xD;
      risk for bevacizumab-associated hemoptysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen. II. Assess the&#xD;
      rate of objective response, overall survival, time to response, and response duration in&#xD;
      irradiated lesions and non-irradiated lesions in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot, multicenter study. Patients are assigned sequentially&#xD;
      to 1 of 2 treatment strata.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratum I: Patients undergo prophylactic radiotherapy on days 1-5 and 8-12. Patients receive&#xD;
      paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 15. Patients also&#xD;
      receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours or carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes and bevacizumab IV&#xD;
      over 30-90 minutes on day 36 (course 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratum II: Patients undergo prophylactic radiotherapy and receive paclitaxel and carboplatin&#xD;
      as in stratum I. Patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 15 (course&#xD;
      1). In both strata, treatment with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab repeats every 21&#xD;
      days for 5-6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients&#xD;
      with complete or partial response or stable disease may continue to receive single-agent&#xD;
      bevacizumab every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
