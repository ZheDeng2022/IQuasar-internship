    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral&#xD;
      ATN-224 plus temozolomide in patients with advanced melanoma. Patients will be randomized&#xD;
      (1:1) between temozolomide and ATN-224 and temozolomide followed by ATN-224. Patients&#xD;
      assigned to the sequential treatment group will receive temozolomide until progression of&#xD;
      disease is documented and then receive ATN-224 as a single agent until documentation of&#xD;
      progression of disease using the last tumor assessment on temozolomide therapy as the&#xD;
      baseline assessment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the National Cancer Institute PDQ database, advanced melanoma is refractory to&#xD;
      most standard systemic therapy, and all newly diagnosed patients should be considered&#xD;
      candidates for clinical trials. Although advanced melanoma is relatively resistant to&#xD;
      therapy, several biologic response modifiers and cytotoxic agents have been reported to&#xD;
      produce objective responses. Once melanoma is metastatic, treatments are palliative rather&#xD;
      than curative. In spite of many attempts at multimodality therapy, the prognosis in this&#xD;
      disease remains poor. Further agents are needed if progress is to be made with melanoma&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATN-224 is an orally active, small molecule that has been shown in cellular and animal models&#xD;
      to be antiangiogenic and to have activity against melanoma cell lines. Clinical studies with&#xD;
      a similar agent (ammonium tetrathiomolybdate) indicate that the agent can be administered&#xD;
      continuously on a daily basis for years in some patients. ATN-224 has the potential to affect&#xD;
      the progression of melanoma by mechanisms that include both antiangiogenic and antitumor&#xD;
      pathways. Temozolomide, a commonly used agent for melanoma, also has a tolerable profile.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with histologically confirmed, advanced cutaneous melanoma. Advanced melanoma&#xD;
             is defined as locally advanced disease that is not amenable to surgery or radiation&#xD;
             therapy and metastatic disease. Patients may have had adjuvant treatment for prior&#xD;
             early disease as long as it was given at least 6 months before the first dose of study&#xD;
             medication, and the treatment did not contain temozolomide or dacarbazine. Previous&#xD;
             treatment for advanced disease is acceptable as long as the patient did not receive&#xD;
             temozolomide or dacarbazine. There is no restriction on the number of prior regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥50%; see&#xD;
             Appendix A)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets ≥100,000/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin ≤2 X institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT) and ALT(SGPT) ≤2 X ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine clearance (measured or calculated) ≥30 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients are allowed to receive erythropoietin or blood transfusions before receiving their&#xD;
        first dose of ATN-224 to bring the hemoglobin level to &gt;9 g/dL to meet eligibility&#xD;
        criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of adequate contraception. Temozolomide has the potential to cause fetal harm. The&#xD;
             effects of ATN 224 on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose&#xD;
             are unknown, but antiangiogenic agents are known to be teratogenic. For these reasons&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential and men with partners of child-bearing potential must&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal and/or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation through&#xD;
             the follow up visit 28 days after the last dose of ATN 224 or temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to forgo taking copper- or zinc-containing vitamins or supplements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uveal (ocular) melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Brain metastasis that has not been treated and remained stable for at least 4 weeks&#xD;
             (In other words, patients are eligible if they have no metastases or if brain&#xD;
             metastases have been treated and remain stable for at least 4 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to ATN-224 or omeprazole&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of malabsorption syndromes or other gastrointestinal disorders that may affect&#xD;
             ATN-224 or temozolomide absorption, including bowel obstruction, celiac disease,&#xD;
             sprue, cystic fibrosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ineligible to receive either temozolomide (Temodar®), omeprazole (Prilosec®),&#xD;
             lansoprazole (Prevacid®), pantoprazole (Protonix®), or ranitidine (Zantac®)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to swallow study medication capsules&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other serious medical or psychiatric illness preventing informed consent or with the&#xD;
             potential to interfere with assessment of safety or efficacy of ATN-224 treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients known to be positive for HIV or infectious hepatitis type A, B or C&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated&#xD;
             basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated&#xD;
             Stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any&#xD;
             other cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for 5 years&#xD;
