  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn whether the inability of certain blood&#xD;
      vessel cells (endothelial cells) to function properly may help researchers to predict who is&#xD;
      at risk for complications after surgery and whether this dysfunction contributes to&#xD;
      complications after surgery. This study will use a blood test to quantify the number of cells&#xD;
      that are destined to become endothelial cells.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A small group of patients (about 12 out of every 100) are at risk of developing&#xD;
      complications, for example lung infection, after their surgery. Researchers do not always&#xD;
      know which patient is at risk or the reason why some patients develop these complications.&#xD;
      Your participation in this study may help researchers to understand who is at risk and also&#xD;
      the mechanism of some of the complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inner layer of cells of blood vessels are called endothelial cells. This layer of cells&#xD;
      plays a vital role in the normal function of blood vessels, including blood clotting and&#xD;
      inflammation. Certain conditions, such as aging, smoking, high cholesterol, and some&#xD;
      chemotherapies cause these cells to not function properly. Researchers can test whether these&#xD;
      cells function properly by doing two simple tests - one is a blood test and the other uses&#xD;
      ultrasound and temperature probes on the finger to look at the ability of arm blood vessels&#xD;
      to dilate (expand).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The way your cells function will be tested within a month before your scheduled chemotherapy&#xD;
      / radiation (if applicable), and again within a month before your major chest surgery. This&#xD;
      will be done on those patients with surgery planned or scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 2 tablespoons of blood will be drawn to measure the number of circulating blood cells&#xD;
      that become endothelial cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During your scheduled surgery, the researcher will also collect just over a teaspoon of blood&#xD;
      at the beginning of the surgery for an additional endothelial risk assessment and a small&#xD;
      sample of lung tissue, if available. Tissue removed during long surgery is usually thrown&#xD;
      away if it is not needed for diagnosis and or treatment purposes. The lung tissue sample&#xD;
      collected for this research study will only be taken from lung tissue that is to be&#xD;
      discarded. The lung tissue will be used to determine the amount of a naturally occurring&#xD;
      substance thought to play a role in recruiting blood cells to repair injured lung tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples (about 2 tablespoons) will also be collected after exercise, during your&#xD;
      surgery, 24 hours after your surgery, and at 5 days after surgery or the time you discharge&#xD;
      from the hospital (which ever is shorter). These blood samples will also be collected at your&#xD;
      routinely schedule post operative clinic visits at 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year after&#xD;
      surgery. The samples will be used to determine the amount of endothelial cells in the blood&#xD;
      stream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For healthy volunteers, blood samples (about 2 tablespoons) will be collected at baseline&#xD;
      (prior to exercising), 15-30 minutes past peak exercise, 3 hours past peak exercise and at 24&#xD;
      hours past past peak exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected on you for 30 days after your surgery, and during the 1 year&#xD;
      follow-up. These data will then be matched with the amount of cell function as measured&#xD;
      before surgery to see if these tests may be used to help predict which patients are at&#xD;
      increased risk for complications. No other measurements will be done and this study will not&#xD;
      change your surgical procedure or lengthen your hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. About 90 patients will take part in this study. All will be&#xD;
      enrolled at The University of Texas (UT) MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC).&#xD;
