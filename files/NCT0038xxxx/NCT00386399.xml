    <textblock>
      Patients will be tested for mutations in the BRCA2 gene. If they have a BRCA2 mutation, they&#xD;
      will be treated with Mitomycin-C as described here. The patients with an identified gene&#xD;
      mutation will also be provided with genetic counseling.&#xD;

      Patients will be tested for mutations in the BRCA2 gene. If they have a BRCA2 mutation, they&#xD;
      will be treated with Mitomycin-C as described here. The patients with an identified gene&#xD;
      mutation will also be provided with genetic counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with BRCA2 gene will be treated with Mitomycin-C (MMC) on Day 1 at a dose of 10mg/m2&#xD;
      intravenously. This will be repeated every 28 days, which is one cycle. Expected adverse&#xD;
      events and appropriate dose modifications are described in this section. Treatment will&#xD;
      continue until disease progression, serious toxicity, patient withdrawal or maximum&#xD;
      cumulative dose of 60 mg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine the 6-month survival of patients with previously untreated advanced or&#xD;
      recurrent adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with BRCA2 mutations that are treated with single&#xD;
      agent Mitomycin-C (MMC) chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the response rate, six-month progression free survival rate,&#xD;
           progression-free survival and survival of patients with previously untreated advanced or&#xD;
           recurrent adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with BRCA2 mutations who are treated with&#xD;
           single agent MMC chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe the toxicity of MMC in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore pharmacogenetic factors that may influence the toxicity and efficacy of MMC&#xD;
           in this patient population.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histological or cytological proven adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Locally advanced unresectable or metastatic disease not amenable to curative&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. No prior treatment for advanced disease. Patient may have received adjuvant treatment&#xD;
             after curative resection. Patients who have received gemcitabine as part of their&#xD;
             adjuvant treatment need to have at least a 6 month progression free interval after&#xD;
             gemcitabine has been discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. BRCA2 deleterious mutation, or genetic variant, suspected deleterious, by DNA testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. No prior treatment with MMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Age â‰¥18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. ECOG PS 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Expected &gt; 12 weeks survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Adequate renal, liver and bone-marrow function as determined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Willingness of male and female subjects, who are not surgically sterile or&#xD;
             post-menopausal, to use reliable methods of birth control (oral contraceptives,&#xD;
             intrauterine devices, or barrier methods) for the duration of the study and for 30&#xD;
             days after the last dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients in whom histologic or cytologic diagnosis is not consistent with&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma including adenosquamous, islet cell, cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma,&#xD;
             carcinoid, small or large cell carcinoma or lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Adenocarcinoma arising from a site other than pancreas (distal common bile duct,&#xD;
             ampulla of vater or periampullary duodenum).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who have had any previous surgery, excluding minor procedures, dental work,&#xD;
             skin biopsy, etc. within 4 weeks of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Uncontrolled medical conditions that could potentially increase the risk of toxicities&#xD;
             or complications of this therapy including immunodeficiency and chronic treatment with&#xD;
             immunosuppressors. Gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an inability to take&#xD;
             oral medication or a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures&#xD;
             affecting absorption, or active peptic ulcer disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Active infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of concurrent malignancy or history of a second malignancy within the past 5&#xD;
             years, except squamous cell and basal cell carcinoma of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Participation in an investigational new drug trial within one month of starting trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Unable to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Concomitant use of phenytoin, carbamazepine, barbiturates, rifampin, phenobarbital or&#xD;
             St. Johns Wort.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Treatment with chemotherapy within 30 days of day 1 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Any unresolved chronic toxicity greater than CTCAE grade 2 from previous anticancer&#xD;
             therapy (except alopecia).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of MMC on the&#xD;
             developing fetus are not known (FDA Pregnancy Category C). Because there is an unknown&#xD;
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with MMC, breast feeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
             the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients must not have clinically significant cardiovascular disease including&#xD;
             myocardial infarction (within 12 months prior to randomization), unstable angina,&#xD;
             grade II or greater peripheral vascular disease, uncontrolled congestive heart failure&#xD;
             or uncontrolled hypertension (SBP&gt;170, DBP&gt;95).&#xD;
