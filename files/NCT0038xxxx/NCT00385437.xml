      This concurrent, two-part study will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I) Using overnight sleep recordings, evaluate the short- and long-term sleep-promoting&#xD;
      effects of the antidepressant mirtazapine (Remeron) in patients who have been prescribed this&#xD;
      medication for major depressive disorder and sleep disruption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II) Investigate the psychomotor performance of depressed patients using driving simulation&#xD;
      testing before and during treatment with mitrazapine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the treatment of depression, the role of sleep is important as there are mutual&#xD;
      relationships between mood disorder and sleep disorders. Over 80% of major depressive&#xD;
      disorder (MDD) patients report sleeping problems. Depression can strongly impair cognitive&#xD;
      functioning and daytime alertness. (Mirtazapine (Remeron) is an antidepressant and&#xD;
      sleep-promoting agent that has been available in Canada for a few years. However, research&#xD;
      investigating the effects of mirtazapine on sleep is limited and it is not known what are the&#xD;
      short- and long-term changes in sleep architecture associated with this drug and if daytime&#xD;
      performance is affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The co-existence of depression and sleep difficulties are very common. Mirtazapine is&#xD;
      marketed as a single modality of treatment for both depression and impaired sleep. As a sleep&#xD;
      clinic in a psychiatry department, a single modality of treatment for depressive and sleep&#xD;
      disorders is preferred by patients and can help improve compliance to treatment. However,&#xD;
      there are only 7 published studies investigating the effects of mirtazapine and sleep and&#xD;
      these have significant limitations. None of these studies have objectively examined&#xD;
      mirtazapine's short- and long-term on sleep architecture and daytime function (daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness, alertness, driving performance) in depressed patients. This study will address&#xD;
      these issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I) Mirtazapine will produce both immediate and long- improvement effects on sleep in patients&#xD;
      with major depressive disorders. There may be impairments in alertness for the first two days&#xD;
      after starting treatment but daytime alertness will recover after one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II) Patients treated with mitrazapine will show a rapid, initial improvement in driving&#xD;
      performance with recovery of sleep and slower, further improvement as treatment of their&#xD;
      depression translates into better sleep quality as well as improvements in attention,&#xD;
      alertness and concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot proposal is a two-part longitudinal, open-label clinical study with consecutive&#xD;
      enrollment of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study will take place in conjunction with normal clinical practice. Patients&#xD;
      with depression and sleep disorders are commonly seen in our sleep clinic and mirtazapine is&#xD;
      one of several antidepressants that is prescribed by our clinicians. In this study, we will&#xD;
      follow a group of patients who have been prescribed mirtazapine by one of our clinic&#xD;
      physicians and who meet the inclusion and exclusion listed below. There will be an additional&#xD;
      number of sleep studies (10 total versus the usual 2 or 3) performed; the usual daytime&#xD;
      testing will be conducted as part of the standard of care (Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT)&#xD;
      and Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT)); we will administer additional questionnaires to&#xD;
      assess subjective sleepiness, alertness and fatigue; and, driving simulator testing will be&#xD;
      conducted in accordance with our normal standard of care.&#xD;
