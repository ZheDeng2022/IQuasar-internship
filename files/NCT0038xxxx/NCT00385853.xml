  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PTK is an investigational new drug that has been shown in early laboratory studies to prevent&#xD;
      the formation of new blood vessels that allow the tumor to grow. These studies have shown&#xD;
      that the study drug can potentially improve the effectiveness of additional radiation and&#xD;
      chemotherapy. With this study, we would like to examine the effects of PTK when used in&#xD;
      combination with radiation therapy and the anti-cancer drug temozolomide, the standard&#xD;
      treatment for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. We would also like to learn how the&#xD;
      study drug is absorbed, distributed, and cleared from the body.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      -  Since we are looking for the highest dose of PTK that can be administered safely without&#xD;
           severe or unmanageable side effects, not everyone who participates will get the same&#xD;
           dose of PTK. A small group will be enrolled onto the study and given a certain dose. If&#xD;
           they tolerate it well, the next small group enrolled will receive a higher dose. This&#xD;
           will continue until the highest dose that can be given without severe or unmanageable&#xD;
           side effects is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive PTK twice daily along with temozolomide daily during each&#xD;
           treatment cycle. Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PTK will start on Day 0 of the first cycle and will be given twice daily for the 7 weeks&#xD;
           the participant receives radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily doses of temozolomide will begin on Day of the first cycle and continue until the&#xD;
           last dose of radiation therapy in cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each participant will receive 7 weeks of radiation therapy. Radiation therapy will start&#xD;
           on Day 5 of the first cycle and will be administered monday through friday, except on&#xD;
           holidays.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When radiation stops, temozolomide and PTK will be given for a maximum of 6&#xD;
           post-radiation cycles of study treatment. During these cycles, PTK and temozolomide will&#xD;
           be given for 5 consecutive days followed by 23 days of no drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests will be performed routinely throughout the study treatment and include; chest&#xD;
           x-rays, blood tests, physical exams, urine tests and ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The following procedures will be performed at the end of the study or after the&#xD;
           participants last dose of study medication; tumor assessment by MRI, routine blood&#xD;
           draws, neurological/physical exam and, medical history review.&#xD;
