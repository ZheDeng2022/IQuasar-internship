      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as decitabine, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of myelodysplastic cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Tretinoin and decitabine may help myelodysplastic cells become more like normal&#xD;
      cells, and to grow and spread more slowly. Giving decitabine together with tretinoin may be&#xD;
      an effective treatment for myelodysplastic syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of tretinoin when&#xD;
      given together with decitabine in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities of decitabine in combination&#xD;
           with tretinoin in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of tretinoin when administered with decitabine in&#xD;
           these patients. (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the clinical remission rate (complete and partial remission) in patients&#xD;
           treated with this regimen. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the rate of hematologic improvement in these patients. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen, in terms of improved bone marrow function, by&#xD;
           monitoring frequency of transfusion, bleeding, and infection, as well as changes in bone&#xD;
           marrow morphology and cytogenetics in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess differentiation by morphology and flow cytometry and apoptosis by flow cytometry&#xD;
           in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if gene expression changes in these patients are induced by this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen, in terms of inducing demethylation of specific&#xD;
           genes, in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate clinical response with gene expression, demethylation of specific genes, and&#xD;
           flow cytometric indicators of differentiation and apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of tretinoin followed by a phase II,&#xD;
      open-label study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I: Patients receive decitabine IV over 1 hour once daily on days 1-5 followed by&#xD;
           oral tretinoin twice daily on days 10-19. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a minimum&#xD;
           of 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or excessive toxicity. Patients who&#xD;
           achieve a partial or complete response after completing 6 courses of treatment may&#xD;
           receive 4 additional courses up to a total of 10 courses. Patients with stable disease&#xD;
           or hematologic improvement are removed from study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tretinoin until the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2&#xD;
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity attributable to tretinoin at any dose level&#xD;
      during course 1. A total of 6 patients are treated at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II: Patients receive decitabine as in phase I and tretinoin at the MTD. Patients&#xD;
           undergo blood and bone marrow collection periodically during study for correlative&#xD;
           demethylation and gene profiling studies and for evidence of differentiation and&#xD;
           apoptosis. Samples are examined by flow cytometry, cytogenetics, histochemistry, and&#xD;
           array-based whole genome methylation analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
