      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AR-67 (formerly DB-67) represents a rationally engineered drug that possesses improved&#xD;
      stability, toxicity, and efficacy compared to current Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA)-approved camptothecins, based on the extensive research of prior studies. Therefore,&#xD;
      the investigators hypothesize that AR-67 (formerly DB-67) will be well-tolerated and&#xD;
      efficacious in phase I clinical trials. This initial phase I trial will establish the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose in humans, establish the toxicity profile, and define the appropriate dose of&#xD;
      AR-67 (formerly DB-67) for future phase II and III clinical trials.&#xD;

      Overview of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Camptothecins are a potent class of anticancer drugs that inhibit DNA topoisomerase I.&#xD;
      Topotecan and irinotecan are two FDA approved second generation congeners currently in&#xD;
      clinical use, and have a spectrum of activity which includes colorectal, ovarian, and lung&#xD;
      cancers. Unfortunately, these drugs are hampered by a labile α-hydroxy-δ-lactone&#xD;
      pharmacophore, which hydrolyzes to yield the inactive carboxylate form of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AR-67 (formerly DB-67) (7-t-butyldimethylsilyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin) is a third generation&#xD;
      analog engineered to be blood stable and highly potent. Its enhanced stability results from&#xD;
      two factors: (1) AR-67 (formerly DB-67) is highly lipophilic, partitioning into lipid&#xD;
      bilayers, thus protecting it from hydrolysis in the aqueous milieu of the bloodstream, and&#xD;
      (2) the 10-hydroxy functionality of the drug effectively ablates the high affinity&#xD;
      interactions of the carboxylate drug form with albumin, which has been previously shown to&#xD;
      diminish the levels of the active lactone species in the circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of its stability and activity, AR-67 (formerly DB-67) was selected by the&#xD;
      National Cancer Institute (NCI) for development in the first cycle of the Rapid Access to&#xD;
      Intervention Development (RAID) program. Data from cycle I, as well as independent data from&#xD;
      collaborative efforts, revealed impressive in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity,&#xD;
      particularly in an intracranial glioma model system. Through the continued support of the&#xD;
      RAID program, the drug has been extensively studied in mice, rats and beagle dogs and the&#xD;
      pre-clinical MTD has been determined. After extensive investigation of various formulations,&#xD;
      a Cremophor:ethanol compound has been identified as the most appropriate for the phase I&#xD;
      study in humans and the GMP grade drug product has been refined and completed. This protocol&#xD;
      describes the initial phase I study in humans using AR-67 (formerly DB-67).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the MTD and describe the DLT of intravenous AR-67 (formerly DB-67)&#xD;
           administered once daily for 5 days every 21 days to adults with recurrent or refractory&#xD;
           solid tumors in which standard therapies are not effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the plasma pharmacokinetics of AR-67 (formerly DB-67) and its&#xD;
           metabolites after intravenous administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the pharmacogenetic effects of polymorphisms in drug metabolism and transport&#xD;
           mediated by liver enzymes and by efflux or uptake proteins, respectively, and relate&#xD;
           these polymorphisms to AR-67 (formerly DB-67) pharmacokinetics and toxicity.&#xD;
