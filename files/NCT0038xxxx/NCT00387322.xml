      RATIONALE: Pemetrexed disodium and erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking&#xD;
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving pemetrexed disodium together with&#xD;
      erlotinib may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of two different&#xD;
      schedules of pemetrexed disodium and erlotinib and to see how well they work in treating&#xD;
      patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer or other solid tumors.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety and feasibility of combining pemetrexed disodium with erlotinib&#xD;
           hydrochloride in patients with advanced non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) or other solid&#xD;
           tumors. (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the response rate in patients with NSCLC treated with pemetrexed disodium in&#xD;
           combination with erlotinib hydrochloride. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare toxicity differences between different schedules of pemetrexed disodium and&#xD;
           erlotinib hydrochloride. (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 2 different schedules of pemetrexed&#xD;
           disodium and erlotinib hydrochloride. (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of the combination of pemetrexed disodium and&#xD;
           erlotinib hydrochloride in patients with advanced solid tumors. (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the overall survival and progression-free survival. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with the administration of&#xD;
           pemetrexed disodium and erlotinib hydrochloride. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I dose-escalation study followed by a phase II&#xD;
      open-label study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups in an alternating fashion.&#xD;
           Once accrual to the first dose level in group 1 is complete, group 2 will open for&#xD;
           accrual to its first dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group 1: Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once on days 2, 9, and 16&#xD;
                and pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21&#xD;
                days for 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group 2: Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily on days 2-16 and&#xD;
                pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days&#xD;
                for 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, patients may continue to receive erlotinib hydrochloride alone after&#xD;
      completion of 6 courses of erlotinib hydrochloride in combination with pemetrexed disodium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib hydrochloride&#xD;
      and pemetrexed disodium until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is&#xD;
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium at the MTD and erlotinib hydrochloride at&#xD;
           the MTD as in group 1 or 2 (whichever is more favorable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 92 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the phase I portion of the study patients must have cytologically or&#xD;
             histologically proven advanced solid tumors for which there is no standard effective&#xD;
             therapy available. For the phase II portion patients must have cytologically or&#xD;
             histologically proven selected stage IIIB (pleural effusion) or IV NSCLC. Patients&#xD;
             with NSCLC that have progressed or recurred after first-line therapy for stage IIIA or&#xD;
             IIIB may also be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the phase II portion patients must have disease that has progressed or recurred&#xD;
             after treatment with platinum-based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any number of prior chemotherapy regimens are allowed for the phase I portion and no&#xD;
             more than 1 previous treatment for advanced NSCLC is allowed for the phase II portion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease by RECIST criteria. Disease in previously&#xD;
             irradiated sites is considered measurable if there is clear disease progression&#xD;
             following radiation therapy. Patients with evaluable disease (bone metastases, pleural&#xD;
             fluid, ascites, etc.) may be included in the phase I portion of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a performance status of 0-2 for phase I portion of study and a&#xD;
             performance status of 0 -1 for the phase II portion of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an estimated survival of at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any prior chemotherapy that patients have received has to have been completed at least&#xD;
             4 weeks prior to start of treatment. For prior mitomycin chemotherapy a 6-week&#xD;
             interval is required. Prior radiation must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior&#xD;
             to start of therapy. Patients must have recovered from acute reversible side effects&#xD;
             of prior chemotherapy regimens or radiotherapy to NCI-CTC &lt; grade 1 (excluding&#xD;
             alopecia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate renal function as documented by a serum creatinine &lt; 1.5&#xD;
             mg/dl or a calculated creatinine clearance of &gt; 45 ml/min (see appendix for formula&#xD;
             for calculating creatinine clearance).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate liver function as documented by serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x&#xD;
             ULN. AST must be &lt; 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a pretreatment granulocyte count of &gt;1500/mm3 and platelet count of&#xD;
             &gt;100 000/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with asymptomatic treated brain metastasis (surgical resection or&#xD;
             radiotherapy) may be included if they are neurologically stable and have been off&#xD;
             steroids and anticonvulsants for at least 4 weeks. Because of the possibility of&#xD;
             treatment related neurological toxicity it is difficult to evaluate for toxicity in&#xD;
             the presence of symptomatic brain metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must give voluntary written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to take and retain oral medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients of reproductive potential must agree to use effective contraceptive method&#xD;
             while on treatment and for 3 months afterwards as the effects of these drugs on the&#xD;
             unborn fetus are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on coumadin should have their INR monitored at least once per week or more&#xD;
             frequently depending on the investigators judgement. There have been some case reports&#xD;
             of increased INR when coumadin is co-administered with OSI-774/placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have previously received Pemetrexed or an EGFR-directed therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females can not be pregnant or breastfeeding as the effects of these drugs on the&#xD;
             unborn fetus are unknown. Documentation of a negative serum pregnancy test is required&#xD;
             for all women of reproductive potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with symptomatic brain metastasis or still requiring steroids and&#xD;
             anti-convulsants may not be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed for the phase II portion except for the&#xD;
             following: adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ&#xD;
             cervical cancer, adequately treated stage I or II cancer from which the patient is&#xD;
             currently in complete remission, or any other cancer from which the patient has been&#xD;
             disease-free for over five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients cannot take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDS) or salicylates 2&#xD;
             days prior and 2 days following (5 days pre and post for long-acting NSAIDS)&#xD;
             administration of pemetrexed due to concerns of increased risk of renal toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically significant ophthalmologic abnormalities will be excluded.&#xD;
             This includes severe dry eye syndrome, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, Sjogren's syndrome,&#xD;
             severe exposure keratopathy, or other disorders that might increase the risk of&#xD;
             corneal epithelial injury.&#xD;
