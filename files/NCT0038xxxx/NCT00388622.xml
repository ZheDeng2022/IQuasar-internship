  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this randomized, clinical trial are to develop and test a multileveled&#xD;
      pharmacy-based program to improve the care of patients with heart failure. Risk factors for&#xD;
      deterioration of heart failure will be determined including poor adherence to medication.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medications improve the function and health-related quality of life of patients with heart&#xD;
      failure and reduce morbidity, mortality, and the costs of patient care. Due to their&#xD;
      complicated medication regimens, however, older adults with heart failure require assistance&#xD;
      with their medications to facilitate adherence and improve their health outcomes. Recent&#xD;
      studies suggest that the outcomes of patients with heart failure improve when pharmacists&#xD;
      provide patients with education and monitoring. This study aims to develop and test, as a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial, a multileveled pharmacy-based program that incorporates patient&#xD;
      education materials and medication packaging that target patients with low health literacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elderly patients from Wishard Health Services with a diagnosis of heart failure (n=314) were&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the pharmacist intervention or usual care group. Patients in the&#xD;
      intervention group received verbal and written education, icon-based labeling of their&#xD;
      medication containers, and therapeutic monitoring. A main objective of the pharmacist was to&#xD;
      reinforce primary care providers' instructions to the patient. The pharmacist educated&#xD;
      patients about their medications, identified barriers to appropriate drug use, coached&#xD;
      patients on overcoming drug use barriers, and coordinated drug use for these patients with&#xD;
      primary care providers. Patients in the usual care (control) group did not receive the&#xD;
      intervention and also served as a prospective cohort to identify the determinants of acute&#xD;
      exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure medication compliance objectively, electronic monitor lids were used on all heart&#xD;
      failure medications for patients in intervention and control groups. These lids contain a&#xD;
      computer chip that electronically imprints a time/date stamp when opened and closed. Each&#xD;
      open-close event indicates that the patient has taken a dose of their medication. By&#xD;
      downloading this information from the medication container lid to a computer, we can&#xD;
      objectively assess the pattern of medication compliance. Study participation for the patients&#xD;
      in the intervention group concluded after nine months of active intervention and three months&#xD;
      of post-intervention follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usual care group permitted our identification of the causes for clinical deterioration in&#xD;
      patients with heart failure. The unique electronic medical record at our institution, the&#xD;
      Regenstrief Medical Record System, permits capture of a wealth of clinical data, which can be&#xD;
      merged with primary data from the trial (for example, medication adherence by MEMS caps,&#xD;
      brain natriuretic peptide, and quality of life assessments). Patients' data captured from the&#xD;
      Regenstrief Medical Record System during the year of follow-up were used to perform&#xD;
      multivariate analyses to determine causes of clinical deterioration. So doing provided&#xD;
      insights into the pathophysiology of decompensation in patients with heart failure to enhance&#xD;
      our understanding of risk factors of this increasingly prevalent disease and thereby lead us&#xD;
      to better therapeutic strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covariates used in our analyses of risk factors included age, sex, race, weight, ejection&#xD;
      fraction, brain natriuretic peptide and other renal autacoids, and New York Heart Association&#xD;
      classification. Endpoints include health-related quality of life, heart failure exacerbation,&#xD;
      patient satisfaction, and healthcare costs. We evaluated the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      pharmacy-based program in improving adherence to heart failure medications, improving&#xD;
      health-related quality of life, decreasing heart failure exacerbations, increasing patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, and decreasing health care costs. Once identified, factors predicting&#xD;
      decompensation of heart failure may become the targets of future interventions aimed at&#xD;
      preventable causes.&#xD;
