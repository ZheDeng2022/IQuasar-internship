&#xD;
          -  Histologic diagnosis of malignant pleural mesothelioma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not candidates for curative surgery. Patients will be clinically staged using the IMIG&#xD;
             TNM staging criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not receive prior systemic chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable lesions, which are diagnosed by CT, or MRI scan within&#xD;
             28 days before administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  More than 20 years and less than 75 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG Performance status score: 0 - 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiation therapy is allowed to &lt; 25% of the bone marrow. Prior radiotherapy&#xD;
             must be completed at least 21 days before study enrollment, and the patients must have&#xD;
             recovered from the toxic effects of the treatment prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior surgeries must be completed at least 21 days before study enrollment, and the&#xD;
             patients must have recovered from the effects of the operation.However, regarding&#xD;
             examination of thoracotomy or celiotomy, etc. if the investigator or sub-investigator&#xD;
             judges that there are no influences of surgery and no problems for participation of&#xD;
             patients in this study, e.g. safety security, there should be at least 14 days from&#xD;
             the surgery day to patient registration date&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have adequate organ function Hemoglobin: no less than 9g/dl, Absolute&#xD;
             neutrophil count: no less than 2,000/mm3, Platelet count: no less than&#xD;
             100,000/mm3,Serum albumin: no less than 2.5g/dL,AST (GOT) and ALT (GPT): no more than&#xD;
             2.5 x the upper limit of reference values at each site (no more than 5 x the upper&#xD;
             limit of reference values at each site is acceptable if liver has tumor involvement),&#xD;
             Total bilirubin: no more than 1.5 x the upper limit of reference values at each&#xD;
             site,Serum creatinine: no more than the upper limit of reference values at each site,&#xD;
             SpO2: no less than 92%, ECG: normal (In the case of the ECG was marked abnormal&#xD;
             waveshape, when the investigator or sub-investigator judges that there is no safety&#xD;
             issue for the patient, administration can be done), 24hr-creatinine clearance or&#xD;
             calculated creatinine clearance: no less than 45mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Estimated life expectancy of at least 90 days from the registration date&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be hospitalized from the start of the first cycle until the start of the&#xD;
             second cycle of the combination therapy, in principle (Only in case investigator or&#xD;
             sub-investigator judges that there are no safety issues, patients can receive the&#xD;
             therapy as outpatients from the middle of Cycle 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female patients with reproductive potential must use an approved&#xD;
             contraceptive method if appropriate (eg, intrauterine device [IUD], birth control&#xD;
             pills, or barrier device) during and for 90 days after study therapy. Females with&#xD;
             childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7&#xD;
             days prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
