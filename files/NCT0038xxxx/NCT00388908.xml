    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is a common and progressive condition that leads to broken bones (fractures),&#xD;
      which cause pain, disability, deformity, and even death. There are new treatments available&#xD;
      that can decrease the risk of a fracture by 50%, and the people who benefit the most are&#xD;
      those with osteoporosis who have already had a fracture, like a vertebral (spine) fracture.&#xD;
      Vertebral fractures are usually &quot;silent,&quot; and ~20% of people over the age of 60 years have&#xD;
      had one although they don't know it. Many of these people have had chest x-rays done for&#xD;
      other reasons, and these x-rays can incidentally detect these silent fractures. Although most&#xD;
      people with a vertebral fracture should be tested and treated for osteoporosis, studies&#xD;
      demonstrate that less than one-quarter of older people with a vertebral fracture are ever&#xD;
      investigated or even treated. This reflects a gap between evidence-based best practice and&#xD;
      everyday practice in the community. The proposed research addresses this care-gap by using a&#xD;
      quality improvement intervention that uses chest x-rays done in the Emergency Department to&#xD;
      remind family physicians about osteoporosis while providing them with evidence-based&#xD;
      treatment guidelines - with or without educating and empowering patients about osteoporosis.&#xD;
      The effectiveness of this intervention will be compared to usual care in a controlled trial.&#xD;
      The intent of this research is to improve quality of care for patients at high risk of&#xD;
      fracture, by increasing rates of testing and treatment of osteoporosis.&#xD;

      Objective: To improve the quality of care for elderly patients with osteoporosis and&#xD;
      vertebral fractures incidentally detected by a chest radiograph in the Emergency Department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Osteoporosis leads to decreased bone mass, skeletal fragility, and fractures.&#xD;
      Osteoporosis affects at least 1.4 million Canadians, 25% of women and 12% of men &gt;60 years of&#xD;
      age. The most common osteoporotic fractures are vertebral (spinal), two-thirds of which are&#xD;
      asymptomatic. Irrespective of symptoms, these &quot;silent&quot; fractures cause disability, deformity,&#xD;
      and death. Compared to those with normal bones and no fracture, the patient with osteoporosis&#xD;
      and vertebral fracture has a 20-fold increased risk of future fracture. Guidelines recommend&#xD;
      aggressive treatment because rate of re-fracture is 20% within 1 year and treatment reduces&#xD;
      risk by 40-50%. Guidelines do not, however, recommend population screening for vertebral&#xD;
      fractures. We reported (Arch Intern Med, 2005) that chest radiographs performed in the&#xD;
      Emergency Department detected &quot;incidental&quot; fractures in 16% of elderly patients, although&#xD;
      only 25% of patients were treated for osteoporosis. The care gap between evidence-based best&#xD;
      practice and usual care needs to be urgently addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The proposed intervention will improve rates of diagnosis and treatment of&#xD;
      osteoporosis in high-risk patients. The intervention will be directed at physicians&#xD;
      (patient-specific reminders and opinion leader generated 1-page guidelines) with or without&#xD;
      patient-activation (leaflets and telephone-based counseling).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: To determine whether exposure to a physician-directed quality improvement&#xD;
      intervention can- Aim #1. Increase rates of osteoporosis treatment in patients with newly&#xD;
      recognized vertebral fracture(s); Aim #2. Increase patients' self-reported diagnosis of&#xD;
      osteoporosis and other related knowledge; Aim #3. Be further augmented by the addition of&#xD;
      patient-activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A single-center prospective nonrandomized controlled trial with blinded&#xD;
      (allocation-concealed) ascertainment of outcomes comparing the proposed&#xD;
      physician-intervention to usual care controls. We define usual care as notification of the&#xD;
      patients' physician of chest radiograph results. Allocation will be on the basis of an&#xD;
      alternate-week time series design, with the proposed intervention &quot;on&quot; for all patients for&#xD;
      one week, followed by the intervention being &quot;off&quot; (i.e., usual care) the next week. After 3&#xD;
      months, controls will be offered the physician-intervention plus patient-activation, with&#xD;
      outcomes recollected 3 months later. Eligible patients will be &gt;60 years of age who present&#xD;
      to the Emergency Department: (1) with a chest radiograph reporting the presence of a&#xD;
      vertebral fracture, (2) are not taking prescription osteoporosis treatment, and (3) are&#xD;
      discharged home. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients starting prescription&#xD;
      osteoporosis treatment within 3 months of fracture recognition; secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      BMD testing and diagnosis of osteoporosis. The intervention is expected to increase the&#xD;
      primary outcome by at least 20% (absolute) over usual care rates of 10%. With alpha=0.05,&#xD;
      beta=0.80, 20% losses-to-followup, and additional power to address secondary outcomes and&#xD;
      effects of patient-activation, the required sample size is 240 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot Data and Feasibility: Our pilot study (AJR, 2004) found institutional true-positive&#xD;
      reporting rates for vertebral fractures were 60%, with 100% specificity, compared with&#xD;
      reference standard. A 1-year feasibility study of a random sample of ~5000 radiographs was&#xD;
      then undertaken (Arch Intern Med, 2005). Based on these data, we expect to enroll 3-4&#xD;
      patients/week, complete recruitment in ~20 months, ascertain outcomes by 30 months, and&#xD;
      finish the study in 3 years. The research team has generated pilot data, systematically&#xD;
      reviewed pertinent literature, recruited opinion leaders to create guidelines, trained&#xD;
      research staff, refined methods for outcomes ascertainment; and conducted related studies of&#xD;
      wrist (Annals Intern Med, 2004) and hip fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: To our knowledge, there are no studies examining strategies to improve care for&#xD;
      this vulnerable and high-risk population, and we believe our results will be important&#xD;
      regardless of findings. If &quot;negative&quot; it will provide evidence that more costly and laborious&#xD;
      interventions will be needed to overcome clinical inertia; if positive, however, our&#xD;
      intervention should be widely applicable. In addition, positive results can be easily&#xD;
      extended to other related populations (e.g., routine chest radiographs done for admission to&#xD;
      nursing homes) and can be adapted for implementation via other modalities (e.g., computerized&#xD;
      decision support, telemedicine).&#xD;
