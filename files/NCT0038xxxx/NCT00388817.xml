  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine whether minority and low-income patients with high&#xD;
      blood pressure take their medications better when they are helped by a pharmacist and&#xD;
      provided with special medication packaging and information aimed at persons with low health&#xD;
      literacy.&#xD;

      Optimal use of medications in patients with hypertension prevents adverse outcomes. When&#xD;
      their blood pressure is carefully controlled, patients with uncomplicated hypertension are&#xD;
      spared primary events including myocardial infarction, stroke, cognitive impairment, and&#xD;
      renal insufficiency. Patients who have already experienced complications are spared the&#xD;
      suffering of subsequent events. Because hypertension is asymptomatic and antihypertensive&#xD;
      drugs have adverse effects, patients often feel better when they are not taking their&#xD;
      medication as opposed to when they carefully adhere to their physician's prescribed regimen.&#xD;
      Therefore, innovative strategies are needed to educate patients and improve patient adherence&#xD;
      to a complicated regimen often involving many drugs. Doing so can to reduce morbidity,&#xD;
      mortality, and the costs of patient care. Minority patients often do not have access to the&#xD;
      resources needed to assist them with their medications and as such they are especially&#xD;
      vulnerable. Recent studies suggest that blood pressure control of patients with hypertension&#xD;
      improves when pharmacists provide patients with education and monitoring. However, studies of&#xD;
      clinical endpoints have not been conducted. This study aims to develop and test, in a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial, a multileveled pharmacy-based program to improve adherence in&#xD;
      minority patients. This program incorporates patient education materials and medication&#xD;
      packaging designed for patients with low-literacy. A study pharmacist accessed a computer&#xD;
      database that is integrated into an electronic medical database called the Regenstrief&#xD;
      Medical Record System (RMRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from Wishard Health Services with uncomplicated or complicated hypertension were&#xD;
      randomly assigned to a pharmacist intervention or usual care group. Patients in the&#xD;
      intervention group received verbal education, written education materials, icon-based&#xD;
      labeling of medication containers, and therapeutic monitoring. The pharmacist educated&#xD;
      patients about their medications, identified barriers to appropriate drug use, coached&#xD;
      patients to overcome drug use barriers, and coordinated drug use for these patients in&#xD;
      conjunction with their primary care providers. Patients in the usual care (control) group did&#xD;
      not receive pharmacist intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To objectively measure medication compliance, Medication Event Monitor System (MEMS) lids&#xD;
      (electronic monitors) were used for all antihypertensive medications. MEMS lids contain a&#xD;
      computer chip that electronically imprints a time/date stamp each time an opening and closure&#xD;
      occurs. Such data reveal the temporal pattern of medication adherence. Data concerning&#xD;
      clinical endpoints, comorbidities, and healthcare costs were extracted from the RMRS. Other&#xD;
      data included blood pressure measurements, health related quality of life, cognitive&#xD;
      function, health literacy, and satisfaction with care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participation for the patients in the intervention group concluded after 12 months of&#xD;
      active intervention, which be followed by six months of post-intervention follow-up. Primary&#xD;
      endpoints included medication adherence and systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes included health-related quality of life, symptoms, patient satisfaction, and direct&#xD;
      healthcare costs.&#xD;
