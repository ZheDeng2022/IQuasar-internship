  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are no solid data on the real advantage of an early start of dialysis, as suggested by&#xD;
      the DOQI guidelines. Uremic patients frequently have a poor nutritional status. However, we&#xD;
      cannot distinguish between the detrimental effect on nutrition of too low a residual renal&#xD;
      function or too long a period of low protein-diet, per se. However, it appears that a&#xD;
      very-low-protein diet (VLPD) supplemented with essential amino acids and keto-analogs of&#xD;
      amino acids, and with an adequate quantity of calories, can prevent hypoalbuminemia at the&#xD;
      start of dialysis and can slow the progression of chronic renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EDTA and USRDS data suggest that most patients starting dialysis nowadays are elderly, who&#xD;
      also have the highest incidence of morbidity and mortality. Moreover, hospitalization rate&#xD;
      becomes higher after the start of dialysis compared to the pre-dialysis period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Can an aminoacid-supplemented VLPD, prolonged beyond the GFR limits suggested by DOQI, offer&#xD;
      elderly patients better survival and better quality of life than dialysis? The answer can&#xD;
      only come from a prospective, randomized trial, in elderly patients, starting at the GFR&#xD;
      values suggested by the NKF-DOQI for starting dialysis, comparing outcomes with a vegetarian&#xD;
      VLPD supplemented with a mixture of keto-analogs of amino acids and essential amino acids,&#xD;
      and with dialysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An adequate dose of dialysis is needed, in order to improve patient outcome, in both&#xD;
      peritoneal dialysis (PD) and extracorporeal dialysis (HD). The debate, however, has renewed&#xD;
      interest in when to start dialysis. The NKF-DOQI group suggested using the amount of solute&#xD;
      clearance for regular dialysis as a value for starting dialysis treatment, i.e. creatinine&#xD;
      clearance 9-14 ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elderly patients on dialysis have a low survival rate.In fact, according to the lombard&#xD;
      Registry(a italian region), patients 70-75 years old survive 2.9/3.6 years (male/female)&#xD;
      after the start of dialysis, those 75-80 years old 2.7/2.7 years, and those 80-85 years old&#xD;
      2.4/1.4 years. This low survival is largely due to the combined effects of aging and&#xD;
      comorbidities, on which an early start of dialysis has no or very limited positive effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the hemodialytic treatment might have more negative effects in the elderly:&#xD;
      intermittent hemodynamic stress, continuous fluctuation of electrolytes, metabolites,&#xD;
      acid-base equilibrium, and the bioincompatibility of the membrane. In PD patients, the&#xD;
      negative effects are also related to episodes of peritonitis and to daily loss of protein and&#xD;
      a higher frequency of malnutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An early start of dialysis should improve survival and well-being, and reduce morbidity. But&#xD;
      a rapid decline of residual renal function (RRF) is observed after the start of dialysis.&#xD;
      Maintenance of RRF as long as possible is very important, because the kidneys do some things&#xD;
      a dialysis membrane cannot do: tubular and endocrine function, larger clearances of middle&#xD;
      molecules, some of them potentially toxic such as parathyroid hormone, granulocyte inhibitory&#xD;
      protein, and substances inducing anorexia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a prospective study on CAPD patients, for every increase of 1 ml/min of GFR, the relative&#xD;
      risk (RR) of death decreased 50%. In the CanUsa study, using the time-dependent Cox&#xD;
      multivariate analysis, a 5% reduction in RR of death was observed for each 5L/week of&#xD;
      residual renal GFR at baseline (7). These results suggest that, at least in elderly patients,&#xD;
      the fast decline of GFR observed after the start of dialysis could be another cause of the&#xD;
      low survival rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our center, 42 elderly patients started a very-low-protein diet (VLPD: 0.3 g of protein/kg&#xD;
      body weight), supplemented with a mixture of keto acids and amino acids when their creatinine&#xD;
      clearance reached values usually considered as a parameter for starting dialysis. The&#xD;
      survival of this group of patients was compared with that of 71 patients directly put onto&#xD;
      dialysis with the same creatinine clearance at which we started the VLPD. Subsequently, 24&#xD;
      patients in the diet group started dialysis when their mean GFR was 3.9 ml/min, i.e. lower&#xD;
      than the 7 ml/min usually considered adequate in PD patients and much lower than 9-14 ml/min&#xD;
      suggested by the NKF-DOQI group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this retrospective, non-randomized study, survival was better in the patients treated with&#xD;
      diet than patients with dialysis. This seems to bear out that RRF does more than a dialytic&#xD;
      membrane and must be preserved as long as possible.&#xD;
