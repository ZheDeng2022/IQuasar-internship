  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study offers catheter-based treatment of heart or artery disease. This protocol permits&#xD;
      treatment of patients with cardiovascular diseases who may not be eligible to participate in&#xD;
      current research protocols. The treatment offered in this protocol is not experimental, but&#xD;
      rather standard treatment provided in most large referral hospitals in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older who are candidates for catheter-based treatment of&#xD;
      obstructive artery disease, including blocked blood flow in a coronary artery (artery to the&#xD;
      heart) or in an artery of the arm, leg, brain or kidney may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates are screened with a general medical evaluation that may include blood tests,&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging, and monitoring of heart rate and rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo angioplasty or stenting for blockage in an artery to the heart or an&#xD;
      artery of the arm, leg, brain or kidney. The procedure uses a balloon-tipped catheter to open&#xD;
      the blocked artery and likely requires permanent implantation of a metal tube (stent) to&#xD;
      improve blood flow through the vessel. During the procedure, the patient is given a sedative&#xD;
      and pain medication, if needed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The NHLBI is developing novel minimally invasive catheter-based treatments for cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease. These investigational treatments require that physicians, nurses and technical staff&#xD;
      maintain and expand their technical skills in the conduct of conventional catheter-based&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol permits treatment of patients with cardiovascular diseases who are not&#xD;
      necessarily eligible to participate in existing clinical research protocols, but who are of&#xD;
      medical interest for the purpose of training professional staff, or who may be eligible for&#xD;
      adjunctive investigational imaging during clinical treatment. Efforts will be made to offer&#xD;
      treatment to patients with limited financial resources or with limited access to specialty&#xD;
      health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol also provides a mechanism to offer catheter-based treatment of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease to patients, so that they may participate in technical development protocols in&#xD;
      cardiovascular intervention or in cardiovascular imaging.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adult men and women with cardiovascular disease will be eligible to participate in this&#xD;
        training protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Adult men and women, age 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Eligible for catheter-based treatment. A representative list of diseases and&#xD;
             catheter-based treatments includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Obstructive coronary artery disease manifest as myocardial infarction, angina&#xD;
                  pectoris, angina-equivalent, ischemic dysrhythmia, or evidence of ischemia or&#xD;
                  viability on non-invasive cardiovascular testing&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Obstructive peripheral artery disease manifest as intermittent claudication,&#xD;
                  limb-threatening ischemia, visceral ischemia, or obstructive extracranial&#xD;
                  cerebrovascular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Structural heart disease including patent foramen ovale, atrial septal defect,&#xD;
                  ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, and valvular heart disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects are excluded if catheter-based therapy is unsuitable, in the opinion of the&#xD;
        operating cardiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnant women&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Inability of patient or surrogate to provide informed consent.&#xD;
