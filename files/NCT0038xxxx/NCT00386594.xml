  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Barrett's esophagus with high-grade dysplasia is a premalignant condition caused by chronic&#xD;
      reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus. High-grade dysplasia is the same as&#xD;
      carcinoma-in-situ. If untreated, patients with this condition are at high risk for developing&#xD;
      cancer of the esophagus. Cancer of the esophagus is a miserable disease that is difficult to&#xD;
      treat and about 95% fatal after 5 years. To prevent progession to cancer of the esophagus&#xD;
      several interventions are available and they include surgery, Photofrin photodynamic therapy,&#xD;
      endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic thermal therapy. All of these modalities are&#xD;
      uncomfortable, expensive and have associated risks. The oral agent, 852A stimulates the&#xD;
      innate immune system in such a way as to eliminate early cancer. A similar dermatologic&#xD;
      drug(imiquimod) is approved for treating the premalignant condition, actinic keratosis. If&#xD;
      local therapy with imiquimod can eliminate a premalignant lesion in the skin, a similar&#xD;
      acting drug should be able to do the same for a premalignant lesion in the lining of the&#xD;
      esophagus. This study is designed to test that hypothesis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is to determine if a locally applied immune response modifier will eliminate high&#xD;
      grade dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus. Barrett's esophagus is a premalignant condition&#xD;
      caused by chronic reflux of gastric contents into the lower esophagus. Present practice is to&#xD;
      do a periodic esophagoscopy on patients with Barrett's esophagus and take biopsies in search&#xD;
      of dysplasia. If the pathologist reports low grade dysplasia, the patient usually receives&#xD;
      more intensive surveillance. If the pathologist reports high grade dysplasia, the patient and&#xD;
      his physician are faced with a dilema. High grade dysplasia is carcinoma in situ and there is&#xD;
      a strong propensity for such patients to progess to frank carcinoma of the esophagus.&#xD;
      Carcinoma of the esophagus is a miserable disease which is difficult to treat and leads to&#xD;
      death in about 95% of the cases at 5 years. The present standard for patients with high grade&#xD;
      dysplasia is to recommend esophagectomy. Esophagectomy is a major surgical procedure with&#xD;
      significant associated morbidity and mortality. Porfimer sodium(Photofrin) photodynamic&#xD;
      therapy is effective in eliminating high grade dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus. It has been&#xD;
      approved by the FDA but it is not widely utilized because of its complexity and expense.&#xD;
      Other modalities such as endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic thermal ablation&#xD;
      techiques are being studied. Although endoscopic techniques are much safer than surgery, they&#xD;
      all are uncomfortable and carry some risk. Many patients with Barrett's esophagus are elderly&#xD;
      and most with high grade dysplasia do not live long enough to develop cancer. This fact has&#xD;
      made some gastroenterolgists recommend intensive surveillance as an alternative to the above&#xD;
      mentioned therapeutic modalities. Intensive surveillance in this setting means endoscopy with&#xD;
      biopsies every 3 months with specific therapy recommended only if frank cancer is found. This&#xD;
      study is based upon the fact that intensive surveillance is an acceptable way of following&#xD;
      these patients. The only difference is an oral agent will be added in hopes of getting rid of&#xD;
      high grade dysplasia. If high grade dysplasia could be eliminated by an oral medication it&#xD;
      would be a quantum improvement over what we have. The present belief is if high grade&#xD;
      dysplasia is eliminated there would be no progression to cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      852A is an immune response modifier being developed by 3M Pharmaceuticals. It is thought to&#xD;
      exert its therapeutic effect by simulating alpha interferon. 852A is similar to the immune&#xD;
      response modifier imiquimod(Aldara). Imiquimod is presently approved by the precancerous&#xD;
      dermatological condition, actinic keratosis. It is very effective. Treatment is simply&#xD;
      applying 5% imiquimod cream twice weekly to the skin lesion for 16 weeks. It seems reasonable&#xD;
      that if an immune response modifier will eliminate precancerous lesions of the skin by local&#xD;
      application, the same should be true for precancerous lesions of the esophagus. In this study&#xD;
      852A will be swallowed to see whether it can eliminate high grade dysplasia from the&#xD;
      esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Entrance into the present study would be predicated on the confirmation of high grade&#xD;
      dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus. If the prospective subject meets all of the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria set out in the protocol, endoscopic ultrasound of the esophagus would be&#xD;
      done. If endoscopic ultrasound shows no invasion into the submucosa the patient would be&#xD;
      asked to sign an informed consent. Once entered into the sudy the subject would be given the&#xD;
      study drug twice weekly, 3-4 days apart, for 8 weeks. 852A will be supplied in sterile vials&#xD;
      by 3M Pharmaceuticals. Five mg of 852A will be mixed with sterile 5% dextrose in water to&#xD;
      give a final volume of 30 ml. The patient will promply swallow the study drug after it is&#xD;
      mixed. The subject will then assume a recumbent position for 30 minutes in hopes that the&#xD;
      medication will stay in contact with the mucosa of the esophagus long enough to get an&#xD;
      effect. All doses of the study medication will be given in the principal investigator's&#xD;
      clinic. After the first dose is given that patient will stay in the clinic under observation&#xD;
      for 4 hours. Observation includes taking the temperature, pulse, and blood pressure every&#xD;
      hour. If there are no adverse effects after the first dose, the observation period after&#xD;
      subsequent doses will reduced to one hour. Laboratory tests will be repeated 1,2,4 and 8&#xD;
      weeks after the first dose is given. As set out in the study protocol, if the patient has any&#xD;
      significant adverse event or laboratory deviation, the subject would be dropped from the&#xD;
      study. Throughout the study the subjects will be treated with a double dose of a proton pump&#xD;
      inhibitor to control gastric acid reflux.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 8 weeks of therapy the study medication will be stopped. Four weeks thereafter and 12&#xD;
      weeks from the beginning, repeat endosocpy with biopsies will be done. If biopsies show no&#xD;
      residual high grade dysplasia, the patient will be continued in an intensive surveillance&#xD;
      program. Intensive surveillance means endoscopy with biopsies every 3 months for 1 year, then&#xD;
      every 6 months for 1 year then yearly for 3 more years. If high grade dysplsia persists after&#xD;
      8 weeks of treatment or cancer is found, the patient would be referred for conventional&#xD;
      therapy. Likewise, if high grade dysplsia recurs or cancer is found during the intensive&#xD;
      surveillance program, the subject will be referred for conventional therapy.&#xD;
