      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistin, a recently described adipokine, belonging to the cysteine-rich secretory protein&#xD;
      family, was originally described as an adipocyte-derived polypeptide, that provides the link&#xD;
      between obesity and insulin resistance in mice1-2. However, resistin is expressed at very low&#xD;
      concentrations in human adipose cells, whereas at high levels in mononuclear leukocytes,&#xD;
      macrophages, spleen, bone marrow cells. The striking differences in the genomic organization&#xD;
      and cellular source of resistin in rodents make the biological effects found in the mouse not&#xD;
      readily transferable to humans3-5. Accordingly, an increasing number of reports raised doubts&#xD;
      regarding the possibility of an important relationship between human resistin and various&#xD;
      metabolic disturbances, characteristic of obesity and type 2 diabetes4-5. Resistin was&#xD;
      originally found to be related to proteins induced during lung inflammation6, and the high&#xD;
      expression levels of resistin in leukocytes, the associations between this protein and&#xD;
      inflammatory markers, the property to stimulate in vivo inflammatory cytokines suggest the&#xD;
      possibility that resistin may be involved in the inflammation process6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data supporting the participation of resistin in oxidative processes have been sporadically&#xD;
      published. A significant interaction among a single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter&#xD;
      of the human resistin gene and a marker of oxidative stress (NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase&#xD;
      I) has been found7. Retinoic acid, the acid form of vitamin A, inhibited the expression of&#xD;
      resistin in mice and reduced the higher resistin levels of ten males affected by psoriasis8.&#xD;
      Resistin serum levels were inversely associated with nitrotyrosine (NT), a product of free&#xD;
      radical activity9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot-analysis performed in five healthy volunteers showed that oral administration of&#xD;
      vitamin C for 15 days determined a slight reduction in resistin serum levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether an in vivo treatment with an antioxidant&#xD;
      vitamin (vitamin C) might substantially affect resistin serum levels. For this purpose, serum&#xD;
      resistin values were evaluated in a group of healthy subjects, randomized to receive orally 2&#xD;
      g ascorbic acid for two weeks. Values of fasting glucose, insulin, total and HDL-cholesterol,&#xD;
      triglycerides, C-reactive protein (CRP), and markers of oxidative stress were measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-arms open prospective randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers aged 20-50 years were recruited from the staff of the S.Giovanni Battista&#xD;
      Hospital of Turin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria were: age 20-50 years, absence of known hyperglycemia, hypertension,&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, impaired renal function, liver disease, or any other systemic&#xD;
      conditions, no use of any drug -estrogen included-, not being on a particular diet and/or&#xD;
      vitamin or other nutrient supplementation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria were: actual pregnancy, known hyperglycemia, hypertension, cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, impaired renal function, liver disease, or any other systemic conditions, use of any&#xD;
      drug -estrogen included-, being on a particular diet and/or vitamin or other nutrient&#xD;
      supplementation; history of renal calculi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a full baseline evaluation of all included subjects, they were stratified according to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. age,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. sex,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. smoking habits,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. body mass index (BMI),&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. fasting blood levels of glucose, hs-CRP, vitamin C, and resistin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization procedure was automatically performed by a statistician, using a SAS&#xD;
      program developed to minimize the differences between the two groups for all the stratifying&#xD;
      variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were randomly allocated, within each stratum, to receive either daily 2 g ascorbic&#xD;
      acid (Cebionâ 1000 per 2/die) supplementation or no supplementation for 14 days. The final&#xD;
      distribution was: 40 subjects on vitamin C supplementation (experimental group) and 40 not&#xD;
      supplemented (control group). These dosages were demonstrated to be safe also for prolonged&#xD;
      treatments10&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main endpoints: mean resistin serum level reduction, after vitamin C treatment, of at least&#xD;
      0.50 standardized units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints: the within- and between-group variations in the other inflammatory and&#xD;
      oxidative variables measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of our previous data21, a sample of at least 34 subjects per group was required&#xD;
      to detect a standardized difference of 0.5 DS resistin reduction in the experimental group,&#xD;
      with a statistical power of 80% and two-tailed 0.05 a-value. Taking into account the&#xD;
      limitations of these assumptions and the possibility of missing some individuals, the total&#xD;
      sample size was increased to 40 subjects per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      The t-Student test for paired data will be used to investigate variations in the&#xD;
      concentrations of several blood variables in the experimental group and in the control group.&#xD;
      To assess whether these changes are different between the two groups, t-tests for independent&#xD;
      samples, assuming either equal or unequal variances, will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the subjects will be submitted in the morning, at fasting, before and after the&#xD;
      treatment, to measurements of weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, and to&#xD;
      determinations of serum glucose, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglyceride, insulin,&#xD;
      high sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP), vitamin A, C, E, oxidized and reduced&#xD;
      glutathione, NT, and resistin levels. Data about smoking habits, physical activity and mean&#xD;
      daily nutrient intakes will be collected, respectively, by an interview, and a validated&#xD;
      3-day food record.&#xD;
