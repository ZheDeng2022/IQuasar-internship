      Purpose To evaluate long-term follow up of Intacs microthin prescription inserts (Addition&#xD;
      Technology Inc, Fremont, Calif) for the management of keratoconus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design A long-term (five years) retrospective, follow-up study&#xD;

      Subjects and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical committee approval was obtained for the original trial, and patients were asked to&#xD;
      sign an informed consent form (in accordance with Institutional guidelines and to the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki) before treatment and for further follow-up examinations. The&#xD;
      registration information for this clinical trial is available to the public through the&#xD;
      National Institute of Health database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical procedure was done under topical anesthesia. Two Intacs segments of 0.45-mm&#xD;
      thickness were inserted so as to embrace the steepest keratoconus meridian, according to the&#xD;
      topographic image, aiming at maximal flattening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The corneal thickness was measured intraoperatively at the incision site and peripherally in&#xD;
      the cornea along the ring placement markings with ultrasonic pachymetry (Sonogage, Cleveland,&#xD;
      Ohio, USA). Using a diamond knife, set at 70% of the thinnest corneal measurement, a 0.9-mm&#xD;
      radial incision was formed, and corneal pockets were created using two Sinskey hooks and a&#xD;
      Suarez spreader. Two corneal tunnels were then formed using clockwise and counterclockwise&#xD;
      dissectors under suction created by a vacuum-centering guide. The two polymethyl methacrylate&#xD;
      (PMMA) segments (0.45-mm thickness) were implanted in the respective corneal tunnels,&#xD;
      maintaining a space of approximately 2.0-mm between their ends and 1.5 mm between the&#xD;
      opposite edge of each segment and the edge of the incision. The incision site was sutured&#xD;
      using a single 10/0 nylon stitch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative evaluation Postoperatively, all eyes received antibiotic/steroid combination&#xD;
      eye drops 4 times per day for 2 weeks. In addition, all patients were instructed to use&#xD;
      preservative-free artificial tears frequently. The sutures were removed 2 weeks after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group differences for continuous variables were tested using the paired Student t tests. The&#xD;
      change in manifest refraction (spherical equivalent) (MRSE) and topographic k values and&#xD;
      topographic astigmatism were plotted over time to determine long-term stability, and the&#xD;
      difference as a function of time was analyzed using paired 2-tailed t tests (at time&#xD;
      intervals of preoperative to 1 month, 1 to 3 months, 3 to 6 months, 6 to 12 months, and every&#xD;
      year of follow up period). Results are presented as means + standard deviation [SD]. A P&#xD;
      value less than .05 was regarded as statistically significant.&#xD;
