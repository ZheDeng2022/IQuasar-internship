      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of&#xD;
      administering ZYC300 with Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study of ZYC300 in the treatment of advanced stage malignancy of the&#xD;
      kidney in patients who have not had previous immune-based therapies or treatment of advanced&#xD;
      stage malignancies (cancerous growths) of the ovary, breast, colon, or hormone-refractory&#xD;
      prostate in patients who have failed at least one but no more than two prior regimens of&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Patients who meet all entry criteria will be administered 600 mg/m^2&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide intravenously 3 days before each dose of ZYC300. ZYC300 will be administered&#xD;
      at 400 micrograms DNA/total dose every two weeks for a maximum of six doses (6 cycles).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ZYC300 is a plasmid DNA formulated within biodegradable microencapsulated particles. This is&#xD;
      the first time that ZYC300 and Cyclophosphamide will be given together. Cyclophosphamide is a&#xD;
      chemotherapy drug approved by the FDA that has been used for many years in many different&#xD;
      kinds of cancer. In this trial the study drug will be used to boost the immune system.&#xD;
      Sometimes the immune system cannot fight infected or abnormal cells because of other cells&#xD;
      called T reg cells. The T reg cells limit the immune systems attack on infected or abnormal&#xD;
      cells. In this study, the hope is that Cyclophosphamide will inhibit the T regs cells so that&#xD;
      the ZYC300 can work better to attack the cancer cells.&#xD;
