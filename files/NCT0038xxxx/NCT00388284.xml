    <textblock>
      This trial is designed as a prospective, multi-center, randomized, double blinded clinical&#xD;
      trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Thrombin VSI. An immunological sub-study to&#xD;
      assess antibody and coagulation changes in the subjects following exposure to the Vascular&#xD;
      Solutions Diagnostic Duett Pro manufactured with Thrombin VSI and Thrombin JMI will be&#xD;
      conducted as a component of this trial with a subset of the enrolled study subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hundred seventy (270) subjects will be enrolled in this trial. A minimum of 50% of the&#xD;
      subjects will be interventional subjects and up to 50% will be diagnostic subjects. All 270&#xD;
      subjects will provide blood specimens at baseline and at the 30 day follow-up visit for&#xD;
      evaluation in the immunologic sub-study. Within the 270 subjects enrolled, a minimum of 45&#xD;
      subjects treated with the Thrombin VSI and a minimum of 45 subjects treated with the Thrombin&#xD;
      JMI will provide blood specimens at the 60 day follow-up visit to be evaluated in the&#xD;
      immunologic sub-study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy objective is to demonstrate that the device time-to-hemostasis for the&#xD;
      study group treated with the sealing device manufactured with Thrombin VSI is non-inferior to&#xD;
      the study group treated with the sealing device manufactured with Thrombin JMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary safety objective is to demonstrate a device-related major complication rate for&#xD;
      the study group treated with the sealing device manufactured with Thrombin VSI that is&#xD;
      non-inferior to the device-related major complication rate observed for the study group&#xD;
      treated with the sealing device manufactured with Thrombin JMI.&#xD;
