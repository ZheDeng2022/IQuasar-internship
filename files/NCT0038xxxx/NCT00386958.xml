  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bacterial corneal ulcers are a leading cause of pediatric blindness in underdeveloped&#xD;
      countries due to a lack of antibiotic availability and affordability, among other reasons.&#xD;
      Povidone-iodine, an inexpensive and readily available broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, may&#xD;
      be an effective and affordable treatment for corneal ulcers, allowing preservation of sight&#xD;
      for those afflicted with this disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis to be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infectious corneal ulceration causes corneal scarring, opacification, and blindness in&#xD;
      hundreds of thousands of children annually. In developing countries, it is the number one&#xD;
      cause of avoidable blindness in children. While in some cases, the cornea was healthy prior&#xD;
      to ulceration, in others; xerophthalmia, trachoma, rubeola, trauma, or some other cause&#xD;
      previously compromised the cornea. Even when the ulceration is associated with one of the&#xD;
      above etiologies, it is usually the bacterial corneal ulcer that directly leads to blindness&#xD;
      in the short-term. In many countries, few of these infections are properly treated with&#xD;
      appropriate antimicrobial agents due to a number of factors, including cost, availability,&#xD;
      and effectiveness. If a topical antimicrobial agent were readily available in developing&#xD;
      countries which is also inexpensive and effective, many of these ulcers could be cured before&#xD;
      scarring and blindness result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The best candidate for such a medication is povidone-iodine ophthalmic solution. It has&#xD;
      already been proven the best agent to sterilize the ocular surface before and after eye&#xD;
      surgery and to prevent conjunctivitis in newborn babies. It was also shown an effective&#xD;
      treatment against bacterial conjunctivitis in children. Povidone-iodine ophthalmic solution&#xD;
      can be prepared in a local hospital or clinic by mixing the powder with an ophthalmic saline&#xD;
      solution bringing the cost of a 10-ml bottle to less than US $0.10. By contrast, in the&#xD;
      Philippines, a 10 ml. bottle of Neosporin ophthalmic solution cost about $4.00 and it may&#xD;
      take a few bottles to cure a bacterial corneal ulcer. For far less than a U.S. dollar, a&#xD;
      corneal ulcer could be fully cured. Povidone-iodine has the widest antimicrobial spectrum of&#xD;
      any known topical medication. It has been shown to be effective against all bacteria, fungi,&#xD;
      and viruses. No true resistance to povidone-iodine has ever been demonstrated. Allergic&#xD;
      reactions are rare. Thus, if any medication could serve the purpose for this study, it would&#xD;
      be povidone-iodine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary research question is whether povidone-iodine ophthalmic solution is effective in&#xD;
      healing bacterial corneal ulcers, which, if proven, would have a dramatic effect in reducing&#xD;
      pediatric blindness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of subjects was determined from the primary outcome measure of non-inferiority to&#xD;
      achieve a minimum of a one-day difference between the control and investigative groups, with&#xD;
      povidone-iodine being compared to the control medication at each study site. The control&#xD;
      medications are Neosporin ophthalmic solution in Manila and ciprofloxacin ophthalmic solution&#xD;
      in the two combined Indian sites (Hyderabad and Tiruchirapalli) for a total of four study&#xD;
      arms. The number of recruits was calculated to achieve 90% power for detecting&#xD;
      non-inferiority using t-tests with a level of significance of 0.05 for comparing mean time to&#xD;
      cure. Cure is defined as closure of the epithelial defect with no inflammatory signs other&#xD;
      than minimal injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects provided written consent. As appropriate, child assent was also obtained. At each&#xD;
      study site, subjects were allocated to receive either povidone-iodine or the control&#xD;
      medication. If corneal ulcers were present bilaterally, one eye was randomized to receive&#xD;
      povidone-iodine, while the other received the control medication standard for that center.&#xD;
      All subjects were hospitalized for at least 7 days for careful monitoring and appropriate&#xD;
      treatment. To assure compliance, all subjects had their medications administered by medical&#xD;
      personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study medication is 1.25% povidone-iodine and the control medications are Neosporin&#xD;
      ophthalmic solution in Manila, Philippines and ciprofloxacin 0.3% ophthalmic solution in&#xD;
      Hyderabad and Tiruchirapalli, India. These medications are the standard of care at each&#xD;
      respective study site. The only eye medication permitted beside povidone-iodine 1.25%&#xD;
      ophthalmic solution and the control medications (Neosporin and ciprofloxacin) is atropine&#xD;
      ophthalmic solution to reduce intraocular inflammation and prevent synechiae. The atropine&#xD;
      solution is administered to the affected eye(s) twice a day. Subjects less than one year old&#xD;
      receive a 0.25% solution, those aged one to three years receive 0.5%, and those older than 3&#xD;
      years receive the 1% solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosing schedule of povidone-iodine 1.25% or control ophthalmic solutions is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For the first three days, one drop of the medication is applied every hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Day 4 and thereafter: hourly while awake. When asleep (sleep not to exceed 9 hours),&#xD;
           drops are administered every three hours. All cases are treated with this intense drop&#xD;
           therapy for a minimum of 5 days unless criteria for change in therapy are met (see&#xD;
           below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At 5 days: If there is no deterioration in any factor (see below) and improvement in at&#xD;
           least one factor (other than epithelial defect size) on 2 consecutive examinations,&#xD;
           dosing frequency is decreased to every 2 hours while awake (about 8 times/day) for 2&#xD;
           days, then 4 times/day until discharge. If status remained unchanged at Day 5, intense&#xD;
           drop therapy continues for 5 more days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. If at 10 days the status is unchanged, the subject exits the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are examined daily and have their visual acuity and ocular examination&#xD;
      documented. The daily eye examination findings are scored and recorded for the following six&#xD;
      factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Visual acuity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Inflammatory signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Stromal infiltrate dimensions&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Epithelial defect dimensions&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. MELT&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Tissue firmness, including keratic precipitate (KP),anterior chamber(AC)cellular&#xD;
           reaction, AC fibrin and hypopyon status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The daily assessment of the ulcer status is classified as cured, improved, persistent,&#xD;
      worsening or failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Change in Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the first 48 hours, treatment is changed for deterioration in all factors or&#xD;
      appearance of a descemetocele. After 48 hours of treatment, treatment is changed for&#xD;
      deterioration in one or more of the following factors on 2 consecutive examinations: stromal&#xD;
      infiltrate, melt, or two or more signs or symptoms of inflammation. Epithelial defect size is&#xD;
      used only for assessing status; not for change in medication. The new treatment is left to&#xD;
      the discretion of the ophthalmologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Culture Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects undergo microbiological analysis of the corneal ulcer upon intake into the&#xD;
      study. A spatula is applied to the cornea of the affected eye(s) and blood agar and chocolate&#xD;
      agar plates and brain heart infusion broth (BHI) are streaked for each patient. Cultures are&#xD;
      repeated daily until two negative cultures are obtained. If the cultures are positive for any&#xD;
      organism, that organism is considered the infecting agent. Each culture plate is incubated&#xD;
      for at least seven days and the colony forming units are differentiated and enumerated by&#xD;
      standard bacteriological techniques, including the VPI technique for anaerobic bacteria. No&#xD;
      culture growth at seven days constitutes a negative culture.&#xD;
