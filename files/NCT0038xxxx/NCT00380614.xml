  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since a proportion of patients with Acute Viral Hepatitis-B develop severe hepatitis and&#xD;
      fulminant hepatic failure, it is logical to believe that a rapid reduction in the HBV DNA&#xD;
      levels by using antiviral agents could result in a less intense host response against the&#xD;
      hepatitis B virus. However, the experience with lamivudine treatment of immunocompetent&#xD;
      patients with AVH-B is limited.The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy,&#xD;
      utility and safety of lamivudine in treating immunocompetent patients with AVH-B.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of acute hepatitis B was based on recent onset acute illness including&#xD;
      prodromal symptoms, jaundice and other typical symptoms. The laboratory investigations&#xD;
      supporting the diagnosis of acute hepatitis included the presence of &gt;2.5 times the upper&#xD;
      limit of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and serum bilirubin, and positive IgM anti-HBc&#xD;
      test. Ultrasound, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done to look for any evidence of chronic&#xD;
      liver disease. All patients had normal alpha-fetoprotein levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-infection with hepatitis A, C, D, E and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was&#xD;
      looked for by appropriate serologic tests conducted within 7 days of presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with co-infection, a history of hepatotoxic drug intake or alcohol use &gt;20g/day, or&#xD;
      any evidence of chronic liver disease in the past, at presentation or during follow-up were&#xD;
      excluded. Patients were also excluded if they had serum bilirubin &lt; 5 mg/dl at presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were classified as severe AVH-B if they fulfilled any two of the following criteria:&#xD;
      (1) hepatic encephalopathy; (2) serum bilirubin ≥10.0 mg/dl; and (3) international normalized&#xD;
      ratio (INR) ≥1.6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were randomized into 2 groups: Group 1: Treatment with lamivudine 100 mg daily&#xD;
      for 3 months, Group 2: Placebo. Randomization was done using random number table. The initial&#xD;
      study and randomization was planned to enroll 120 patients or continue the study till three&#xD;
      years, whichever was earlier. Individual rather than block randomization was done The&#xD;
      investigators as well as the patients were blinded to the randomisation. The patients in the&#xD;
      placebo group received a placebo pill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were monitored during treatment for clinical evidence and grade of hepatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy, impaired coagulation (abnormal international normalized ratio, IINR),&#xD;
      AST/ALT, serum albumin bilirubin levels every week for the first month and then monthly. HBV&#xD;
      serology, including serum HBsAg, HBeAg, and anti-HBe were checked at baseline and every 3&#xD;
      months. Anti-HBs titres were checked at 6 and 12 months. Quantitative HBV DNA assay was&#xD;
      performed on day 0, day 4, week 1, week 2, week 3, week 4, then every month for the next 2&#xD;
      months and then every 3 months for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were followed for at least 12 months after the onset of AVH-B. Development of&#xD;
      protective anti-HBs(&gt;10 IU/L) was specifically looked for.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B was excluded by investigating thoroughly for any evidence&#xD;
      of chronic liver disease by Ultrasound, Upper GI endoscopy, or low albumin at presentation.&#xD;
      Ultrasound was repeated at 6 and 12 months, and if there was any suspicion Upper GI endoscopy&#xD;
      was also repeated. LFTS were done at every hospital visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HBsAg, HBeAg, IgM anti-HBc, anti-HBs, and anti-HBe were tested by commercially available&#xD;
      enzyme-linked immunoassays. Serum quantitative HBV DNA assay was performed by use of an ultra&#xD;
      sensitive Hybrid capture assay [Digene Labs, USA] that has a lower limit of detection of&#xD;
      4,700 copies/ml. An arbitrary value of 4,700 copies/ml was assigned to values &lt; 4,700&#xD;
      copies/ml for analysis purposes. In such patients HBV DNA was done by an in-house qualitative&#xD;
      PCR test to indicate negativity or positivity of viral DNA. The lower limit of detection was&#xD;
      600 copies/ml.&#xD;
