      Comparison between use of Aruba Aloë formula F-BC-096 and control.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with two equal donor sites will be selected for inclusion. After wound healing one&#xD;
      donor site will be treated with Aruba Aloë Formula F-BC-096 while a control product will be&#xD;
      applied to the second site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If pressure garments are applied they must be equal for both donor sites. During follow-ups&#xD;
      objective methods will be used to evaluate elasticity and colour of the scar.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have two similar donor sites, identical in depth and wound treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healing time of both donor sites may differ by 3 days maximum.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Flux values determined by Laser Doppler Imaging before commencement of the therapy&#xD;
             must be approximately similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If possible, the donor sites to be compared must have the same location.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient compliance with therapy in relation to the protocol is necessary. In case of&#xD;
             pediatric patiënts this depends on collaboration of the parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the two donor sites to be compared, the entire after-treatment concerning pressure&#xD;
             garments or eventual silicone sheets must be equal for both donor sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be available for regular and necessary follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Possibility to finish all measurements during follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written authorisation of the patient, family or parents is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donor sites are not similar (not identical in: depth, wound treatment, healing time&#xD;
             and flux values)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children requiring sedation for LDI of donor sites&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not following the complete treatment schedule or missing some evaluations during the&#xD;
             follow-up period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has any condition(s) that seriously compromises the patient's ability to&#xD;
             complete this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has participated in another study utilizing an investigational drug or device&#xD;
             within the previous 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has one or more medical condition(s), diabetes, including renal, hepatic,&#xD;
             hematologic, neurologic, or immune disease that in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;
             would make the patient an inappropriate candidate for this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients wish to terminate the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No informed consent before start of the trial&#xD;
