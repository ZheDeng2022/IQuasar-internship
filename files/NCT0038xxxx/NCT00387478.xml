  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tree MATAMPL has been developed to provide pre-seasonal specific immunotherapy for patients&#xD;
      with hypersensitivity to Tree (birch, alder, hazel) pollen (hay fever). This novel&#xD;
      formulation is designed to provide a vaccine that will be efficacious with only four&#xD;
      escalating dose injections administered before the start of the pollen season. In this Study&#xD;
      the Efficacy will be assessed by exposing allergic subjects to birch pollen in an&#xD;
      environmental exposure chamber EEC. Patient symptomatic response to birch pollen and patient&#xD;
      quality of life in the EEC will be determined.&#xD;

        apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
