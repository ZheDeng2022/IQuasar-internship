  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a double blind randomized crossover study of patients with congestive heart&#xD;
      failure and a heart rate dependent upon a permanent pacemaker. Thus, at all times the heart&#xD;
      rate can be maintained at a set rate by adjusting the settings of the pacemaker. Acute and&#xD;
      chronic effects of heart rates of 60, 75, and 90 beats per minute will be evaluated. The&#xD;
      effect of heart rate will be determined by measuring ejection fraction by nuclear&#xD;
      ventriculography, six minute walk distance, and peak oxygen consumption on a maximal exercise&#xD;
      test.&#xD;

      This study is a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study of patients with congestive heart&#xD;
      failure and a heart rate dependent on a permanent pacemaker. Thus, at all times the heart&#xD;
      rate can be maintained at a set rate by adjusting the settings of the pacemaker. Acute and&#xD;
      chronic effects of heart rates of 60, 75, and 90 beats per minute will be evaluated by&#xD;
      primarily comparing cardiopulmonary exercise tests and radionuclide ventriculography scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have symptomatic congestive heart failure, NYHA Class II to IV symptoms and an&#xD;
      ejection fraction &lt; 40% by nuclear ventriculography within the previous 6 months. Patients&#xD;
      must be stable with no change in dosage on conventional therapy (including digoxin,&#xD;
      diuretics, ACE inhibitors, hydralazine, nitrates, angiotensin II receptor blockers and/or&#xD;
      beta blocker) for at least 4 weeks. Because only heart rate is being evaluated, stable&#xD;
      treatment with beta blockade should not prevent evaluation of the effects of changing heart&#xD;
      rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have an intrinsic cardiac rate &lt; 60 beats per minute and a functioning&#xD;
      permanent pacemaker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. active alcohol or illicit drug use&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. myocardial infarction or unstable angina within the previous 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. obstructive valvular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. exercise induced sustained arrhythmias or symptomatic myocardial ischemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. psychiatric disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. non-compliance with medical regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment for eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who appear eligible based upon the prior inclusion and exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      further evaluated for eligibility as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing a consent form but prior to randomization and enrollment, the pacemaker rate&#xD;
      will be set at 60 and then a 24 hour assessment by Holter monitor will be obtained. Patients&#xD;
      will be eligible for the study if they are paced at least 75% of the time. For rate&#xD;
      responsive pacemakers, the pacemaker will be set at a lower rate of 60 and an upper rate of&#xD;
      80. Patients will need to be paced at a rate of 60 beats per minute at least 75% of the time&#xD;
      for these patients as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A symptom limited maximal exercise tolerance with measurement of peak oxygen consumption&#xD;
      (VO2) will be performed to assess patient's maximal aerobic capacity. The Naughton protocol&#xD;
      will be used. Exercise will continue until limiting symptoms are present, but will be stopped&#xD;
      if patient develops sustained arrhythmia, cyanosis, dizziness, decrease in blood pressure or&#xD;
      an ataxic gait. Patients who develop angina or claudication limiting exercise capacity will&#xD;
      be excluded from further evaluation or participation. Peak oxygen consumption on this test&#xD;
      must be &lt; 20 ml/kg/min for a patient to be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a three period crossover study. Patients initially will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to be paced at a rate of 60, 75, or 90 BPM for 2 consecutive months. Patients with&#xD;
      rate responsive pacemakers will be set at an upper limit of 20 beats above their assigned&#xD;
      rate. At the end of this period, patients will have end point measurements obtained and then&#xD;
      will be randomized to one of the other heart rates for another 2 consecutive months.&#xD;
      Following repeat end point measurements at the end of this period, patients will then be&#xD;
      randomized to the final heart rate for 2 consecutive months with repeat measurements at the&#xD;
      end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End Point Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following tests will be done at the end of each of the three two month periods to assess&#xD;
      the effect of heart rate on ventricular function, functional status and exercise capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Nuclear ventriculography (MUGA): Equilibrium gated blood pool will be completed&#xD;
           according to standard protocol, under the supervision of Dr. Eliot Siegel. Ejection&#xD;
           fraction will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Six minute walk: All patients will have their submaximal exercise capacity evaluated by&#xD;
           a 6 minute walk. This test is performed on a 100 foot hallway. Patients are instructed&#xD;
           to walk from end to end repeatedly at a comfortable pace while attempting to cover as&#xD;
           much ground as possible. After 6 minutes the distance covered is measured to the nearest&#xD;
           foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Maximal exercise tolerance and peak oxygen consumption: This will be assessed in all&#xD;
           patients at baseline and at the end of each 2 month period. Patients will be exercised&#xD;
           to exhaustion on a motorized treadmill using a Naughton Protocol. Heart rate and rhythm&#xD;
           will be monitored continuously while blood pressure will be measured every 2 minutes.&#xD;
           Oxygen consumption, C02 production and respiratory quotient will be calculated every 20&#xD;
           seconds using breath by breath analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute Studies Effect of Heart Rate on Ejection Fraction Acute studies will be performed to&#xD;
      help differentiate the effect of changes in heart rate on left ventricular ejection fraction&#xD;
      from changes in cardiac performance and contractility. Acutely, ejection fraction might&#xD;
      change because of alterations in preload and afterload, which might not reflect the long term&#xD;
      effects on contractility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the first 2 month period, the patient will have nuclear ventriculography (as&#xD;
      detailed above) to evaluate ejection fraction. At that time the pacemaker rate will be&#xD;
      changed in a random manner to the two other heart rates. Ten minutes after each adjustment,&#xD;
      an ejection fraction will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect of Heart Rate on Exercise Performance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to look at the acute effect of changes in heart rate on exercise&#xD;
      performance. This will differentiate exercise effects induced by the change in heart rate on&#xD;
      contractility from the acute effects of changing heart rate. Twenty four hours following&#xD;
      randomization of patients to the first heart rate, they will have an exercise tolerance test.&#xD;
      As previously indicated, the effect of a chronic change in heart rate ill be evaluated&#xD;
      following each 2 month period. Subsequently, when patients are crossed over to another heart&#xD;
      rate, they will have an exercise tolerance test 24 hours later. This will follow the chronic&#xD;
      exercise test of the previous period by at least 24 hours.&#xD;
