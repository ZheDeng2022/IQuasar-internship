      Patients with high grade brain tumors will be treated to test shortened course of radiation&#xD;
      therapy with the use of precise, focused radiation with cyberknife.&#xD;

      Screening Procedures: Screening procedures are tests and procedures that will be done to&#xD;
      determine if you are eligible to take part in the research study. For this research study,&#xD;
      the screening procedures include: Medical history, physical examination including&#xD;
      neurological and performance status, assessment of preoperative and postoperative scans,&#xD;
      operative reports and pathology reports. All of these have already been performed or will be&#xD;
      performed as standard of care for your condition even if you are not taking part in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Procedures: If you qualify to take part in this research study, you will undergo&#xD;
      these research procedures: The pre- and post operative MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans&#xD;
      before and after your operation, the operative procedure (including sampling known as biopsy&#xD;
      or removal of as much as tumor as possible) and the procedures to facilitate radiation&#xD;
      therapy planning (making a mask in the treatment position to keep you comfortably still and&#xD;
      CAT scan in the treatment position). These are all part of standard procedures in the&#xD;
      treatment of your tumor, whether you are in this study or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the primary reasons to deliver radiation in multiple small doses conventionally (30-33&#xD;
      treatments over 6-61/2 weeks) is to minimize damage to the surrounding normal brain. The&#xD;
      Cyberknife technology allows precise delivery of radiation to your tumor while minimizing&#xD;
      radiation to the surrounding brain. This allows the possibility of delivering higher doses of&#xD;
      radiation to the tumor thereby shortening the overall treatment time (18 treatments in 31/2&#xD;
      weeks). This is what is being studied in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cyberknife treatment will be longer in duration lasting about 30-60 minutes rather than&#xD;
      5-10 minutes with each conventional radiation treatment. During this time you will be asked&#xD;
      to lie as comfortably still as you can. The technology however permits the radiation beam to&#xD;
      adjust precisely to any small movements you may make to maintain the accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along with radiation, you will get chemotherapy called Temozolomide, in the form of pills.&#xD;
      This is also standard treatment whether or not you are in this study. You will be asked to&#xD;
      take these pills every day during the course of radiation and for 5 days each month&#xD;
      thereafter for a year. However during radiation you will be receiving Temozolomide, which is&#xD;
      used to possibly make the radiation more effective, only for 4 weeks as opposed to 6 weeks of&#xD;
      conventional radiation. As part of usual care with this chemotherapy you may receive&#xD;
      supportive medication to prevent and treat nausea, vomiting, low blood counts or infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring/Follow-Up Procedures. Procedures performed to evaluate the effectiveness and&#xD;
      safety of the experimental procedures are called &quot;monitoring&quot; or &quot;follow-up&quot; procedures. For&#xD;
      this research study, the monitoring/follow-up procedures include: Clinical assessment&#xD;
      including neurological and performance status assessments and blood tests for your&#xD;
      chemotherapy will be performed every month for the first year and every three months&#xD;
      thereafter. MRI scans one month after completion of radiation therapy and every 2 months&#xD;
      thereafter. All these procedures are performed routinely in the management of your tumor&#xD;
