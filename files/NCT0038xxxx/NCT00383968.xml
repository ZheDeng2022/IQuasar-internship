  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prevention of progressive renal disease needs a clear understanding of prevalence of early&#xD;
      stage of chronic kidney disease in a community. Even in developed countries most subjects in&#xD;
      early stages of chronic kidney disease go largely undiagnosed and untreated. Targeted&#xD;
      screening could identify a greater numbers of individuals at risk then a general public&#xD;
      screening (11). It is economically more feasible to perform in a country like Pakistan.&#xD;
      Hypertension and diabetes are highly prevalent in South-Asia.It is anticipated that if target&#xD;
      screening of hypertensive population is performed especially of an age group in which&#xD;
      intervention might be expected to have maximal benefit it will not only help to identify from&#xD;
      a large number of patients with essential hypertension destined to develop or in the course&#xD;
      of advancing towards end stage renal disease but will also unearth mislabeled &quot;essential&#xD;
      hypertension&quot; that have underlying primary renal disease. This later group may belong to&#xD;
      socio-economic disadvantaged population who have limited access to health care and have never&#xD;
      been investigated properly. The aim of the Study is to detect sub-clinical chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease in hypertensive patients at community level and to identify associated risk factors.&#xD;

      This will be Cross sectional or prevalent study targeting diagnosed hypertensives aged 40 and&#xD;
      above years, in middle to low socio-economic settings of Karachi. This proposed study will be&#xD;
      nested in the existing Wellcome Trust funded study. The parent study is designed to determine&#xD;
      the impact of a unique community versus high risk approach to control BP in Karachi, Pakistan&#xD;
      In that ongoing Factorial design, individuals aged ≥40 who are found hypertensive in the 12&#xD;
      clusters (each containing 250 households) are being randomized to different interventions for&#xD;
      their BP control. All participants enrolled in that study had urine examination for&#xD;
      proteinuria and serum creatinine measurements at baseline to assess their renal status. For&#xD;
      the proposed study the identified hypertensive (from parent study) who had either shown&#xD;
      proteinuria and or had elevated serum creatinine (more then 1.2 for females and 1.4 mg/dl for&#xD;
      males) at baseline will be approached. Serum creatinine levels exceeding above mentioned&#xD;
      cut-off levels, are only reached when GFR is&lt;60ml/min/m². As mentioned above in order to&#xD;
      classify these subjects as having chronic kidney disease these abnormalities must be&#xD;
      demonstrated to persist for at least three months. A repeat serum creatinine measurement and&#xD;
      urine examination for proteinuria will be performed in the present study, by obtaining blood&#xD;
      sample and urine sample respectively from these subjects. As a period of three months have&#xD;
      already passed since the baseline investigations were done, all subjects who will show&#xD;
      persistent abnormalities in either or both test will fall into chronic kidney disease group.&#xD;
      The repeated testing to confirm presence of CKD will include, measurement of serum creatinine&#xD;
      and urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (&gt;30mg/g) in an untimed urine specimen. This method has&#xD;
      been recommended as the preferred screening strategy. A set questionnaire will be filled by&#xD;
      interviewing the patient and risk factors for the presence of renal disease will be analyzed&#xD;
      based on this information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection will be done through structured questionnaire and diagnosis will be made&#xD;
      on the basis of their persistently elevated kidney biomarkers.&#xD;
