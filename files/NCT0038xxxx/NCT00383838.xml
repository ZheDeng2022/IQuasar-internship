  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use among youth continues to be a major concern for this nation, with a large&#xD;
      proportion of adolescents increasing their alcohol consumption as they transition from the&#xD;
      6th to the 8th grade. Although many adolescents experience alcohol-related problems, few&#xD;
      actually seek help or treatment. This may be because traditional intervention approaches are&#xD;
      not well suited for this age group. It is important to understand where adolescents turn to&#xD;
      when they want to get help. The current project focuses on developing an alcohol intervention&#xD;
      program for younger adolescents. We will conduct biannual surveys at two middle schools to&#xD;
      assess alcohol and drug use patterns over three years. In years 2 and 3, we will implement an&#xD;
      intervention in one of the schools.We will examine whether the intervention has an impact on&#xD;
      subsequent alcohol use.&#xD;

      Alcohol use among youth continues to be a major concern for this nation, with a large&#xD;
      proportion of adolescents increasing their alcohol consumption as they transition from the&#xD;
      6th to the 8th grade. Although many adolescents experience alcohol-related problems, few&#xD;
      actually seek help or treatment. This may be because traditional intervention approaches are&#xD;
      not well suited for this age group. The aims of this project are to assess factors that&#xD;
      impact younger adolescents' alcohol-related help-seeking behavior and to develop and&#xD;
      standardize a developmentally sensitive self-change facilitation program. We will also&#xD;
      preliminarily test the efficacy of the program in modifying the alcohol involvement (e.g.,&#xD;
      initiation, use, and problems) of middle school students. The focus of this grant is on&#xD;
      younger adolescents (e.g., 12-15 years old), as they are particularly vulnerable to&#xD;
      initiating alcohol use due to unique developmental issues. For example, peer conformity peaks&#xD;
      during 6tn, 7th and 8th grade and declines thereafter. In addition, this age group is less&#xD;
      likely to consider future consequences in the decision making process. Biannual surveys at&#xD;
      two middle schools will assess alcohol and drug use patterns, help-seeking behavior and&#xD;
      preferences, self-change efforts, and level of motivation for change. Year 1 data will be&#xD;
      used to develop a voluntary brief intervention program that targets a variety of youth,&#xD;
      including those who are just beginning to experiment with alcohol and those who may have&#xD;
      experienced some problems due to their use. Primary objectives are: 1) to explore barriers&#xD;
      and facilitative factors that promote/hinder younger adolescents' use of services, 2) use&#xD;
      detailed survey information to design and pilot a self-change program, 3) examine alcohol&#xD;
      involvement in relation to program utilization, and 4) preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      the intervention and overall patterns of service use. This study will extend facilitation of&#xD;
      self-change research, as this program will be one of the first voluntary alcohol focused&#xD;
      intervention programs to target middle school students.&#xD;
