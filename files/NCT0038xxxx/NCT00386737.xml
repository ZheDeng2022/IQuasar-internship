  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Annually, asthma is responsible for 1 million emergency room visits, 400,000&#xD;
      hospitalizations, and 5000 deaths according to the NHLBI. In addition, 10 million missed&#xD;
      school-days per year and 100 million days of restricted activity are attributed to this&#xD;
      disease. While there is no known cause or cure for asthma, recent studies have shown that&#xD;
      hospitalizations and emergency room visits can be reduced by as much as 78% and 73%,&#xD;
      respectively, when the disease is properly managed. According to the EPA, the occurance of&#xD;
      children with asthma more than doubled the rate of two decades ago; in 2001 the percentage of&#xD;
      asthmatic children was 8.7% (6.3 million children).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Properly managing asthma is nontrivial and can often require an asthma specialist. The&#xD;
      difficulty in diagnosing and managing asthma lies primarily in the lack of available clinical&#xD;
      technologies capable of assessing airway inflammation, an early and persistent component of&#xD;
      asthma. Accordingly, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines for the diagnosis and&#xD;
      management of asthma strongly recommend long term anti-inflammatory therapies, such as oral&#xD;
      or inhaled corticosteroids, to reverse airway inflammation in an effort to prevent&#xD;
      irreversible airway damage, termed &quot;airway remodeling&quot;. The medical community has expressed&#xD;
      the need for more objective and noninvasive measures of airway inflammation for diagnosing&#xD;
      asthma and monitoring the effectiveness and compliance of anti-inflammatory therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical research plan is designed to evaluate airway inflammation associated with&#xD;
      asthma. In this human subjects study, a non-invasive exhaled breath analysis sensor, called&#xD;
      the Breathmeter, will be used to measure eNO concentrations in children and adults (ages&#xD;
      4-65) with a broad range of respiratory disorders as well as those with no known respiratory&#xD;
      disorders. Breath donations will be simple and straightforward presenting little to no&#xD;
      discomfort to volunteers.&#xD;

      The study plan is divided into two sections: in-clinic studies and large-scale outreach&#xD;
      screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (A). Clinical Studies The clinical study is intended to obtain data characterizing eNO&#xD;
      concentrations within individual groups of subjects listed in the inclusion criteria. The&#xD;
      type of this study is &quot;non-invasive&quot;, and the study design is &quot;diagnosis/ treatment&#xD;
      monitoring, and efficacy&quot;. The study will seek to recruit subjects who fall into one of the&#xD;
      categories listed in the inclusion criteria below. The number of subjects (n) to be recruited&#xD;
      for each category is given and is estimated based on the past number of subjects mainly at&#xD;
      the Ekips Technologies, The Oklahoma Allergy &amp; Asthma Clinic, and the Norman Lung Center&#xD;
      sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria (Total Number of Subjects, n = 700)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both genders are eligible for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Healthy subjects (n=120)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Asthma (Total n=450) [diagnosed according to NHLBI/ NAEPP Guidelines (1998)]&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Non-treated or B2-agonist treated asthmatics (n=150),&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Glucocorticoid treated asthmatics, (n=150),&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Leukotriene Antagonist treated asthmatics, (n=75),&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Glucocorticoid and Leukotriene Antagonists treated asthmatics, (n= 75).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Acute respiratory illnesses (n=65&#xD;
&#xD;
           a) Sinusitis (Acute and Chronic), b) Influenza, c) Common cold, d)Pneumonia, e)Related&#xD;
           symptoms, but no diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Allergies (n=65) a) Atopic dermatitis, b) Allergic rhinitis, c) Seasonal allergies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy Subjects Recruiting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy subjects will be recruited from visitors and patients at the study sites. Visitors&#xD;
      may include relatives or friends accompanying patients. Healthy employees at the study sites&#xD;
      may be asked to participate in the study. Patients, visitors, and employees will be told that&#xD;
      do not have to participate if they do not want to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects younger than 4 and older than 65 will be excluded from the study. Pregnant women&#xD;
      will also be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Participation&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each visit, the participant in the study will be asked to donate up to 3 breath samples&#xD;
      for the first visit. The total time required for breath donations and measurements will be&#xD;
      about 5 minutes. An additional five minutes of a subject's time are needed to complete a&#xD;
      short interview if the information needed is not already available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthmatic or suspected asthmatic patients, both treated and non-treated will be asked to&#xD;
      donate breath during additional visits if convenient. Follow-up measurements may be performed&#xD;
      during regularly scheduled office visits.&#xD;
