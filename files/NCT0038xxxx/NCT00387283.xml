  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During a clinical study of people with severe West Nile virus infections, it was determined&#xD;
      that the drug AVI-4020 crossed the blood-brain barrier. This study will assess the amount of&#xD;
      drug that goes across the blood-brain barrier and the drug levels measured in both the blood&#xD;
      and urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to find out how much and how fast this drug crosses this&#xD;
      barrier.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AVI-4020 was designed to interfere with West Nile virus translation, and has been shown to&#xD;
      cross the blood-brain barrier in both normal and inflamed meninges in a clinical study in&#xD;
      patients with severe West Nile virus disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At issue, is whether this observation is limited to AVI-4020 PMO drug, or is observed with&#xD;
      other PMO drugs. This study is one of three to assess the specific ability of PMO drugs to&#xD;
      cross the blood-brain barrier, using similar dosing, and PK assessment time points. In order&#xD;
      to rigorously assess the pharmacokinetics, this study is being performed in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers at a single point in time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability of other PMO drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier will set the stage for future&#xD;
      studies that exploit this product characteristic.&#xD;
