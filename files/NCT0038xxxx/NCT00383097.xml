  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain blood (up to 90 ml or 18-teaspoonfuls on one or two&#xD;
      occasions) to make LMP1- and LMP2-cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and grow them in the laboratory in&#xD;
      such a way that they are able to attack LMP1- and LMP2-positive cells in the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If we are successful in growing these cells and if we feel they would be helpful to the&#xD;
      donor, we would then give the cells back to the donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is for patients that have a type of lymph gland cancer called Hodgkin or&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or chronic active Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection, which has come&#xD;
      back or not gone away after treatment, including the best treatment we know.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a research study using special immune system cells called LMP1- and LMP2-specific&#xD;
      cytotoxic T lymphocytes (LMP1- and LMP2-CTLs), a new experimental therapy. As in chronic&#xD;
      active EBV infection, some patients with Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma show evidence of&#xD;
      infection with the virus that causes infectious mononucleosis (EBV) before or at the time of&#xD;
      their diagnosis of the Lymphoma. EBV is found in the cancer cells of up to half the patients&#xD;
      with lymphoma, suggesting that it may play a role in causing lymphoma. The cancer cells&#xD;
      infected by EBV are able to hide from the body's immune system and escape destruction. We&#xD;
      want to see if special white blood cells, called T cells, that have been trained to kill EBV&#xD;
      infected cells can survive in the patient's blood and affect EBV-positive cells. In this&#xD;
      present study we are trying to find out if we can improve this treatment by growing T cells&#xD;
      that only recognize two of the proteins expressed on lymphoma cells called LMP1 and LMP2.&#xD;
      These special T cells are called LMP1- and LMP2-specific cytotoxic CTLs.&#xD;

      Infusions of CD45 MAbs A fixed dose of CD45 MAbs will be used determined from our previous&#xD;
      and ongoing studies in stem cell transplant recipients will be used 40, 400ug/kg over 6 to 8&#xD;
      hrs daily x 4 given as daily intravenous infusions that will be completed 48-72 hours prior&#xD;
      to CTL infusion. Patients will be premedicated prior to CD45 infusions and monitored as per&#xD;
      the SOP for CD45 MAbs infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 through Day 4: YTH 24/54 400ug/kg over 6 to 8 hr; Day 5: Rest; Day 6, 7 or 8: CTL&#xD;
      Infusion (provided CD45 Mab level &lt;100 ng/ml)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of the Patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxygen and suction equipment must be available in the room. Emergency drugs (Benadryl,&#xD;
      Epinephrine, solucortef to solumedrol) in appropriate doses must be preordered by the&#xD;
      physician prior to initiation of each infusion with doses available. A code card containing&#xD;
      the appropriate doses of each medicine according to the patient's weight will also be&#xD;
      available. Continuous telemetric monitoring by pulse oximeter and EKG will begin prior to and&#xD;
      for 6 hours after each antibody infusion has taken place. Baseline vital signs are taken and&#xD;
      recorded and monitored as per the SOP for antibody infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAbs Infusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antibody aliquot to be infused will arrive in the treatment area hand-carried by the&#xD;
      attending physician or appointed designate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antibody aliquot will be diluted in minimal amounts of normal saline. The resulting&#xD;
      solution is stable for 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antibody solution is administered by a syringe pump in incremental doses, 0.2-0.8 mg in&#xD;
      the first hour and up to 10 mg/hr thereafter, for a maximum infusion time of 8 hrs. A&#xD;
      registered nurse and a physician must be readily available&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibody toxicity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volume Overload: This is of particular importance in small recipients and will be monitored&#xD;
      carefully.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory mediator release from damaged circulating white cells and allergic reactions:&#xD;
      Fever, chills, rigors, pruritis, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, throat tightness and dyspnea&#xD;
      may occur. These reactions usually respond to slowing or stopping the infusion and/or the&#xD;
      parenteral administration of diphenhydramine, hydrocortisone, meperidine or anti-emetics.&#xD;
      Administration of O2, epinephrine, bronchodilators or IPPB may be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse effects of CD45 MAbs on CTL Our experience to date has shown rapid clearance of CD45&#xD;
      MAbs from the plasma, such that levels are undetectable by 24-48hrs after infusion. However,&#xD;
      the MAb levels will be measured before CTL infusion and if free plasma CD45 MAbs are present&#xD;
      CTL infusion will be deferred for 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      CTL Infusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Levels of CTLs: The following dose levels will be evaluated: Each patient will receive 1&#xD;
      injection, according to the following dosing schedules:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose level I: 2 x 10e7 cells/m2; Dose level II: 1 x 10e8 cells/m2; Dose level III: 3 x 10e8&#xD;
      cells/m2; Dose level IV: 1 x 10e9 cells/m2. Patients will be pre-medicated with Benadryl&#xD;
      1mg/kg IV (max 50mg) and Tylenol 10mg/kg po (max 650mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell Administration: LMP1- and LMP2-specific T cells will be given by intravenous injection&#xD;
      over 1-10 minutes through either a peripheral or a central line.&#xD;
