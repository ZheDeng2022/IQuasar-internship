      RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as topotecan, work in different ways&#xD;
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Giving bortezomib together with topotecan may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of bortezomib and&#xD;
      topotecan in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the safety and feasibility of bortezomib and topotecan hydrochloride in&#xD;
           patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bortezomib and topotecan hydrochloride in&#xD;
           these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform laboratory correlative studies on tumor tissue and blood samples from these&#xD;
           patients to investigate potential predictors of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain fresh tumor tissue for correlative studies from a subset of patients with small&#xD;
           cell lung cancer treated at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes followed by bortezomib IV on days&#xD;
      1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease may continue&#xD;
      to receive bortezomib alone in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of topotecan hydrochloride and bortezomib&#xD;
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose&#xD;
      preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten additional patients with small cell lung cancer are treated at the MTD. These patients&#xD;
      undergo tumor biopsy at baseline and before the second course of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor tissue is collected at baseline in all patients. Blood samples are collected at&#xD;
      baseline, at the beginning of courses 2 and 3, and after completion of study treatment.&#xD;
      Samples are examined for topoisomerase-1 levels by western blotting; BCL-2, BCL-xL, BAX, and&#xD;
      p27 by immunohistochemistry; hypoxia-inducible factor-1, plasminogen-activator inhibitor 1,&#xD;
      vascular endothelial growth factor, and osteopontin by immunoenzyme techniques; and NF-kB and&#xD;
      p27 nuclear expression by flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 34 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
