    <textblock>
      Approximately 40 qualified subjects with mild-to-moderate great toenail fungus infection will&#xD;
      be treated for 48 weeks with lacquer application to at least one affected great toenail. All&#xD;
      subjects will receive treatment with EcoNail™ lacquer.&#xD;

      This study will use a multi-center, open-label study design in subjects with onychomycosis of&#xD;
      at least one great toenail to assess the safety, local tolerability, and efficacy of chronic&#xD;
      daily ungual application of EcoNail™. Forty (40) evaluable subjects will apply study drug&#xD;
      daily to at least one affected great toenail for 48 weeks. The subjects must comply with all&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have mycologically confirmed distal subungual onychomycosis of at least&#xD;
             one or both great toenails (&quot;target toenails&quot;), defined as a positive result by&#xD;
             office-based KOH preparation (± Chlorazol B) and by laboratory culture demonstrating&#xD;
             one of more of the following organisms: T. rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans&#xD;
             and/or E. floccosum&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have target toenail showing 20-65% (+/- 2%) involvement as judged by the&#xD;
             clinical investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have target toenail showing great than or equal to 3 mm distal&#xD;
             involvement as judged by the clinical investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have target toenail showing great than or equal to 2 mm proximal clear&#xD;
             nail at the cuticle.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must agree not to apply other nail polish or related products to the affected&#xD;
