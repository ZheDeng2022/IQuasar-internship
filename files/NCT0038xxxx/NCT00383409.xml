      Multivitamins (MVi) are broadly used by cancer patients to improve overall health and energy.&#xD;
      Fatigue is a common symptom in cancer patients including those receiving radiation therapy.&#xD;
      We conducted a trial of MVi versus placebo in patients with breast cancer (BC) undergoing&#xD;
      radiation therapy (Rxt) to evaluate if MVi would affect fatigue and quality of life. We&#xD;
      randomized patients at the beginning of Rxt treatment to either placebo or Centrum Silver®&#xD;
      (Wyeth-Whitehall laboratory). At the middle of the radiation treatments patients were&#xD;
      switched from placebo to MVi and vice versa. Patients answered to the EORTC QLQ C-30 quality&#xD;
      of life (QOL) and Chalder Fatigue Questionnaires at the beginning, the time of switching and&#xD;
      at the end of Rxt. We found that both groups experienced significant decreases in general and&#xD;
      physical fatigue at the end of the course of placebo compared to the assessment prior to this&#xD;
      treatment. We also observed significant improvements in functional and symptoms in the&#xD;
      patients on placebo. When we compared different groups of patients we also observed&#xD;
      significantly lower rates of physical and general fatigue in the patients who had just&#xD;
      finished a course of placebo as compared to patients finishing course of MVi. We conclude&#xD;
      that MVi do not improve radiation related fatigue, and may in fact have a deleterious effect&#xD;
      on fatigue and decrease QOL in patients with BC undergoing Rxt.&#xD;

      Multivitamins (MVi) are broadly used by cancer patients to improve overall health and energy.&#xD;
      Fatigue is a common symptom in cancer patients including those receiving radiation therapy.&#xD;
      We conducted a double blind randomized cross-over trial of MVi versus placebo in patients&#xD;
      with breast cancer (BC) undergoing radiation therapy (Rxt) to evaluate if MVi would affect&#xD;
      fatigue and quality of life. We randomized forty patients at the beginning of Rxt treatment&#xD;
      to either placebo or Centrum Silver® (Wyeth-Whitehall laboratory). At the middle of the&#xD;
      radiation treatments patients were switched from placebo to MVi and vice versa. Patients&#xD;
      answered to the EORTC QLQ C-30 quality of life (QOL) and Chalder Fatigue Questionnaires at&#xD;
      the beginning, the time of switching and at the end of Rxt. When we analyzed the same group&#xD;
      of patients throughout the treatment periods, we found that both groups experienced&#xD;
      significant decreases in general (p = 0.009; p = 0.001) and physical fatigue scores (p =&#xD;
      0.031; p = 0.029) at the end of the course of placebo compared to the assessment prior to&#xD;
      this treatment. We also observed significant improvements in functional (p = 0.026) and&#xD;
      symptoms (p = 0.016) score scales of the QOL questionnaire in the patients on placebo. No&#xD;
      significant changes were elicited with the use of MVi. When we compared different groups of&#xD;
      patients we also observed significantly lower rates of physical and general fatigue in the&#xD;
      patients who had just finished a course of placebo as compared to patients finishing course&#xD;
      of MVi (0 vs 25% p = 0.035 for both types of fatigue). We conclude that MVi do not improve&#xD;
      radiation related fatigue, and may in fact have a deleterious effect on fatigue and decrease&#xD;
      QOL in patients with BC undergoing Rxt. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings.&#xD;
