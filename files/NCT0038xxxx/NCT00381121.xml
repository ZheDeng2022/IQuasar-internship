  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each year chronic kidney disease (CKD) claims the lives of millions of people worldwide.&#xD;
      Costs for patient care are in excess of 2.4 billion dollars in the US alone. At the moment&#xD;
      most kidney diseases are of unknown etiology, are classified according to a microscopic&#xD;
      description of the kidney tissue obtained on biopsy and are treated with non-specific&#xD;
      therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each kidney contains millions of filter units called nephrons. The nephron consists of a&#xD;
      glomerulus and a tubule. The glomerulus filters the blood of waste products, while retaining&#xD;
      larger molecules that are required for the body to function properly. The filtered fluid then&#xD;
      passes through the tubule, where salts, acids and water are regulated to keep the body in a&#xD;
      normal metabolic state. After the filtered fluid passes through the tubule it is collected in&#xD;
      the bladder as urine. Diseases, which affect the glomeruli or tubules result in kidney&#xD;
      damage. Once kidney function is lost it is generally not recoverable and the only option for&#xD;
      a patient's survival is dialysis or transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to provide a platform, which will enable researchers with&#xD;
      different areas of expertise, to investigate the molecular markers and pathways of kidney&#xD;
      disease and its progression. Our goal is to increase our understanding of kidney health&#xD;
      issues and to develop new prevention and treatment strategies which will be shared with the&#xD;
      medical community and the public.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals seen in the nephrology clinic at the University of Michigan will be eligible to&#xD;
      enroll in this study. Their clinical data will be recorded, blood and urine samples will be&#xD;
      collected and if a biopsy is performed as a part of their standard medical care then a small&#xD;
      sample will be reserved for use in the study after all pathological evaluations required for&#xD;
      patient care are completed. Biological samples will be available for biochemical, molecular&#xD;
      biological and genetic testing and for correlation of these parameters to the individuals&#xD;
      clinical data in future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advances in the understanding of kidney disease may 1) provide methods of early detection of&#xD;
      disease, 2) identify molecular markers that will help physician prescribe the most&#xD;
      appropriate and beneficial treatments, 3) identify targets for the development of new&#xD;
      treatments, and 4) decrease the enormous cost of caring for individuals with CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Create a biobank enabling the study of kidney disease from the perspectives of&#xD;
           epidemiology, genetics and molecular biology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Create a resource for the study of kidney disease, which will enable the researchers at&#xD;
           the University of Michigan to work collaboratively toward the elucidation of the&#xD;
           molecular pathways, which cause kidney disease.&#xD;
