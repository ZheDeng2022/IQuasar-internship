      45 women and 45 men, all healthy and sexually active, 21-45 years old, without HIV infection,&#xD;
      will be enrolled in Francistown and Gaborone, Botswana. Volunteers will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either 0.1% or 0.25% UC-781 carbomer gel or placebo gel (3 arms. Women will be&#xD;
      instructed to apply gel intravaginally, morning and evening, and prior to sex (always with&#xD;
      male condom use) for 14 consecutive days. Men will be instructed to apply gel topically for&#xD;
      14 consecutive nights, before bed, allow to dry overnight, and wash it off in the morning.&#xD;
      Additionally instructed never to use gel during sex but always to use condoms. Volunteers&#xD;
      will be seen weekly for evaluation of symptoms, laboratory toxicities, genital exam findings&#xD;
      (with colposcopy for women, and plasma drug levels. Acceptability will be assessed in focus&#xD;
      groups in the month after completing gel use.&#xD;
