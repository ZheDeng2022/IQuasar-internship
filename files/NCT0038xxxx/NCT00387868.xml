  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study for patients with thymoma or thymic carcinoma thought to be at&#xD;
      significant risk for recurrence following surgical removal. This study involves the use of&#xD;
      combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy prior to surgery, in hopes of increasing the&#xD;
      chances of complete resection. The chemoradiotherapy protocol is one which has been used&#xD;
      extensively for other diseases, and the side effects are therefore well-documented. Patients&#xD;
      with thymomas thought to be at significant risk for recurrence (by x-ray and pathology&#xD;
      criteria) will be allowed to participate, and will undergo combined chemotherapy with&#xD;
      radiation to the chest followed by surgical removal of the tumor and postoperative&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The main outcome measured will be the rate of pathological complete response&#xD;
      (e.g. no active tumor in the resected specimen) to the preoperative treatment. Patients will&#xD;
      receive postoperative treatment based on surgical and pathologic criteria.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Past experience has suggested that the ability to completely remove the thymoma using surgery&#xD;
      is important in preventing recurrence. Strategies which would help the surgeon's ability to&#xD;
      completely remove the tumor therefore need to be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study represents a multi-institutional, phase II pilot trial of preoperative&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy followed by surgical resection and postoperative chemotherapy for patients&#xD;
      with invasive thymoma or thymic carcinoma at significant risk for recurrence. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that this strategy will be well-tolerated and produce response and resectability rates&#xD;
      exceeding those previously published involving surgical resection alone, or preoperative&#xD;
      chemotherapy followed by surgery. Patients with locally advanced thymoma, based on&#xD;
      radiographic and biopsy criteria, will undergo pretreatment computed tomography (CT) scan and&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET) followed by concurrent (simultaneous) chemotherapy&#xD;
      (cisplatin and etoposide) and radiation. After this therapy, patients will be reassessed&#xD;
      using computed tomography (CT) and PET, and undergo surgical resection of their tumors.&#xD;
      Following resection, patients will be either observed, or treated with postoperative&#xD;
      chemotherapy, or chemotherapy and radiation. Correlative genomic, serologic and pathologic&#xD;
      studies will also be performed.&#xD;
