  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney disease affects about one out of three people with diabetes mellitus, a common medical&#xD;
      problem. Treatment of kidney disease with medications that lower blood pressure can slow the&#xD;
      kidney disease but there is no known cure. This study is designed to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      certain combination-based blood pressure lowering regimens (of FDA approved medications) are&#xD;
      better than single agent-based regimens for lowering blood pressure and further slowing or&#xD;
      preventing progression of this incurable disease&#xD;

      The long-range objective of this project is to prevent progression of diabetic nephropathy,&#xD;
      the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In most patients diabetic nephropathy&#xD;
      progresses inexorably to ESRD despite inhibition of the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system&#xD;
      with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II type 1 receptor&#xD;
      blockers (ARBs). The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) recruit a multiethnic cohort&#xD;
      of 78 young adults (ages 20-40) with type 1 (n=36) or type 2 (n=36) diabetes and overt&#xD;
      nephropathy (defined as a urine albumin/creatinine ratio &gt; 300 mg albumin/g creatinine) and&#xD;
      randomize in a double blind fashion to a control group consisting of ACEI-based therapy alone&#xD;
      (ramipril 40 mg once daily) or one of two experimental groups: a) ACEI + ARB (ramipril 40 mg&#xD;
      once daily plus losartan 100 mg once daily) or b) ACEI + mineralocorticoid receptor&#xD;
      antagonist (MRA) (ramipril 40 mg once daily plus spironolactone 25 mg once daily); 2) conduct&#xD;
      a 12-month prospective study to determine if proteinuria is reduced to a greater extent when&#xD;
      either the ARB or MRA is added to ACEi-based therapy. This study is powered to detect a 30%&#xD;
      greater reduction in 24-hour urine albumin/creatinine ratio in either experimental group&#xD;
      versus control (alpha = 0.05, beta=0.10, repeated measures analysis of variance). Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints to be examined include: (a) serum potassium and creatinine to assess safety, (b)&#xD;
      TGF-beta, as a surrogate marker for ongoing renal injury, (c) plasma renin activity,&#xD;
      angiotensin II and aldosterone levels and (d) plasma lipids and lipoprotein composition; and&#xD;
      3) perform repeated ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to examine the renoprotective&#xD;
      effect of the 3 different regimens at comparable 24-hour BP of &lt; 125/75 mmHg. The&#xD;
      deliverables include: 1) documentation of the safety of maximal dose combination therapy; 2)&#xD;
      the feasibility of utilizing 24-hr ABPM to establish BP independent renoprotective effects of&#xD;
      specific antihypertensive therapies; and 3) provide preliminary data for future large-scale&#xD;
      studies to test efficacy and safety of combining ACEi with MRA therapy on renal outcomes.&#xD;
