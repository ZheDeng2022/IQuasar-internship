      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor hypoxia has been shown to be a prognostic factor for local progression and prognosis in&#xD;
      several types of human cancers (1-4), including cervical carcinoma (5). Distribution of&#xD;
      oxygen within a tumor can diminish toward the less vascularized center of the tumor (6, 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoxia is an important factor in many pathological processes, including tumor formation,&#xD;
      where it has been associated with resistance to radiotherapy, malignant progression, and&#xD;
      metastasis. Although hypoxia is toxic to both cancer and normal cells, cancer cells undergo&#xD;
      genetic and adaptive changes that allow them to survive and even proliferate within a hypoxic&#xD;
      environment. These processes contribute to the malignant phenotype and to aggressive tumor&#xD;
      behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoxia has a negative effect on anti cancer treatment (8). Radiotherapy is a major treatment&#xD;
      modality for advanced cervical carcinomas and requires free radicals from oxygen to destroy&#xD;
      target cells, and cells in hypoxic areas were found to be resistant to radiation-induced cell&#xD;
      death (9). The gold standard for measuring hypoxia in tumors is the invasive technique of&#xD;
      using computerized oxygen-sensitive electrodes. This method is cumbersome and expensive and&#xD;
      has not become a general clinical tool for hypoxia measurement (10, 11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positron emission tomography (PET) becomes an interesting and promising diagnostic modality&#xD;
      for hypoxia imaging in tumor tissue. Several tracers were developed for this purpose and&#xD;
      Fluoromisonidazole (18FMISO) is the most extensively hypoxia tracer studied both in humans&#xD;
      and animals (12-15). Previous results for imaging hypoxia using FMISO showed the regional&#xD;
      distribution of tumor hypoxia, expressed as fractional hypoxic volume (16). However, its&#xD;
      major disadvantages lie on its slow clearance kinetics and its high lipophilicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18Ffluoroazomycinarabinofuranoside (18FAZA) is recently synthesized and introduced as a&#xD;
      hypoxia tracer in various tumor-bearing mice using PET and autoradiography with promising&#xD;
      results. (17). 18FAZA showed also superior biokinetics in comparison to 18F-MISO in animals&#xD;
      (18). The safety and feasibility of FAZA was evaluated recently in 10 patients with advanced&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The authors of this study concluded that PET&#xD;
      imaging with FAZA appears to be safe and feasible in patients with head and neck tumors.&#xD;
      (19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to visualize the tumor hypoxic tissue, the potential quantitative&#xD;
      changes and the biological behavior of cervical carcinoma (primary and / or lymph nodes)&#xD;
      before, during and after radiochemotherapy with the novel hypoxia PET tracer 18FAZA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-five patients with cervical carcinoma (T2Nx or TxN1) will be included in the present&#xD;
      study. In addition to the routine pre-therapeutical staging of cervical cancer, 18FAZA PET&#xD;
      will be performed before, during the planed radio/chemotherapy (short before brachytherapy)&#xD;
      and 3 months after the therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Synthesis and quality control 18FAZA (Research Center Seibersdorf)&#xD;
&#xD;
      18FMISO will be synthesized as previously described (20). The synthesis of 18F-FAZA will be&#xD;
      performed as follows (21):5 mg of the precursor&#xD;
      1-(2,3-diacetyl-5-tosyl-a-D-arabinofuranosyl)-2-nitroimidazole in 1 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide&#xD;
      were reacted with the mixture of azeotropically dried 18F-fluoride, 15 mg of Kryptofix 2.2.2.&#xD;
      (Merck), and 3.5 mg of K2CO3 at 100C for 5 min. After hydrolysis with 1 mL of 0.1 N NaOH (2&#xD;
      min,30C), 0.5 mL of 0.4N NaH2PO4 was added for neutralization. The product was purified first&#xD;
      using an alumina cartridge (Alu N light; Waters) and then high performance liquid&#xD;
      chromatography (HPLC) (Phenomenex Nucleosil C18; ethanol/NaH2PO4 buffer (5:95); flow,&#xD;
      4mL/min; detection ultraviolet (320nm), Na(Tl)). The product was obtained in radiochemical&#xD;
      yields of 20.7%+-3.5% (n=12) at end of the beam. After irradiations of 1 h at 35ÂµA, 9.1&#xD;
      +-1.4GBq (n=8) 18FFAZA will be isolated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [18F]FAZA PET imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      18FFAZA imaging will be performed in all patients after overnight fasting on a dedicated full&#xD;
      ring PET scanner (Advance, General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI). The patients&#xD;
      will be scanned subsequent to the administration of the activity (dynamic scan) and 2 hours&#xD;
      afterwards (static scan). For each image acquisition a 10-min transmission scan will be&#xD;
      performed. All images will be acquired in a 3D-mode with a matrix of 128x128. The dynamic&#xD;
      scan (pelvis) begins with the intravenous administration of 370 MBq 18FFAZA. Over the first&#xD;
      hour 21 frames will be acquired (6 frames 20s, 6 frames 30s, 2 frames 150s, 4 frames 300s, 3&#xD;
      frames 600s). Two hours after the application a 10-min static scan (pelvis + abdomen) will be&#xD;
      acquired. The images are reconstructed using an iterative algorithm (OSEM). In addition to&#xD;
      visual interpretation of the acquired images a semi quantitative analysis will be performed&#xD;
      by drawing regions of interest (ROIs) in tumor tissue (primary and lymphnodes). For these&#xD;
      ROIs both a standardized uptake value (SUV) and ratios to normal tissue (muscle) will be&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simultaneously to the FAZA PET scans blood sampling (10ml) will be drawn for measurements of&#xD;
      protein concentrations (VEGF, Osteopontin, PAI). In total, 30 ml blood will be collected from&#xD;
      each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation burden&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated radiation burden for 18FFAZA (370MBq) examination amounts about 12 mSv&#xD;
      (equivalent to a CT examination of the thorax).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks, Side effects, Toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fluorine-18(18F) labeled compound is obtained by nucleophilic substitution of a&#xD;
      tosylate-precursor with no-carrier-added 18F-fluoride in a specific activity of &gt; 74 MBq /&#xD;
      nmol. The administration of 370 MBq 18F-FAZA will therefore correspond to &lt; 5 nmol compound&#xD;
      and will not exert any pharmacologic or toxicologic effect. Similar radiopharmaceutical such&#xD;
      as 18FMISO showed no side effects in their clinical use in human (22)&#xD;
&#xD;
