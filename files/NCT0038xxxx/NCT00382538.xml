  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mid-second trimester medical terminations of pregnancy require admission to the hospital for&#xD;
      the length of time it takes a woman to abort. The current protocol at BMC uses intra-amniotic&#xD;
      digoxin injection the day prior to admission. The following day, the woman is admitted and&#xD;
      given sequential doses of misoprostol until delivery occurs. The average length of time&#xD;
      between the first dose of misoprostol and delivery is 12 hours, requiring most women to stay&#xD;
      overnight. This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study designed to&#xD;
      determine whether adding mifepristone significantly reduces the induction interval time (time&#xD;
      between starting the first misoprostol and delivery) required for a second trimester&#xD;
      termination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation Method: Women will be randomized using a computer-run random number table. Tablets&#xD;
      will be placed in capsules by the pharmacy according to the randomization chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding: Subjects will receive a capsule containing either 200 mg of mifepristone or 250 mg&#xD;
      Vitamin C. Neither she nor the researcher will be aware of which medication she receives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: The primary outcome measured will be the mean interval from first misoprostol dose&#xD;
      to fetal expulsion. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of women delivering within 24&#xD;
      hours from the first dose of misoprostol and the proportion of women with a complete delivery&#xD;
      not requiring additional treatment for retained placenta. We will also compare the amount of&#xD;
      pain medication used, as well as the length of hospital stay between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria Inclusion criteria: · Need for second trimester induction for termination&#xD;
      of pregnancy · Gestational age of 18-23 weeks · At least 18 years of age or 16 years old with&#xD;
      parental consent No medical contraindication to the use of digoxin and misoprostol for the&#xD;
      purposes of inducing abortion. · Able and willing to give informed consent in English or&#xD;
      Spanish&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Exclusion criteria: · Known allergy to mifepristone, misoprostol or&#xD;
      prostaglandins · Pre-existing intrauterine fetal demise · Premature preterm rupture of&#xD;
      membranes · IUD in place · History of chronic adrenal failure, porphyrias; or concurrent&#xD;
      long-term corticosteroid treatment Unable or unwilling to give informed consent in English or&#xD;
      Spanish&#xD;
&#xD;
      Involvement in the study will be as follows: on study day number one, all patients undergo an&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided amniocentesis with intra-amniotic injection of digoxin regardless of entry&#xD;
      into the study. Study patients will be randomized to the treatment or placebo group, and will&#xD;
      receive one of two similar-looking tablets containing the allocated medication. The tablet&#xD;
      will be swallowed in the clinic. The patient, researchers and the care providers will be&#xD;
      blinded to group assignment. All patients return to the hospital the the day after their&#xD;
      digoxin injection for induction. From this point on, the treatment of women enrolled and&#xD;
      those not enrolled in the study will be identical; they are admitted to the hospital and&#xD;
      induction for termination is begun using an initial 400mcg of misoprostol buccally. The&#xD;
      initial dose is followed by 200 mcg of misoprostol every six hours until delivery is&#xD;
      successful or 24 hours passes without delivery. Less than 5% of women require more than 24&#xD;
      hours of induction, and approximately 15% require extraction of the placenta if it does not&#xD;
      pass spontaneously after the fetus. The subjects enrolled will not differ from other&#xD;
      termination patients in regards to the following: 1. the number of appointments or time&#xD;
      required in the hospital 2. use of intra-amniotic digoxin 3. termination method; misoprostol,&#xD;
      400 mg, followed by 200 mg every 6 hours 4. pain medication administration (PCA narcotics) 5.&#xD;
      Medical evaluation of need to use other methods of completing abortion if 24 hours has&#xD;
      elapsed after first misoprostol dose without delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytic Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the length of induction interval for termination. The Kaplan-Meier&#xD;
      procedure will be utilized to create a survival curve for analysis of induction to delivery&#xD;
      interval by time. Demographic data for each group will also be compared to assure that there&#xD;
      are no other differences between groups. Chi -square analysis will be used for dichotomous&#xD;
      variables and t-tests for continuous variables.Study Size and Power:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A power calculation was performed for time from induction to delivery using a significant&#xD;
      value of 0.05 and power of 80% using a survival analysis power formula. We used our previous&#xD;
      data to estimate the mean time of induction and then estimated a likely delta (difference&#xD;
      between the two treatment groups) of 35%. The number of patients needed in each group using&#xD;
      this calculation is 32, and therefore the total number needed is 64.&#xD;
