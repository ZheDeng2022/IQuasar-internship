      It is possible to measure skeletal muscle tissue oxygenation (StO2) using near infrared&#xD;
      spectroscopy(NIRS). It is performed non invasively. We want to compare usually used invasive&#xD;
      methods for assessing adequacy of flow to StO2 in critically ill. Aim is to faster and non&#xD;
      invasively estimate adequacy of flow to make therapeutic algorithms efficient.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration and severity of tissue hypoxia have been related to increased mortality.&#xD;
      Maintenance of adequate oxygen delivery (DO2) is essential to preserve organ function, as a&#xD;
      sustained low DO2 is a path to organ failure and death. DO2 does not have influence on oxygen&#xD;
      consumption (VO2) until it reaches critically low values (DO2crit), when VO2 starts to fall.&#xD;
      Low cardiac output states (cardiogenic, hypovolemic and obstructive types of shock), anemic&#xD;
      and hypoxic hypoxemia are characterized by a decreased DO2 but preserved oxygen extraction&#xD;
      ratio (OER=the ratio of DO2 to VO2, VO2/ DO2) so that DO2crit remains normal. In distributive&#xD;
      shock, the oxygen extraction capability is altered so that the critical oxygen extraction&#xD;
      ratio is typically decreased. These situations are typically associated with an increased&#xD;
      DO2crit, and VO2 can become dependant on DO2 even when the latter is normal or elevated.&#xD;
      These observations help to characterize the four principal types of circulatory shock,&#xD;
      however this classification is somewhat simplistic as several types of alternations may&#xD;
      coexist, in particular in cardiogenic shock. Rhodes et al. reported that outcome was more&#xD;
      favorable in septic patients whose VO2 increased after dobutamine administration. DO2 also&#xD;
      increased in survivors. On the other hand DO2 did not increase in patients whose VO2 did not&#xD;
      increase. In dobutamine test proposed by Rhodes et al. the hemodynamic response was&#xD;
      influenced by cardiovascular reserve and the degree of stimulation of adrenoreceptors at&#xD;
      baseline. Unfortunately global measurements of DO2 and VO2 may not be sensitive enough to be&#xD;
      clinically relevant. They may fail to detect regional perfusion abnormalities as in&#xD;
      splanchnic circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) from the pulmonary artery is used for&#xD;
      the calculations of the VO2 and has been advocated as an indirect index of tissue of tissue&#xD;
      oxygenation and prognostic predictor in critically ill patients. Catheterization of pulmonary&#xD;
      artery is costly, has inherent risks and its usefulness remains under debate. Not&#xD;
      surprisingly the monitoring of central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) was suggested as a&#xD;
      simpler and chipper assessment of global DO2 to VO2 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a technique for continuous, non-invasive, bedside&#xD;
      monitoring of tissue oxygen saturation (StO2). Like pulse oximetry, NIRS uses the principles&#xD;
      of light transmission and absorption to non-invasively measure the concentrations of&#xD;
      oxygenated hemoglobin and reduced hemoglobin in tissue. NIRS offers greater tissue&#xD;
      penetration and does not discriminate between compartments. Therefore it provides a global&#xD;
      assessment of oxygenation in all vascular compartments (arterial, venous and capillary) in&#xD;
      sample volume of underlining tissue. We have previously shown that thenar muscle tissue&#xD;
      oxygen saturation during stagnant ischemia decreases slower in septic shock patients compared&#xD;
      to patients with severe sepsis, localized infection and healthy volunteers. This may be due&#xD;
      to microcirculatory or metabolic changes, and probably correlates to muscle tissue oxygen&#xD;
      consumption. The rate of StO2 decrease correlated with SOFA score, norepinephrine&#xD;
      requirement, and plasma lactate concentration. As recently described, StO2 in sample volume&#xD;
      of underlining tissue depends in vivo on 3 major determinants: the concentration in&#xD;
      oxy-hemoglobin, capillary recruitment and the vascular size (vasodilatation or constriction).&#xD;
      The StO2 during stagnant ischemia has then to be viewed in light of these determinants. The&#xD;
      gradual decrease (slope) of StO2 after cuff inflation-induced vascular occlusion depends&#xD;
      mainly on the augmentation of the concentration of deoxy-hemoglobin and estimates tissue&#xD;
      oxygen consumption and to a lesser degree on vessel de-recruitment. The StO2 upslope during&#xD;
      reperfusion (cuff deflation) can be analyzed in light of flow papers during&#xD;
      ischemia/reperfusion test. Vasodilatation after ischemia leads to recruitment of more vessels&#xD;
      and increase in the local blood flow, which in turn results in a StO2 increase. It remains&#xD;
      unclear which of the described changes is more influential, however this StO2 increase&#xD;
      mirrors the maximal local DO2 at the time of measurement. The development on NIRS signal&#xD;
      processing might be able to provide a clinical important tissue hemoglobin concentration&#xD;
      index and local oxygen consumption as shown by De Blasi et al., such an index may help to&#xD;
      clarify the mechanism(s) by which StO2 signal varies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study was to study skeletal muscle oxygen kinetics in low flow state due to&#xD;
      combined cardiogenic and septic circulatory failure, relate it with central heamodynamic&#xD;
      variables and outcome. We hypothesized that basal StO2 could relate to ScvO2, because blood&#xD;
      flowing through upper limb muscles importantly contributes to flow through superior vena&#xD;
      cava. The second hypothesis was that decrease of skeletal muscle OER and lower muscle oxygen&#xD;
      consumption are more pronounced in patients with septic component of circulatory failure due&#xD;
      to microcirculatory and metabolic changes seen in sepsis, what results in higher mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients Study protocol was approved by the National Ethics Committee of Slovenia, informed&#xD;
      consent was obtained from all patients or their relatives. Study was performed during October&#xD;
      2004 and January 2006. After initial hemodynamic resuscitation, transthoracic ultrasound&#xD;
      heart examination was performed in all patients admitted to our ICU. In patients with primary&#xD;
      heart disease, low cardiac output, and no signs of hypovolemia, a right heart catheterization&#xD;
      with a pulmonary artery floating catheter (PAFC)(Swan-Ganz CCOmboV CCO/SvO2/CEDV, Edwars Life&#xD;
      Sciences, USA) was performed after decision of treating physician. The site of insertion was&#xD;
      confirmed by the transducer waveform, the length of catheter insertion and chest radiography.&#xD;
      In all patients systemic arterial pressure was measured invasively using radial or femoral&#xD;
      arterial catheterization. Patients with inserted PAFC and signs of low flow state (cardiac&#xD;
      index less then 3.0 L/min/m2) were included in our study. PAFC data were calculating using&#xD;
      standard formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Localized infection, severe sepsis and septic shock were defined according to ACCP/SCCM&#xD;
      consensus conference definitions (1992). All patients received standard treatment of&#xD;
      localized infection, severe sepsis and septic shock including: source control, fluid&#xD;
      infusion, catecholamine infusion, organ failure replacement and/or support therapy, intensive&#xD;
      control of blood glucose and corticosteroid substitution therapy. Mechanically ventilated&#xD;
      patients were sedated with midazolam and/or propofol infusion and no paralytic agents were&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skeletal Muscle Oxygen Kinetics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thenar muscle StO2 was measured non-invasively by NIRS (15mm Probe, InSpectra™, Hutchinson&#xD;
      Technology Inc., USA). The values were continuously monitored and stored into a computer&#xD;
      using InSpectra ™ software. The StO2 was monitored before, during and after upper arm&#xD;
      ischemia-reperfusion test (UIRT) which was standardized as follows: a rapid cuff inflation&#xD;
      above elbow towards 260 mmHg to stop flow and to induce a decrease in StO2 for 90 seconds,&#xD;
      cuff deflation with continuous measurement of StO2 increase, overshooting and stabilization.&#xD;
      Measurements were performed immediately after PAFC insertion (in first 24 to 72 hours after&#xD;
      admission), the second measurement was performed 12-24 hours after the first measurement, the&#xD;
      third measurement was performed (only if patient was still alive and still had PAFC inserted)&#xD;
      in 48 hours after the first measurement. In spontaneously breathing patients and healthy&#xD;
      volunteers measurements were performed after 15 minutes of bed rest, avoiding any muscular&#xD;
      contractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In figure 1 schematic StO2 measurement line-drawing during UIRT is presented. The following&#xD;
      parameters were obtained: basal StO2 (%): basal StO2 before cuff inflation (maximal thenar&#xD;
      muscle StO2 was found by moving probe over thenar prominence); StO2 downslope during cuffing&#xD;
      (∆downStO2)%/sec); StO2 upslope (∆upStO2)%/sec) after cuffing release; overshootStO2 (%):&#xD;
      maximal StO2 after cuffing release. Inspectra measures content of hemoglobin in sample volume&#xD;
      of underlining tissue - Tissue Haemoglobin Index (THI). Average of muscle THI before and at&#xD;
      the end of cuff inflation was reported. These data were automatically obtained using the&#xD;
      Inspectra Analysis Program V2.0 (Hutchinson Technology Inc., USA) running in MatLab 7.0&#xD;
      (MathWorks Inc., USA). Estimation of muscle oxygen consumption (mVO2Nirs) and muscle oxygen&#xD;
      extraction ratio (mOER) were calculated using the following formulas:&#xD;
&#xD;
      mVO2Nirs= ΔdownStO2 * THI* (-1), mOER(%)= (1- basalStO2/overshootStO2)* 100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severity of disease Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA score) was calculated at&#xD;
      the time of each measurement to asses the level of organ dysfunction. Dobutamine,&#xD;
      norepinephrine requirement represented the dose of drug during the Sto2 measurement. Used of&#xD;
      levosimendan is reported if patient received the drug less then a week before inclusion in&#xD;
      the study. Use of intra-aortic balloon pump during ICU stay is reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory analysis Blood was withdrawn from superior vena cava approximately 2cm above right&#xD;
      atrium and pulmonary artery was performed at the time of each StO2 measurement to determine&#xD;
      ScvO2 (%) and SvO2(%) respectively. In view of the known problems arising during sampling&#xD;
      from pulmonary artery, including the possibility of contaminating artery blood with pulmonary&#xD;
      capillary blood, all samples from this site were withdrawn over 30s, using a low-negative&#xD;
      pressure technique, and never with the balloon inflated . A standard volume of 1mL of blood&#xD;
      was obtained from each side after withdrawn of dead-space blood and flushing fluid. All&#xD;
      measurements were made using a cooximeter (RapidLab 1265, Bayer HealthCare, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma lactate concentration was measured using enzymatic colorimetric method (Lactate, Roche&#xD;
      Diagnostics, Germany) at the time of each StO2 measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis StO2 curves were analyzed by Inspectra Analysis Program V2.0. Linear regression&#xD;
      was used to extrapolate the rate of Δdown- and Δup- StO2 during UIRT. Data was expressed as&#xD;
      median ± standard deviation (SD). Non parametric test: Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Wilcoxon and&#xD;
      Fisher exact test were used (SPSS 10.0 for Windows ™, SPSS Inc., USA). Spearman correlation&#xD;
      test was used to determine correlation. To compare muscle tissue StO2 variables during UIRT,&#xD;
      ScvO2 and SvO2: bias, systemic disagreement between the measurements (mean difference between&#xD;
      two measurements), and precision, the random error in measuring (standard deviation of bias),&#xD;
      were calculated. The limits of agreement were arbitrary set by Bland and Altman as the bias±&#xD;
      2 SD. To determine the variables independently associated with survival uni- and multivariate&#xD;
      logistic regression (Forward Stepwise (Likelihood Ratio)) was used. The p value of &lt;0.05&#xD;
      (2-tailed) was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
