  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At the end of 2004 there were more than 40 million people infected worldwide with HIV, with&#xD;
      an estimated 16,000 new infections every day (Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS&#xD;
      [UNAIDS], 2004). The HIV epidemic threatens whole societies particularly in Africa and Asia&#xD;
      and rates of infections in the Western countries have also increased over the last few years.&#xD;
      However, despite more than 15 years of research, an effective vaccine against HIV and&#xD;
      acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has still not been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is considerable evidence that cellular immune responses can effectively control HIV-1&#xD;
      replication during acute and chronic infections thereby possibly protecting individuals from&#xD;
      infection and preventing the spread of HIV. To be truly effective in the general population,&#xD;
      a vaccine must induce responses specific to immunologically conserved regions. The&#xD;
      epitope-based vaccine MVA-mBN32 represents a very logical approach to this problem because of&#xD;
      its potential to elicit a polyfunctional immune response and to focus these responses to&#xD;
      conserved epitopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a recombinant MVA-BNÂ® vaccine&#xD;
      expressing cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and helper T lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes of HIV-1&#xD;
      (MVA-mBN32) in 36 healthy volunteers will be examined. This will include a full analysis of&#xD;
      CD4+ T helper cells and CD8+ CTL responses to these epitopes, to establish the potential of&#xD;
      such a homologous prime-boost vaccine approach to induce a broad cell-mediated response to&#xD;
      different HIV antigens.&#xD;
