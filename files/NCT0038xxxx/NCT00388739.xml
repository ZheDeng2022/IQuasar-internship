      Hypothesis: Initiating chronic management treatment plans in conjunction with an asthma&#xD;
      educational intervention in the pediatric Emergency Department (ED) with anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      medication will result in an improvement of ED revisits (and unscheduled return visits).&#xD;
      Chronic management intitiation in conjunction with an asthma educational intervention in the&#xD;
      pediatric ED with anti-inflammatory medication will also result in improved Quality of Life&#xD;
      measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims: 1. To demonstrate that the initiation controller medication therapy in&#xD;
      conjunction with asthma education will result in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Decreased return ED visits (or unscheduled primary care physician visits) as compared to&#xD;
           a control group over a 12 month period&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Improved Quality of Life as measured by Bukstein's ITG Quality of Life measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2. To describe the relationship of the initiation of controller medication therapy in&#xD;
           conjunction with asthma education with well child visits, missed school/daycare days and&#xD;
           behavioral capabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Objective: To determine the impact of beginning chronic asthma medication regimens after&#xD;
           an educational intervention in the ED in pediatric patients 1-18 years of age with mild&#xD;
           to moderate persistent asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Long-term goal/purpose: To demonstrate the success of a model of care that utilizes the&#xD;
           emergency department physician to initiate National Asthma Education and Prevention&#xD;
           Program (NAEPP) guided chronic asthma therapy in children 1-18 years of age. This model&#xD;
           will attempt to bridge the gap in initiation of chronic asthma therapy currently left by&#xD;
           a failure of both emergency department and primary care physicians.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a health outcomes intervention trial that utilizes a randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      (non-placebo controlled) with two separate arms. The study will be conducted in the ED of&#xD;
      Texas Children's Hospital, a tertiary care facility that evaluates over 80,000 children per&#xD;
      year. IRB approval has been obtained, and guardians of patients 1-18 years of age will be&#xD;
      consented for enrollment. All children will receive standardized burst steroids and&#xD;
      broncholdilators (albuterol), however, patients will be randomized to a control and&#xD;
      intervention group. Randomization will occur utilizing assignment by a randomized number&#xD;
      table. The randomization scheme will then be packaged into sealed envelopes concealed to the&#xD;
      educational interventionist at the time of enrollment. Once the patient is enrolled, the&#xD;
      interventionist will open the sealed envelope revealing assignment to intervention or&#xD;
      control. The study will utilize a post hoc analysis of age subgroups (1 through 5 years of&#xD;
      age and 6 through 18 years of age).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrollees involved must be a child who is 1-18 years of age, with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      persistent asthma or reactive airway disease and no other cardiovascular or pulmonary disease&#xD;
      not currently on the NAEPP recommended chronic care regimen for controller medication&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients without a physician's confirmed diagnosis of asthma. Children with concurrent&#xD;
      cardiovascular or pulmonary disease. Patients will also be excluded if they do not speak&#xD;
      English or Spanish as their primary language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility. Any child with a diagnosis of asthma meeting an inclusion criteria of an acute&#xD;
      exacerbation of asthma in the emergency department of Texas Children's Hospital will be&#xD;
      considered for this study. The patient's family must use English or Spanish as a first&#xD;
      language. This study will draw upon pediatric emergency department physicians currently&#xD;
      trained through the Texas Emergency Department Asthma Surveillance project for classification&#xD;
      of chronic severity. Any child who has been identified as having mild or moderate or severe&#xD;
      persistent chronic asthma will be eligible for the study as long as he/she is not on the&#xD;
      NAEPP recommended chronic care regimen. Procedure. Once informed consent is obtained,&#xD;
      demographic information will be collected as well as information regarding the severity of&#xD;
      the acute disease. As per standard ED asthma educational intervention protocol through the&#xD;
      TEDAS intervention project, all patients will undergo asthma education utilizing the TEDAS ED&#xD;
      asthma platform. This is a brief 20-30 minute personalized laptop-driven intervention&#xD;
      delivered by one of the trained TEDAS interventionists. Patients that are enrolled will be&#xD;
      randomly entered into either a treatment or control arm. Control vs intervention arms. All&#xD;
      children (control and treatment arm) will be given a burst dose of steroids (4 days of&#xD;
      prednisone, 1mg/kg/dose to a maximum of 40 mg/dose to be given twice a day) at discharge from&#xD;
      the ED. All children 1-5 years of age will also receive standardized discharge medication&#xD;
      instructions for using albuterol nebulizer treatments: they will receive a prescription for&#xD;
      2.5mg of albuterol in 3cc Normal Saline for aerosol use via compressor 3 times a day as a&#xD;
      chronic care regimen if they are either in the treatment arm and 1-5 years of age or if they&#xD;
      are in the control group and already own a nebulization compressor. Children in the control&#xD;
      group that do not own a nebulization compressor will be given a prescription for an albuterol&#xD;
      MDI with mask and spacer with instructions to deliver 2 puffs (90mcg per actuation) 3 times a&#xD;
      day as a standard chronic care regimen. Instructions to follow-up with their primary care&#xD;
      physician in 3-5 days (as is standard care practice) will be given at discharge for patients&#xD;
      in the control or treatment arm. Treatment arm for patients 1-5 years of age. Patients 1-5&#xD;
      years of age who are randomly assigned to the treatment arm will be given a one month supply&#xD;
      as well as a prescription (for a 6 month supply) for Pulmicort respules (children with mild&#xD;
      persistent disease will receive 0.25 mg bid whereas children with moderate or severe&#xD;
      persistent disease will receive 0.5 mg bid). Those children 1-5 years of age who do not have&#xD;
      a nebulization compressor delivery system at home will be provided one at no cost to the&#xD;
      patient as part of the study if randomized to the intervention group. Upon the one month&#xD;
      follow-up call after the index ED visit, children who have improved symptoms may have reduced&#xD;
      treatment regimens as follows: children with mild persistent disease will decrease therapy to&#xD;
      0.25 mg qd, children with moderate persistent disease will decrease therapy to 0.5mg qd, and&#xD;
      children with severe persistent disease will continue on 0.5mg bid dosing of Pulmicort&#xD;
      respules. Children with worsening symptoms at one month will be referred back to their&#xD;
      primary care physician or emergency department at Texas Children's Hospital for further&#xD;
      evaluation. Control vs intervention arms. Children who are 6-18 years of age and randomized&#xD;
      to the control group will be given a standardized steroid burst at discharge from the ED as&#xD;
      outlined above. Additionally, they will receive standardized discharge medication&#xD;
      instructions for using albuterol nebulizer treatments: they will receive a prescription for&#xD;
      2.5mg of albuterol in 3cc Normal Saline for aerosol use via compressor every 3 times a day as&#xD;
      a chronic care regimen if they already own a nebulization compressor. Children who are 6-18&#xD;
      years of age and randomized to either the control group or treatment group and do not own a&#xD;
      nebulization compressor will be given a prescription for an albuterol MDI with spacer with&#xD;
      instructions to deliver 2 puffs (90mcg per actuation) 3 times a day as a standard chronic&#xD;
      care regimen. Treatment arm for patients 6-18 years of age. Children who are randomized to&#xD;
      the intervention group will receive a Pulmicort TBH (200mcg/puff) with instructions to&#xD;
      deliver 1 puff per twice a day for mild persistent disease or 2 puffs twice a day if they are&#xD;
      of moderate or severe persistent disease. Instructions to follow-up with their primary care&#xD;
      physician in 3-5 days (as is standard care practice) will be given at discharge for patients&#xD;
      in the control or treatment arm. Upon the one month follow-up call after the index ED visit,&#xD;
      children who have improved symptoms may have reduced treatment regimens as follows: children&#xD;
      with mild persistent disease will decrease therapy to Pulmicort TBH (200mcg/puff) 1 puff once&#xD;
      per day for mild persistent disease or 2 puffs once per day if they are of moderate&#xD;
      persistent disease, but will remain on 2 puffs twice a day if they are of severe persistent&#xD;
      disease. Children with worsening symptoms at one month will be referred back to their primary&#xD;
      care physician or emergency department at Texas Children's Hospital for further evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up. All children (intervention and control groups) will receive follow-up calls at 14&#xD;
      days, and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Queries for primary and secondary outcomes will be made.&#xD;
      Patients' families will be mailed a gift certificate for a local fast-food restaurant or toy&#xD;
      store as a token of gratitude for their time after each follow-up call (5$ per contact for a&#xD;
      maximum of $30 of gift certificates). The regimen for phone-follow is outlined in the PI's&#xD;
      Educational Intervention Study (Sockrider, et al. Delivering Tailored Asthma Family Education&#xD;
      in a Pediatric Emergency Room Setting: A Pilot Study. Pediatrics, in press). The one month&#xD;
      re-evaluation is only to ascertain that the drug is being used as per recommended usage (ie&#xD;
      as per FDA approved indications). Should the drug be changed by the primary care physician,&#xD;
      the patient will be left on the drug prescribed by the primary care physician. It is&#xD;
      important to remember, as noted in my previous cover letter, that this is not a trial to test&#xD;
      the efficacy of a drug, but an intervention in health outcomes research to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of starting controller medications on health care utilization while assessing asthma&#xD;
      outcomes. There will be no need to contact the PCP after one-month as the initital contact&#xD;
      with the PCP will include an explanation for decreasing the dose of steroids after the acute&#xD;
      excaerbation to the dosing recommended by the NAEPP guidelines after the first month unless&#xD;
      the patient is experiencing an acute exacerbation. If the PCP changes the therapy, this will&#xD;
      be an important outcome to track as this is both relevant and assures generalibility of the&#xD;
      findings. Unlike a drug efficacy trial, this trial is intended to measure the health outcomes&#xD;
      of the ED intervention of STARTING chronic care. The additional measures for the one month&#xD;
      follow-up only assure the drug is being delivered as per initital ED discussion (to include&#xD;
      the stepdown) or as per the PCP recommendations. If the PCP instructs the parent not to&#xD;
      change the dose or to alter the dose, then this will be taken as priority and the PCP change&#xD;
      in plan will be noted and its impact analyzed.&#xD;
