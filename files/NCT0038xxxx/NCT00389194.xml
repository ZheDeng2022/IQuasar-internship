      The main objective of the study is to assess changes in fat distribution over 48 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment in patients who currently successfully use zidovudine (AZT) and lamivudine (3TC) as&#xD;
      part of their regimen and who will either continue these antiretrovirals or who will switch&#xD;
      these antiretrovirals to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC). Each of&#xD;
      these medications is commonly used for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Combinations of two nucleoside analogue RT inhibitors (NRTI) are by far the most commonly&#xD;
      utilized backbone of combination antiretroviral regimens upon which additional third or&#xD;
      fourth agents, a non-nucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI) or a (boosted) protease inhibitor (PI),&#xD;
      confer sufficient potency for long-term efficacy. The choice of the specific two NRTI is made&#xD;
      on the basis of potency and durability, short-and long-term toxicities, drug-drug&#xD;
      interactions, the propensity to select for resistance mutations, and dosing convenience.&#xD;
      Currently, the most frequently used NRTI combination is zidovudine plus lamivudine, often&#xD;
      co-formulated as Combivir®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The thymidine analogues NRTI have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the lipodystrophy&#xD;
      syndrome and of peripheral lipoatrophy in particular. Exposure to zidovudine is associated&#xD;
      with a slower and possibly lesser degree of limb fat loss than exposure to stavudine. The&#xD;
      mechanisms by which thymidine analogue NRTI contribute to lipoatrophy remain uncertain,&#xD;
      although there is evidence that drug-induced mitochondrial toxicity at the level of&#xD;
      subcutaneous adipose tissue is involved2 3. NRTI are known inhibitors of mitochondrial DNA&#xD;
      polymerase gamma and greater degrees of mtDNA depletion in subcutaneous adipose tissue are&#xD;
      associated with greater loss of limb fat as measured by DEXA. In addition, NRTI may&#xD;
      detrimentally affect mitochondrial function by mechanisms other than mtDNA depletion. It has&#xD;
      also been postulated that the normal regional distribution of body fat may be under&#xD;
      hypothalamic autonomic neuronal control, and that effects of NRTI on the central and/or&#xD;
      peripheral autonomic pathways may be underlying the selective loss of fat in subcutaneous but&#xD;
      not in central regions of the body4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal of thymidine analogues from the antiretroviral regimens of patients with clinical&#xD;
      signs of lipodystrophy (and replacing it by abacavir or in more recent studies by tenofovir)&#xD;
      has been demonstrated to be able to partially revert limb fat loss in a number of studies,&#xD;
      including randomized placebo-controlled trials 5-10. Of note, most patients in these studies&#xD;
      had stavudine replaced. Carr11 and Martin6 reported an increase in limb fat of 0.39 kg and&#xD;
      1.26 kg 24 and 104 weeks, respectively, after replacing stavudine or zidovudine by abacavir&#xD;
      in the Mitox study (the majority of patients was on a stavudine-based regimen at entry, the&#xD;
      minority on a ZDV-based regimen). Moyle8 reported an increase of 1.08 kg of limb fat 48 weeks&#xD;
      after withdrawal of thymidine analogues. The reported increases in limb fat have been&#xD;
      greatest in patients that were pretreated with stavudine compared to patients pretreated with&#xD;
      zidovudine. The rate of peripheral fat loss is slower in patients using zidovudine compared&#xD;
      to patients using stavudine, suggesting that patients using stavudine may have usually lost&#xD;
      more peripheral fat to begin with than patients using zidovudine. Therefore the potential&#xD;
      increase in peripheral fat after withdrawal of the thymidine analogue is expected to be&#xD;
      greatest in patients using stavudine. The current study, in contrast to earlier studies, will&#xD;
      be limited to patients who with respect to thymidine analogue exposure have solely been&#xD;
      exposed to zidovudine and never to stavudine. In order to assure that participants in our&#xD;
      study have already had the opportunity to lose a reasonable amount of peripheral fat, we will&#xD;
      only include patients who have been continuously treated with zidovudine and lamivudine for&#xD;
      at least 2 years. Nolan12 reported that treatment-naïve patients receiving zidovudine-based&#xD;
      therapy, after 3 years had lost an average of 31% of limb fat compared to baseline12.&#xD;
      Patients who continue to use zidovudine appear to continue to progressively loose limb fat at&#xD;
      a rate of several percentage-points per year. By limiting our sample to patients who have&#xD;
      been treated with zidovudine and lamivudine for over 2 years we can be confident that the&#xD;
      average loss of limb fat is large enough to allow for an objectively measurable and&#xD;
      statistically significant regain in limb fat to occur after discontinuation of zidovudine and&#xD;
      lamivudine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continued treatment with zidovudine plus lamivudine is expected to result in a (further)&#xD;
      decrease in the mass of peripheral adipose tissue. Switching to emtricitabine plus tenofovir&#xD;
      disoproxil fumarate is expected to result in an increase or at least the absence of a further&#xD;
      loss of peripheral adipose tissue. The combination of emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil&#xD;
      fumarate is an attractive backbone of antiretroviral combination therapy. This combination&#xD;
      has potent antiretroviral activity, has a favorable resistance profile, ease of once-daily&#xD;
      dosing, can be conveniently co-formulated in a single tablet, has no special food&#xD;
      requirements, is well tolerated, and thus far has not been particularly associated with the&#xD;
      occurrence of mitochondrial toxicity or lipoatrophy. With respect to the latter, the recent&#xD;
      Gilead 903 trial has been very informative in the sense that no limb fat wasting (measured by&#xD;
      DEXA) was observed between 96 and 144 weeks of treatment as opposed to the progressive limb&#xD;
      fat loss which was seen in patients randomized to the stavudine-containing control arm13.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we therefore aim to demonstrate a small but statistically significant mean&#xD;
      increase in peripheral body fat in the patients who switch to emtricitabine and tenofovir&#xD;
      disoproxil fumarate as opposed to a further decrease in peripheral fat in the patients who&#xD;
      continue the use of zidovudine and lamivudine. Such increases in peripheral fat are not&#xD;
      expected to be observable for the treating physicians and the patients themselves. However,&#xD;
      the demonstration of even a small sub-clinical effect will provide important information for&#xD;
      future patient management with respect to strategies on how to best prevent progressive&#xD;
      lipoatrophy. The Mitox study demonstrated that substituting abacavir for stavudine resulted&#xD;
      in an increase in limb fat of 390 grams after 24 weeks11. This increase was likewise not&#xD;
      noticeable to clinicians and patients, and could only be detected with the use of DEXA&#xD;
      scanning. Nevertheless, the results of Mitox had a huge impact on the management of patients:&#xD;
      clinicians started to pro-actively substitute other compounds for stavudine, and to exclude&#xD;
      stavudine from first-line regimens in order to prevent (progression of) lipoatrophy. If our&#xD;
      study would demonstrate a similar increase in peripheral fat in patients substituting&#xD;
      emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for zidovudine and lamivudine, this could&#xD;
      potentially likewise impact on the continued long-term use of ZDV-based regimens. Although&#xD;
      the cleanest comparison would be to replace only zidovudine by tenofovir disoproxil fumarate,&#xD;
      we also replace lamivudine by emtricitabine. Given that most experts agree that the&#xD;
      difference between lamivudine and emtricitabine is probably not very important and&#xD;
      emtricitabine has the additional advantage of allowing the possible use of the fixed dose&#xD;
      once daily combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada®), we have&#xD;
      chosen to replace lamivudine by emtricitabine as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: Antiretroviral regimens containing emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate&#xD;
      might be associated with a lower incidence and severity of lipoatrophy. In this study we&#xD;
      compare the effect of proactively switching zidovudine and lamivudine to emtricitabine plus&#xD;
      tenofovir disoproxil fumarate on peripheral fat loss with continued lamivudine and&#xD;
      zidovudine-based treatment in HIV-1 infected adults also receiving a non-nucleoside reverse&#xD;
      transcriptase inhibitor or (boosted) protease inhibitor. In the patients who discontinue the&#xD;
      use of zidovudine and switch to emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate we expect to&#xD;
      demonstrate a regaining or at least a lack of further loss of peripheral adipose tissue.&#xD;
