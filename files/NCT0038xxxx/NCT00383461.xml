      RATIONALE: Computer-based stop smoking programs may assist doctors in helping patients stop&#xD;
      smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well a computer-based stop smoking&#xD;
      program works in assisting doctors in helping adults stop smoking.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop an electronic medical record (EMR)-based strategy, the Computerized EMR-Assisted&#xD;
           Smoking Cessation Effort (CEASCE), for assisting physicians in treating tobacco use in&#xD;
           adults who are currently smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the reach and effectiveness of CEASCE by conducting a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
           in the Brigham and Women's Primary Care Practice-Based Research Network to determine its&#xD;
           effectiveness in increasing the proportion of smokers who receive treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the adoption, implementation, and short-term maintenance of CEASCE by measuring&#xD;
           the proportion and characteristics of providers who use CEASCE, the consistency with&#xD;
           which providers use the components of CEASCE, and changes in the use of CEASCE over&#xD;
           time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter study. Clinics are stratified&#xD;
      according to socioeconomic mix of patients and clinic type (community health center vs&#xD;
      hospital based vs community-based). Clinics are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (intervention): Primary care providers utilize the Computerized Electronic Medical&#xD;
           Record (EMR)-Assisted Smoking Cessation Effort (CEASCE) decision support system&#xD;
           comprising a 5-step algorithm (i.e., the &quot;5 A's&quot;). CEASCE provides reminders to primary&#xD;
           care providers to document smoking status using the &quot;5 A's&quot; (Ask, Advise, Assess,&#xD;
           Assist, and Arrange). Primary care providers input information into the CEASCE,&#xD;
           including asking the patient about their smoking status (Ask), the date they advised the&#xD;
           patient to quit (Advise), an assessment of the patient's readiness to quit (Assess), and&#xD;
           the action that was taken by the physician (Assist). When the primary care provider&#xD;
           inputs information, CEASCE automatically presents actions that are tailored to the&#xD;
           smoker's readiness to quit. Actions offered include setting a quit date, prescribing&#xD;
           medications, referral to a smoking-cessation counselor, discussing barriers to quitting,&#xD;
           counseling about the health risks of smoking, and an offer to help the smoker when she&#xD;
           is ready to quit. CEASCE automatically prints educational materials and sends an e-mail&#xD;
           to a smoking cessation counselor for patients who are agreeable to having a smoking&#xD;
           cessation counselor contact them. The smoking cessation counselor makes 4 attempts to&#xD;
           contact the patient by telephone within 30 days. If the patient is ready, the counselor&#xD;
           facilitates enrollment into a smoking cessation program and documents the outcome of the&#xD;
           referral. The referring primary care provider then receives an e-mail message regarding&#xD;
           the outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary care providers complete surveys after â‰¥ 6 months of experience with the intervention.&#xD;
      Some patients participate in an exit interview immediately after their primary care visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II (control): Patients receive current standard of care, including documentation of&#xD;
           smoking status and contact from a smoking-cessation counselor only after receiving a&#xD;
           referral.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 4,314 participants (primary care providers and patients) will&#xD;
      be accrued for this study.&#xD;
