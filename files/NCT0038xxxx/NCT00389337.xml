      BACKGROUND: In November 2003 the Medical Director at Copenhagen University Hospital,&#xD;
      Hvidovre, gathered a group of doctors involved in the diagnosis and treatment of patients&#xD;
      with sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMIS: To develop a fast and reliable tool that can guide the physician in the diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of the septic patient thereby reducing mortality and morbidity. The measurement of&#xD;
      markers of inflammation, coagulation, infection and specific bacterial antigens in the same&#xD;
      plasma sample will give insight to the pathogenesis of sepsis and SIRS and the bodies&#xD;
      responds to the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODES: Case-Control study nested in cohort. 300 patients admitted to the&#xD;
      hospital from 1.01.05 to 01.07.06. Copenhagen University Hospital, Hvidovre, an 800 beds&#xD;
      hospital, covers a part of Copenhagen with a wide variety in the population's socioeconomic&#xD;
      and cultural background. For the analysis of markers the luminex 100 lab analysis system is&#xD;
      used. It utilizes xMAP® technology which enables you to simultaneously assay up to 100&#xD;
      analytes in a single well of a microtiter plate, using very small sample volumes. Assay&#xD;
      development of a 15-plex is don In-house.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COWORKERS &amp; FOUNDING: The following departments at the hospital, are coworkers in the SPEEDI&#xD;
      study: Clinical Research Unit, Departments of Infectious Disease, Clinical Microbiology,&#xD;
      Clinical Biochemistry, Gastroenterology (incl. surgery), Intensive Care Unit, Emergency Room,&#xD;
      and the Hospital Board of Directors. All departments have research experience and a long&#xD;
      tradition of publication of scientific works. The study received founding for equipment and&#xD;
      salaries during the first phase of the study from the hospitals Board of Directors.&#xD;
      Applications to major public foundations in Denmark are awaiting answer. No commercial&#xD;
      interest are involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FUTURE APPLICATIONS: A second phase of the study including children admitted at the hospital&#xD;
      is in preparation. The very small sample volume is a great advantage in diagnosing infection&#xD;
      in children. The applications of the study results will hopefully provide the physician with&#xD;
      the needed tool for a fast and reliable diagnosis, prognosis and treatment guide for the&#xD;
      patients suffering from SIRS and sepsis.&#xD;
