    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a devastating chronic health condition that primarily affects&#xD;
      African-Americans. Painful episodes are the most frequent form of morbidity in SCD and the&#xD;
      most frequent reason for hospitalization. Cognitive-behavioral interventions for pain&#xD;
      management have shown efficacy for improving coping abilities, reducing the amount of&#xD;
      medication needed to manage pain, and improving daily functioning during painful episodes.&#xD;
      However, difficulties with disseminating and implementing cognitive-behavioral treatments&#xD;
      have resulted in almost no use of these techniques in pediatric settings. In South Carolina&#xD;
      these difficulties are compounded by social and geographical factors that pose particular&#xD;
      challenges. A major issue with implementing quality pain management protocols is the&#xD;
      difficulty with providing adequate practice and monitoring of the use of the techniques,&#xD;
      particularly given the rural population in South Carolina and transportation difficulties for&#xD;
      economically disadvantaged families. Due to a history of under-treating pain in SCD it is&#xD;
      also critical that psychological and medical treatments are presented in an integrated manner&#xD;
      so that these approaches are viewed as complimentary, not mutually exclusive, approaches to&#xD;
      pain management. Finally, we believe the same implementation issues for improving the use of&#xD;
      behavioral coping skills are also important for improving adherence to medication protocols&#xD;
      for appropriate home-based pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this proposal is to develop, implement, and evaluate a pain management&#xD;
      protocol that uses portable electronic devices and other technologies to increase the&#xD;
      practice of psychosocial pain management techniques, improve adherence to the overall&#xD;
      biopsychosocial pain management protocol, and improve the clinician's ability to track&#xD;
      progress with fewer office visits. In addition to addressing important dissemination issues,&#xD;
      by embedding methods to assess for adherence into the technology it will be possible to&#xD;
      continuously evaluate and modify protocol efficacy, resulting in a product that is effective,&#xD;
      empirically sound, and flexible. Participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention&#xD;
      or waitlist control condition. Those on the waitlist condition will receive the same study&#xD;
      procedures after a 2 month wait periods. We anticipate that the intervention will result in&#xD;
      better pain management and less impairment in the participants.&#xD;

      &quot;Home-Based Pain Management Protocol for Children with Sickle Cell Disease&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a devastating chronic health condition that&#xD;
      primarily affects African-Americans. Painful episodes are the most frequent form of morbidity&#xD;
      in SCD and the most frequent reason for hospitalization. Cognitive-behavioral interventions&#xD;
      for pain management have shown efficacy for improving coping abilities, reducing the amount&#xD;
      of medication needed to manage pain, and improving daily functioning during painful episodes.&#xD;
      However, difficulties with disseminating and implementing cognitive-behavioral treatments&#xD;
      have resulted in almost no use of these techniques in pediatric settings. In South Carolina&#xD;
      these difficulties are compounded by social and geographical factors that pose particular&#xD;
      challenges. A major issue with implementing quality pain management protocols is the&#xD;
      difficulty with providing adequate practice and monitoring of the use of the techniques,&#xD;
      particularly given the rural population in South Carolina and transportation difficulties for&#xD;
      economically disadvantaged families. Due to a history of under-treating pain in SCD it is&#xD;
      also critical that psychological and medical treatments are presented in an integrated manner&#xD;
      so that these approaches are viewed as complimentary, not mutually exclusive, approaches to&#xD;
      pain management. Finally, we believe the same implementation issues for improving the use of&#xD;
      behavioral coping skills are also important for improving adherence to medication protocols&#xD;
      for appropriate home-based pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: The purpose of this research is to implement and evaluate a pain management protocol&#xD;
      that uses portable electronic devices (PDA) and other technologies to increase the practice&#xD;
      of psychosocial pain management techniques, improve adherence to the overall biopsychosocial&#xD;
      pain management protocol, and improve the clinician's ability to track progress with fewer&#xD;
      office visits. In addition to addressing important dissemination issues, by embedding methods&#xD;
      to assess for adherence into the technology it will be possible to continuously evaluate and&#xD;
      modify protocol efficacy, resulting in a product that is effective, empirically sound, and&#xD;
      flexible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Assignment to Study Conditions. Families will be approached as part of their&#xD;
      routine psychosocial screenings currently conducted at the Children's Cancer and Blood&#xD;
      Disorder Center. Parental informed consent and child assent will be obtained from families&#xD;
      who meet inclusion criteria and agree to participate. Next, participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to waitlist control or intervention groups through the use of a random assignment&#xD;
      procedure. The researcher will explain details of the participation incentive system to the&#xD;
      families at this time, including the number of coupons assigned for each phase of study&#xD;
      completion and how to redeem coupons for toys and gift cards. All participants (waitlist&#xD;
      control group and intervention group) will complete the initial measures: Background&#xD;
      Information Questionnaire ; Structured Pain History Interview - Parent and Child Forms;&#xD;
      Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ); Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PEDS-QL);&#xD;
      Pediatric Pain Questionnaire (PPQ); Child Health Locus of Control during the initial meeting&#xD;
      and the second set of measures (CSQ, PEDS-QL and PPQ) 4 weeks after the initial meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive-Behavioral Training. Following completion of the intake measures, families in the&#xD;
      intervention condition will be provided education on pain medication use and explanation of&#xD;
      active versus passive methods of coping with pain and the cognitive-behavior techniques will&#xD;
      be introduced (Progressive Muscle Relaxation, Deep Breathing, Guided imagery and&#xD;
      Distraction). These techniques will be tailored to the child's preferences and recorded onto&#xD;
      the PDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, the researcher will review with the family the pain flow chart, how to complete the&#xD;
      Daily Pain and Activity Diary (DPAD), and use the PDA and Pain Management software.&#xD;
      Participants and their parents will be provided with detailed instructions regarding care of&#xD;
      PDA, who to contact if device is broken or lost, policy on continued participation if device&#xD;
      is lost, and a padded addressed stamped envelope to return the PDA should it require&#xD;
      attention. Three days after the initial visit families will be contacted to answer questions&#xD;
      and ensure implementation of skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families will also receive a weekly telephone contact at a pre-arranged time to address any&#xD;
      difficulties with protocol implementation. Pain diaries and frequency of skills practice will&#xD;
      be electronically downloaded approximately every three days using wireless synchronization&#xD;
      built into the PDA devices. One month following the initial session, all participants&#xD;
      (waitlist and intervention groups) will complete the PPQ, PEDS-QL and CSQ outcome measures.&#xD;
      Two months after the initial session, intervention participants will complete outcome&#xD;
      measures, including PPQ, PEDS-QL, CSQ and Protocol Evaluation Form (PEF). Six months after&#xD;
      the initial session, intervention participants will complete the follow-up measures,&#xD;
      including child report on the CSQ, and parent and child report on the PPQ and PEDS-QL. At&#xD;
      this time the participant's school will be contacted to obtain school attendance records so&#xD;
      as to document absences due to illness over the previous year and participants medical&#xD;
      records will be reviewed to examine patient's disease severity over the course of their study&#xD;
      participation time and their lives (Medical Record Review Form). Participants in the waitlist&#xD;
      control group will start participation in the intervention at the two month point, and follow&#xD;
      the procedures outlined above for the intervention condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concurrent Validity Study Procedures. Assessment of pain experience will be obtained for&#xD;
      study participants undergoing routine venipuncture as part of their clinic visit co-occurring&#xD;
      with study entry and study completion. Observational, physiological response, parent-report,&#xD;
      and self-report of pain experience will be obtained to provide convergent validity for&#xD;
      measures of pain report. A brief measure of medical coping style, the Child&#xD;
      Approach-Avoidance Rating Scale (CAARS; Appendix J) will be included to assess for shifts in&#xD;
      coping strategies employed by the participant during painful procedures. Participants and&#xD;
      parents will report on child pain experience before, during, and after the routine&#xD;
      venipuncture that is part of their clinic visit on the day of initial contact. Participant&#xD;
      response to routine venipuncture will also be captured via video recording to allow for an&#xD;
      in-depth analysis of observable pain behaviors. Pre-procedural heart rate will be taken at&#xD;
      three intervals: when the patient is first seen for the clinic visit, immediately prior to&#xD;
      the venipuncture, and immediately following the venipuncture. Additionally, small extra vial&#xD;
      of blood will be obtained (5mL) to measure the participant's level of endothelin-1, a&#xD;
      biological marker of pain. This extra vial of blood will not require an additional needle&#xD;
      stick. Finally, the medical records of all participants will be reviewed to obtain&#xD;
      information about disease course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECT POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will include up to 50 children and adolescents with SCD ranging between the ages&#xD;
      of 8 to 18 years of age and their primary caregivers. Participants will be recruited from the&#xD;
      Children's Cancer and Blood Disorder Center at Palmetto Health and four DHEC Children's&#xD;
      Rehabilitative Services sites (Orangeburg, Columbia, Florence and Sumter). Reviews of&#xD;
      behavioral interventions for rheumatoid arthritis or chronic low back pain have indicated&#xD;
      typical treatment effect sizes for pain experience and coping of d = 0.46 or greater (Astin&#xD;
      et al., 2002; van Tulder et al., 2001). Using this value as a basis for computing study power&#xD;
      (with an alpha level of .05) the study has an expected power of .80 with a sample size of 50&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion/Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria mandate that the families selected demonstrate adherence with standard SCD&#xD;
      treatment as indicated by reliable attendance to clinic visits, and chart notes demonstrating&#xD;
      adherence to prescribed medical care (e.g., follow-through with required specialist visits&#xD;
      and appointments for diagnostic procedures). Participants must have had at least 1 major pain&#xD;
      episode or 3 minor pain episodes in the previous 6 months that resulted in functional&#xD;
      impairment, such as reduced school attendance. Finally, individuals with developmental&#xD;
      disabilities such as mental retardation, autism, and Down syndrome, severe cognitive&#xD;
      limitations following stroke, or diagnoses of severe psychopathology will be excluded from&#xD;
      participation as these disorders have the potential to confound the findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONFIDENTIALITY: To minimize threats to confidentiality, only investigators will have access&#xD;
      to participant data. For data management purposes and confidentiality, subjects will be given&#xD;
      a unique identifier to use when recording data and electronically transmissions of data. This&#xD;
      arrangement minimizes risk to loss of patient confidentiality. All study staff, including&#xD;
      research assistants who may enter data, will be required to complete and pass the University&#xD;
      of South Carolina Human Subjects on-line tutorial prior to commencing their work on this&#xD;
      research project. All data will be stored in a locked file cabinet in the investigators&#xD;
      office at Palmetto Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED RESULTS AND IMPLICATIONS: We anticipate that the intervention will result in better&#xD;
      pain management and less impairment in the participants. These data will be used to seek&#xD;
      funding for a larger-scale study and in the development of interventions to decrease the&#xD;
      impact of pain on the lives of individuals with SCD.&#xD;
