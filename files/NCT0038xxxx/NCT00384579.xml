  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that Botulinum toxin B (Myobloc®) treatment reduces pain&#xD;
      and disability in subjects suffering from acute low back pain due to an identifiable muscle&#xD;
      strain or back trauma occurring 3 to 6 weeks prior to enrollment. The study will also&#xD;
      delineate the duration of medication effect and control for any placebo or mechanical&#xD;
      trigger-point injection effect by employing a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy of Botulinum Toxin B (Myobloc®) injected into the lumbar&#xD;
      paravertebral muscles for reducing pain and disability in subjects suffering from acute low&#xD;
      back pain (duration 3 to 6 weeks) arising from an identifiable muscle strain injury or back&#xD;
      trauma. The treatment modality and techniques used are based upon three successful prior&#xD;
      open-labeled pilot studies done by this research group investigating the effect of Botulinum&#xD;
      Toxin A (BOTOX®) on relief of chronic low back pain. This study, however, will employ a&#xD;
      prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial to control for any placebo or&#xD;
      mechanical trigger-point injection effects. Subjects will also be assessed for 3 months to&#xD;
      define the duration of efficacy of Myobloc®. Sixty subjects will be randomly assigned to one&#xD;
      of two groups and will then receive either Myobloc® or placebo injection into the lumbar&#xD;
      paravertebral muscles. The subjects will be assessed using validated scales for pain and&#xD;
      disability prior to injection and weekly to monthly thereafter for three months. All subjects&#xD;
      will continue to receive any medication or physiotherapy per standard of care but those&#xD;
      treatments will be recorded and controlled for in the data analysis.&#xD;
