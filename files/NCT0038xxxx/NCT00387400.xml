      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.&#xD;
      Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving temozolomide together with everolimus&#xD;
      may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of everolimus when&#xD;
      given together with temozolomide in treating patients with newly diagnosed, recurrent, or&#xD;
      progressive malignant glioblastoma multiforme.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose(s) and the recommended phase II dose(s) of&#xD;
           everolimus when administered with standard-dose temozolomide in patients with newly&#xD;
           diagnosed, recurrent, or progressive glioblastoma multiforme.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen in patients with measurable disease at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify correlates of activity by molecular study of paraffin-embedded tumor samples&#xD;
           from these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, nonblinded, parallel-group, multicenter, dose-escalation&#xD;
      study of everolimus. Patients are stratified according to concurrent use of enzyme-inducing&#xD;
      antiepileptic drugs (yes vs no).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 2-5 in course 1 and on days 1-5 in all&#xD;
      subsequent courses. Patients also receive oral everolimus once daily on days 1-28. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients with newly diagnosed disease receive up to 6 courses of treatment. Patients with&#xD;
      recurrent disease who achieve a response (partial or complete response) or stable disease may&#xD;
      continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients per stratum receive escalating doses of everolimus until the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2&#xD;
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity during the first course of therapy.&#xD;
      Once the MTD is determined, an additional 6 patients are treated at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' archival diagnostic tumor tissue is evaluated during study for correlative&#xD;
      molecular studies (by immunohistochemical staining) of mammalian target of rapamycin&#xD;
      inhibition status (mTOR activity) and pretreatment molecular markers. Blood samples are taken&#xD;
      periodically during course 1 for pharmacokinetic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 4 weeks. Patients with stable or&#xD;
      responding disease are then followed every 3 months until relapse or progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
