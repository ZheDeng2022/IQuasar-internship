  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fever is one of the most common symptoms in pediatrics and one of the most common reasons for&#xD;
      visits in pediatricians' office and pediatric emergency departments. Many parents consider&#xD;
      fever to be the most terrifying symptom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are both effective and safe treatments for febrile children. In&#xD;
      order to achieve better temperature control and to avoid toxicity it has been suggested to&#xD;
      treat febrile children with alternating doses of acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Surveys in the&#xD;
      USA and Spain found that this practice is very common. However, The safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      such practice was never described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children who are still febrile after being treated with acetaminophen or ibuprofen will have&#xD;
      greater temperature decrement if treated with another drug (acetaminophen for those treated&#xD;
      with ibuprofen and ibuprofen for those treated with acetaminophen) than if treated with&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;

      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: randomized double blind placebo controlled study. Setting: The ED and pediatric ward&#xD;
      of a large University affiliated Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age: 6 mo- 4 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rectal temperature &gt; 38.5&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Received 10-15 mg/kg of acetaminophen or 5-10 mg/kg of ibuprofen 1.5 - 3.5 hours before&#xD;
           admission to the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Received more than 75 mg acetaminophen in the last 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unable to take oral medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypersensitivity to acetaminophen or ibuprofen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Varicella&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Renal failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liver disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rectal temperature can't be measured (due to anatomical or medical problem)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Received both Ibuprofen and acetaminophen in the last 6 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent could not be granted&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited in the ED and pediatric ward at Assaf Harofeh Medical Center.&#xD;
      Legal guardians of eligible patients will be approached for consent. After obtaining informed&#xD;
      consent a detailed history regarding the way fever was managed during the current illness&#xD;
      will be collected (appendix 1). Patients will be randomized in a ratio of 2:1 (by a computer&#xD;
      generated list of random numbers) into one of two groups. Group A will be treated with oral&#xD;
      suspension of ibuprofen 10mg/kg (if the patient received acetaminophen at home) or oral&#xD;
      suspension of acetaminophen 15 mg/kg (if treated previously with ibuprofen). The second group&#xD;
      will be treated with the same amount of oral placebo suspension. The parents and the&#xD;
      physician will be blinded to the treatment given. Body departure will be recoded at base line&#xD;
      and at 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 minutes after the drug administration. Blood sample for serum&#xD;
      concentrations of acetaminophen or/and ibuprofen will be taken at the time of routine blood&#xD;
      sampling according to the attending physician decision. Serum concentrations will not be&#xD;
      measured if the attending physician decides that blood tests are not indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      · Maximal change in temperature during the 3-hour period after enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of patients with a drop of at least 1°C and 2°C in mean temperature at the&#xD;
           end of the study (3 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decrement in fever at each time point, and the area under the temperature (versus time)&#xD;
           curve for each group, calculated using the trapezoidal method. Continuous outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of patients with temperature &lt; 38 at the end of the study (3 hours).&#xD;
