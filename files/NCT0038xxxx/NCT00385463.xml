    <textblock>
      The four respiratory drugs being researched in this study have been approved by the US Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration (FDA) and are currently available by prescription at your drug store.&#xD;
      One of the drugs is for the treatment of asthma alone, one is for treatment of SAR alone, and&#xD;
      one is for treatment of both SAR and asthma. In addition, you will also receive one asthma&#xD;
      rescue drug (albuterol) that is to be used for any breakthrough asthma symptoms that you may&#xD;
      experience throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see how well your asthma and SAR are controlled when taking&#xD;
      one of the medicine combinations&#xD;

      4-week study to assess asthma control as measured by lung function and clinical features,&#xD;
      rhinitis treatment, subject-rated overall satisfaction with treatment, and safety outcomes&#xD;
      when FLONASE™ 200mcg (FPANS) QD, Singulair 10mg (MON) QD, or placebo QD is added to ADVAIR™&#xD;
      DISKUS™ 100/50mcg (FSC) BID and when Singulair 10mg (MON) QD is added to placebo DISKUS BID&#xD;
      in adolescent and adults subjects. Male or female subjects must be symptomatic with both&#xD;
      seasonal allergic rhinitis and persistent asthma, and have an FEV1 65-95% of predicted while&#xD;
      using an as-needed short-acting beta2-agonist or an allowed ICS or non-ICS controller&#xD;
      therapy. Subjects will replace their short-acting beta2-agonist with VENTOLIN™ HFA (for&#xD;
      rescue) and will enter a 7-14 day run-in period during which they will continue use of their&#xD;
      pre-study controller therapy. At Visit 2, subjects who meet both the asthma and rhinitis&#xD;
      randomization criteria will be randomized to double-blind treatment with ADVAIR DISKUS&#xD;
      100/50mcg BID and either FLONASE 200mcg QD, Singulair 10mg QD, or placebo QD, or to placebo&#xD;
      DISKUS BID and Singulair 10mg QD. The co-primary efficacy measures will be the mean change&#xD;
      from baseline at endpoint in AM PEF, compared between the FSC and the MON treatment groups to&#xD;
      assess superiority and compared between the FSC and FSC+MON treatment groups to assess&#xD;
      equivalence. Secondary efficacy measures for rhinitis will be mean change from baseline in&#xD;
      subject-rated daytime total nasal symptom score and nighttime total nasal symptomatic score&#xD;
      averaged over Weeks 1-2 (D-TNSSW1-2 and N-TNSSW1-2, respectively). Secondary efficacy&#xD;
      measures for asthma will be mean change from baseline at endpoint in morning pre-dose FEV1,&#xD;
      percentage of symptom-free days, and percentage of rescue-free days. Other measures will&#xD;
      include subject-rated overall satisfaction with treatment, evening PEF, asthma symptom scores&#xD;
      (D-INSSW1-x, N-INSSW1-2), averaged over Weeks 1-2. Descriptive measures will include all&#xD;
      total and individual nasal symptoms scores averaged over Weeks1-4. Safety measures will&#xD;
      include assessment of clinical adverse events and asthma exacerbations.&#xD;
