      Diabetic macular edema (DME) results from abnormal leakage of macromolecules into the&#xD;
      extracellular space from microaneurysms and incompetent blood vessel walls due to small&#xD;
      vessel damage from high blood glucose levels. Oncotic forces then allow water into the&#xD;
      extracellular space. Abnormalities in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) may reduce normal&#xD;
      outflow of fluid from the retina to the underlying choriocapillaris via the pump mechanism&#xD;
      (Ferris et al. 1984). This leads to retinal edema in the macula with accompanying loss of&#xD;
      vision. There is evidence suggesting that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a&#xD;
      part in vessel wall permeability with subsequent retinal edema (Aiello et al. 1997).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies demonstrate that tight junctions in the vessel walls were shown to be regulated by&#xD;
      VEGF and VEGF increases vascular permeability (Anticliff et al. 1999). The healthy human&#xD;
      retina contains little or no VEGF. Hypoxia, a component of diabetic retinopathy, causes&#xD;
      upregulation of VEGF in the retina (Vinores et al. 1997). Binding VEGF with an antibody&#xD;
      specific for VEGF may inhibit resultant edema thus preventing and possibly reversing loss of&#xD;
      vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in people aged 20-74 years, accounting&#xD;
      for 8% of all cases of legal blindness and 12% of the newly blind (Klein 1995). A common&#xD;
      complication of all forms of diabetes mellitus, diabetic retinopathy is present in over 2.5%&#xD;
      of the U.S. population, or more than 5.3 million people aged 18 or older (Prevent Blindness&#xD;
      American 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three forms of retinopathy are commonly recognized in association with all forms of diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus: 1) non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), 2) proliferative diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy (PDR), and 3) diabetic macular edema (DME).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NPDR is characterized by ophthalmoscopically visable abnormalities that include&#xD;
      microaneurysms, intraretinal hemorrhages, exudates, retina nerve fiber layer infarcts&#xD;
      (cotton-wool spots), and, in more severe cases, venous beading and intraretinal microvascular&#xD;
      abnormalities (IRMA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over time, NPDR may progress to more severe PDR, the hallmark of which is neovascularization&#xD;
      on the surface of the retina, optic disc, or iris, and angle structures in the front of the&#xD;
      eye. PDR is associated with a high risk of visual morbidity arising from vitreous hemorrhage,&#xD;
      traction retinal detachment, and neovascular glaucoma (Diabetic Retinopathy Research Group&#xD;
      1979).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DME, the third form of diabetic retinopathy, is characterized by swelling of the central part&#xD;
      of the retina that mediates high-resolution vision. DME frequently coexists with and is&#xD;
      superimposed upon NPDR or PDR. When the area of swelling is located more than 1 disc diameter&#xD;
      (approximately 1500 mm) away from the center of the fovea, the swelling constitutes a low&#xD;
      threat to visual acuity and is regarded as non-clinically significant macular edema (Early&#xD;
      Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ETDRS] Research Group 1985). Vision deteriorates when&#xD;
      DME involves the foveal center. DME that either directly involves the fovea or is at high&#xD;
      risk of doing so is referred to as Clinically Significant Macular Edema (CSME) (ETDRS&#xD;
      Research Group 1985).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the center of the fovea is involved by CSME, the DME is referred to as CSME with center&#xD;
      involvement (CSME-CI), as opposed to CSME without center involvement (ETDRS Research Group&#xD;
      1987).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The natural history of untreated CSME-CI is particularly poor. The ETDRS demonstrated that&#xD;
      over a 3-year period, 33% of subjects with CSME-CI lose &gt;15 letters of visual acuity on the&#xD;
      standardized ETDRS Visual Acuity Chart (Ferris et al. 1982) compared with 23% of CSME&#xD;
      subjects without center involvement (ETDRS Research Group 1987). Such a degree of visual&#xD;
      acuity change is equivalent to doubling of the visual angle or greater. The ETDRS did not&#xD;
      discriminate between subtypes of diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although laser photocoagulation in CSME-CI was shown to reduce the proportion of subjects&#xD;
      losing &gt; 15 letters from 33% to 13% over 3 years, 13% of subjects nevertheless continued to&#xD;
      double their visual angle or do worse. Moreover, in subjects with CSME initially without&#xD;
      center involvement, over 3 years, 12% lose &gt; 15 letters despite laser treatment, presumably&#xD;
      because edema eventually involves the center of the fovea (i.e., the subjects convert to&#xD;
      CSME-CI). Thus, while laser is an effective tool in the treatment of CSME, there is a&#xD;
      considerable unmet clinical need for CSME-CI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to compare the effectiveness of intra-vitreal Ranibizumab to current&#xD;
      standard of care.&#xD;
