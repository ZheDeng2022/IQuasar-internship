      The objective of this study is to evaluate an antibiotic therapy called Rifalazil to&#xD;
      determine its effect on hardening of the carotid arteries.&#xD;

      To evaluate the effect of treatment with rifalazil versus placebo taken once weekly for 12&#xD;
      weeks on carotid atherosclerotic disease progression in patients who test positive for&#xD;
      Chlamydia pneumoniae. Measurements of the carotid artery wall (intima-media thickness) and&#xD;
      plaque characteristics will be evaluated with high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) and carotid ultrasound. at Baseline and at 6,12 and 18 months following initiation of&#xD;
      drug treatment in Chlamydia pneumoniae seropositive patients with a history of&#xD;
      atherosclerotic disease. Biomarkers will be collected throughout the study. Safety will be&#xD;
      evaluated by the collection and analysis of laboratory parameters, vital signs,&#xD;
      electrocardiograms, physical examination and adverse events. Seventy two patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study. There will be a total of approximately 7-9 visits which will occur&#xD;
      over an 18 month period.&#xD;
