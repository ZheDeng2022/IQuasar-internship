      The research team is comprised of an expert nutrition scientist and a pediatrician with&#xD;
      expertise in endocrinology. Both have world-class experience in assessing bone mass in&#xD;
      infancy. Together they have designed a study to determine how much dietary vitamin D is&#xD;
      needed to optimize health in infants. This is important since many infants are born with&#xD;
      vitamin D deficiency. At present the dosage of vitamin D that is optimal for infant health is&#xD;
      unclear and recent research suggests that vitamin D status very early in life has long&#xD;
      lasting effects on bone mass and other health issues. Therefore, in a group of healthy&#xD;
      infants, this research team will test which dosage of vitamin D is needed to achieve optimal&#xD;
      vitamin D status. Optimal vitamin D status will be based on growth, biomarkers of vitamin D&#xD;
      and bone status in blood and also general health. The infants will all be breastfed and begin&#xD;
      the study at about 2 weeks of age. At 3 months intervals over the first year of life, each&#xD;
      infant will be measured for growth, duration of breastfeeding and supplement use plus have a&#xD;
      bone density scan to determine changes in bone growth. The data will be helpful to guide&#xD;
      health care professionals in providing the best care possible for their infants. It will also&#xD;
      be important to the health of populations since dietary recommendations for vitamin D are&#xD;
      used to guide fortification of foods and development of evidence based policy around nutrient&#xD;
      recommendations and their implementation.&#xD;

      Vitamin D status is currently judged by serum 25(OH)D and the parathyroid hormone&#xD;
      (PTH)-25(OH)D dynamic (1). The ultimate effect of vitamin D on human health is a healthy&#xD;
      skeleton, which is characterized in infancy by normal linear growth and bone mineral&#xD;
      accretion and absence of bone related disease, such as rickets (1). The importance of these&#xD;
      indicators is illustrated in epidemiological research, where linear growth in infancy is&#xD;
      positively related to peak bone mass as an adult (2). Moreover, both vitamin D status (3) and&#xD;
      intake (4) in infancy are related to bone mass in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2004, Health Canada reaffirmed its population health policy that all breastfed, healthy&#xD;
      term infants in Canada receive a daily vitamin D3 supplement of 400 IU (5). This policy&#xD;
      recommendation was made in consultation with the Canadian Expert Advisory Committee on&#xD;
      Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI). They determined that the 1997 DRI value for vitamin D of 200&#xD;
      IU was too low for Canadians based on Canadian studies (6, 7) and surveillance systems (1)&#xD;
      that indicated a high rate of vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D deficient rickets continued&#xD;
      in Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the Health Canada committee (5) and Institute of Medicine Committee on Dietary&#xD;
      Recommended Intakes (1) acknowledged that there was considerable uncertainty regarding what&#xD;
      defines optimal vitamin D intake in infancy based on functional outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In adults, a minimum serum 25(OH)D value of 75 nmol/L now defines optimal vitamin D status&#xD;
      (8). This concentration is derived from dose-response studies of the relationship between&#xD;
      25(OH)D and PTH, where PTH plateaus in approximately the mid-normal range and also from&#xD;
      studies where 25(OH)D concentrations between 90 and 100 nmol/L are positively related to bone&#xD;
      mineral density (BMD) in young adults (9). A dose-response study to determine the&#xD;
      physiological and functional response to vitamin D3 supplementation has not been conducted in&#xD;
      infants and is necessary to confidently set DRI values for Canadian infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, health care professionals are faced with major gaps in knowledge of: a) what&#xD;
      constitutes optimal vitamin D status in infancy based on the physiological and functional&#xD;
      outcomes, 25(OH)D, PTH and bone mass; and b) what oral dosage of vitamin D supplement is&#xD;
      required to elevate serum 25(OH)D to optimal values as the key biomarker of optimal vitamin D&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The global objective of this study is to conduct a dose-response study of vitamin D3 intakes&#xD;
      and to provide information regarding the physiological and functional response to vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation in infancy, including: 25(OH)D concentrations and the relationship between&#xD;
      25(OH)D, PTH and bone mineral accretion. Once the best dosage is determined, funding for a&#xD;
      larger study spanning all Canadian regions will be sought to more conclusively demonstrate&#xD;
      that this dosage is appropriate for all Canadian infants. In the larger study, infants will&#xD;
      be followed longitudinally to confirm that optimization of vitamin D status in infancy&#xD;
      enhances peak bone mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 BACKGROUND 2.1 Recommendations for Intakes of Vitamin D for Infants The AI value of at&#xD;
      least 200 IU/d was derived from the amount of breast milk typically consumed by infants and&#xD;
      the concentration of vitamin D in breast milk that resulted in serum 25(OH)D concentrations&#xD;
      above 27.5 nmol/L (1). The current recommendations for vitamin D intake in Canada for infants&#xD;
      are listed below, but no dosage has been evaluated using dose-response studies conducted in&#xD;
      Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  400 IU vitamin D3/d for infants recommended in 2004 by Health Canada, The Canadian&#xD;
           Pediatric Society and Dietitians of Canada in Guidelines for Healthy Term Infants (5);&#xD;
           and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  that entirely breast-fed infants should be given 400 IU of vitamin D daily that may be&#xD;
           increased to 800 IU/d from October through April as recommended by the Indian and Inuit&#xD;
           Committee of the Canadian Pediatric Society (10). Infants bottle-fed formulas made from&#xD;
           fortified whole or canned milk should receive additional 400 IU from October through&#xD;
           April (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Vitamin D Metabolism and Sources of Vitamin D for Infants: The Canadian Scenario&#xD;
      Endogenously synthesized vitamin D is in the form of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3). Most food&#xD;
      sources and supplements in Canada have this mammalian form, but some contain the plant form,&#xD;
      ergocalciferol (vitamin D2). Vitamin D3 is estimated to be approximately 9.5 times more&#xD;
      potent than vitamin D2 (12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endogenous synthesis accounts for the majority of vitamin D in adults (8). Above latitude 42&#xD;
      in the northern hemisphere, synthesis is limited to late spring through mid-autumn, because&#xD;
      of the low intensity of UVB radiation, during the rest of the year. The majority of Canadians&#xD;
      reside north of the 42nd parallel, placing them at risk for hypovitaminosis D year round&#xD;
      because of the use of sunscreen and environmental factors, such as clothing and pollution,&#xD;
      which reduce exposure to UVB sunlight (14). This means that endogenous synthesis in pregnant&#xD;
      women and subsequent maternal-fetal transfer may be compromised. Fortified foods such as&#xD;
      milk, margarine and vitamin supplements remain the major source of vitamin D for many&#xD;
      Canadian adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2.1 Maternal-fetal transfer by birth: Given the fact that Canadian women do not consume&#xD;
      enough milk (15, 16), it is not surprising that over 1/3 of infants are born already&#xD;
      deficient in vitamin D. In Manitoba, the PI has documented that 36% of infants from white or&#xD;
      non-white parents are deficient in vitamin D at birth, defined as a serum 25(OH)D below 27.5&#xD;
      nmol/L, with 46% of their mothers themselves having values &lt; 37.5 nmol/L (6). In that study,&#xD;
      20% of white infants were deficient, and as a group 60% of First Nations, Asian, Filipino and&#xD;
      Black infants were deficient. This suggests that vitamin D deficiency is not uncommon,&#xD;
      particularly in non-white women and their infants (6, 19-22). Likewise season of birth (19)&#xD;
      and ethnicity (6) are important factors to consider in defining how much vitamin D is&#xD;
      required to achieve and maintain target values for 25(OH)D in infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2.2 Infants from birth to 12 months: Infants have limited stores of vitamin D at birth&#xD;
      because the amount transferred from the mother has a very short half life of 10-21 days (1).&#xD;
      For infants exclusively breastfed, vitamin D supplementation is recommended by Health Canada&#xD;
      (5) because vitamin D concentrations are low in the breast milk of Canadian mothers (4-40&#xD;
      IU/L). Fortified formula would provide ~ 400 IU vitamin D/L daily, but likely not achieved&#xD;
      until close to 6 months of age (i.e., with intake 1L/d). After 6 months of age, the foods&#xD;
      available to infants have limited vitamin D content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Role of Early Life Vitamin D in Human Bone Health Term infants with 25(OH)D&#xD;
      concentrations above 27.5 nmol/L have higher weight adjusted bone mass than those born with&#xD;
      lower concentrations (6). The effects of higher maternal-fetal transfer of vitamin D are&#xD;
      sustained long into childhood, as illustrated by a recent report from Southampton, UK (50N&#xD;
      latitude): maternal vitamin D status in pregnancy, synonymous with fetal exposure to vitamin&#xD;
      D in utero, was positively correlated with bone mass in the children measured as late as 9&#xD;
      years of age (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of various dosages of vitamin D on whole body/skeletal bone mineral accretion in&#xD;
      the first year of life has not been reported. In the first year of life, it is expected that&#xD;
      whole body bone mineral content (BMC) will almost triple in parallel to growth (24, 25). In&#xD;
      formula fed infants, whole body BMC at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of age are 79, 130, 160, 200&#xD;
      and 235 g respectively as measured with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) with a&#xD;
      precision error of 4.5% (25). Since the largest increment is between 1 and 3 months (63%),&#xD;
      this is an ideal time to compare outcomes with respect to effects of various dosages of&#xD;
      vitamin D on bone mineral accretion. However, this has yet to be conducted and is an&#xD;
      important objective of the present proposal. It is anticipated that optimal vitamin D status&#xD;
      will yield greater bone mass, since in Geneva, Switzerland (46N latitude), even a 400 IU/d&#xD;
      vitamin D3 supplement in infancy (median duration of 12 months) is associated with higher BMD&#xD;
      at 7 to 9 years of age (4). In the girls who received a vitamin D supplement in infancy, BMD&#xD;
      was 6% higher in the distal radius and 9% higher in the femoral neck, even after adjustment&#xD;
      for size (4). These positive associations must be viewed in conjunction with studies&#xD;
      identifying peak bone mass as a critical factor in bone health (26). Whether the positive&#xD;
      effects of the supplement translate into higher peak bone mass, is not yet known. An&#xD;
      additional limitation is that no such studies have been conducted in Canada, with its unique&#xD;
      climate, culture, food supply, and policies related to infant sun exposure. Since optimal&#xD;
      vitamin D requirements for Canadian infants are ill defined, the benefits to bone mass are&#xD;
      also unclear. As such, recommended dietary intake of vitamin D3 for Canadian infants must be&#xD;
      identified by rigorous, well-controlled, randomized designs with optimal vitamin D status as&#xD;
      the primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 New Paradigm for Optimal Vitamin D Status Physiologically, when blood calcium falls, PTH&#xD;
      is released to promote hydroxylation of 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D. Both PTH and 1,25(OH)2D&#xD;
      mobilize of calcium (Ca) from bone and enhance absorption of Ca from the diet and glomerular&#xD;
      filtrate. Elevated PTH levels characteristically seen in individuals with inadequate vitamin&#xD;
      D status can result in the long latency disease of osteoporosis (27). A high PTH can also&#xD;
      result from low dietary Ca, but for infants, breast milk and formula provide ample Ca.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimal 25(OH)D concentration for infants is unknown but is projected to be at least 75&#xD;
      nmol/L based on adult studies (8). This value is derived from well controlled dose-response&#xD;
      studies of vitamin D3 supplementation in men and women, which demonstrate a reduction in&#xD;
      serum PTH (8, 28, 29) with increasing 25(OH)D concentrations and a plateau in the mid-normal&#xD;
      PTH reference range. However, current thinking suggests that the 25(OH)D-PTH dynamic is not&#xD;
      the only instrument to determine recommendations, but should be supplemented with alternate&#xD;
      biomarkers, such as bone mass and mineral metabolism, to more clearly define what is optimal&#xD;
      (27). This is illustrated by a study of young adults in whom higher vitamin D concentrations&#xD;
      (90-100 nmol/L) were associated with higher BMD when compared to those with lower&#xD;
      concentrations (9). This would suggest that gains in 25(OH)D beyond those associated with the&#xD;
      PTH plateau are important. Similarly, 25(OH)D concentration of 75 to 80 nmol/L in children 7&#xD;
      to 18 years of age are related to normalization of PTH (30-34) and has been selected as the&#xD;
      target concentration for this age group as well. Concentrations of 25(OH)D at and above this&#xD;
      value are associated with enhanced bone mineral accretion in one cohort (35) and in a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) of vitamin D supplementation with 400 and 600 IU/d in&#xD;
      adolescents (36). These studies again emphasize that the PTH-25(OH)D dynamic and bone mass&#xD;
      are important determinants for establishing the RDA in pediatrics. Such dose-response studies&#xD;
      of vitamin D3 do not exist for Canadian infants and it is possible that PTH should not be the&#xD;
      only biomarker of adequacy during this life stage. There are limited dose-response studies&#xD;
      [2] or RCT [1] examining daily oral vitamin D intake in infants (37-39). The details of these&#xD;
      studies have recently been summarized as part of a NIH requested systematic review compiled&#xD;
      by Canadian experts. The key message of this report is that there are no dose-response&#xD;
      studies of vitamin D3 intake in infants, but only of vitamin D2 (9.5 x lower potency (12)) in&#xD;
      dosages ranging from 100 to 1000 IU/d. These studies were of short duration and none were&#xD;
      conducted in Canada. Additionally, not all studies measured PTH and none measured whole body&#xD;
      bone mass. Clearly, a trial of vitamin D3 in Canadian infants is overdue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to better understand how to optimize vitamin D status in infants, newer biomarkers&#xD;
      of bone formation and resorption should be included to more comprehensively assess bone&#xD;
      metabolism in association with 25(OH)D, PTH and whole body BMC. Suggested biomarkers include&#xD;
      plasma osteocalcin and urinary N-telopeptide. Osteocalcin increases with growth and bone&#xD;
      mineralization in the first year of life, as does alkaline phosphatase (40). Osteocalcin is&#xD;
      the superior marker, since it also reflects seasonal changes in 25(OH)D and PTH in infancy&#xD;
      (41). For bone resorption, urinary N-telopeptide is a practical marker, as it can be measured&#xD;
      in urine and is also a specific index for bone resorption. Excretion of N-telopeptide in a&#xD;
      spot urine sample in infants over the first year of life can be used with confidence for&#xD;
      comparing groups of patients (42).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5 Safety Considerations, High Dosages Elevate 25(OH)D with No Adverse Effects There are no&#xD;
      observed adverse effects at vitamin D2 or D3 doses of 1800 IU/d in infants (1). In the event&#xD;
      of hypervitaminosis D, hypercalciuria and or hypercalcemia could occur. Sustained&#xD;
      hypercalcemia could manifest as failure-to thrive, anorexia, irritability, nephrocalcinosis&#xD;
      and its effects, and the remote possibility of cardiac arrhythmias. In one published study&#xD;
      where infants received approximately 1200 IU of vitamin D per day (D2 supplements and D3&#xD;
      formula) (43), and in a pilot coordinated Dr. Taback (Univ. Manitoba) and the applicants (see&#xD;
      CV module, CDA grant) where infants received 2000 IU/d of vitamin D3, no hypercalcemia or&#xD;
      hypercalciuria was noted. In the later trial, PTH data are not yet available and this dose of&#xD;
      vitamin D3 results in 25(OH)D well above 75 to 80 nmol/L (199 nmol/L, n=4). While too small&#xD;
      to calculate SD, this study suggests that the required intake of vitamin D3 is likely below&#xD;
      2000 IU/D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.6 Theoretical Calculation of Vitamin D Intakes To Establish Study Dosage Groups As&#xD;
      described in 2.1, the RDA is defined as the EAR + 2 SD and covers requirements of 97% of the&#xD;
      population. If the target is 75 nmol/L for all infants, this means that the 2.5 percentile&#xD;
      must be at this concentration. Using data from the PI's research of 83 cord blood samples,&#xD;
      the mean value of 25(OH)D was 35 with SD of 15 nmol/L (full dataset from Weiler et al. (6)).&#xD;
      Thus the lower 2.5 percentile is 5 nmol/L. To elevate this to 75 nmol/L, a gain in 70 nmol/L&#xD;
      would be required (97 % of infants above target). Unfortunately, there is little available&#xD;
      data as to the dose-response dynamics of mammalian cholecalciferol (D3) in infants, and&#xD;
      studies of plant ergocalciferol (D2) may be misleading due to differences in bioavailability,&#xD;
      which may be as much as a whole order of magnitude. The preliminary data from Drs. Taback and&#xD;
      Weiler using daily supplements of either 400 IU or 2000 IU of D3 in a small number of&#xD;
      Winnipeg infants (n=4 in each group) are the only data for us to base our estimates. Although&#xD;
      too small a sample to confidently estimate measurement variance, they observed a rise of 44&#xD;
      and 115 nmol/L in the respective mean 25(OH)D concentrations in the first 3 months of&#xD;
      supplementation. Thus, the 400 IU dose of vitamin D3 is expected to achieve a mean&#xD;
      concentration of 75 nmol/L by 3 months of age. 800 IU D3 will be used in this study because&#xD;
      this is currently recommended for Canadian infants. Because 2000 IU D3 was felt to be&#xD;
      excessive based on the modest numbers of infants given this dose and their short follow up,&#xD;
      we elected to select 1200 and 1600 IU as intermediate yet likely candidate RDA doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 OBJECTIVES and HYPOTHESIS HYPOTHESIS: Daily oral dosage of 400 IU/d of vitamin D3 will be&#xD;
      inadequate to achieve optimal vitamin D status in 97% of Canadian infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To define the dosage of vitamin D3 required to achieve 25(OH)D&#xD;
      concentrations ≥ 75 nmol/L at 3 months of age in exclusively breast fed infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: When multiple doses achieve our primary objective of optimal 25(OH)D&#xD;
      concentrations, the best dosage will be identified based on: (i) 25(OH)D-PTH dynamics (ii)&#xD;
      incidence of adverse events, such as disturbed mineral homeostasis (e.g. hypercalcemia,&#xD;
      hypercalciuria, etc), and (iii) alternate markers of bone health (e.g. bone mass, osteocalcin&#xD;
      and N-telopeptide) TERTIARY OBJECTIVE: We will examine the quantitative relationships between&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcome measures and the various prospectively collected predictor&#xD;
      variables, including dose, vitamin D from breast milk or fortified formulae, gender, season&#xD;
      of birth, ethnicity, baseline vitamin D stores and determine if the selected dosage maintains&#xD;
      25(OH)D over the first year of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.0 METHODOLOGY: Dose Response Study 4.1 Population n=192 breast-fed infants from greater&#xD;
      Montreal region will be studied. The rationale for studying breast-fed infants is that this&#xD;
      is the current recommended optimal food for infants, along with vitamin D supplements, and&#xD;
      the fact that 85% of women in Canada initially breastfeed their infant (44, 45). Beginning&#xD;
      with breastfeeding allows confirmation that the best dose is suitable while breastfeeding and&#xD;
      if this dose is also optimal later in infancy with introduction of foods and weaning to&#xD;
      vitamin D fortified formula. Initially a pilot study will be employed with 24 infants to&#xD;
      evaluate the recruitment strategy, study questionnaires and procedures that will be used in&#xD;
      the larger study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Study Protocol 4.2.1 Recruitment: Rolling recruitment over 1 year with 1-year follow up&#xD;
      for all beginning in September of 2006 and continuing through August 2007. Equal numbers&#xD;
      across all months will be sought. At least two large pediatric clinics (Médicentre St-Lazare&#xD;
      and Clinique de santé jeunesse) will be the primary recruitment centres with over 1500&#xD;
      newborns annually receive their ongoing medical care. These clinics provide care to families&#xD;
      with a wide range of SES and cultures representative of Montreal and Canada. Infants will be&#xD;
      recruited at the first postnatal visit at 2 weeks of age. Such recruitment age is suitable&#xD;
      since breastfeeding will be deemed as established and recovery of birth weight and good&#xD;
      health are confirmed. The clinician will inform women and families who meet inclusion&#xD;
      criteria, and only those who are interested in participating in the study will have their&#xD;
      names and contact address and telephone number forwarded to the study coordinator. All study&#xD;
      visits will take place at the Mary Emily Clinical Nutrition Research Unit, School of&#xD;
      Dietetics and Human Nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2.2 Study treatment groups: After obtaining written consent the infant will be randomized&#xD;
      to a study group stratified for sex (see page 12) i for randomization process). At&#xD;
      recruitment (2-4 weeks of age), baseline measurements will be conducted prior to providing&#xD;
      treatment. Infants will then be randomized to receive 400, 800, 1200 or 1600 IU/d of vitamin&#xD;
      D3 to 1 year of age. A placebo group is not included since the standard in Canada is 400 IU/d&#xD;
      and a precedent for considering placebos unethical has already been set (37). The supplement&#xD;
      will be double blinded to the investigators and all staff by coding of the supplements by&#xD;
      Euro-Pharm who as agreed to provide the supplement in kind. This supplement will be stable&#xD;
      for at least 3 months (the longest interval of measurements) and each dosage delivered in 2&#xD;
      ml volumes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2.3 Frequency and duration of follow up: Baseline and all follow up visits (3, 6, 9, and 12&#xD;
      months of life) will include anthropometric measurements and blood and urine analysis for&#xD;
      (25(OH)D, PTH, calcium, phosphorus, creatinine) as well as bone markers and bone mass&#xD;
      measurements. An additional blood sample will be obtained 1 month after starting the study to&#xD;
      monitor blood calcium levels. Bottles of the supplement will be assessed for compliance at&#xD;
      these visits. Other sources of vitamin D intake will be reviewed by diet history as well as&#xD;
      determining the content of vitamin D in the breast milk. Maternal baseline information&#xD;
      regarding demographics will be gathered at the initial visit and dietary vitamin D intake&#xD;
      will be assessed at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 Details of Measurements INFANT: NUTRITIONAL AND HORMONAL STATUS AND BONE METABOLISM 4.3.1&#xD;
      Sample procurement: Blood and urine samples will be collected in infants at all visits. All&#xD;
      samples will be taken between 8 and 10 am to control for diurnal variation permitting 3 to 4&#xD;
      infants to be seen in our Unit daily. Heparinized blood (~1 ml in infants via finger poke -&#xD;
      400 ul for safety, 600 ul for other measurements) and non-pharmacological approaches used to&#xD;
      provide for pain control including swaddling and 1 ml 33% sucrose solution given sub lingual&#xD;
      2 minutes prior to collection (46).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3.2 25(OH)D and PTH concentrations: Vitamin D status will be measured using a RIA (25-50;&#xD;
      Diasorin) that is known to measure both D2 and D3 in plasma (47). This method (RIA) is&#xD;
      selected as the now most common clinical method over HPLC and competitive protein binding&#xD;
      assays. Serum intact PTH will be measured using an ELISA (50 ul; Immutopics International).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3.3 Bone markers: Change in bone metabolism in response to 25(OH)D will be assessed by a&#xD;
      marker of osteoblast activity related to mineralization, plasma osteocalcin (20 ul;&#xD;
      Diasorin). Osteoclast activity will be assessed by measuring urinary N-telopeptide (ELISA,&#xD;
      Osteomark) corrected to creatinine. The assay is specific to Type 1 collagen with a CV% &lt;8%.&#xD;
      N-telopeptide measurements urine selected over blood to reserve the small blood sample for&#xD;
      other measurements. Urinary N-telopeptide in spot urine samples is a validated measurement in&#xD;
      infancy (42). The PI is experienced in all of these measurements (6, 48).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3.4 Anthropometry: For infants, size at birth (weight, length, head circumference) and&#xD;
      gestational age will be documented from the vaccine carnet. Growth will be assessed each&#xD;
      visit using triplicate measurements of weight (to the nearest g without clothing/diaper),&#xD;
      crown-heel length (to the nearest 0.1 cm using an infant length board) and head circumference&#xD;
      (to the nearest 0.1 cm using a non-stretchable tape). Data will be expressed in absolute&#xD;
      units and standard deviation scores using the data from the Centers for Disease Control at&#xD;
      each age. Quality of growth achieved after term age will be available as lean and fat mass&#xD;
      provided during measurement of bone mass using DXA, reported as accurate and reproducible&#xD;
      (49).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3.5 Nutrition: Milk intake in infancy will be assessed by weighing infants prior to and&#xD;
      after breast-feeding (i.e., test weighing and the basis of the required weigh scales). For&#xD;
      this purpose, parents will be provided with electronic weigh scales designed for test&#xD;
      weighing over 3 days then returned to the research site by courier. Additionally, breast milk&#xD;
      vitamin D (all forms) will be measured (using HPLC (51, 52)) in samples collected at&#xD;
      inception and the 3 month visit using an electronic breast pump. Mothers will be asked to&#xD;
      feed the infant on one breast and pump from the other. Total intake of vitamin D will then be&#xD;
      derived from milk intake and milk vitamin D concentration. Thus total intakes of vitamin D&#xD;
      will be possible whether breast-fed or fed formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each age, dietary and supplement intake will be documented in infants using written 3-day&#xD;
      records that are designed to accommodate test weighing and documentation of other milks and&#xD;
      any foods consumed as successfully used previously by the PI (53). Estimated portions sizes&#xD;
      will be made using household measuring tools. Mothers will be asked about timing of&#xD;
      introduction of solid foods or fluids other than breast-milk or vitamin D supplements. If&#xD;
      infants wean to infant formula or cows milk, the product brand will be documented. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that by 3 to 4 months of age that many infants will wean from breastfeeding to&#xD;
      formula. However, the dosage will not be adjusted. Intake of vitamin D from infant formula,&#xD;
      cows' milk etc will be documented and used to calculate total daily intake above the&#xD;
      supplement. Such additional vitamin D will be addressed in the statistical analysis and is&#xD;
      anticipated to be a systematic variation in total intakes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3.6 Bone mass: Measurement of bone area, BMC and BMD of the whole body, lumbar vertebrae&#xD;
      (L2-4) and femur at all visits will be conducted using DXA (QDR 4500A Discovery series,&#xD;
      Hologic Inc.) at the Mary Emily Clinical Nutrition Research Unit. DXA has been validated for&#xD;
      measuring infant whole body and regional BMC (49, 54, 55) and delivers minimal radiation (6&#xD;
      uSv) in comparison to standard pediatric x-rays (~60 uSv). Since positioning in infants is&#xD;
      difficult to standardize, only BMC is used for whole body and femur. For lumbar spine,&#xD;
      standardized positioning is feasible enabling assessment of bone area, BMC and BMD. Infants&#xD;
      will not be sedated and will be scanned while sleeping and wrapped in a receiving blanket and&#xD;
      standardized clothing without any metal zippers, clasps etc. Data will be expressed as&#xD;
      absolute values for bone area, BMC and BMD and also as a rate of change for BMC. The&#xD;
      measurement of whole body bone mass is ideal and recommended by ISCD (56). To enable complete&#xD;
      data regarding bone, the next best measurement is lumbar spine, vertebra 1-4 (56). This&#xD;
      measurement is easily attainable in infants to 1 year of age and only requires 30 to 60&#xD;
      seconds compared to whole body at 3 minutes. In addition, the femur can be scanned in 30 to&#xD;
      60 seconds and offers a novel assessment of a long bone. Whole body BMC will be corrected to&#xD;
      body weight, length and lean mass and also expressed as change over the period of study.&#xD;
      Correction to weight or length is endorsed by ISCD rather than more novel methods such as use&#xD;
      of bone area and height (59) since normative data for infants is not currently available.&#xD;
      Differences in whole body bone mineral accretion between inception, 3 and 6 months and&#xD;
      between 6 and 12 months are greater than the error of measurement by DXA estimated at &lt;4.5%&#xD;
      (25, 49). Values for spine bone area, BMC and BMD and femur BMC will be compared among&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERNAL CHARACTERISTICS 4.3.7 General demographics and anthropometry include: Maternal age,&#xD;
      weight gain in pregnancy, height, family income range and number of dependent members,&#xD;
      employment, highest education level achieved, previous pregnancies, live births. To obtain&#xD;
      accurate measurement of height, mothers will be measured at the inception visit. Weight will&#xD;
      also be measured to accurately describe the population. Self-reported weight gain in&#xD;
      pregnancy will be documented. Mothers will be asked to self-identify ethnicity. These data&#xD;
      will be used to simply characterize the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3.8 Nutrient intake: Dietary and supplement intake by the mothers during the last trimester&#xD;
      of pregnancy will be assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire, the modified&#xD;
      Willett/Harvard (60). This questionnaire is modified to assess intakes over the last 3 months&#xD;
      of pregnancy. These data will be used to describe vitamin D exposure of the fetus in utero&#xD;
      when bone is mineralizing. At each visit and while the mother is lactating, intake of vitamin&#xD;
      D will be assessed using a 24-hour recall. The value for maternal vitamin D intake will be&#xD;
      used to describe our population as necessary to determine if results can be extrapolated to&#xD;
      the Canadian population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4 Recruitment and Statistical Analysis 4.4.1 Recruitment: Infants will be equally allocated&#xD;
      to the 4 dosage groups, based on a randomization in blocks of 8 to accommodate stratifying by&#xD;
      gender since growth diverges in male and female infants by the first year of life. Even&#xD;
      distribution among the 4 seasons (standard calendar dates) will be sought by recruiting&#xD;
      1/12th of the sample each month. The fact that some infants may have already began vitamin D&#xD;
      supplements will be considered as a systematic error.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4.2 Power and sample size: The sample size will be 48 to enable balanced groups across&#xD;
      seasons and genders. This sample size will permit analysis of the data by feeding type:&#xD;
      infants exclusively breast-fed versus weaning to formula as necessary to meet objective 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4.3 Data Analysis: The intention-to-treat principle will be applied, including all&#xD;
      randomized infants for each outcome. For comparison purposes, results will also be evaluated&#xD;
      in terms of the dose actually received. Should baseline imbalances occur between groups&#xD;
      despite randomization, these will be treated as covariates and adjusted for. To compare&#xD;
      proportions between treatment groups, sample proportions will be evaluated by a Chi-squared&#xD;
      test of proportions, adjusted for multiple comparisons to ensure a family-wise error rate of&#xD;
      0.05. Results will be assessed at the each time point, with a Chi-squared test for trend in&#xD;
      proportions to compare their temporal evolution. Mean 25(OH) D concentrations, bone mass, and&#xD;
      biochemical indices of bone remodeling will be compared in each dose group under a fixed&#xD;
      effects ANOVA model, with significant group differences localized by suitable post-hoc&#xD;
      testing (e.g. Tukey method), again with adjustment for multiple comparisons to ensure a&#xD;
      family-wise error rate of 0.05. Time course will be evaluated under a mixed effects ANOVA&#xD;
      model (with the addition of time as a random effect). The dynamics of the 25(OH)D-PTH&#xD;
      relationship is visually assessed in linearized log-log plots, whose slope is a measure of&#xD;
      PTH sensitivity to 25(OH)D. The best-fit line is determined by least squares, and slopes&#xD;
      compared by standard methods based on the distribution of regression coefficients as&#xD;
      t-statistics. Taking the following as independent predictor variables - dose, source of&#xD;
      vitamin D, age, gender, season of birth, ethnicity, and baseline vitamin D stores - their&#xD;
      effect on the likelihood of achieving our therapeutic target will be evaluated by multiple&#xD;
      logistic regression, with ordinary multivariate linear regression to examine their impact on&#xD;
      serum concentration of 25(OH)D, bone mass, osteocalcin, and N-telopeptide.&#xD;
