      This study will test whether a new non-invasive technique can quickly and precisely measure&#xD;
      retinal metabolism (the amount of energy retinal cells use). The retina is the part of the&#xD;
      eye that sends information to the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in current NEI studies who have age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy, or von Hippel-Landau disease may be eligible for this study. Healthy volunteers&#xD;
      will participate as controls. Patients with AMD must be 60 years of age or older; those with&#xD;
      VHL disease or diabetic retinopathy must be 18 or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the tests and procedures required in the NEI study in which they&#xD;
      previously enrolled. In addition, for the current study, they undergo metabolic mapping. For&#xD;
      this procedure, the subject's eyes are dilated, and different amounts of low-level light are&#xD;
      shone into the eye to see how different cells respond with changes in metabolism.&#xD;
      Measurements are taken while the subject breathes room air and while he or she breathes&#xD;
      medical grade oxygen for about 1 minute. The entire procedure takes about 15 minutes.&#xD;

      Background. Alterations in retinal metabolism are associated with blinding conditions and&#xD;
      vision loss. We propose to apply a non-invasive in vivo retinal imaging system to investigate&#xD;
      key physiologic processes affecting retinal metabolism. The imaging system is designed to&#xD;
      quantify and characterize the topology of retinal metabolism in 3-dimensional space across&#xD;
      40--130 picosecond time periods and allows dynamic measurement of physiologically relevant&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives. The primary objectives of our study are to: (1) evaluate the utility of this&#xD;
      system in a clinical setting; and (2) examine variation in retinal metabolism within retinal&#xD;
      cell subtypes under environmental conditions optimized to support this metabolism. The&#xD;
      working hypothesis of our first objective is that the imaging system will be easily and&#xD;
      efficiently implemented in a clinical setting and will yield stable and repeatable results.&#xD;
      The working hypothesis for our second objective is that people with or at high risk for&#xD;
      progression to sight threatening retinal disease will exhibit different metabolic profiles&#xD;
      than an age- and sex-matched disease-free comparison group. Their peers with less severe&#xD;
      disease may exhibit differences with severe diseased and non-diseased groups. The long-term&#xD;
      goal of the project is to address the following research questions: Are metabolic profiles&#xD;
      generated by the imaging system effective for determining presence and severity of retinal&#xD;
      diseases?; and if so, are these metabolic profiles useful in identifying people at risk for&#xD;
      progression to sight threatening forms of retinal diseases?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population. We will first apply the systems in 3 groups of 10 people exhibiting a range&#xD;
      of severity in retinal diseases that influence retinal metabolism; these diseases are:&#xD;
      age-related macular degeneration (AMD); diabetic retinopathy (DR); and von-Hippel-Lindau&#xD;
      (VHL) disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. Cross-sectional sampling design. If the system yields accurate, stable, and&#xD;
      repeatable results it will be applied in longitudinal studies to evaluate prognostic utility&#xD;
      for estimating the risk of progression to sight-threatening AMD, DR, or VHL disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures. The magnitude and 3-D topographic profile of fluorescence anisotropy values&#xD;
      across physiologically meaningful time periods for a 20 degree field centered on the macula.&#xD;
      Fluorescence anisotropy of our system provides a measure of retinal metabolism.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        GENERAL INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Ability and willingness to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Presence of a natural lens in the study eye(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Media clarity, pupillary dilation, and cooperation sufficient to perform measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. All participants will have the ability to read with at least 1 eye&#xD;
&#xD;
        AMD-SPECIFIC INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants will range from those with no AMD and little or no drusen in either eye&#xD;
        through end stage AMD (geographic atrophic, retinal pigment epithelial detachment, or other&#xD;
        signs of neovascular/exudative disease) in one eye. Participants will be classified with&#xD;
        the AREDS System for Classifying Age-Related Macular Degeneration and will exhibit a range&#xD;
        of severities of AMD with at least half exhibiting unilateral advanced AMD (geographic&#xD;
        atrophy or neovascular AMD) and half at high risk of progression. Inclusion criteria are as&#xD;
        follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A diagnosis of AMD. We will use AREDS criteria and diagnostic scales for the&#xD;
             definition of AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Men and women aged 60 years or older. Children are not included because AMD (by&#xD;
             definition) is a disease afflicting adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Eligible participants may have no evidence of AMD with little or no drusen in either&#xD;
             eye, or may have any stage of AMD through end stage (geographic atrophic, retinal&#xD;
             pigment epithelial detachment, or other signs of neovascular/exudative disease) in one&#xD;
             eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        DR-SPECIFIC INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. People with DR will be classified with the modified ETDRS scale; participants will&#xD;
             have a range of severities of DR, with at least half classified in the severe&#xD;
             non-proliferative DR category (SNPDR). Efforts will be made to recruit people with&#xD;
             unilateral SNPDR.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants will be men and women aged 18 years or older with diagnosis of diabetes&#xD;
             mellitus (type 1 or type 2). Any one of the following will be considered sufficient&#xD;
             evidence that diabetes is present:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Current regular use of insulin for the treatment of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Current regular use of oral antihyperglycemia agents for the treatment of&#xD;
                  diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Documented diabetes by ADA guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        VHL-SPECIFIC INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants will be men and women aged 18 years or older with a genetic confirmation&#xD;
             of VHL-disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. People with VHL disease exhibit a range of retinal lesions from none to severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        GENERAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Cataract surgery in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Glaucoma with evidence of optic nerve damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Chronic requirement for any systemic or ocular medication for other eye diseases other&#xD;
             than AMD, DR, or VHL-disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Presence of implanted medical devices that may be affected by electromagnetic&#xD;
             frequency (EMF) emissions. Although our equipment is CE or UL rated for EMF emissions&#xD;
             it would be prudent to exclude people with implanted pacemakers, neural stimulators,&#xD;
             and insulin pumps.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Arrhythmia as indicated in medical records, as this may result in instability in&#xD;
             measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of seizures. The scanning mechanism of the system operates at 12 Hz, which may&#xD;
             induce a seizure (n.b. a 12Hz scan rate is used in the Heidelberg HRTII and HRA).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or other lung disease that&#xD;
             might make breathing 100% O2 unsafe.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Ocular disease (other than AMD, DR, or VHL) that confounds assessment of the retina.&#xD;
             These include but are not limited to central serous choroidopathy, optic atrophy,&#xD;
             retinal vein occlusion, active uveitis, significant explained or unexplained visual&#xD;
             field loss, or any other type of retinopathy or retinal degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Vitreous hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of renal failure requiring dialysis or renal transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Existing condition that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude&#xD;
             participation in the study (e.g., unstable medical status including blood pressure and&#xD;
             glycemic control).&#xD;
