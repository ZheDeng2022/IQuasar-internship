      The study's overarching aim is to determine whether Enzymatically Augmented Subcutaneous&#xD;
      Infusion (EASI) can assist in out-of-hospital situations characterized by mismatch between&#xD;
      need for, and ability to achieve, access to the vascular compartment. One mechanism for&#xD;
      providing access to the vascular compartment, subcutaneous infusion, is facilitated by&#xD;
      administration of hyaluronidase; the hyaluronidase hydrolyzes hyaluronan the major&#xD;
      subcutaneous diffusion barrier. Hyaluronidase thus increases local dispersion and absorption&#xD;
      of subcutaneously administered drugs and fluids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EASI Access study is intended to be the first out-of-hospital study assessing&#xD;
      FDA-approved Chinese hamster ovary-derived recombinant hyaluronidase (the recombinant product&#xD;
      is hereafter referred to by the shorter brand name, Hylenex). The EASI Access will test some&#xD;
      fundamental principles and will facilitate design and implementation of follow-up&#xD;
      investigations (e.g. extension of access to non-ALS providers). For example, we will attempt&#xD;
      to show that EASI access is simple, effective, and has few or no downsides as compared to IV&#xD;
      access.&#xD;

      Background Challenges to IV access outside the hospital The out-of-hospital setting can pose&#xD;
      myriad challenges to the provider attempting to gain access to the intravascular compartment.&#xD;
      In an individual patient encounter, placement of an intravenous (IV) catheter may be hampered&#xD;
      by anatomy (e.g. venous collapse in hypotension), positioning (e.g. entrapment), and&#xD;
      environmental conditions such as lighting and vehicular motion. These problems may be&#xD;
      compounded in situations where multiple patients simultaneously require expedited IV access.&#xD;
      Therefore, both &quot;host&quot; (i.e. patient) and &quot;environment&quot; (i.e. physical setting) parameters&#xD;
      can contribute to a mismatch between desire for, and ability to achieve, access to the&#xD;
      intravascular compartment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aforementioned issues with IV line placement all make the assumption of presence of an&#xD;
      operator with appropriate Advanced Life Support (ALS)-level training and credentials. Such&#xD;
      may not be the case in a mass casualty incident (MCI) situation, or in a situation where&#xD;
      initial responders are Basic Life Support (BLS) level. Thus, consideration of potential&#xD;
      barriers to intravascular compartment access should include &quot;personnel&quot; as well as &quot;host&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;environment&quot; parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case for importance of access to intravascular compartment Is intravascular access really&#xD;
      important? Assuming that an EMS system could fiat easy and widespread access to the&#xD;
      intravascular compartment in an MCI or more routine ALS or BLS response, is there impact on&#xD;
      outcome? Unfortunately, as is often the case with EMS interventions, there is little or no&#xD;
      randomized controlled evidence addressing the issue - in fact, related literature on&#xD;
      penetrating trauma suggests that prehospital fluid resuscitation may be deleterious. However,&#xD;
      clinical practice as well as standard emergency medicine and trauma resuscitation teaching&#xD;
      (such as the Advanced Cardiac Life Support course and the Advanced Trauma Life Support text)&#xD;
      do emphasize importance of early fluid resuscitation for a variety of injuries and&#xD;
      illnesses.1 In addition, literature addressing MCI situations (e.g. crush injuries) makes a&#xD;
      strong case for the importance of fluid replacement.2 Besides opening an avenue for fluid&#xD;
      replacement, catheter-based access to the intravascular compartment allows for reliable&#xD;
      delivery of medications. For patients who are not tolerating po intake, or for those who&#xD;
      otherwise stand to benefit from parenteral drug delivery, catheter-based access to the&#xD;
      intravascular compartment allows for administration of repeated doses of a variety of drugs&#xD;
      while avoiding multiple (often painful) injections. Once the catheter is placed (currently,&#xD;
      in a vein), the access line is available to both initial and subsequent caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is obvious that out-of-hospital caregivers may use the access line for administration of&#xD;
      drugs in the (limited) prehospital pharmacopoeia, but it is equally true that&#xD;
      pre-establishment of intravascular access saves a step on arrival to the next level of care.&#xD;
      Practitioners in today's EDs currently benefit, in savings of nursing time, from not having&#xD;
      to take time to establish IV access in patients transported to the hospital by ALS units.&#xD;
      This helps both the individual patient with pre-established IV access, since ED staff can&#xD;
      immediately administer time-critical drugs - including those not in the ALS armamentarium -&#xD;
      and also aids the resource-taxed ED whose staff can execute duties other than starting IV&#xD;
      lines. Furthermore, though there is no concrete supporting evidence, common wisdom holds that&#xD;
      placement of a (smaller) IV line and fluid administration through that line, may facilitate&#xD;
      subsequent placement of a larger IV line due to more fluid in the vascular compartment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the balance of evidence from a variety of standpoints (outcomes research, accepted&#xD;
      practice and teaching, logistics) supports an argument that ability to gain access to the&#xD;
      intravascular compartment is an important priority for out-of-hospital care. Importantly, it&#xD;
      should be noted that for &quot;ED&quot; one could substitute &quot;triage tent&quot; or other MCI-related care&#xD;
      site since intravascular compartment access is of obvious import in MCI/disaster-type&#xD;
      situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential role for EASI Mechanism of subcutaneous infusion Subcutaneously administered drugs&#xD;
      and infusates must traverse an interstitial matrix to enter the vascular or lymphatic system.&#xD;
      The interstitium's resistance to drug permeation can be envisioned as functioning like a&#xD;
      three-dimensional filter through which drugs/infusates must pass. There are large molecules&#xD;
      such as elastin and collagen inhabiting a matrix of hydrated gel-like glycosaminoglycans and&#xD;
      proteoglycans. Among the glycosaminoglycans is hyaluronan, which contributes to the&#xD;
      resistance of fluid flow through the interstitium. Though hyaluronan is found in lower&#xD;
      concentration than collagen in the skin, it plays a disproportionately large role in&#xD;
      resisting fluid movement.3 Hyaluronidase modifies connective tissue permeability via&#xD;
      hydrolyzing hyaluronic acid, effecting a cleavage of the glucosaminidic bond between&#xD;
      N-acetylglucosamine and glucuronic acid moieties. The cleavage results in a decrease in&#xD;
      viscosity of the cellular cement and promotes diffusion of injected fluids, facilitating&#xD;
      their absorption. The decrease in viscosity is reversed within 24 hours, due to the rapid&#xD;
      inactivation of the hyaluronidase enzyme and also due to the rapid turnover rate of skin&#xD;
      hyaluronan.4, 5 So-called &quot;spreading agents,&quot; historically derived from animal extracts, have&#xD;
      been used clinically to facilitate dispersion and absorption of other drugs for over 50&#xD;
      years.4 The extensive history of spreading agent use was relevant to the FDA review of the&#xD;
      new recombinant enzyme. Based in part upon the longtime uses of (nonrecombinant)&#xD;
      hyaluronidase, the FDA approval for Hylenex states the drug is: &quot;Indicated as an adjuvant to&#xD;
      increase the absorption and dispersion of other injected drugs, for hypodermoclysis, and as&#xD;
      an adjunct in subcutaneous urography for improving resorption of radiopaque agents.&quot;&#xD;
      Subcutaneous infusion instead of, or prior to, IV infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Out-of-hospital clinical scenarios vary widely. It is certainly true that not all EMS&#xD;
      patients, or MCI patients, need an IV line. However, it is easy to think of out-of-hospital&#xD;
      situations in which rapidly and easily placed intravascular access could be very helpful, and&#xD;
      in which standard IV catheters may not be the (sole) solution. To name but a few examples,&#xD;
      there could be a:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single-patient encounter where the IV line is difficult to place&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multi-car motor vehicle crash (MVC) site attended by many BLS, but few ALS, providers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Marathon medical support tent confronted with scores of volume-depleted individuals&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Building collapse (e.g. in an earthquake) with numerous victims in whom simultaneous and&#xD;
           timely fluid replacement can stave off crush-mediated renal failure Standard texts such&#xD;
           as the American College of Surgeons' Advanced Trauma Life Support note that the need for&#xD;
           IV access is often present in cases where there is no ability to place an indwelling&#xD;
           vascular catheter. The ATLS text points out that fluid resuscitation in clinically&#xD;
           challenging environments (e.g. austere conditions, MCI situations) is often of&#xD;
           sufficient criticality that, in the absence of IV access, hydration should be attempted&#xD;
           through oral or rectal routes. As the ACS Committee on Trauma writes, oral hydration has&#xD;
           obvious aspiration and absorption risks, and rectal clysis (as it is denoted in the ATLS&#xD;
           text) presents obvious logistic and patient comfort issues in the field.1 It is thus&#xD;
           clear that there is a potential role for EASI access if such access extends the ability&#xD;
           to usefully reach the intravascular compartment. In terms of its potential as a&#xD;
           mechanism for out-of-hospital fluid replacement and as a route for drug administration,&#xD;
           EASI warrants attention in the form of a trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to the current standard of IV (and perhaps intraosseous) line placement by ALS-level&#xD;
      providers, EASI access could enable out-of-hospital responders (ALS as well as lower echelon&#xD;
      providers) to achieve intravascular access in more patients, more quickly, more reliably, and&#xD;
      with less pain. We thus plan to conduct the EASI Access study for out-of-hospital providers,&#xD;
      as a mechanism to investigate whether EASI access can accrue the hypothesized advantages. The&#xD;
      study will begin with ALS-level providers. The ultimate plan, should ALS provider EASI prove&#xD;
      efficient, will be to assess whether simple placement of EASI access by non-ALS providers can&#xD;
      extend the reach of advanced care providers in situations where need for IV access outstrips&#xD;
      available resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not specifically the goal of the EASI Access trial, but potentially relevant for any future&#xD;
      use of Hylenex, is that the ability to avoid IV access may be occasionally useful in the&#xD;
      acute care setting. In patients who are very young, or cachectic, or simply need IV access&#xD;
      for fluid replacement, EASI may be able to obviate the need for (possibly numerous) IV&#xD;
      &quot;sticks&quot; and their attendant discomfort. The low, but nonzero, rate of IV access&#xD;
      complications (e.g. thrombosis, phlebitis) in general may also be avoided by use of EASI&#xD;
      access. The EASI Access investigation very clearly does not offer these potential advantages&#xD;
      to the current trial's study subjects, but the hypothetical advantages to avoiding IV&#xD;
      placement do provide further possible relevance to any positive findings in the EASI Access&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
