  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if emergency room physicians can use bedside&#xD;
      ultrasound to quickly determine the proper placement of a central venous catheter and to&#xD;
      evaluate for complications such as a punctured lung.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Central venous catheterization (CVC) of the subclavian or internal jugular veins is a common&#xD;
      procedure performed in the emergency department (ED). This procedure is followed by&#xD;
      complications in 0.3 to 12% of cases. Pneumothorax (PTX) and catheter-tip misplacement can&#xD;
      occur. The diagnosis of these complications requires a chest radiograph (CXR). In certain&#xD;
      cases, CXR may be time-consuming, requiring more than 30 minutes. This could be harmful in&#xD;
      the case of critically ill patients. Moreover, several investigators have questioned the need&#xD;
      of routine post-procedural CXR in the absence of clinical complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent data has shown that ultrasound can accurately detect PTX in critically ill patients.&#xD;
      Furthermore, bedside ultrasound is an easy technique to investigate the subclavian and&#xD;
      internal jugular veins, and can improve the success rate of catheter insertion. Ultrasound&#xD;
      also allows visualization of central venous catheters in vivo. Ultrasound has been reported&#xD;
      as a tool to detect catheterization complications and misplacement when performed by ICU&#xD;
      physicians, but has never been studied in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This method could be valuable in hemodynamically unstable patients, who quickly need a CVC&#xD;
      for the measurement of central venous pressure, immediate fluid resuscitation, and infusion&#xD;
      of vasoactive medications. Similarly, bedside ultrasound examination could quickly confirm&#xD;
      PTX and allow immediate chest tube insertion in case of respiratory distress after catheter&#xD;
      insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that bedside ultrasound examination performed by ED physicians could&#xD;
      accurately detect placement of the CVC and the presence or absence of a PTX after&#xD;
      catheterization of the jugular and subclavian veins.&#xD;
