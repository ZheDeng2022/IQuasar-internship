  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A preliminary study has shown that the hormone-similar, growth-retarding drug octreotide can&#xD;
      prolong survival time in patients with primary liver cancer. Due to methodological&#xD;
      deficiencies of the preliminary study the results will be re-checked by the comparison of&#xD;
      octreotide with an pseudo-drug (so-called placebo) primarily regarding to the survival time&#xD;
      and secondarily concerning costs, side effects, patient cooperation and quality of life as&#xD;
      well as specific conditions in the tumor tissue in both groups with 108 patients with primary&#xD;
      liver cancer.&#xD;

      A pilot study showed that octreotide can prolong survival time of patients with HCC. Due to&#xD;
      methodological deficiencies the results of this pilot study will be re-evaluated by&#xD;
      comparison of octreotide versus placebo primarily regarding to the global survival time and&#xD;
      secondarily concerning the costs, side effects, patient compliance and quality of life as&#xD;
      well as the Somatostatin receptors in the tumor tissue and its prognostic relevance in both&#xD;
      groups with 108 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis was done after occurrence of the half of the events (deaths). No&#xD;
      significant effect could be shown.&#xD;
