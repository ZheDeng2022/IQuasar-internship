      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from gene-modified tumor cells may help the body build an immune&#xD;
      response to kill tumor cells. Giving booster vaccinations may make a stronger immune response&#xD;
      and prevent or delay the recurrence of pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well vaccine therapy works&#xD;
      in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that has been removed by surgery.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety of primary and boost vaccinations with lethally irradiated&#xD;
           allogeneic pancreatic tumor cells transfected with sargramostim (GM-CSF) gene vaccine in&#xD;
           patients with surgically resected adenocarcinoma of the head, neck, or uncinate of the&#xD;
           pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate specific in vivo parameters of immune response (e.g., mesothelin, prostate&#xD;
           stem cell antigen, and mutated k-ras-specific T-cell responses) with clinical response&#xD;
           in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the efficacy, in terms of overall and recurrence-free survival, of this&#xD;
           regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate serum GM-CSF levels with longevity of an allogeneic vaccine after semi-annual&#xD;
           boosting in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the psychosocial (e.g., demographics, quality of life, hope, trust, social&#xD;
           support, decision control, and advanced directives) and symptom (e.g., pain, anorexia,&#xD;
           fatigue, and mood state) profiles in these patients and explore changes over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a open-label study. Patients are stratified according to prior vaccination&#xD;
      with allogeneic sargramostim (GM-CSF)-secreting pancreatic tumor cell vaccine (yes [stratum&#xD;
      I] vs no [stratum II]).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stratum I: Patients receive booster vaccination comprising allogeneic GM-CSF plasmid DNA&#xD;
           pancreatic tumor cell vaccine subcutaneously (SC). Treatment repeats every 6 months in&#xD;
           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stratum II: Patients receive priming vaccinations SC once a month for 3 months and then&#xD;
           receive booster vaccinations as in stratum I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete self-reported psychosocial (including quality of life, hope, and trust) and&#xD;
      symptom (including pain, fatigue, anorexia, and mood) questionnaires at day 0 and day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at day 28 and then annually for 15&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
