    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous lidocaine infusion&#xD;
      administered during general anesthesia in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reducing length of hospital stay following total abdominal hysterectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reducing postoperative analgesic requirement following total abdominal hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The addition of an intraoperative lidocaine infusion to a balanced anesthetic technique will&#xD;
      result in up to 50% of patients being discharged after postoperative day 2 compared with the&#xD;
      current 21%. Also, it will result in a 30% reduction in opiod consumption during the first 48&#xD;
      hours following total abdominal hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assumption:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the intervention and control groups will be titrated to approximately equal&#xD;
      analgesia because they will self-administer enough pain-controlling medications to make their&#xD;
      postoperative pain experience the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Length of hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Total opioid use at 48 hours postoperatively&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes. The following data will be collected and analyzed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intraoperative data: BIS scores (to control depth of anesthesia); intraoperative serum&#xD;
           lidocaine levels; intraoperative opioid use&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Opioid use in the recovery room&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) morphine requirements postoperatively up to 48 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Oral pain controlling medication use up to 48 hours postoperatively if IV PCA&#xD;
           discontinued before 48 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Verbal Analogue Scale (VAS) pain scores in recovery room and during first 2 days&#xD;
           post-operatively&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Incidence of side effects that can be attributed to local anesthetic toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Incidence of nausea and vomiting and anti-emetic use up to 48 hours postoperatively&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Time of first flatus and first bowel movement.&#xD;

      Provide the rationale for the study (see list of references attached separately).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate postoperative pain control is still a major problem for many surgical patients.&#xD;
      Identifying better ways of controlling pain during and after surgery remains an ongoing goal&#xD;
      of research in anesthesia. Continuous infusion of IV lidocaine has been identified in the&#xD;
      anesthetic literature as a valuable supplement to general anesthesia. Approximately 20% of&#xD;
      all total abdominal hysterectomies at The Ottawa Hospital today are done using a continuous&#xD;
      IV lidocaine infusion in addition to general anesthesia. Considering its low cost, ease of&#xD;
      administration, and low incidence of side effects, lidocaine presents an attractive&#xD;
      anesthetic option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there have been only a few randomized controlled trials to date that have assessed&#xD;
      the effect of IV lidocaine on a patient's pain control. These trials were small single center&#xD;
      studies that require independent validation at other institutions and in other surgical&#xD;
      populations. In the previous trials, the standard anesthetic technique was not as well&#xD;
      controlled as it will be in this trial. If approved this study will add to the scant but&#xD;
      promising literature concerning peri-operative lidocaine use for analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Lidocaine infusion supplements general anesthesia and improves analgesia. Lidocaine has&#xD;
           been used to supplement general anesthesia for over 50 years (1). It has a MAC sparing&#xD;
           effect that allows reduction of other anesthetic agents in a balanced anesthetic&#xD;
           technique (1). Lidocaine infusions improve pain scores in burn patients and provide&#xD;
           sufficient analgesia without the addition of an opioid analgesic (3). Its use is well&#xD;
           established in chronic neuropathic and ischemic pain (6,7). Over the last decade, its&#xD;
           use in the management of acute pain and pre-emptive analgesia has increased. Studies&#xD;
           demonstrating improved pain scores with movement and at rest in major abdominal&#xD;
           surgeries and radical retropubic prostatectomy have been published (2,5,8).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. IV Lidocaine infusion dose and toxicity (2,3,4,5,6,7,10). Lidocaine toxicity does not&#xD;
           occur with plasma levels below 5 mcg/mL. Currently reported dosing vary between 'no IV&#xD;
           bolus' to 3 mg/kg/hr IV bolus followed by 1.5 to 3 mg/kg/hr infusion rates. These doses&#xD;
           generally result in plasma levels of 1.3-3.7 mcg/mL. There is no increase in local&#xD;
           anesthetic toxicity at these plasma levels compared to placebo. In one study up to 2.6&#xD;
           mg/kg/hr of lidocaine had been infusing for 24 hours after the end of surgery with no&#xD;
           reported side effects attributed to local anesthetic toxicity (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
           In another lidocaine dose-response study an infusion of 500 mg of lidocaine over one&#xD;
           hour in 13 patients with neuropathic chronic pain (6) resulted in plasma levels of 2.43&#xD;
           +/- 1.01 mcg/mL at the initial onset of analgesia. This corresponds to infusion rates of&#xD;
           approximately 6-7 mg/kg/hr of lidocaine (no bolus). The amount of lidocaine used at the&#xD;
           onset of analgesia was 123+/-55 mg over ~ 9-20 minutes. Complete analgesia was reported&#xD;
           in 10 out 13 patients with corresponding plasma levels of 3.79+/- 1.00 mcg/mL with a&#xD;
           total lidocaine dose of ~ 375 +/- 23mg over 36-54 minutes. In 3 patients there was a&#xD;
           significant reduction in pain but no complete analgesia. Light-headedness at some time&#xD;
           during infusion was reported in 6 out of 13 patients and their lidocaine levels ranged&#xD;
           from 0.9 to 3.08 mcg/mL. At no time did the infusion need to be adjusted because of&#xD;
           subjective complaints of toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The dose of lidocaine currently used at the Ottawa Hospital Department of Anesthesia to&#xD;
           supplement general anesthesia is a bolus of 1-1.5 mg/kg followed by an intraoperative&#xD;
           infusion of 1.2 to 3 mg/kg/hr. In this study we propose a bolus of 1.5 mg/kg followed by&#xD;
           3 mg/kg/hr infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Lidocaine infusion reduces opiod consumption. Lidocaine infusions have decreased the&#xD;
           opioid and NSAID use following major surgery (2,5). A protocol and a case report in burn&#xD;
           patients demonstrate markedly reduced requirements for opioid analgesia (3). The reduced&#xD;
           use of opiods should be associated with lower incidence of opiod-related side effects&#xD;
           and decreased use of medication to treat these side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Lidocaine infusion improves bowel function. Lidocaine use speeds the return of bowel&#xD;
           function that is a major complication of intra-abdominal operations. In both radical&#xD;
           prostatectomy and cholecystectomy patients' time to passage of first postoperative bowel&#xD;
           movement was decreased (4,5).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Lidocaine infusion leads to quicker discharge. Lidocaine use led to faster discharge&#xD;
           from hospital in-patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (5). This result is likely&#xD;
           due to the combined beneficial effects as outlined above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited through multiple mechanisms. These will include, but not be&#xD;
      restricted to: preoperative assessment clinics, physicians' clinics, and hospital wards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia physicians, Obstetrics and Gynecology physicians, residents, and nurses involved&#xD;
      in the care of potential total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) candidates will be be informed&#xD;
      about the study by primary investigators through memos, presentatations, departmental&#xD;
      meetings. Potential subjects will be identified by these physicians, residents, and nurses&#xD;
      involved in the care of TAH patients. Study personnel will be contacted to determine patient&#xD;
      eligibility for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary investigators at the Civic and General campuses of Ottawa Hospital and physicians at&#xD;
      the Preoperative Assessment Unit (PAU) at both campuses will identify patients undergoing&#xD;
      elective total abdominal hysterectomy. These patients will be offered an opportunity to&#xD;
      participate in the study during standard pre-anesthetic assessment at the Pre-Admission Unit&#xD;
      by an anesthesiologist. During this assessment a full medical history, a complete physical&#xD;
      exam, and appropriate investigations will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient is willing to consider participation, a study investigator or their delegate&#xD;
      will discuss the study. The study information sheet will be provided to the patient. The&#xD;
      rationale for the study and the study protocol would be discussed using the language&#xD;
      appropriate for the patient's background. A discussion of benefits and risks associated with&#xD;
      the study and possible anesthetic techniques will be carried out and all questions answered&#xD;
      at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient consent. Once identified and their eligibility confirmed patients will be asked to&#xD;
      provide informed written consent using the Information sheet and Consent form (Appendix 1).&#xD;
      Participation will be entirely voluntary. Patients will neither be coerced nor offered&#xD;
      incentives to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient decides to participate a Study Checklist will be completed by research&#xD;
      personnel and placed on patient's chart. The Study Checklist form will contain pre-calculated&#xD;
      doses of medications for that particular patient as well as concise protocol checklist for&#xD;
      the attending anesthetist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization. Patients will be randomized using a computer generated random number table.&#xD;
      All patients randomized will be followed and analyzed in the group to which they are&#xD;
      allocated. All patients will be randomized as close to the time of surgery as possible to&#xD;
      avoid randomizing patients who subsequently have surgery postponed or cancelled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation concealment: Allocation to intervention or control groups will be printed on cards&#xD;
      placed in sealed, opaque, sequentially-numbered envelopes. Trial envelopes will be kept with&#xD;
      research personnel and opened in numerical order when the patient has met the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria and is ready to be randomized. An anesthesia resident or staff not involved with&#xD;
      care of the patient will open an envelope for that patient and prepare four syringes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One 10mL Study Drug Bolus syringe containing either Normal Saline or 2% Lidocaine;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three 20mL Study Drug Infusion syringes containing either Normal Saline or 2% lidocaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance of confidentiality. All records will be kept confidential. Records will be kept&#xD;
      in a locked cabinet in the Department of Anesthesiology, Civic Campus for fifteen (15) years&#xD;
      following enrollment of the last patient. Access will be restricted to study investigators&#xD;
      and research assistants. Data will be stored on a secure, password-protected computer within&#xD;
      the Department of Anesthesiology and kept strictly confidential. No information capable of&#xD;
      identifying a study participant will appear in study reports or publications&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a prospective, randomized, double blinded, clinical trial comparing&#xD;
      intravenous lidocaine infusion plus general anesthesia with general anesthesia alone. The&#xD;
      intervention group will receive a balanced anesthetic with the addition of lidocaine as&#xD;
      outlined in the anesthetic protocol outlined in appendix 2. The control group will receive a&#xD;
      balanced anesthetic with the addition of normal saline as outlined in the appendix 2. The&#xD;
      patients, clinicians, and study personnel will be blinded to group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study the effect of the addition of intraoperative intravenous lidocaine infusion&#xD;
           (1.5 mg/kg IV bolus followed by 3 mg/kg/hr infusion) to a balanced general anesthetic on&#xD;
           length of hospital stay after total abdominal hysterectomy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study the effect of the addition of intraoperative intravenous lidocaine infusion&#xD;
           (1.5 mg/kg IV bolus followed by 3 mg/kg/hr infusion) to balanced general anesthetic on&#xD;
           opioid requirements intraoperatively, in the recovery room, and up to 48 hours post&#xD;
           operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Post-operative visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores for 48 hours;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Incidence of opioid related side effects including: (a) post-operative nausea and&#xD;
           vomiting (b) subsequent anti-emetic medication use (c) decreasing time to first flatus&#xD;
           and bowel movement;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Following data will also be analyzed:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intraoperative lidocaine levels;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Incidence of side effects that can be attributed to local anesthetic toxicity;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Oral pain medications use up to 48 hours postoperatively if IV PCA discontinued&#xD;
                before 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Assessment: All patients eligible for the trial will have the following information&#xD;
      documented preoperatively: age, sex, height, weight, body mass index, serum creatinine,&#xD;
      calculated creatinine clearance (Cockroft-Gault), primary diagnosis, and scheduled procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of anesthesia: All patients will undergo a standardized anesthetic according to&#xD;
      the Study Checklist (Appendix 2) that will be completed as soon as the patient is enrolled in&#xD;
      the study. The Study Checklist will accompany the anesthetic record and the patient to the&#xD;
      OR. This Study Checklist will form the basis for the dosing of all the medications for the&#xD;
      anesthetic and the order the protocol is to be completed in. The drugs that are variable in&#xD;
      their dosing will include: propofol (will be given to the desired effect at anesthesia&#xD;
      induction); rocuronium (will be given to the desired effect of muscle relaxation); and&#xD;
      desflurane (will be titrated to a BIS reading of 40 to ensure adequate anesthetic depth). If&#xD;
      needed, morphine will be available to the attending anesthesiologist should the patient&#xD;
      demonstrate clinical signs of inadequate analgesia during the anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of intervention group: Patients in the intervention group will receive lidocaine&#xD;
      1.5 mg/kg as part of their induction. The lidocaine bolus will be followed be a continuous&#xD;
      intravenous infusion at 3.0 mg/kg/hr. The rate is pre-calculated and appears on the Study&#xD;
      Checklist (Appendix 2). The infusion of lidocaine and fentanyl will be stopped upon skin&#xD;
      closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum lidocaine levels will be collected at two points of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30 minutes after the initial bolus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  and during surgical closure, just prior to stopping the infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of control group: Patients in the control group will receive normal saline as part&#xD;
      of their induction. The normal saline bolus will be followed be a continuous intravenous&#xD;
      infusion. The rate is pre-calculated and appears on the Study Checklist (Appendix 2). The&#xD;
      infusion of normal saline and fentanyl will be stopped upon skin closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum lidocaine levels will be collected at two points of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30 minutes after the initial bolus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  and during surgical closure, just prior to stopping the infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of inadequate analgesia: Patients in the post anesthesia care unit (PACU) will be&#xD;
      given their patient controlled analgesia (PCA) after immediate assessment of visual analogue&#xD;
      scale (VAS) pain scores are complete. They can self administer morphine until their desired&#xD;
      comfort level is reached with the help of the nurse if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of opioid related side effects: Patients with satisfactory analgesia but&#xD;
      experiencing unwanted sedation will be assessed by a study physician. Patients experiencing&#xD;
      hypotension, will be given a 500mL crystalloid bolus and will assessed by a study physician.&#xD;
      Patients with significant respiratory depression will be given naloxone in 40μg boluses until&#xD;
      respiratory rate is &gt;10 and will be sedation will assessed by a study physician. Patients&#xD;
      experiencing pruritis, nausea, or insomnia will be managed with the medications outlined in&#xD;
      the Study Checklist (Appendix 2) and these orders will be on the APS order sheet that will&#xD;
      have been completed with the Study Checklist at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postop care: Patients will be discharged to the ward with care as per current Total Abdominal&#xD;
      Hysterectomy (TAH) care map.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Tests: In addition to the usual bloodwork involved during this type of&#xD;
      procedure, the anesthesiologist will collect 2 blood samples to test the levels of lidocaine&#xD;
      in your blood during surgery. There will be no further tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Switching to oral analgesia: Patients who are nearing discharge criteria and being able to&#xD;
      tolerate medications PO will be offered discontinuation of IV PCA and a switch to PO morphine&#xD;
      5-10 mg PO PRN q 2 hours. Patients will continue receiving Celebrex 200 PO q12hr with food&#xD;
      intake and Tylenol 650mg PO q4hr while awake until 72 hours postop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discharge criteria: Patients will be discharged according as per the current discharge&#xD;
      criteria for the care map of TAH patient at The Ottawa Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adequate pain control&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Vital signs stable&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Afebrile (no fever)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Passing flatus (passing gas)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. No or scant vaginal discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Incision clean, dry, intact, and edges approximated&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Tolerates diet as ordered&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Understands: staple removal instructions if applicable; New medications; discharge&#xD;
           instructions per patient information booklet; follow-up plan with Gynecology physician&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Understands there will be a follow up phone call in about one week by one of study&#xD;
           investigators to assess level of satisfaction&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Gynecology physicians will make assessment for discharge eligibility daily in the first&#xD;
      half of the day. Should the patient discharge be delayed due to logistical reasons (e.g. was&#xD;
      ready for discharge on POD2, but seen late on POD2 and discharged home POD3) - a note of that&#xD;
      will be made by study nurse in the study data sheet for that patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post discharge follow-up: patients will be contacted by study coordinator or study nurse in&#xD;
      approximately one week by phone to evaluate patient satisfaction with the overall experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure: The length of hospital stay in days will be recorded. The morphine&#xD;
      consumption will be recorded from the PCA pump database on departure from the PACU and every&#xD;
      8 hours until 48 hours postoperatively. Any other opioid medication used for weaning off PCA&#xD;
      will also be recorded and converted to morphine equivalents for analysis during the first 48&#xD;
      hours. This data will be compared between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures: Post-operative visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores will be&#xD;
      recorded on departure from the PACU and every 8 hours until 48 hours postoperatively. The&#xD;
      incidence of opioid related side effects will be recorded. This will include post-operative&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting, subsequent anti-emetic medication use, time to first flatus and bowel&#xD;
      movement. This data will be compared between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lidocaine levels that were measured at 30 minutes intraoperatively and just prior to the end&#xD;
      of the infusion will also be collected and reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: The number of patients discharged on post-operative day 2 will be analyzed&#xD;
      with a chi-square analysis. The morphine consumption at 24 and 48 hours, will be analyzed&#xD;
      with the unpaired student's t-test. Post-operative visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores&#xD;
      will be analyzed for statistical difference using an unpaired student's t-test. Analyses of&#xD;
      secondary outcomes such as immediate post-operative nausea and vomiting, subsequent&#xD;
      anti-emetic usage, time to first bowel movement will be analyzed with the unpaired student's&#xD;
      t-test Statistical significance will be assigned a probability of &lt;0.05 for all analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management. Data will be recorded on standardized data collection forms. Data will be&#xD;
      transferred from the forms to an Excel 2002 spreadsheet (Microsoft Corp, Redmond WA) at which&#xD;
      time patients will be assigned and identified by a unique trial number. Data will be exported&#xD;
      to SPSS 11.0.1 (SPSS Inc, Chicago Il) for analysis.&#xD;
