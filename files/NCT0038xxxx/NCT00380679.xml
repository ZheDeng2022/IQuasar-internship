  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), all people aged 50&#xD;
      years or older and persons aged less than 50 years who have medical conditions that put them&#xD;
      at increased risk for serious influenza disease should receive an annual influenza&#xD;
      vaccination. However, since the mid-1990s, vaccination rates and racial disparities have&#xD;
      mostly remained static, and there has been limited progress towards the Healthy People 2010&#xD;
      objectives for influenza vaccination coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine what proportion of previously unvaccinated persons&#xD;
      in target groups for whom influenza and pneumococcal vaccine are recommended will accept and&#xD;
      receive influenza and/or pneumococcal vaccine in an urban emergency department (ED), and to&#xD;
      estimate the potential impact of ED vaccination on population-based vaccination coverage. The&#xD;
      intervention will utilize a combination of assessment survey, vaccine information and&#xD;
      pre-printed vaccine order sheets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target population for influenza vaccinations includes all patients aged 18 years and&#xD;
      older for whom influenza vaccine is recommended by the ACIP. This includes all persons aged&#xD;
      50 years and older and persons aged 18 to 49 years who are in one of the following groups: 1)&#xD;
      health care workers, 2) pregnant women, 3) residents of long-term care facilities, 4)&#xD;
      household contacts and out-of-home caregivers of children aged 0 to 23 months, or 5) persons&#xD;
      with underlying chronic medical conditions which increase their risk of influenza-related&#xD;
      complications. The target population for pneumococcal vaccination includes all patients aged&#xD;
      65 years or older who have not previously been vaccinated against pneumococcus or have not&#xD;
      received the vaccine within 5 years (and were less than 65 years at the time of vaccination).&#xD;

      PROTOCOL - Baton Rouge General Medical Center&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Institute of Medicine, non-institutionalized high-risk adults may present&#xD;
      the greatest challenge to adult immunizations. There are a number of barriers to&#xD;
      implementation of comprehensive strategies for vaccinating adults:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine preventive health visits are infrequent and transient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals lack knowledge of the vaccines required during adulthood&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary care providers may lack time, knowledge, or ability to perform a vaccination&#xD;
           assessment, or it may not be part of their standard practice pattern&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary care providers lack the infrastructure (especially time and personnel) to assist&#xD;
           with adequately assessing and documenting immunization status&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emergency departments represent ideal settings for vaccination efforts because each year&#xD;
      millions of adults who have no or limited access to traditional primary care visit hospital&#xD;
      EDs for medical and surgical problems that are non-life threatening. Such EDs often already&#xD;
      provide other medical screening and preventive care services in the management of their&#xD;
      patients. Almost one-quarter of adults aged 65 years and older make one or more visits to an&#xD;
      emergency department each year. Patients who use EDs as their usual source of care are more&#xD;
      likely to be members of minority groups and uninsured. These characteristics suggest that&#xD;
      vaccination programs in EDs could have a significant impact in correcting disparities in&#xD;
      vaccination coverage among patients in older age groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combined with the large volume of patient visits each day, these characteristics would seem&#xD;
      to make EDs ideal settings to implement vaccination services for people who have little&#xD;
      access to primary care. Furthermore, influenza vaccination in EDs could play a substantial&#xD;
      role in correcting disparities in vaccination coverage among this cohort of patients. The&#xD;
      American College of Emergency Physicians recommends that ED personnel consider participating&#xD;
      in influenza vaccine programs for the elderly if other sources of vaccination are not readily&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A limited number of studies suggest that about half of patients for whom influenza vaccine is&#xD;
      indicated (based on age or other high risk conditions) who have not yet received influenza&#xD;
      vaccination during the current season would accept vaccination if it was offered to them&#xD;
      during an ED visit. However, since these studies were conducted early in the vaccination&#xD;
      season and involved the use of convenience samples, the results might not be generalizable to&#xD;
      all patients seen in an ED throughout the vaccination season. The proportion of persons who&#xD;
      would not have been vaccinated elsewhere but would accept vaccination in EDs has not been&#xD;
      demonstrated. Therefore, the true potential of vaccination in EDs to increase vaccination&#xD;
      coverage is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional evidence suggests that strong recommendation by a health care professional,&#xD;
      particularly the patient's primary physician, can further increase the acceptance of&#xD;
      influenza vaccine. However, there is limited evidence regarding the effectiveness of&#xD;
      counseling by providers who are previously unknown to the patient, as is usually the case in&#xD;
      an ED setting, to produce a similar change in patient behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals and Objectives The overall goal is to determine the feasibility, sustainability,&#xD;
      acceptability, and effectiveness of hospital-based vaccination efforts and to increase&#xD;
      influenza immunization coverage among persons aged 18 years and older for whom vaccination is&#xD;
      recommended who would otherwise not have been vaccinated. Inherent in feasibility and&#xD;
      sustainability are the ability to recoup some income from those vaccinated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients aged 18 years and older who seek medical care in the ED, determine&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the number of vaccinations administered to eligible persons&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the proportion of patients, among all persons not previously vaccinated, who accept&#xD;
           vaccines in the emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the increase in coverage that can be achieved through a four-month emergency&#xD;
           department-based vaccination program&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All patients aged 18 years and older will be approached by the PPS after the chief&#xD;
           complaint is ascertained. The PPS will begin and administer a questionnaire on all&#xD;
           eligible patients for whom vaccine is recommended. If the patient is eligible, the PPS&#xD;
           will read the questionnaire to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If the patient is unsure or states that he or she does not want to receive the flu&#xD;
           vaccine, the PPS will determine the reason for vaccine refusal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient meets criteria for influenza vaccination and/or pneumococcal vaccination, the&#xD;
      PPS will inform him/her that influenza/pneumococcal vaccine is/are recommended for them and&#xD;
      that the vaccination will be offered to eligible patients in the ED at no additional charge&#xD;
      beyond that which is reimbursed by their insurance. Patients will be referred to a physician&#xD;
      for additional assessment if they have a questionable or possible contraindication. The PPS&#xD;
      will provide all eligible patients with the appropriate Vaccine Information Statement(s) and&#xD;
      answer any questions. If the patient agrees to be vaccinated, the PPS will place a preprinted&#xD;
      order form in the patient's chart, ask the physician to sign the order, and alert the&#xD;
      patient's nurse. The patient will be offered vaccination by an ED nurse while they are&#xD;
      undergoing evaluation and treatment in the emergency room. The nurse giving the vaccination&#xD;
      will document the lot number, expiration date, time and location of the injection(s) on a&#xD;
      label that will be placed in the patient's chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Documentation of doses received will be faxed to the patient's private care physician, if the&#xD;
      information is available for doing so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How confidentiality will be maintained:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal identifiers will not be retained by investigators beyond the time needed to document&#xD;
      dose receipt in the patient medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients under 18 years of age will be excluded. Any patient with a medically unstable&#xD;
      condition, altered mental status, or language barrier will also be excluded. Patients who&#xD;
      present with a contraindication to influenza vaccination (acute febrile illness or a history&#xD;
      of allergic reaction to eggs) or pneumococcal vaccine will not be eligible for receipt of&#xD;
      those vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunization status:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous immunization history will be assessed by patient self-report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be the number of indicated influenza and pneumococcal&#xD;
      vaccinations received during the course of the study. Data will be collected and analyzed&#xD;
      according to demographic information, contraindications, and clinical consent.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Study design and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All patients aged 50 years and older will be approached by the scribe after the chief&#xD;
           complaint is ascertained. The scribe will begin and administer a questionnaire on all&#xD;
           age eligible patients. Having already taken a history, the scribe will be able to easily&#xD;
           determine if the patient is eligible for the study (i.e. does not meet any of the&#xD;
           exclusion criteria). If the patient is eligible, the scribe will read the questionnaire&#xD;
           to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If the patient is unsure or states that he or she does not want to be vaccinated, the&#xD;
           scribe will determine the reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient meets criteria for vaccination (i.e., has not been previously vaccinated&#xD;
      against influenza this season and has no known contraindications to influenza vaccination),&#xD;
      the scribe will inform him/her that influenza vaccine is recommended and that the vaccine&#xD;
      will be offered to eligible patients in the ED at no additional charge beyond that which is&#xD;
      reimbursed by their insurance. Patients will be referred to a physician for additional&#xD;
      assessment if they have a questionable or possible contraindication. The scribe will provide&#xD;
      all eligible patients with a VIS and answer any questions. If the patient agrees to be&#xD;
      vaccinated, the scribe will place a preprinted label in the patient's chart, ask the&#xD;
      physician to sign the order, and alert the patient's nurse. The patient will be offered&#xD;
      vaccination by an ED nurse while they are undergoing evaluation and treatment in the&#xD;
      emergency room. The nurse giving the vaccination will document the lot number, expiration&#xD;
      date, time and location of the injection on a label that will be placed in the patient's&#xD;
      chart.&#xD;

      Personal identifiers will not be retained by investigators beyond the time needed to document&#xD;
      dose receipt in the patient medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients under 50 years of age will be excluded. Any patient with a medically unstable&#xD;
      condition, altered mental status, or language barrier will also be excluded. Patients who&#xD;
      present with a contraindication to influenza vaccination (acute febrile illness or a history&#xD;
      of allergic reaction to eggs) or previous influenza vaccines will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunization status:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous immunization history will be assessed by patient self-report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be the number of indicated influenza vaccinations received&#xD;
      during the course of the study. Data will be collected and analyzed according to demographic&#xD;
      information, contraindications, and clinical consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analysis will be of the effectiveness of systems changes to deliver vaccine in an&#xD;
      emergency department setting. If necessary, surveys will be administered to key staff persons&#xD;
      to assist with data gathering for this analysis.&#xD;
