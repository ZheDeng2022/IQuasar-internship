      Reperfusion Injury occurs by the sudden blood flow to the injured and ischemic myocardium&#xD;
      during restoration of blood flow either by Mechanical revascularization or thrombolysis. A&#xD;
      phenomenon known as Pre-conditioning has been identified to limit the the extent and severity&#xD;
      of reperfusion injury but it is very difficult to apply it in patient care setting as timing&#xD;
      of acute cardiac or neurologic ischemic event is difficult to reliably predict.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postconditioning or ischemic postconditioning is well known to attenuate the reperfusion&#xD;
      injury. There is enough data that shows the benefit of post conditioning in reducing the&#xD;
      reperfusion injury in animals. However postconditioning in humans has not been investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that Post conditioning will attenuate the reperfusion injury and will be&#xD;
      comparable to the effect of preconditioning in humans.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Myocardial ischemia is one on the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in the United&#xD;
      States. The initial injury to the myocardium is due to a state of imbalance when oxygen&#xD;
      demand exceeds supply. This is most pronounced in the cases of sudden total occlusion of a&#xD;
      coronary artery that results in myocardial injury and necrosis (AMI). The main stay of the&#xD;
      therapy in these cases is the restoration of the flow to the ischemic myocardium by means of&#xD;
      reperfusion therapy such as thrombolysis or mechanical revascularization. Interestingly,&#xD;
      there is data to suggest that sudden restoration of blood flow to the ischemic myocardium may&#xD;
      cause another form of myocardial injury ,known as reperfusion injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although initially controversial, reperfusion injury is now recognized as a distinct entity.&#xD;
      This refers to the sudden and brisk reperfusion of ischemic myocardium that may induce injury&#xD;
      that was not originally present-paradoxically exaggerating the end result of an ischemic&#xD;
      event. Reperfusion injury may increase infarct size, decrease myocardial contractile function&#xD;
      and induce or exaggerate vascular endothelial dysfunction. The pathophysiology is not well&#xD;
      understood, but some of the effects of reperfusion injury have been attributed to the&#xD;
      generation of free oxygen radical and increased oxidative stress possibly related to the&#xD;
      abnormalities of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzyme and its byproducts. These cellular&#xD;
      events lead to the endothelial dysfunction, a pivotal event in the development of reperfusion&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A concept known as pre-conditioning has been identified as a phenomenon that limits the&#xD;
      extent and severity of reperfusion injury. Classically, preconditioning refers to the&#xD;
      occurrence whereby repeated brief episodes of ischemia preceding a prolonged period of&#xD;
      ischemia results in marked diminution of ischemic injury and injury occurring during&#xD;
      reperfusion. The mechanism of this ischemic tolerance was thought to be secondary to the&#xD;
      recruitment of collateral circulation, as it was noted to develop in patients undergoing&#xD;
      serial balloon inflations during angioplasty. The cellular mechanism involved in ischemic&#xD;
      preconditioning are not completely understood, but may be related to the attenuation of&#xD;
      reperfusion injury. These findings are also corroborated by Kharbanda's group in their&#xD;
      findings made after inducing forearm ischemia in 31 healthy volunteers. In an attempt to test&#xD;
      the effects of ischemic preconditioning on the attenuation of ischemia-reperfusion injury as&#xD;
      it pertains to endothelial function and circulating blood cell function, the forearms of&#xD;
      these volunteers were made ischemic for a 20 minutes period using a pneumatic blood pressure&#xD;
      cuff to 200 mmHg. This method was then compared to the use of ischemic preconditioning prior&#xD;
      to the prolonged 20 minutes ischemic episode. Ischemic preconditioning was induced by&#xD;
      inflating the pneumatic cuff to 200 mmhg for 5 minutes and then deflating the cuff. This was&#xD;
      repeated for a total of 3 times. Radial artery reactivity testing and blood samples were&#xD;
      collected from the antecubital vein at timed intervals after cuff deflation in both methods.&#xD;
      It was noted that ischemic -preconditioning prior to prolonged forearm ischemia prevented&#xD;
      both endothelial dysfunction and neutrophil activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, although pre-conditioning has been extensively studied and has shown to reduce&#xD;
      reperfusion injury in both animal and human models, it is difficult to practically apply this&#xD;
      in a patient-care setting. This is because the timing of acute cardiac or neurologic ischemic&#xD;
      events is difficult to reliably predict. Accordingly, this has generated great interest in a&#xD;
      theory known as post-conditioning. Post conditioning or ischemic post-conditioning is a&#xD;
      concept whereby short, repetitive ischemic episodes applied during early reperfusion of&#xD;
      ischemic myocardium will attenuate reperfusion injury. It appears that both pre-conditioning&#xD;
      and post-conditioning target the same pathophysiological mechanism, or share effects on a&#xD;
      final common pathway involved in the pathogenesis of reperfusion injury. In a recent study,&#xD;
      the effects of ischemic post-conditioning were compared to ischemic preconditioning in the&#xD;
      coronary circulation of an animal model. An open chest, left anterior descending coronary&#xD;
      artery occlusion model was used in 29 dots (10 controls, 9 preconditioning, and 10&#xD;
      post-conditioning). When compared to controls, both interventions showed protective&#xD;
      myocardial effects. The strategy of post-conditioning had comparable results to ischemic&#xD;
      preconditioning regarding reduction in infarct size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial dysfunction is on of the signs of early atherosclerosis, and also a major&#xD;
      component of ischemia-reperfusion injury. Several factors affect endothelial function, but&#xD;
      the presence of reactive oxygen species in the vessel wall and the ability of endothelium to&#xD;
      generated nitric oxide (NO) seem to be the most important determinants of endothelial&#xD;
      function. Due to abnormalities in NOS, the generation of free oxygen radicals increases, and&#xD;
      the level of NO decreases during an ischemic episode. This leads to significant alterations&#xD;
      in the endothelial function. Under ischemic conditions, nitric oxide synthase produces&#xD;
      superoxide (.O2-) in excess of nitric oxide (NO). Superoxide can react with the surrounding&#xD;
      nitric oxide to produce a potent oxidizing agent, peroxynitrite (ONOO-). These oxygen&#xD;
      radicals are thought to contribute to the development of ischemia-reperfusion injury in&#xD;
      humans. NO has been shown to play a significant role in reducing reperfusion injury in&#xD;
      humans. The group from our institution demonstrated this where reperfusion injury in the&#xD;
      forearm of human subjects was attenuated by the administration of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4),&#xD;
      a cofactor for NOS that leads to the production of NO (unpublished data, Baballiaros et al.).&#xD;
      The time course for oxidative marker expression, such as NO, after ischemia-reperfusion&#xD;
      injury is expected to occur as early as 2.5 to 5 minutes after reperfusion. Several studies&#xD;
      have examined the time course of NO, nitrosyl hemoglobin, glutathione reduction-oxidation,&#xD;
      and hydro peroxides. In a study conducted by Mochizuki et al, describing an arterial flow&#xD;
      mediated dilation model, NO attained a peak value with a first-order time delay and the peak&#xD;
      level NO concentration was linearly correlated with perfusion rate in each vessel. It must be&#xD;
      noted, however, that the peak and duration of the levels are somewhat variable and depend on&#xD;
      perfusion flow and the diameter of the vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial function can be non-invasively evaluated using Brachial (or Radial) artery&#xD;
      reactivity testing (BART) as a measure of flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Since it's beginnings&#xD;
      in 1989, the study of FMD has now taken on an expanded role in the understanding of&#xD;
      endothelial physiology. FMD is an endothelial dependent process that reflects relaxation of a&#xD;
      conduit artery when exposed to shear stress. Increased flow, and thereby increased shear&#xD;
      stress, through the brachial artery occurs after post occlusive reactive hyperemia. Several&#xD;
      studies have suggested that the maximal increase in diameter occurs after approximately 60&#xD;
      seconds after the release of the occlusive cuff or after 45-60 seconds after peak reactive&#xD;
      hyperemia blood flow. The increase in diameter at this time is prevented by the NO synthase&#xD;
      inhibitor, N-G monomethyl-L-arginine, indicating that it is an endothelial dependent process&#xD;
      mediated by NO. Other measures of vasodilator response include time to maximum response,&#xD;
      duration of the vasodilator response, and the area under the dilation curve .An impairment of&#xD;
      endothelial function, via FMD assessment by BART, has been shown to correlate with risk&#xD;
      factors for coronary artery disease (smoking, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus) and adverse&#xD;
      cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is data that shows the benefit of post-conditioning in reducing reperfusion&#xD;
      injury in animal models only. However the use of post-conditioning in humans to reduce&#xD;
      reperfusion injury has not been well investigated.Given that endothelial dysfunction is a&#xD;
      significant component of reperfusion injury, we propose to examine the effects of&#xD;
      post-conditioning on a reperfusion injury by using BART. This study will act as a pilot by&#xD;
      which we can compare the results of Post-conditioning to preconditioning to reduce the&#xD;
      reperfusion injury with BART in a human reperfusion injury model. The clinical relevance of&#xD;
      this study is paramount. If it can be shown that post-conditioning attenuates reperfusion&#xD;
      injury in humans, as assessed by BART a larger scale trial to assess post-conditioning on&#xD;
      prevention of ischemia reperfusion injury in humans will be necessary. Furthermore, this&#xD;
      allows for a possible therapeutic application in the clinical setting, such as potentially&#xD;
      providing post-conditioning measures to patients undergoing percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention for abruptly occluded coronary arteries. Attenuation of reperfusion injury may&#xD;
      further reduce the associated morbidity and mortality of acute coronary ischemic events.&#xD;
