      This study used a card study design to allow volunteer physicians to record research data in&#xD;
      the context of providing clinical care. The method was brief, simple, and convenient for busy&#xD;
      practicing clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteer resident physicians and faculty carried data collection checklists in their pockets&#xD;
      and completed one for every adolescent patient seen during a randomly selected two week&#xD;
      period. Physicians attempted to collect data on ten consecutive encounters with teen patients&#xD;
      aged 11-21 years. The checklist documented patient characteristics (age, gender and&#xD;
      ethnicity), reason for visit, parent presence, and types of prevention issues discussed&#xD;
      during the visit. Patient and visit information was collected to assess its influence on&#xD;
      physician prevention discussions. Finally, the checklist asked open-ended questions related&#xD;
      to barriers to and facilitators to teen prevention discussions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involved five clinical sites comprising approximately 140 faculty and resident&#xD;
      family physicians. The investigators sought 10-15 volunteer physicians from each site (60-90&#xD;
      physicians), and asked them to complete data checklists on 10 consecutive adolescent patients&#xD;
      (600-900 visits). After a training session, each site randomly selected data collection&#xD;
      periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians provided usual care for adolescent patients and recorded on the checklists any&#xD;
      prevention discussions during the visit.&#xD;
