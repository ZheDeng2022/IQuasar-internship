  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a 10-day course of therapy with orally&#xD;
      administered VCH-759 given at 400-mg, 600-mg or 800-mg three times daily can effectively&#xD;
      reduce the amount of circulating virus (i.e., viral load) in patients with early-stage&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis C-infection. This study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      treatment with VCH-759. Blood samples will also be taken to measure the levels of VCH-759&#xD;
      present in plasma at various time points during the treatment period.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this trial are to assess the antiviral activity, safety, and&#xD;
      tolerability of VCH-759 monotherapy in adult subjects with early-stage chronic HCV-infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of VCH-759 at steady state in HCV-infected&#xD;
      adults and the relationship between VCH-759 plasma levels and corresponding HCV RNA reduction&#xD;
      with the administered dosages of VCH-759 in adults will also be investigated. The kinetics of&#xD;
      plasma HCV RNA during treatment for up to ten (10) days with VCH-759 and following&#xD;
      discontinuation of therapy will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in which subjects will be&#xD;
      assigned to receive treatment with one of the following oral dosages of VCH-759: 400 mg&#xD;
      t.i.d., 600 mg t.i.d., and 800 mg t.i.d., or placebo; enrollment into the three cohorts will&#xD;
      occur sequentially. Within each cohort, subjects will be randomized to a treatment: placebo&#xD;
      ratio of 3:1 for a total of 12 subjects per cohort; subjects will be randomized in blocks of&#xD;
      4. The decision to continue dosing within a cohort will be determined by an independent&#xD;
      review of all safety data up to and including Day 11 for the first 4 subjects within that&#xD;
      dose cohort; this review will be conducted by a qualified medical specialist, in conjunction&#xD;
      with the sponsor and medical monitor. The decision to proceed to the next cohort will be&#xD;
      decided by an independent review of Day 11 safety data for all 12 subjects in the previous&#xD;
      cohort. Eligible subjects will receive study medication three times daily for 10 days and&#xD;
      will return to the study center for follow-up assessments on Day 11, Day 17, and Day 24.&#xD;
