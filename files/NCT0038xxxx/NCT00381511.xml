      Background. Management of patients with suspected Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is problematic if&#xD;
      diagnostic imaging is not available. Pretest Clinical Probability (PCP) and D-dimer (D-d)&#xD;
      assessment were shown to be useful to identify those high risk patients for whom empirical,&#xD;
      protective anticoagulation is indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate whether PCP and D-d assessment, together with the use of low molecular weight&#xD;
      heparins (LMWHs), allow objective appraisal of PE to be deferred for up to 72 hours, we&#xD;
      planned to prospectively evaluate consecutive patients with suspected PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. In case of deferment of diagnostic imaging for PE, patients identified at high-risk&#xD;
      (those with high PCP or moderate PCP and positive D-d), receive a protective full-dose&#xD;
      treatment of LMWH; the remaining patients will be discharged without anticoagulant. All&#xD;
      patients will be scheduled to undergo objective tests for PE within 72 hours. Standard&#xD;
      antithrombotic therapy will be then administered when diagnostic tests confirmed Venous&#xD;
      ThromboEmbolism (VTE).&#xD;

      Introduction Pulmonary Embolism (PE), the most serious complication of Deep Vein Thrombosis&#xD;
      (DVT), is a relatively common and potentially fatal disease. Its diagnosis usually requires&#xD;
      multiple approaches based on diagnostic imaging such as ventilation/perfusion lung scanning&#xD;
      (V/Q) or Computed Tomography (CT). However, the performance of such imaging cannot&#xD;
      immediately be performed in case of night or week-end referral; in this situation, attending&#xD;
      physicians have to decide whether to treat incompletely assessed patients or to hospitalise&#xD;
      them until confirmatory tests can be carried out. In lack of guidelines, empirical protective&#xD;
      anticoagulation with Low Molecular Weight Heparins (LMWH), drugs showing a more favourable&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic profile in comparison to UnFractionated Heparins (UFH), is usually given to&#xD;
      patients. However, no clear-cut information is available about the need of such&#xD;
      anticoagulation, its dosage and duration, or the time over which deferral of diagnostic&#xD;
      procedures can be considered as safe. It seems more appropriate and safer, though, a&#xD;
      management based on a preliminary evaluation of the actual risk of thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have recently demonstrated that in patients clinically suspected of venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism, Pre-test Clinical Probability (PCP), D-dimer and the use of LMWH can be&#xD;
      safely used for delaying diagnostic tests for up 72 hours (Siragusa S et al. Arch Intern Med&#xD;
      2004;164:2477). Our paper was mainly focused to patients suspected of Deep Vein Thrombosis&#xD;
      (about 80% of the patients' cohort) which are considered a category at lower risk for&#xD;
      complications than PE patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critically, data are lacking to guide the management of patients clinically suspected of&#xD;
      having PE who cannot undergo immediate diagnostic imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to perform a prospective clinical trial aimed at evaluating whether data derived from&#xD;
      PCP and D-dimer testing, together with the use of LMWHs, permit safe management of patients&#xD;
      with suspected PE when objective assessment is not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods Patient Population Out-patients presenting with suspected acute PE,&#xD;
      when diagnostic imaging were not immediately available (during nights or week-ends), will be&#xD;
      considered eligible for the study. The study will be conducted in three Institutions&#xD;
      (University Hospital AOUP &quot;Paolo Giaccone&quot; of Palermo, IRCCS Policlinico S. Matteo, Italy and&#xD;
      IRCCS Ospedale Maggiore di Milano, Italy) with the same protocol. Exclusion criteria included&#xD;
      the following: 1) life-threatening conditions, or serious co-morbidities that required&#xD;
      immediate hospitalisation ; 2) relapse of a previously documented PE episode; 3) current use&#xD;
      of oral anticoagulant therapy; 4) history of bleeding or any other contraindication to&#xD;
      heparin; 5) age younger than 18 years; 6) life expectancy of less than 3 months; 7) refusal&#xD;
      to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Algorithm of intervention Patients will be evaluated and managed according to the clinical&#xD;
      assessment protocol. PCP for PE will be assessed first (using a previously reported clinical&#xD;
      model, followed by the D-dimer test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients considered at &quot;low-risk&quot;, in case of low PCP or moderate PCP with a negative D-dimer&#xD;
      test result, will be discharged without anticoagulant therapy. Conversely, patients with&#xD;
      moderate PCP and a positive D-dimer test or with high PCP , will be considered as being at&#xD;
      &quot;high risk&quot; and will receive therapeutic doses of LMWHs as 'protective anticoagulation'.&#xD;
      Physicians have indeed the option of admitting patients to the hospital irrespective of PCP&#xD;
      and D-dimer test results. All patients, either managed as in or out-patients, havo to undergo&#xD;
      diagnostic imaging within 72 hours of PCP and D-dimer test assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic assessment protocol for PE Diagnosis of PE will be assessed as described; briefly,&#xD;
      all patients will undergo Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) lung scanning or lung CT within 72&#xD;
      hours from the patient referral. In case of not diagnostic imaging, patients undergo&#xD;
      ultrasonography of the lower limbs. Patients weill be diagnosed as having PE if they have a&#xD;
      high-probability V/Q scan or an abnormal imaging result showing venous thrombi. All&#xD;
      diagnostic tests will be performed by operators unaware of D-d assay results or PCP&#xD;
      assessment. In cases of a positive diagnostic imaging test results, patients will be managed&#xD;
      accordingly and they will receive full dose of anticoagulants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood drawn for the D-dimer assay will be mixed with tri-sodium citrate (1 vol) and tested by&#xD;
      technicians unaware of other test results. We will use a semi-quantitative latex assay&#xD;
      (Dimertest®, Dade Behring, Deerfield Ill) performed as described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Patients will be monitored for 2 periods of follow-up: short-term and long-term.&#xD;
      Short-term follow-up is defined as the time between patient referral and the completion of&#xD;
      the diagnostic procedures (within 72 hours). Patients will be trained to return or to contact&#xD;
      physicians during this period in case of: 1) worsening of respiratory symptoms; 2) signs and&#xD;
      symptoms suggestive of developing deep venous thrombosis of the legs; 3) major and minor&#xD;
      bleeding during protective anticoagulation; 4) any other reason for hospitalisation due to&#xD;
      VTE-related symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term follow-up (3 months) is used to record the incidence of PE in those patients for&#xD;
      whom this diagnosis will be ruled out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At any follow up time, in case of signs or symptoms suggestive of the aforementioned events,&#xD;
      patients will undergo objective assessment through imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistic analysis We estimate that the primary event rate (PE and major bleeding) during the&#xD;
      short-term follow-up would be less than 2%. We plan to include a sufficient number of&#xD;
      patients to ensure that the upper limits of the 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were less than&#xD;
      2.5%. This resulted in a projected sample size of at least 300 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of occurrence of any thromboembolic event during the short- or long-term follow-up&#xD;
      will be determined and 95% CI will be calculated. The proportion of patients who developed&#xD;
      VTE in each PCP group and the relative 95% CI will be determined, as were the proportions of&#xD;
      patients who develope events during the long-term follow up. Paired &quot;t&quot; and Pearson 2 tests&#xD;
      were used as indicated; P &lt; .05% (2-tailed) was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
      Diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer assessment will be calculated in terms of sensitivity,&#xD;
      specificity, and positive and negative predictive values with corresponding 95% CIs (9).&#xD;
