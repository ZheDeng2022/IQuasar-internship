  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of Systane Free to Saline in decreasing&#xD;
      the symptoms of dry eye after aggressive therapy. As a principal outcome measure, we are&#xD;
      using the modified Schein dry eye symptomatology questionaire to determine whether any&#xD;
      improvement in signs is mirrored by improvement in the Schein Score. Up to 30 dry eye&#xD;
      subjects will be dosed six times per day for one month. The typical clinical signs will be&#xD;
      onmitored (e.g., corneal staining) along with dyrness symptoms. The hypothesis is that an&#xD;
      optimized drop, Systane Free, will be more effective than saline solution in improving dry&#xD;
      eye signs and symptoms.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The informed consent document must be read, signed and dated by the subject or legally&#xD;

        consent document must be signed and dated by the individual obtaining consent of the&#xD;
        subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adult subjects with mild to moderate dry eye. Criteria for the diagnosis must include two&#xD;
        of the three following characteristics as demonstrated at the Eligibility Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Composite symptom score of greater than or equal to 7 on the Schein Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Sodium Fluorescein (NaFl) Tear Break-Up Time less than 7 seconds in both eyes. Cumulative&#xD;
        Sodium Fluorescein Corneal Staining greater than or equal to 4 in both eyes on a 0 to 20&#xD;
        point scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Rose Bengal corneal staining greater than 4 of 24 maximum for 6 zones. Able and willing to&#xD;
        follow study instructions. Subjects must have best corrected visual acuity of twenty twenty&#xD;
        five or better in each eye.&#xD;
&#xD;

        Adult subjects with mild-to-moderate dry eye. Criteria for the diagnosis must include two&#xD;
        of the three following characteristics as demonstrated at the Eligibility Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        Composite symptom score of greater than or equal to 7 on the Schein Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Sodium FluoresceinTear Break-Up Time less than or equal to 7 seconds in both eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cumulative Sodium Fluorescein Corneal Staining greater than or equal to 4 in both eyes on a&#xD;
        0 to 20 point scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Rose Bengal corneal staining greater than 4 of 24 maximum for 6 zones. Able and willing to&#xD;
        follow study instructions. Subjects must have best corrected visual acuity of twenty twenty&#xD;
        five or better in each eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        History or evidence of ocular or intraocular surgery in either eye within the past six&#xD;
        months. LASIK and other keratorefractive procedure patients may participate if the surgery&#xD;
        was earlier than 12 months at the time of the beginning of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        History or evidence of serious ocular trauma in either eye within the past six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of hypersensitivity to any component of the study medications. These include the&#xD;
        artificial tear and the diagnostic dye sodium fluorescein.&#xD;

        active or recent varicella, viral disease of the cornea and/or conjunctiva; chronic&#xD;
        bacterial disease of the cornea and/or conjunctiva and/or eyelids; mycobacterial infection&#xD;
        of the eye; and/or fungal disease of the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Use of topical ocular medications during the study period. Subjects using systemic&#xD;
        steroids, immunosuppressive agents and/or anti-cholinergics (e.g. cold and allergy&#xD;
        medications, tricyclic antidepressants) for treatment of autoimmune connective tissue&#xD;
        disease may not be enrolled in the study if they have not been on a stable dosing regimen&#xD;
        for a minimum of 30 days prior to the Eligibility Visit. In addition, the dosing regimen&#xD;
        must remain stable throughout the 4-week treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
