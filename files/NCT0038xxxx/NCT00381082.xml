      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the cure rates (defined as the complete absence of live lice, adults or nymphs, as&#xD;
      diagnosed by wet-combing of three Australian approved head lice products for the treatment of&#xD;
      primary school children with head lice infestation. The study design will be randomised and&#xD;
      assessor-blind using three comparative parallel treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of Queensland state primary school children (up to Year 7)&#xD;
      with live head lice (adults or nymphs) on the hair or scalp who have not used any head lice&#xD;
      product in the four weeks prior to the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      All products were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. KP24 and Banlice were&#xD;
      applied twice separated by a one week interval. MOOV Head Lice Treatment was applied on Day&#xD;
      0, Day 7 and Day 14. The cure rate (absence of live lice) one day after the first&#xD;
      administration for all products was a secondary outcome measure. The cure rate at 7 days&#xD;
      after the final administration (Day 14 for Banlice or KP24 and at Day 21 for MOOV Head Lice&#xD;
      Treatment) was the primary outcome measure. Siblings were treated if these were found to be&#xD;
      infected as an enrolment criteria.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female primary school children.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of live head lice (adults or nymphs) on the hair or scalp. The presence of&#xD;
             live lice will be determined from a visual inspection of the hair and scalp and&#xD;
             Dry-combing of the hair. Combing will stop immediately once live lice are observed.&#xD;
             The presence of lice eggs alone is not a sufficient condition for inclusion in the&#xD;
             trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be available for the duration of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parent / Guardian is willing not to use other head lice products or methods (e.g.&#xD;
             combs) to treat their child's head lice for 21 days after the first treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parent / Guardian has given written informed consent to their child's participation in&#xD;
             the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergies or adverse reactions to head lice products or the components of&#xD;
             the specific products being tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with any head lice product in the month prior to Day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of scalp disease(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If a subject has a sibling in Grade 1-7 this sibling must also be enrolled in the&#xD;
             study and treated on Day 0 otherwise the subject must be considered ineligible for&#xD;
             enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have one fixed place of residence&#xD;
