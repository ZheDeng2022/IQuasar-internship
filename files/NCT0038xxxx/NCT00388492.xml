  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the proportion of subjects both antiretroviral&#xD;
      experienced and virologically suppressed on lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)400/100mg twice daily&#xD;
      who maintain viral suppression after switching to lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)800/200mg once&#xD;
      daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis for this study is that the majority of subjects will remain virologically&#xD;
      suppressed with once daily dosing versus twice daily dosing and therefore quality of life&#xD;
      will be improved with the once daily dosing of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)800/200mg.&#xD;

                       the study drug, throughout the study, and for at least 2 weeks after&#xD;
                       completion or premature discontinuation of the study to account for&#xD;
                       elimination of the investigational drug. Should a patient decide to become&#xD;
                       sexually active during the course of the study, she must be counseled and be&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  Sterilization (female patient or male partner of female patient)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Any other methods with published data showing that the lowest expected&#xD;
                       failure rate for that method is &lt;1% per year NOTE: Data are insufficient to&#xD;
                       exclude a clinically important interaction of LPV/r with drugs, such as&#xD;
                       hormonal contraceptives, that are highly metabolized by the cytochrome P450&#xD;
                       enzyme system. As a result, hormonal contraception is not considered&#xD;
                       adequate.&#xD;

             Appendix B)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of active substance abuse, excluding cannabis, or psychiatric illness that, in&#xD;
             the opinion of the investigator, would preclude compliance with the protocol, dosing&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient suffers from a serious medical condition, such as diabetes, congestive heart&#xD;
