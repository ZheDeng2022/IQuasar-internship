  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of spinal cord stimulation&#xD;
      using the Precision implantable neurostimulation device for chronic and intractable pain of&#xD;
      the trunk and or limbs in patients who have failed treatment with an intraspinal infusion&#xD;
      pump or other SCS system.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is managed by the sequential application of various strategies: medications,&#xD;
      anesthetic injections, ablation, surgery, implantable intraspinal infusion pumps, and spinal&#xD;
      cord stimulation. For a significant number of patients, however, these treatments are&#xD;
      inadequate or cannot be tolerated. Those patients require another option for pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapy afforded by spinal cord stimulators is dependent on overlapping paresthesia with&#xD;
      the painful areas. One of the leading reasons for explant of SCS systems (not including&#xD;
      device failure or surgical complication) is the complaint of inadequate pain relief due to&#xD;
      poor coverage of the painful area. Mounting evidence suggests that the clinical efficacy&#xD;
      afforded by SCS varies with each manufacturer's technology. For instance,&#xD;
      previously-implanted SCS patients report more complete coverage, better pain relief, and a&#xD;
      more pleasant sensation associated with the paresthesia of the Precision system. The tight&#xD;
      lead spacing and current fractionalization achievable with the Precision system may provide&#xD;
      pain relief after failure with another SCS system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess pain relief with the Precision system for patients with chronic,&#xD;
      intractable pain who are refractory to treatment with other types of SCS systems and/or&#xD;
      implantable intraspinal infusion pumps. Because Precision allows unique programming&#xD;
      combinations not possible with other systems, it is expected that subjects will enjoy&#xD;
      significant pain relief.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have chronic and intractable neuropathic pain of the trunk and/or limbs of moderate to&#xD;
             severe intensity and have failed treatment with an intraspinal infusion pump or other&#xD;
             SCS device. Determination of failure of treatment will be based on subject feedback.&#xD;
             Subjects with an active intraspinal infusion pump but with inadequate pain control&#xD;
             will be allowed to participate;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be 18 years of age or older;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be an appropriate candidate for the surgical procedures required for this study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing and able to comply with all study related procedures and visits;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be capable of reading and understanding patient information materials and giving&#xD;
             written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have failed immediate past treatment with an intraspinal infusion pump or other SCS&#xD;
             device because of technical reasons associated with the device such as unresolved lead&#xD;
             migration, battery depletion, etc.;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any evidence of neurologic instability requiring surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any significant medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator may&#xD;
             interfere with the conduct of the study or may adversely affect the subject's safety&#xD;
             during the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any other active implantable device with the exception of a intraspinal infusion&#xD;
             pump for pain medications;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are pregnant or lactating or planning to become pregnant in the next year;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have participated in any investigational drug or device trial in the last 4 weeks or&#xD;
             plan to participate in any other investigational drug or device trial while on this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
