  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acetaminophen is the most commonly used drug in children. Inhibition of COX-3 in the brain&#xD;
      has been suggested as the primary central mechanism by which acetaminophen decrease pain and&#xD;
      possibly fever. However there is very limited data about acetaminophen concentrations in the&#xD;
      brain and no such data is available for newborns. The objective of the current study is to&#xD;
      describe concentrations of acetaminophen in the fluid around the brain of infants after&#xD;
      administration of acetaminophen.&#xD;

      The mechanism by which acetaminophen causes analgesia and antipyretic effect is not entirely&#xD;
      clear. Recently a new COX isoenzyme was identified and termed COX 3. In humans this isoenzyme&#xD;
      is most abundant in cerebral cortex and heart. Inhibition of COX-3 could represent a primary&#xD;
      central mechanism by which acetaminophen decrease pain and possibly fever (10). An effect on&#xD;
      of acetaminophen on presynaptic 5-HT(2) receptors in the hypocampus has been demonstrated&#xD;
      (11) suggesting again that the primary effect of acetaminophen is in the CNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies (12-16) described the pharmacokinetics of oral and rectal acetaminophen in&#xD;
      infants and neonates. Yet, the data on acetaminophen concentrations in the CSF is very&#xD;
      limited. Two studies in adults (17;18) used intravenous propacetamol and described&#xD;
      concentrations of acetaminophen in the plasma and CSF. Acetaminophen was detected as early as&#xD;
      15 minutes after the administration and reached peak concentrations in the CSF at the 4th&#xD;
      hour. A small study (19) of nine children who had indwelling ventricular drains found that&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid concentrations lagged behind those of plasma with an equilibration half&#xD;
      time of 0.72 h. This study did not describe CSF concentrations in neonates and used a dose of&#xD;
      40mg/kg, which is higher than the recommended dose in children. To the best of our knowledge&#xD;
      there is no data on acetaminophen CSF concentrations in neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the current study is to describe concentrations of acetaminophen in the CSF&#xD;
      of infants after single administration of acetaminophen. A better understanding of the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen and its penetration into the CSF will enable us to better&#xD;
      predict the effects of this commonly used drug.&#xD;
