      RATIONALE: Radioisotope therapy, such as iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG),&#xD;
      releases radiation that kills tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as topotecan,&#xD;
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing. Topotecan may also make tumor cells more sensitive to iodine I&#xD;
      131 MIBG. A peripheral stem cell transplant may be able to replace blood-forming cells that&#xD;
      were destroyed by iodine I 131 MIBG and topotecan. This may allow more iodine I 131 MIBG and&#xD;
      topotecan to be given so that more tumor cells are killed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving high-dose iodine I 131 MIBG together&#xD;
      with topotecan and peripheral stem cell transplant works in treating young patients with&#xD;
      relapsed stage 4 neuroblastoma or primary resistant high-risk neuroblastoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine response (partial and complete response at metastatic sites) in children with&#xD;
           relapsed stage 4 neuroblastoma or primary resistant high-risk neuroblastoma treated with&#xD;
           high-dose iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine, topotecan hydrochloride, and peripheral&#xD;
           blood stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the proportion of patients who, as a result of this treatment, are able to&#xD;
           progress to potentially curative surgery and further systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate tumor dosimetry (to determine whether the tumor absorbed the radiation dose)&#xD;
           with response in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the time to tumor progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to&#xD;
      disease type (relapsed stage 4 vs primary resistant high-risk neuroblastoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 and 15-19 and&#xD;
      high-dose iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (^131I-MIBG) IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and&#xD;
      15. Patients receive autologous CD 34+ peripheral blood stem cells when ^131I-MIBG dosimetry&#xD;
      levels reach an acceptable low on days 25-29.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total whole-body absorbed dose is measured periodically after the first ^131I-MIBG dose is&#xD;
      administered and periodically thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 67 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
