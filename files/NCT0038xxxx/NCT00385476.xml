      The goal of the study is to learn about patients' knowledge of their medications in an&#xD;
      outpatient acute care setting (such as the M. D. Anderson Emergency Center) and to learn&#xD;
      about any clinical factors that affect patients' knowledge of their medications.&#xD;

      You will be asked to list your prescription medicines, over-the-counter medicines, herbal&#xD;
      preparations and vitamins, minerals and supplements that you take. Information about you&#xD;
      (such as age or gender), the status of the disease (such as cancer diagnosis and extent of&#xD;
      disease), and your Emergency Center visit (such as your reason for visit and discharge&#xD;
      diagnosis) will be collected from your medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find out if your answers on the questionnaire are correct regarding the medications you&#xD;
      take, researchers will check the pharmacy database for medications you fill at the M. D.&#xD;
      Anderson pharmacy, your medical record, and contact any outside pharmacy that you may use to&#xD;
      fill your medicines, with your permission. In order for outside pharmacies to release the&#xD;
      requested medication information, you will need to sign an Authorization for Disclosure of&#xD;
      Health Information from Pharmacy Records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your information will be kept confidential. All patient data will be reported and published&#xD;
      as a group. You will not be individually identified. Data will be stored with patient codes&#xD;
      so that your identity will be protected. In addition, the study database will be password&#xD;
      protected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may be contacted in the future for more information; however, you are not obligated to&#xD;
      answer any future questions just because you agreed to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. About 350 patients will take part in this study. All will&#xD;
      be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients admitted to the Emergency Center&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must be able to read and write English&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must agree to participate and sign informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients 16 years or above. (Age limit explained below)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must be able to complete the survey tool. They may have help from a caregiver&#xD;
             in transcribing the information but the caregiver can not fill the tool independent of&#xD;
             the patient. A research assistant will be trained to discriminate whether a caregiver&#xD;
             is acting as a scriber or independently completing the tool. If the caregiver&#xD;
             completes the tool independently, the patient will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with altered mental status and those with an acute, emergent illness and&#xD;
             hemodynamic instability (Examples: status epileptics, sepsis, and cardiac arrest)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Employees of the institution with work-related injuries&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Visitors who are non-cancer patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients transferred directly from another hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients will be excluded after their first enrollment during the study period. (Can&#xD;
             only be enrolled once though may have multiple Emergency Center visits during study&#xD;
             time frame).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients will be excluded if all prescribed medications are filled at an external&#xD;
             pharmacy and this pharmacy is not accessible.&#xD;
