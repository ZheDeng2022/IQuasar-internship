  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, growing body of evidence support the finding that anemia frequently occurs in&#xD;
      patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). Chronic kidney disease (CKD), as well, is highly&#xD;
      prevalent among heart failure patients, and both anemia and CKD are independently associated&#xD;
      with increased mortality. A vicious circle is established with CHF causing both chronic renal&#xD;
      insufficiency and anemia, and CKD further aggravating anemia which, in turn, worsens CHF and&#xD;
      so on. Treatment of the anemia breaks this circle and improves the quality of life, cardiac&#xD;
      and renal functions in patients with severe CHF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous iron alone was proved to allow the maintenance of target hematocrit in one-third&#xD;
      of chronic renal failure predialysis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these considerations, intravenous iron for anemia in patients with CHF and moderate&#xD;
      CKD would represent a reasonable therapeutic approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the trial is to assess the efficiency of intravenous iron therapy in the&#xD;
      management of mild to moderate anemia associated with CHF NYHA III class and concomitant&#xD;
      moderate CKD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous iron administration in CHF patients with absolute or functional iron deficiency&#xD;
      could correct their anemia, thus improving cardiac function judged by ejection fraction and&#xD;
      NYHA functional class. If true, enhancement of cardiac output will increase oxygen delivery&#xD;
      to tissues, including renal cortex. This might improve the renal functions and slow the rate&#xD;
      of progression of CKD reflected by the slope of decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since erythropoietin synthesis is located in peritubular fibroblasts from outer renal cortex,&#xD;
      which is the most affected area during chronic hypoxia, increasing renal blood flow after&#xD;
      anemia correction is expected to restore optimal erythropoietin production and normalize&#xD;
      plasma Epo levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the efficiency of intravenous iron therapy in the&#xD;
      management of mild to moderate anemia associated with chronic heart failure NYHA III class&#xD;
      and concomitant moderate chronic kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to determine if the correction of anemia in these patients&#xD;
      affects the cardiac function, the rate of progression of CKD and the plasma erythropoietin&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration from Helsinki and Tokyo, with&#xD;
      the amendments from Venice (1983), after the approval by the local ethics committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total observation period will be of 28 weeks, with a pre-study phase (selection,&#xD;
      randomization of subjects) 4 weeks.The study period will last 24 weeks, with a possible&#xD;
      extension to 48 weeks, depending on the results of this first phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      200 anemic patients with chronic heart failure class NYHA III and concomitant stage 3 chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease will be enrolled, after obtaining their written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be evaluated for the inclusion and exclusion criteria at enrollment and at&#xD;
      each visit during the pre-study phase. Only patients fulfilling all the requested criteria at&#xD;
      all evaluation moments will be enrolled. The enrolled subjects will be centrally randomly&#xD;
      assigned in a 1:1 ratio into two study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I (treatment group): Subjects assigned to this group will receive intravenous iron&#xD;
      (ferric sucrose product Venofer® 2%, 5mL/ampoule) in a starting dose of 200mg (2 ampoules)&#xD;
      diluted in 150mL 0.9% NaCl solution, over 60 minutes, once a week for the first four&#xD;
      administrations, and then every other week until hemoglobin levels reach 12g/dL. Then, iron&#xD;
      dose will be adjusted to 1 ampoule at 2-4 weeks interval, as needed to maintain these levels&#xD;
      with serum ferritin ≤500ng/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron administration will be discontinued if serum ferritin will exceed 500ng/mL, and will be&#xD;
      restarted with a reduced dosage (1 ampoule at every 2-4 weeks) once serum ferritin decrease&#xD;
      below this value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional treatment for CHF will be continued as needed. Group II (control group):&#xD;
      Subjects assigned to this group will continue their conventional treatment for CHF as needed,&#xD;
      without iron supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No other anti-anemic medication will be administered in either group during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject's visits will take place at two weeks intervals in the first 12 weeks of the study&#xD;
      phase and at 4 weeks apart thereafter. At each visit will be recorded, according to the&#xD;
      schedule, data concerning physical examination, including signs of CHF, hematological and&#xD;
      iron status, renal function, concomitant medication and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters recorded at the time of first iron administration will serve as baseline&#xD;
      determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The completion of the study will be declared when 200 subjects will complete the whole&#xD;
      observation period, according to the above protocol.&#xD;
