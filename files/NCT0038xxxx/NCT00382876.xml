  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The infant car restraint devices are a critical part of infant safety during transportation.&#xD;
      The crash tolerance and the critical safety features of each seat are well established.&#xD;
      Infant transportation may be via a car seat or car bed. The effect of the sitting position on&#xD;
      the airway is a concern in an infant with poor head control. Because of this concern, car&#xD;
      seat tests during which oxygen saturation is measured, are performed on many low birth weight&#xD;
      infants before discharge from the nursery. Indeed, a number of deaths have occurred in car&#xD;
      seats probably related to airway obstruction. The relative effects of position on the&#xD;
      ventilation need to be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to identify the relative changes in ventilation that are induced by position&#xD;
      change during sleep. We will collect a broad array of high quality data that will identify&#xD;
      these changes, and the most likely cause. Specifically, we will we screen 200 infants, with&#xD;
      each infant assigned to the supine position, the car bed and the car seat. The order of these&#xD;
      positions will be randomly assigned. Following data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Relative changes in ventilation will be assessed by oxygen saturation measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Respiratory movement will be measured in order to define the defect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Once the data is collected, it will be sent for blind data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Once the data analysis is complete, the effect of position on ventilation will be&#xD;
           established.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safe transportation of infants has formed a critical part of public health policy for&#xD;
      many years. Clearly crash tolerance of the seat, the ease of installation, the position of&#xD;
      the seat and the relative position to airbags has been the focus of intensive research.&#xD;
      However as with all safety devices, there are some limitations. Respiratory instability is a&#xD;
      potential concern due to the upright position in the car seat. This is particularly true in&#xD;
      the premature newborn and has resulted in the recommendation to perform car safety seat&#xD;
      testing before discharge from hospital for these infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently there have also been concerns raised about term infants. Merchant et al showed that&#xD;
      mean oxygen saturations declined in both term and premature infants reaching a nadir of 95%&#xD;
      after about 70 minutes of placement in a car safety seat with 8% noted to have an SaO2 of&#xD;
      less than 90% for more than 20 minutes. Also, in an earlier study by Bass and Mehta, selected&#xD;
      high risk full term infants were found to have increased risk of developing hypoxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been generally accepted that the potential for adverse effects from these hypoxic&#xD;
      events are substantially offset by the crash protection afforded by these devices.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the portability of car seats and contemporary busy lifestyles are resulting in&#xD;
      infants spending extended periods of time in the car seat for reasons other than transport.&#xD;
      Callahan et al found in 187 infants that 94% spent greater than 30 minutes in seating devices&#xD;
      including car seats each day. The mean time spent in seating devices was 5.7+/- 3.5 hours and&#xD;
      ranged from 0 to 16 hours. Prolonged use of car seats in infants too young to sit unsupported&#xD;
      may also potentially result in prolonged periods of oxygen desaturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent comprehensive review of peer reviewed published evidence noted that hypoxia has&#xD;
      frequently been associated with significant defects in cognition. In some studies changes in&#xD;
      cognitive function were seen with even mild levels of oxygen desaturation. Such changes were&#xD;
      observed in all groups except premature babies. The young child may be relative resistant, as&#xD;
      their physiology is adapted for the relatively hypoxic intrauterine environment. However a&#xD;
      recent study also suggests that premature infants may also have problems. Thus a cautious&#xD;
      approach has been adopted where children who fail to maintain adequate oxygen saturation&#xD;
      while placed in the car seat are discharged in a car bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cause of the hypoxia while placed in the car safety seat is most likely attributable to&#xD;
      the relative vulnerability of the airway in the premature and term infant. The cause of the&#xD;
      airway narrowing is slouching of the head forward while asleep in car seats which results in&#xD;
      closure of the mouth, the pressing of the tongue against the posterior pharyngeal wall and&#xD;
      the flexion of the airway. The shape of the newborn head with a prominent occiput and the&#xD;
      reduced muscle tone encourages head slouching. A recent pilot study suggested that the&#xD;
      placement of an insert which accommodated the occiput thus reducing the tendency towards&#xD;
      flexion improved airway size and reduced the frequency of episodes of oxygen desaturation.&#xD;
      Thus the flexion position, which is unique to the car seat, may have important implications&#xD;
      for the airway of the newborn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) currently recommends that infants with documented&#xD;
      oxygen desaturation in a car seat should be transported in a car bed. Car beds should&#xD;
      overcome the position dependent airway instability. However gastro-esophageal reflux may also&#xD;
      occur in the flat position and this could potentially result in significant apnea. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study was to define if the term infant is at increased risk of apnea and&#xD;
      oxygen desaturation while positioned in a semi-reclined car safety seat when compared to&#xD;
      positioning in a car bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Overview Phase I Identify normal healthy newborns (200 newborns) Phase II Explain to the&#xD;
           family the risk benefit of the study Obtain informed consent Review to see if the baby&#xD;
           conforms to inclusion criteria Review to see if the baby does not meet exclusion&#xD;
           criteria Randomization to supine (car bed) or sitting position (car seat) as the 1st&#xD;
           position Phase III Physiological testing to include oxygen saturation, heart rate,&#xD;
           respiratory plethysmography to monitor chest wall movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Phase IV Data for blinded and independent review&#xD;
&#xD;
           Over a period of one year, we propose to study 200 patients. Each infant will be studied&#xD;
           in the supine position (30 minutes), car bed (60 minutes) and car seat (60 minutes). The&#xD;
           order of positions will be randomly assigned. This size should be adequate to identify&#xD;
           significant differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Weight greater than 2.8 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Gestation 38-41 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Normal newborn examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Healthy mother&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Weight greater than 4 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Any abnormality on examination&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Any medications in mother and child (including insulin; vitamins and folic acid are&#xD;
                okay).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Caesarean section&#xD;
&#xD;
      ORGANIZATION&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Time Table The study will be performed in the mothers' room (rooming-in). We expect to&#xD;
           recruit at least 1-2 infants/day. We expect to recruit easily 200 as about 5000 healthy&#xD;
           newborns per year are delivered in Maternity Hospital in Ljubljana. Both males and&#xD;
           females will be accrued as they present. The study will be performed in the morning in&#xD;
           order to facilitate discharge planning and maximize time for the baby to interact with&#xD;
           the family.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Plans for subject recruitment and consent Newborns will be recruited from our Newborn&#xD;
           Nursery Unit. A thorough explanation of each in-patient study will be provided. An&#xD;
           Institutional Review Board consent form will be reviewed with each parent. A copy of the&#xD;
           signed, witnessed consent form will be given to each parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Potential risks to participants The potential risks associated with this proposal are&#xD;
           minimal, as the infants will have non-invasive measurement of cardio-respiratory&#xD;
           function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Risk/benefit assessment Information acquired in this study does not have treatment&#xD;
           implications at this time. However, if there are significant desaturation, the attending&#xD;
           pediatrician will be informed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA At the time of inclusion, we will collect basic perinatal data, including pregnancy&#xD;
      complications, descriptors of labor and delivery, use of medications in the perinatal period&#xD;
      (drugs, cigarettes, alcohol and caffeine). We will obtain basic information concerning the&#xD;
      infant (i.e. date of birth, sex, and race) as well as birth weight, length, head&#xD;
      circumference and Apgar scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each infant will be assigned a study number and all data will be labeled with this&#xD;
           number. Each infant will have 4 leads place for cardio-respiratory monitoring. Oxygen&#xD;
           saturation will be measured on the left hand. The study will be performed following&#xD;
           feeding and a diaper change. The child will be placed in the designated position as&#xD;
           determined by study randomization. The control position will be established by placing&#xD;
           the infant face up in a standard hospital crib. The supine position will be established&#xD;
           by placing the infant face up in an Aprica Car Bed. The seated position will be&#xD;
           established using a standard car seat that results in 45 degree angle relative to the&#xD;
           horizontal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Early intervention or termination of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study nurse will be available at all times during the study. Dr. Lilijana&#xD;
           Kornhauser-Cerar, Dr. Irena Štucin Gantar and Prof. David Neubauer or their designated&#xD;
           substitutes will be available for consultation via cellular phone during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If there is significant desaturation to 85% for longer than 10 seconds, the child shall&#xD;
           be stimulated. If there is persistent desaturation, oxygen will be added. If there is&#xD;
           still persistent desaturation, the study will be terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quality control procedures for data collection and data entry of data forms.&#xD;
                Quality control measures are essential in any research effort. The quality control&#xD;
                measures shall implement by Prof. Janez Stare, PhD, so as to provide detailed and&#xD;
                unambiguous data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Back-up procedures. Data files will be backed-up and labeled after each study.&#xD;
                Weekly files will be labeled, dated, and archived. The final data sets will be&#xD;
                permanently archived on CDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Confidentiality. An important component of the data management is protection of&#xD;
                subject confidentiality. We will establish a system whereby no names would be&#xD;
                transmitted to the statistics laboratory. We will design the data forms such that&#xD;
                only an ID number appears as an identifier. In transmission of data we include the&#xD;
                infant's date of birth on each form as verification of the recording of the correct&#xD;
                ID number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS AT IBMI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Staff at Institute of Biomedical Informatics at Faculty of Medicine at University of&#xD;
           Ljubljana (Inštitut za biomedicinsko informatiko MF, IBMI) with a wide variety of&#xD;
           investigators both within the Ljubljana University Medical Center and outside Ljubljana&#xD;
           University research community. This group has been a data processing resource center for&#xD;
           multi-center studies since 1973. The IBMI has a staff of 16 with expertise in&#xD;
           computerized data collection and tracking systems, quality control procedures, sleep and&#xD;
           statistical analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each trace will be scored for 1. apnea; frequency, duration and type, 2. for time with&#xD;
           oxygen saturation 90-94.9%, 85-89.9%, below 85%; 3. for mean oxygen saturation and heart&#xD;
           rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LIMITATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At University Medical Centre Ljubljana, we have 5,000 births per year. We should be able&#xD;
           to perform at least 1-2 studies per day. We have limited the study time and will perform&#xD;
           the study in the morning so as not to interfere with discharge planing or family&#xD;
           oriented time. We will make every effort to complete the study in the first year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. This study makes physiological measures when there is no car vibration. We recognize&#xD;
           this limitation but this aspect is being investigated by our collaborators in a smaller&#xD;
           study in Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PUBLICATION Drs. Kornhauser-Cerar, Štucin - Gantar, Neubauer and Kinane will be responsible&#xD;
      for the publication of the results. All results will be submitted to a peer review journal&#xD;
      for consideration.&#xD;
