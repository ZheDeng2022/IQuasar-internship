  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims of this study is to improve short and long-term patient and graft survival,&#xD;
      to reduce the incidence and severity of allograft rejection, to reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      infection and to reduce and/or eventually eliminate the need for long-term immunosuppression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale behind this study involves the need to better manage rejection in the&#xD;
      intestinal allograft recipient. Although tacrolimus based immunosuppression has made&#xD;
      intestinal transplantation feasible, the requisite need for chronic high dose&#xD;
      immunosuppression in order to control rejection has inhibited the wide spread clinical use&#xD;
      and practicality of intestinal/multivisceral transplantation. The measures needed to prevent&#xD;
      graft loss have frequently resulted in lethal infections, the leading cause of death. This&#xD;
      trial is significant for determining if this new strategy of allograft immune-modulation with&#xD;
      low dose ex-vivo irradiation and simultaneous done bone marrow cell infusion will favorably&#xD;
      affect short and long term outcomes by reducing the risk of allograft rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is offered to all patients with irreversible intestinal failure who must undergo&#xD;
      intestinal, combined liver-intestinal, and multivisceral transplantation at the University of&#xD;
      Pittsburgh Medical Center. Patients are recruited through the referral system and no cold&#xD;
      calling is carried out. Patient confidentiality is maintained by the use of codes to identify&#xD;
      the study participants. All data is stored in a locked filing cabinets as a means to protect&#xD;
      participants against a breach of confidentiality. This trial involves ex-vivo low dose&#xD;
      irradiation of the intestinal allograft with or without adjunct donor bone marrow cell&#xD;
      infusion. An intravenous bone marrow cell infusion is prepared form the thoracolumbar&#xD;
      vertebral bodies harvested from cadaveric donors. Control subjects will be those who refuse&#xD;
      to be enrolled in the study or those for whom donor bone marrow is not available. All&#xD;
      patients will be treated perioperatively with thymoglobulin, a rabbit polyclonal&#xD;
      anti-lymphocyte globulin at a dose of 5-10 mg/kg. Tacrolimus will be given in a standard&#xD;
      fashion and from the outset as a single monotherapeutic agent to prevent early allograft&#xD;
      rejection and promote graft acceptance. All patients will be monitored for rejection, graft&#xD;
      function, opportunistic infections and GVHD. Surveillance endoscopy with guided mucosal&#xD;
      biopsies will be obtained according to the standard protocol. Attention will be paid for any&#xD;
      clinicopathologic changes suggestive of acute or chronic irradiation injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study closed for enrollment as of 9/30/03.&#xD;
