      Nursing home patients admitted to the hospital pose a significant challenge for health care&#xD;
      providers. Geriatric teaching pays particular attention to these admissions and related&#xD;
      problems. However, it is yet to be proven, whether geriatric training helps to overcome any&#xD;
      of these issues in a better way than through non-geriatric education. The study aims to prove&#xD;
      that geriatric training provides advantages over non-geriatric training in caring for nursing&#xD;
      home patients admitted to the hospital.&#xD;

      Context: Nursing home patients admitted to the hospital pose a significant challenge for&#xD;
      health care providers. Geriatric age, frailty, multiple readmissions, prolonged length of&#xD;
      stay, and high mortality are just a few attributes of nursing home patients in the hospital.&#xD;
      Geriatric teaching pays particular attention to these challenging problems. However, it is&#xD;
      yet to be proven, whether geriatric training helps to overcome any of these issues in a&#xD;
      better way than through non-geriatric education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To test the hypothesis that geriatric care provides advantages over non-geriatric&#xD;
      training in caring for nursing home patients admitted to the hospital in regards to length of&#xD;
      stay, rate of expirations and rate of readmissions. The secondary objective is to compare&#xD;
      expirations and readmissions among patients cared for by geriatricians and non-geriatricians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study of patients admitted from&#xD;
      Metropolitan Jewish Geriatric Nursing Home (MJGNH) to Maimonides Medical Center (MMC) over a&#xD;
      certain period of time and under the care of geriatricians, non-geriatric internists, and&#xD;
      surgeons. Comparison of the three study groups by age, sex, expiration rate, length of&#xD;
      hospital stay (LOS) and readmission rate. Comparison of expired patients by age, sex and&#xD;
      average LOS. Comparison of readmissions, expiration rate, by preservation of continuity of&#xD;
      care, and by emergency room visits without admission.&#xD;
