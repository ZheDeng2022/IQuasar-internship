      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an aerobic home-based exercise&#xD;
      program for the treatment of postpartum depression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum depression occurs in 10-16% of women, with depressive symptoms lasting up to one&#xD;
      year post delivery. Women affected by depression in the postpartum have been shown to be at&#xD;
      higher risk for developing a recurrent depressive disorder. While the direct and indirect&#xD;
      costs associated with postpartum depression are unknown, those associated with depression&#xD;
      have been found to exceed 43 billion dollars in the United States alone. Moreover, maternal&#xD;
      depression can negatively impact the mother-infant relationship and infant development.&#xD;
      Despite the high prevalence of postpartum depression, the condition often goes undiagnosed&#xD;
      and untreated by primary care providers. Alternative non-medical interventions for treating&#xD;
      postpartum depression have not been widely investigated, leaving women and health care&#xD;
      providers with few evidence-based options for treatment. If this exercise program is shown to&#xD;
      be effective, then this intervention can be an alternate treatment option for alleviating&#xD;
      depressed mood for women in the postpartum period. This nonpharmacological approach may be&#xD;
      particularly attractive as many women are reluctant to take medication in the postpartum.&#xD;
