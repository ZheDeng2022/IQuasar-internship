    <textblock>
      This phase II study will evaluate the effect of bevacizumab, capecitabine and oxaliplatin&#xD;
      with radiation on rectal cancer. Researchers will also evaluate the tolerability (how it&#xD;
      makes the patient feel) and safety of this combination by watching for harmful&#xD;
      side-effects.It is hoped that by adding bevacizumab to the capecitabine/oxaliplatin treatment&#xD;
      in combination with radiation before surgery will improve response rate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Improved pre-operative therapy is required in the management of high risk rectal cancer in&#xD;
      order to decrease local recurrence and increase the rate of sphincter sparing surgery.&#xD;
      Capecitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab represent new systemic agents and have been given&#xD;
      safely in phase I and II trials concurrently with radiation with promising improvements in&#xD;
      pCR rates of 15 -24% compared to historic rates of 8-14% achieved with 5-FU alone.&#xD;
      Improvements in pCR rates have not been associated with an increase in post-operative&#xD;
      complication rates. A trial of all three of these agents is justified due to their enhanced&#xD;
      efficacy when given in combination as well as their non-overlapping treatment toxicity&#xD;
      profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a one-armed, multi-centred, Phase II study in patients with T3/4 locally advanced and&#xD;
      T3/4 low lying rectal cancer, to study the efficacy and safety of the addition of bevacizumab&#xD;
      to a regimen of capecitabine and oxaliplatin in combination with pre-operative radiation.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the rectum, defined as either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Mid- or upper rectal tumours (&gt;= 6 - 15 cm): T3 or T4 adenocarcinoma that is fixed or&#xD;
        partially fixed or tethered and is potentially resectable; or Low rectal tumours (&lt;6cm): T3&#xD;
        or T4 adenocarcinoma: or Node positive rectal tumours (&lt;= 15cm): T1-4N2 or T1-4N+ where&#xD;
        pelvic nodes approach or invade the mesorectum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        M0/X or M1 is permitted as long as definitive resection of the primary tumour is planned&#xD;
        and, in the opinion of the investigator, it is safe to delay full dose of systemic&#xD;
        chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Appropriate staging investigations of the primary tumour, either endorectal ultrasound&#xD;
             or pelvic MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female aged 18 or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a performance status ECOG of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a life expectancy greater than 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ function and coagulation parameters as measured by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        ANC &gt;=1.5 platelets &gt;=100 Serum creatinine &lt;= 1.5X ULN AST, ALT &lt;= 2.5X ULN Bilirubin &lt;=&#xD;
        1.5 ULN PTT and INR within normal limits Albumin &gt;= than 30&#xD;
