      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response.&#xD;
      Incomplete Freund's adjuvant may stimulate the immune system in different ways and may help&#xD;
      the vaccine work better. Colony-stimulating factors, such as GM-CSF, may increase the number&#xD;
      of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood. Giving vaccine therapy together&#xD;
      with incomplete Freund's adjuvant and GM-CSF may be an effective treatment for patients with&#xD;
      HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well giving vaccine therapy together with&#xD;
      incomplete Freund's adjuvant and GM-CSF works in treating patients with HIV.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the safety of vaccination comprising E1M184V peptide with incomplete Freund's&#xD;
           adjuvant in combination with sargramostim (GM-CSF) in patients with HIV who are HLA-A2&#xD;
           positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess, preliminarily, the ability of E1M184V peptide vaccine to induce a cytotoxic&#xD;
           T-cell response, defined by ELISPOT assay, in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore, preliminarily, the effect of this regimen on HIV viral load and CD4 count in&#xD;
           these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore, preliminarily, the development of lamivudine or emtricitabine resistance in&#xD;
           patients who subsequently receive lamivudine or emtricitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore, preliminarily, the ability of E1M184V peptide vaccine to induce a cytotoxic&#xD;
           T-cell response as assessed by HLA-A2 class I tetramers and intracellular interferon&#xD;
           gamma production after stimulation with E1M184V.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive vaccination comprising E1M184V peptide and incomplete Freund's adjuvant&#xD;
      subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 in weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16. Patients also receive sargramostim&#xD;
      (GM-CSF) SC immediately after vaccination and once daily on days 1-4. Some patients do not&#xD;
      receive GM-CSF after the first 2 doses of vaccine. Treatment continues in the absence of&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo blood collection at baseline and at 4, 12, 20, 36, and 52 weeks for&#xD;
      biomarker/laboratory analysis. Assays may include immunoenzyme techniques and viral&#xD;
      genotyping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
