  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic urticaria undertake a five week elimination diet (pseudoallergen free&#xD;
      diet). The efficacy of the diet will be determined by symptom score, by the use of rescue&#xD;
      medication (oral antihistamines and glucocorticosteroids) and by a Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaire on week 0 and week 5. All patients with sufficient response (regarding the&#xD;
      urticaria score) enter a second dietary part over six weeks, whereas a provocation diet is&#xD;
      carried out. Each diet week a choice of pseudoallergen rich food is added, sorted by the type&#xD;
      of pseudoallergens (e.g. biogenic amines, organic acids, flavours, additives). This study is&#xD;
      conducted to investigate if the provocation diet could be a new diagnostic intervention to&#xD;
      elucidate clinical relevant pseudoallergens.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic urticaria is defined as a daily or almost daily spontaneous occurrence of wheals that&#xD;
      cause itching and lasting for at least six weeks. If there is no indication of a possible&#xD;
      eliciting agent and because approximately 70% of patients benefit from it, a&#xD;
      low-pseudoallergen diet should be carried out for 5 weeks. Although the low-pseudoallergen&#xD;
      diet is successful, no explanation of the underlying mechanisms exists. On DBPC oral&#xD;
      provocation testing with known food additives, only a small amount of patients, who&#xD;
      experienced remission after a low-pseudoallergen diet react with new wheals and/or&#xD;
      angioedema. For this discrepancy, natural food ingredients and new food additives are&#xD;
      included in the dietary diagnostic. The high amount of substances, which are administrated&#xD;
      within oral provocation testing can not reflect a realistic diet situation. Often it is&#xD;
      impossible to ingest corresponding amounts of foods to reach the same concentration such as&#xD;
      the provocation amount. Recording change reactions between food ingredients and the&#xD;
      individual metabolism of the patients, the &quot;step by step&quot; food provocation method reveals&#xD;
      itself to be most effective. In addition, individual predilections, amounts and frequency of&#xD;
      ingested foods, are taken into consideration.&#xD;
