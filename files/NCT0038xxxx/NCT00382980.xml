  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare how the body reacts to different strengths&#xD;
      of an experimental cell culture-grown whole virus A/H5N1 flu vaccine when given with or&#xD;
      without the addition of aluminum hydroxide adjuvant. Researchers will also look at how much&#xD;
      antibody is made to the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) after subjects receive the H5N1&#xD;
      vaccine. Three hundred healthy adults aged 18-40 years will participate for approximately 9&#xD;
      months, which includes screening. Participants will receive 2 doses of vaccine or placebo&#xD;
      injected 28 days apart. Participants will have blood samples taken up to 7 times and have 8&#xD;
      scheduled study visits.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging clinical trial&#xD;
      of the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of intramuscular immunization with&#xD;
      inactivated, Vero cell-culture derived influenza A/H5N1 vaccine given alone or with aluminum&#xD;
      hydroxide to healthy young adults. The primary objectives are to determine the dose-related&#xD;
      safety of an inactivated, cell-culture grown whole virus influenza A/H5N1 vaccine with or&#xD;
      without aluminum hydroxide adjuvant in healthy adults; to determine the potential for&#xD;
      aluminum hydroxide to enhance the immune response to inactivated whole virus H5N1 vaccine in&#xD;
      healthy adults approximately 1 month following receipt of 2 doses of vaccine; and to provide&#xD;
      information for the selection of the best dosage level for further studies. The secondary&#xD;
      objective is to evaluate dose-related immunogenicity and the percent of subjects responding&#xD;
      approximately 1 and 7 months after the first vaccination. The primary endpoints are adverse&#xD;
      event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) information (solicited in the clinic and via memory&#xD;
      aids, concomitant medications, periodic targeted physical assessment, and laboratory safety&#xD;
      evaluations in a subset of subjects); proportion of subjects in each dose group achieving a&#xD;
      serum neutralizing antibody titer of greater than or equal to 40 against the influenza A/H5N1&#xD;
      virus 28 days after receipt of the second dose of vaccine (approximately Day 56); proportion&#xD;
      of subjects in each dose group achieving a serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody&#xD;
      titer of greater than or equal to 40 against the influenza A/H5N1 virus 28 days after receipt&#xD;
      of the second dose of vaccine (approximately Day 56); geometric mean titer (GMT) and&#xD;
      frequency of 4-fold or greater increases in neutralizing antibody titers in each group 28&#xD;
      days after receipt of the second dose of vaccine; and GMT and frequency of 4-fold or greater&#xD;
      increases in serum HAI antibody titers in each group 28 days after receipt of the second dose&#xD;
      of vaccine (approximately Day 56). The secondary endpoints are GMT and frequency of 4-fold or&#xD;
      greater increases in neutralizing antibody titers in each group 1 month and 7 months after&#xD;
      receipt of the first dose of vaccine; and GMT and frequency of 4-fold or greater increases in&#xD;
      serum HAI antibody titers in each group 1 month and 7 months after receipt of the first dose&#xD;
      of vaccine. Approximately 300 healthy adults, 18-40 years old inclusive, will be enrolled at&#xD;
      up to 5 sites in the United States for up to 9 months, including the screening period. Two&#xD;
      doses of vaccine or placebo will be injected into the deltoid muscle approximately 28 days&#xD;
      apart. The study will be conducted in 2 stages. During Stage 1, 90 subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive saline placebo or 7.5 micrograms (with or without aluminum hydroxide),&#xD;
      15 micrograms (with or without aluminum hydroxide), or 45 micrograms (without aluminum&#xD;
      hydroxide) (6 groups; N=15 per group). Blood for safety evaluations will be obtained from all&#xD;
      subjects in the Stage 1 cohort at screening, and before and 1 week after each vaccination.&#xD;
      Subjects in Stage 1 will receive their second vaccinations following review of available&#xD;
      clinical and laboratory safety data by the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC). If no&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity or safety-related issues are noted during the week after&#xD;
      administration of the first dose of vaccine during Stage 1 (based on review of clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory safety data by the SMC), then Stage 1 subjects will receive a second vaccination.&#xD;
      A complete Stage 1 safety report will be reviewed by the SMC prior to the enrollment of the&#xD;
      210 additional subjects in Stage 2 (N=50 per formulation group total). Sera for immune&#xD;
      assessment of antigen-specific immune responses will be collected from all subjects at&#xD;
      baseline (Day 0), 1 month after each vaccine dose, and 6 months after the second vaccine&#xD;
      dose. This study is linked to DMID protocol 07-0022.&#xD;
