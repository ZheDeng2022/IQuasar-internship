      This study will look at blood samples taken from 300 preterm babies and newborns admitted for&#xD;
      inpatient care at Hopital Gabriel Toure in Bamako, Mali, and to gather information that will&#xD;
      help the investigators verify the role of malaria in illness of very small babies. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be taken from the mothers so that the investigators can find out if they have a&#xD;
      malaria infection and how their body fights malaria. The investigators will also determine&#xD;
      whether the mother and newborn baby are infected with the same malaria parasite. The&#xD;
      information from this study may be used to improve malaria treatment in very small babies.&#xD;
      Mothers and babies whose blood is tested will receive treatment for malaria as recommended by&#xD;
      the National Malaria Control Program (NCMP).&#xD;

      The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to determine the rate of congenital and acquired&#xD;
      malaria in inpatient neonates at a tertiary pediatric hospital in Bamako, Mali. The primary&#xD;
      study endpoint will be the number of infants with malaria infection as detected by the&#xD;
      positivity of one of the three malaria diagnosis assays. The secondary study endpoints will&#xD;
      be: (1) the rate of congenital malaria, (2) the rate of acquired malaria, (3) the prevalence&#xD;
      of antimalarial antibodies in neonates, and (4) the prevalence of specific hemoglobin types&#xD;
      in the study population. Neonates of both sexes who weigh at least 2000g, are 0 - 28 days&#xD;
      old, and are referred to the Unit of Reanimation and Neonatology of Hopital Gabriel Toure in&#xD;
      Bamako, Mali, for inpatient care are eligible for enrollment in this two-year study. After&#xD;
      informed parental consent is obtained, approximately 2 ml of venous blood will be collected&#xD;
      for malaria diagnosis by OptiMal test, microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). If in&#xD;
      the clinician's judgment drawing blood is not feasible, a small blood sample will be obtained&#xD;
      by heel prick from the infants and tested for the presence of malaria parasites. If any of&#xD;
      the three infant malaria tests is positive, parenteral quinine will be administered as per&#xD;
      the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) treatment guidelines. If malaria is detected in&#xD;
      mothers, standard malaria therapy will be administered according to the National Malaria&#xD;
      Control Program (NMCP) treatment guidelines. Blood will be obtained from mothers for&#xD;
      molecular diagnosis of malaria infection and characterization of the genetic profile of&#xD;
      mother's malaria infections.&#xD;
