      The purpose of this study is to look at changes that occur in blood and nasal swab samples&#xD;
      after a person's immune system responds to receiving a flu vaccine. The investigators will&#xD;
      look at the immune response in 50 healthy volunteers, between 21 and 49 years of age, after&#xD;
      they have been vaccinated with 1 dose of a flu vaccine sprayed into the nose. A blood sample&#xD;
      and nasal swab of each nostril will be collected from volunteers before they receive the flu&#xD;
      vaccination. After receiving the flu vaccine, volunteers will record health changes and daily&#xD;
      temperatures on diary cards at home for 21 days. Blood will be drawn and nasal swabs will be&#xD;
      collected from each volunteer at each of the 6 study visits. Volunteers will participate in&#xD;
      the study for approximately 1 month. This study is being conducted at the Glennan Center for&#xD;
      Geriatrics and Gerontology at Eastern Virginia Medical School.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a nonrandomized, non-comparative study conducted in 50 healthy subjects, between 21&#xD;
      and 49 years of age, who have been vaccinated with 1 dose (0.5 mL) of Influenza Virus Vaccine&#xD;
      Live, Intranasal FluMistTM, a live trivalent nasally administered vaccine. The central&#xD;
      hypothesis is that immune responses to vaccination can be quantified by proteomic profiling&#xD;
      of serum and nasal proteins, and that host responses to different infectious agents are&#xD;
      unique and can be &quot;fingerprinted&quot; by proteomics. Using influenza virus vaccination, this&#xD;
      study proposes to use mass spectrometry platforms to profile and characterize proteins from&#xD;
      serum samples obtained from recipients. These samples will be used to develop a proteomic&#xD;
      profiling system for monitoring vaccine response, and will eventually allow earlier&#xD;
      detection/diagnosis of infection. Annually, natural influenza infections cause serious&#xD;
      international public health problems that are particularly severe in elderly people, who&#xD;
      account for more than 90% of influenza mortality. The current trivalent split virus influenza&#xD;
      vaccine is cost-effective, but its efficacy is greatly reduced in the elderly population. The&#xD;
      long-term goal of the investigators' approach is to develop tools useful for reducing the&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality of influenza from natural and potential bioterrorism-related&#xD;
      infections by improving measures of vaccine efficacy and early diagnosis. This study is being&#xD;
      conducted at the Glennan Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology at Eastern Virginia Medical&#xD;
      School. Solicited adverse events (AEs) and daily temperatures will be collected on diary&#xD;
      cards for 21 days. Unsolicited AEs will also be collected throughout the duration of the&#xD;
      study. Blood will be drawn and nasal swabs will be collected from each subject at each of the&#xD;
      6 study visits. Subjects will participate in the study for approximately 1 month. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to analyze serum samples before and after FluMist intranasal&#xD;
      attenuated live-virus influenza vaccination to identify surrogate markers reflective of the&#xD;
      immune response by using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight&#xD;
      (SELDI-TOF) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass&#xD;
      spectrometry proteomic profiling tools reflective of the immune response. Concurrent T-cell&#xD;
      activation, cytokine assays, and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) serologic assays will&#xD;
      correlate cellular and humoral responses to influenza vaccination with protein profiling&#xD;
      changes. Proteins obtained from intranasal swabs pre and post vaccination will be analyzed.&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate identifying multiple host response proteins from this analysis&#xD;
      using combinations of gel electrophoresis, MALDI-TOF and tandem MS/MS approaches. The&#xD;
      secondary objective is safety. Data on solicited reactions will be collected from Day 0 to&#xD;
      Day 14. The time of occurrence of AEs will be used to determine if there is a correlation&#xD;
      with the time of increase in certain protein biomarkers. The primary endpoint is to identify&#xD;
      surrogate markers reflective of the immune response in serum and/or nasal proteins and to&#xD;
      correlate these markers to cellular and humoral responses (demonstrated with T-cell&#xD;
      activation, cytokine assays, and the hemagglutination inhibition [HI] serologic assays) to&#xD;
      influenza vaccination. The secondary endpoint is safety. Data on local reactions and&#xD;
      solicited systemic reactions will be collected from Day 0 to Day 14 and categorized according&#xD;
      to severity. Unsolicited AEs will be collected and categorized throughout the study by&#xD;
      severity, duration, and relatedness to vaccine. The time of occurrence of AEs will be used to&#xD;
      determine if there is a correlation with the time of increase in certain protein biomarkers.&#xD;
