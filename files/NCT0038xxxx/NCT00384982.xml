      The MYocardial STem cell Administration after acute myocardial infaRction (MYSTAR) study is a&#xD;
      multicenter, prospective, randomized, single-blind clinical trial designed to compare the&#xD;
      early and late intracoronary or combined (percutaneous intramyocardial and intracoronary)&#xD;
      administration of bone marrow-derived stem cells to patients after acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction with reopened infarct-related artery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous data suggest that bone marrow-derived stem cells (BM-SCs) decrease the infarct size&#xD;
      and beneficially affect the postinfarction remodeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MYocardial STem cell Administration after acute myocardial infaRction (MYSTAR) study is a&#xD;
      multicenter, prospective, randomized, single-blind clinical trial designed to compare the&#xD;
      early and late intracoronary or combined (percutaneous intramyocardial and intracoronary)&#xD;
      administration of BM-SCs to patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with reopened&#xD;
      infarct-related artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoints are the changes in resting myocardial perfusion defect size and left&#xD;
      ventricular ejection fraction (gated SPECT scintigraphy) 3 months after BM-SCs therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints relate to evaluation of 1) the safety and feasibility of the&#xD;
      application modes, 2) the changes in left ventricular wall motion score index (transthoracic&#xD;
      echocardiography), 3) myocardial voltage and segmental wall motion (NOGA mapping), 4) left&#xD;
      ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (contrast ventriculography), and 5) the&#xD;
      clinical symptoms (CCS and NYHA) at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomly assigned into one of four groups, Group A: early treatment (21-42 days&#xD;
      after AMI) with intracoronary injection; Group B: early treatment (21-42 days after AMI) with&#xD;
      combined (intramyocardial and intracoronary) application; Group C: late treatment (3 months&#xD;
      after AMI) with intracoronary delivery; and Group D: late treatment (3 months after AMI) with&#xD;
      combined (intramyocardial and intracoronary) administration of BM-SCs. Besides the BM-SCs&#xD;
      therapy, the standardized treatment of AMI is applied in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MYSTAR trial is the first randomized trial to investigate the effects of the combined&#xD;
      (intramyocardial and intracoronary) and the intracoronary mode of delivery of BM-SCs therapy&#xD;
      in the early and late periods after AMI.&#xD;
