  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pazopanib will be given with TAXOL in one part, in another part pazopanib will be given with&#xD;
      TAXOL and PARAPLATIN, and in a third part pazopanib will be given with TAXOL and lapatinib&#xD;
      (patients separated in each part). Toxicity monitoring will enable us to find the largest&#xD;
      dose of pazopanib daily that can be safely given in combination with the chemotherapy agents&#xD;
      TAXOL and PARAPLATIN, and with lapatinib, as well as what side effects are likely to manifest&#xD;
      when these agents are given together and whether the combination of pazopanib with&#xD;
      chemotherapy, helps to treat different types of cancer. Another objective is to find out how&#xD;
      much pazopanib, TAXOL, PARAPLATIN and lapatinib are in the blood at specific times after the&#xD;
      agents are given. Collecting the blood samples requires that the patients remain in the&#xD;
      vicinity of the clinic overnight on 2 occasions.&#xD;
