  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a sequential phase I and II, controlled, double-blinded study to determine whether&#xD;
      immune responses suggesting protection against influenza can safely be induced in young&#xD;
      children by two reduced doses one month apart of 0.1 mL of a trivalent inactivated influenza&#xD;
      vaccine (INF) administered by the intradermal (ID) route with an investigational ID spacer on&#xD;
      a United States (U.S.)-licensed needle-free jet injector (JI), compared to two standard&#xD;
      intramuscular (IM) 0.25 mL doses by needle-syringe (N-S) in this age group. The locale is a&#xD;
      developing country where financial restraints for the use of full-dose influenza vaccine&#xD;
      would limit protection from an influenza pandemic threat, where N-Ss pose dangers and&#xD;
      drawbacks in clinical use, and where Mantoux-type N-S ID injections are difficult to&#xD;
      administer during mass campaigns.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, observer-blinded, clinical pilot (phase I) trial of safety, followed by a&#xD;
      clinical (phase II) trial of safety and non-inferiority of immune response to the standard&#xD;
      route and dose for the merged subjects from both phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I - Influenza-vaccine naïve children (n = 48) aged &gt;= 6 to &lt; 24 months will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to the following three study arms, each to receive two doses on&#xD;
      days 0 and 28 of trivalent inactivated influenza (INF) vaccine (Vaxigrip®, Sanofi Pasteur,&#xD;
      Lyon, France) into the left thigh (&lt; 12 months) or left deltoid (≥ 12 months):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group &quot;ID-JI-0.1&quot; (n = 16) - reduced 0.1 mL INF doses administered intradermally (ID) by&#xD;
           needle-free jet injector (JI) (Biojector® 2000 subcutaneous syringe no. 2 [green color&#xD;
           code], with 2 cm investigational spacer, Bioject Medical Technologies, Inc., Portland,&#xD;
           OR, USA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group &quot;IM-NS-0.1&quot; (n = 16) - reduced 0.1 mL INF doses administered intramuscularly (IM)&#xD;
           needle-syringe (NS) (via 22-25 gauge needle, minimum 25 mm/1-inch length)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group &quot;IM-NS-0.25&quot; (controls) (n = 16) - full 0.25 mL INF doses administered&#xD;
           intramuscularly (IM) by needle-syringe (NS) (22-25 gauge needle, minimum 25 mm/1-inch&#xD;
           length)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II - Upon assessment of the safety profile from phase I by the unblinded Data Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Board (DSMB), with its approval an additional 402 children will be recruited and&#xD;
      randomized (134 per group) as in phase I above. Total subjects in phase I and II = 450 (150&#xD;
      in each of three study arms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Event Diaries: Parents will be trained to complete a diary form to observe, measure,&#xD;
      and record solicited local reactions for the injection site and systemic signs and symptoms&#xD;
      for the child for days 0 through 7 after vaccination, plus unsolicited symptoms, illness, and&#xD;
      medications for days 0 through 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Followup: Return clinic visits will be scheduled on days 2, 7, and 28 after INF dose 1, at&#xD;
      which times the diary card data will be recorded by staff and the card collected on day 28.&#xD;
      Upon receiving dose 2 of vaccine, patients will be scheduled again to return to the study&#xD;
      center 2, 7, and 28 days afterwards. The same procedures as for dose 1 regarding diary cards,&#xD;
      telephone followup, and home visits will apply after dose 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon returning to clinic on day 28 after dose 2 (day 56 after dose 1), the child will receive&#xD;
      an unblinded, &quot;insurance&quot;, full-volume, 0.25 mL dose (#3) of influenza vaccine by NS IM,&#xD;
      unless he or she is in the full-dose IM control group IM-NS-0.25, in which case a mock&#xD;
      injection will be administered instead of a 3rd full dose beyond the usual 2-dose series. All&#xD;
      participants will return 6 months after this third injection for a fourth &quot;bonus&quot; dose of&#xD;
      influenza vaccine to ensure protection for the following season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum Collection: Blood specimens to measure serologic responses will be collected three&#xD;
      times, just prior to vaccination on day 0 (INF dose 1), on day 28 (INF dose 2), and on day 56&#xD;
      (INF &quot;insurance&quot; dose 3).&#xD;
