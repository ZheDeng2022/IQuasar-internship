      The purpose of this study is to determine if treadmill training with body weight-support&#xD;
      (BWST) is more effective at improving walking in individuals post-stroke than a resisted&#xD;
      leg-cycling exercise program. In addition, we want to determine if training programs that&#xD;
      combine leg strength training to treadmill walking provide an additional benefit to&#xD;
      post-stroke walking outcomes.&#xD;

      Impaired walking ability is a hallmark residual deficit that contributes to post-stroke&#xD;
      walking disability . Impairment in lower extremity muscle strength is a significant&#xD;
      contributor to decreased walking speed after stroke. No studies have combined task-specific&#xD;
      locomotor training in combination with lower extremity strength training programs designed to&#xD;
      improve post-stroke walking outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will include individuals who are ambulatory, but walk slower than 1.0 m/sec and&#xD;
      are at least 6 months post unilateral stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are stratified by initial comfortable walking speed (moderate &gt;0.5 m/sec; severe&#xD;
      &lt;= 0.5 m/sec) and randomized to one of four exercise pairs: 1) body-weight supported&#xD;
      treadmill training (BWST) and locomotor-based strength training (resistive cycling task,&#xD;
      LBST), 2) BWST and LE muscle-specific strength training (MSST), 3) BWST and upper extremity&#xD;
      ergometry (SHAM), and 4) LBST and SHAM. Training will occur 4 times per week for 6 weeks (24&#xD;
      total sessions). Exercise type in each exercise pair is alternated daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes include comfortable and fast overground walking speed, and distance walked&#xD;
      in 6-minutes measured at baseline, after 12 and 24 treatment sessions and at a 6-month&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
