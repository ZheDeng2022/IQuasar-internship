    <textblock>
      This interventional trial studies the effectiveness of adding cryoablation treatment in&#xD;
      patients who are receiving standard of care immunotherapy to treat cancer that is has spread&#xD;
      to other parts of the body (metastatic). Cryoablation uses a probe that freezes the tissue&#xD;
      around the tumor to try to kill the cancer cells. Using cryoablation to treat cancerous&#xD;
      lesions may help to kill the cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effect of cryoablation on adaptive resistance to immunotherapy in&#xD;
      metastatic cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess additional efficacy response to treatment. II. To assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of cryoablation in this population. III. To compare the radiologic response of&#xD;
      ablated and non-ablated lesions using Immune-Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
      Tumors (iRECIST) and RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the immune effect of cryoablation on the non-ablated lesion using pre- and&#xD;
      post-treatment biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the immune microenvironment and systemic changes as a result of cryoablation&#xD;
      with the goal of biomarker discovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning 1 week prior to the next scheduled standard of care immunotherapy infusion,&#xD;
      patients undergo core biopsy of the lesion to be ablated and a non-ablated lesion and also&#xD;
      undergo cryoablation. Patients undergo a mandatory second core biopsy of the non-ablated&#xD;
      lesion at 4 weeks after cryoablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 12 months after cryoablation and then&#xD;
      periodically thereafter.&#xD;
