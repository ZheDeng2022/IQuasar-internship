  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Concussions occur most frequently in adolescents and often result in significant disruption&#xD;
      to daily living for prolonged periods of time. Concussions are an epidemic, with the&#xD;
      incidence rates for sports related concussions (SRC) in adolescents up to 0.47 per 1000&#xD;
      athlete exposures. Research would suggest that multi-planar neck strength is a protective&#xD;
      factor of SRC risk in adolescents as greater neck strength is associated with a lower SRC&#xD;
      risk.(Collins et al) Neck pain is a common symptom associated with SRC that is also&#xD;
      associated with prolonged recovery from SRC. (King et al, Van der Naalt et al) Neck pain is&#xD;
      also associated with decreased neck muscle strength (DeKoning et al). Our study will address&#xD;
      a critical gap in concussion management - multi-planar cervical spine strengthening to&#xD;
      specifically rehabilitate the cervicogenic component of prolonged post-concussion symptoms&#xD;
      with a cervicogenic component and determine if this approach restores normal neck strength,&#xD;
      decreases neck pain and headaches, improves daily global function and allow patients to&#xD;
      return to sport and school. work more quickly than those without specific multi-planar neck&#xD;
      strengthening.&#xD;

      Overall Design: This will be a randomized clinical trial using a prospective cohort model. A&#xD;
      total of 56 adolescents/young adults with concussion symptoms that persist &gt;4 weeks&#xD;
      post-trauma and +ve screening for cervical involvement (rated neck pain as a symptom, TOP&#xD;
      para cervical or suboccipital spine, +ve cervical flexion-rotation test (Hall et al)) will be&#xD;
      assigned randomly into one of two groups: 1) Control group who undergo traditional usual&#xD;
      clinical care comprised of bi-weekly physiotherapy sessions and home-based exercise programs&#xD;
      (TRADITIONAL), and 2) In combination with standard clinical care as described above, 2&#xD;
      sessions per week training on the TopSpin360 (protocol outlined below). (INTERVENTION). The&#xD;
      intervention will last up to 7 weeks or until medical clearance to return to normal daily&#xD;
      activities. Balancing as much as possible the impact of age and sport is critical because&#xD;
      mechanisms and patterns of injury differ with the patient and the sport in which the&#xD;
      concussion occurred. The randomization process will balance the influence of one's sex on the&#xD;
      measured outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Patients will be randomized into one of the two groups using a 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      balance recruitment and covariates. A random number generator will be used to assign groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Sequence: Based on previous work, it is anticipated that 7 weeks of intervention will be&#xD;
      required. (Versteegh et al) Following baseline measures (Week 0) upon study entry, tests will&#xD;
      be conducted at the midway point (4 weeks) and upon completion (7 weeks) or upon medical&#xD;
      clearance to return to sport. The test sessions ideally will occur following the clinical&#xD;
      examination with the physician . This will increase convenience for the patient's family who,&#xD;
      for this age group, will be with the patient. At each test session a physiotherapist will&#xD;
      bring the participant through 1. Cervical Flexion-Rotation test, 2. Deep neck flexor&#xD;
      endurance test, 3. a multi-planar static neck strength assessment using a handheld&#xD;
      dynamometer (Versteegh et al), 4. Dynamic necks strength assessed via peak RPM and time to&#xD;
      complete 20 revolutions clockwise and counterclockwise on the TopSpin360, 5. Joint position&#xD;
      error testing (Revel et al), 6. and complete standard questionnaires: SCAT 5 symptom score,&#xD;
      Neck Disability Index, Headache Inventory and&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention training protocol using TopSpin360: Participants allocated to the INTERVENTION&#xD;
      group will participate in 2 training sessions per week using the TopSpin360 neuromuscular&#xD;
      neck-training device. Each session will be separated by a minimum of 2 days. Given the target&#xD;
      population for this study will include younger subjects than previous training studies using&#xD;
      the TopSpin360 and given they will have some neck pathology, a significantly reduced training&#xD;
      load (number of revolutions used per set) will be used. The advantage of the TopSpin360 as a&#xD;
      training tool is its safety profile in that the device uses self-generated resistance to&#xD;
      create the muscular load and training effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The attached weight is only 125gm, and the resistance is generated through the centripetal&#xD;
      force created as the participant swings the weight about the centrally mounted axis. Much&#xD;
      like a hula-hoop, the participant is only capable of spinning the weight as quickly as his or&#xD;
      her neck muscles and coordination are capable of getting it spinning, if they fatigue or lose&#xD;
      coordination, the weight stops spinning and the resistance is removed. The first 2 weeks will&#xD;
      involve 3 sets of 20 revolutions in each direction of clockwise and counterclockwise. Weeks 3&#xD;
      and 4 will involve 3 sets of 30 revolutions in each direction and weeks 4-7 will involve 3&#xD;
      sets of 40 revolutions in each direction.&#xD;
