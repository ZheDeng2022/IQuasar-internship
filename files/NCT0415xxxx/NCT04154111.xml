  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is growing interest in the utilization of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as a&#xD;
      novel, non-pharmacologic approach to decreasing alcohol use among treatment-seeking&#xD;
      individuals with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). The results of this study will be used to&#xD;
      determine which of the 2 proposed TMS strategies has a larger effect on drinking behavior (%&#xD;
      days abstinent, % heavy drinking days) as well as alcohol cue-reactivity in a 4 month period.&#xD;
      These data will pave the way for TMS to be used as an innovative, new treatment option for&#xD;
      individuals with AUD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is prevalent, devastating, and difficult to treat. The majority of&#xD;
      therapeutic approaches to date have relied on pharmaceutical modulation or and/or&#xD;
      psychotherapy. With a growing knowledge of the neural circuits that contribute to relapse in&#xD;
      AUD, there is an emerging interest in developing a novel, neural-circuit specific therapeutic&#xD;
      tool to enhance AUD treatment outcomes. The long term goal of this multidisciplinary research&#xD;
      team is to develop an evidence-based brain stimulation treatment protocol which will improve&#xD;
      AUD treatment outcomes. The competing neurobehavioral decision systems (CNDS) theory posits&#xD;
      that in addiction, choice results from a regulatory imbalance between two decision-making&#xD;
      systems (impulsive and executive). These behavioral systems are functionally linked to two&#xD;
      discrete frontal-striatal circuits which regulate limbic and executive control. Modulating&#xD;
      these competing neural circuits (e.g. either dampening the limbic/impulsive system or&#xD;
      amplifying the executive control system) may render alcohol users less vulnerable to relapse.&#xD;
      These two frontal-striatal neural circuits - the limbic loop (ventromedial prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      (VMPFC)-ventral striatum), and executive control loop (dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC)-dorsal&#xD;
      striatum) can be differentially stimulated by theta burst stimulation (TBS), a patterned form&#xD;
      of transcranial magnetic stimulation. Continuous TBS (cTBS) results in long term depression&#xD;
      (LTD) of cortical excitability and intermittent TBS (iTBS) results in long term potentiation&#xD;
      (LTP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past 7 years, through the scaffolding of a National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and&#xD;
      Alcoholism (NIAAA) P50 Center and a strong Brain Stimulation Research program, this&#xD;
      multidisciplinary group of clinicians and neuroscientists has demonstrated) it is possible to&#xD;
      differentially activate these circuits through TMS/Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD)&#xD;
      imaging LTD-like TMS (cTBS) to the VMPFC decreases orbitofrontal cortex and ventral&#xD;
      striatal/accumbens BOLD signal in heavy alcohol users cTBS also decreases alcohol cue&#xD;
      reactivity in this population and in AUD patients currently enrolled in intensive outpatient&#xD;
      treatment, 10 days of cTBS to the VMPFC is feasible, well-tolerated, increases 1 and 2 month&#xD;
      retention rates, and attenuates limbic brain reactivity to alcohol cues after 1 month. While&#xD;
      these studies provide a strong foundation for pursuing a larger multisite trial of cTBS, the&#xD;
      CNDS theory and other alcohol TMS studies suggests that the DLPLC may also be a fruitful&#xD;
      treatment target. In a sham-controlled pilot study the study team recently compared the&#xD;
      efficacy of VMPFC cTBS to DLPFC iTBS, and, to the study team's surprise demonstrated that a&#xD;
      single session of DLPFC iTBS had a greater effect on the brain response to alcohol cues than&#xD;
      VMPFC cTBS. To resolve this gap in understanding, the investigator proposes a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the relative efficacy of these 2&#xD;
      strategies as novel tools to improve AUD treatment outcomes (e.g. percent days abstinent up&#xD;
      to 4 months after TMS treatment initiation). These outcomes will be measured with urine ethyl&#xD;
      glucuronide (ETG) and blood carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT) measurements. The study&#xD;
      team will also evaluate the effect of these TBS treatments brain reactivity to alcohol cues.&#xD;
      The investigator's long-term vision is that TBS would be used as an adjuvant to behavioral&#xD;
      treatment, enabling individuals to maximize the likelihood of behavioral change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      180 treatment-seeking men and women recruited from the community at large, will be randomized&#xD;
      to receive 15 visits of TMS (2x/day; 3x/week, 20-30 min intersession interval) of either real&#xD;
      or sham TBS to the VMPFC or left DLPFC while they are enrolled in the proposed study.&#xD;
      Randomization will occur after the participant has been consented and screened for&#xD;
      eligibility and prior to the first treatment visit. Real/Sham TBS will be delivered three&#xD;
      times per week for a total of 15 TMS visits. Quantitative ETG will be collected daily.&#xD;
      Quantitative CDT will be collected monthly throughout the course of the study. Additional&#xD;
      assessments and/or brain reactivity to alcohol cues will be measured at the following&#xD;
      timepoints: baseline screening visit, MRI visit #1 (before TMS treatment visit 1), TMS&#xD;
      treatment visits 1, 6, 11, and 15, MRI visit #2, and at the 3 monthly Follow Up visits. A&#xD;
      saliva sample taken for genetic analysis of a specific Brain-derived neurotrophic factor&#xD;
      (BDNF) variant will be obtained on enrollment and used to also analyze across these measures&#xD;
      and individual outcomes in response to TMS. Building on recent pilot data, the study team&#xD;
      will test the hypotheses that for both Strategy 1 &amp; 2, real TBS will improve AUD treatment&#xD;
      outcomes significantly more than sham. Analysis will be performed using repeated measures&#xD;
      analysis of variance (ANOVA) on change scores from baseline for each visit. The main&#xD;
      independent variable in the ANOVA will be time (TMS visits 1, 6, 11, and 15), group (VMPFC&#xD;
      vs. DLPFC TBS vs. sham) and their interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 (Strategy 1): Modulating the limbic system: VMPFC cTBS. The study team will evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of VMPFC cTBS, relative to sham, on number of days abstinent (primary outcome) and&#xD;
      heavy drinking days in 30 day intervals for 4 months. Participants will receive stimulation&#xD;
      over the left frontal pole electroencephalogram (EEG)10-20 system: Frontal Pole 1 (FP1). This&#xD;
      location has been used in previous studies in alcohol users which demonstrate VMPFC target&#xD;
      engagement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 (Strategy 2): Modulating the executive system: DLPFC iTBS. The study team will evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of DLPFC iTBS, relative to sham, on the parameters listed. iTBS will be delivered&#xD;
      over the left DLPFC EEG 10-20 system: Frontal 3 (F3) as this location has also been validated&#xD;
      to reliable result in target engagement by this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim- Baseline alcohol cue reactivity as a mediator of TBS clinical response. The&#xD;
      study team will test the hypotheses that individuals with a higher ratio of&#xD;
      (DLPFC-striatal)/(VMPFC-striatal) response to alcohol cues will be more likely to have a&#xD;
      change in drinking after Strategy 2.&#xD;
