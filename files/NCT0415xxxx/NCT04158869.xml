    <textblock>
      This is an observational case-control add-on study to an investigator-initiated clinical&#xD;
      trial (IICT) (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03167307): Omega-3 fatty acids as firstline&#xD;
      treatment in pediatric depression. A 36-week multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      randomized superiority study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will recruit a healthy control group matched for age and sex to a sub-group of&#xD;
      patients with diagnosed pediatric major depressive disorder (pMDD) enrolled in the IICT. The&#xD;
      aim is to investigate the relationship of n-3 FA intake and status with mental health in&#xD;
      children and adolescents with and without diagnosed pMDD, and explore potential biochemical&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying this relationship by measuring biomarkers related to n-3 FA metabolism,&#xD;
      mental health and cognitive function.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to a recent school survey, one out of ten adolescents in Zurich have moderate to&#xD;
      marked depressive symptoms. Early onset of paediatric major depressive disorder (pMDD) is a&#xD;
      risk factor for chronic and recurrent forms of depression in adulthood (MDD). MDD is&#xD;
      associated with difficulties in relationships, impaired school and work performance, and an&#xD;
      increased risk of substance abuse. Furthermore, MDD is a major contributor to the burden of&#xD;
      suicide and poor long-term health late in life. The emerging potential of n-3 polyunsaturated&#xD;
      fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), also known in short as omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FAs), for the&#xD;
      treatment of MDD is being investigated in several studies. Previous observational studies&#xD;
      suggest a link between the consumption of n-3PUFA-rich food and the level of depressive&#xD;
      symptoms. However, studies that investigated the potential beneficial effects of n-3 PUFA&#xD;
      supplementation for the treatment of MDD compared with placebo showed inconsistent findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives of this project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the relationship of n-3 FA intake and status with mental health in children&#xD;
           and adolescents with and without diagnosed pMDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore biochemical mechanisms underlying this relationship by measuring biomarkers&#xD;
           related to n-3 FA metabolism, mental health, cognitive function, and potential pathways&#xD;
           linking n-3 FA intake/status and brain health (e.g. immune system, gut&#xD;
           microbiome-brain-axis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants meeting the following criteria are eligible for the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants of female and male sex&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children aged 8 to â‰¤ 13 years or teenagers 13 to &lt; 18 years at time of study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Written informed assent of the subject and written informed consent from the subject's&#xD;
           parents/legal representatives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No present primary diagnosed psychiatric disorder according to the M.I.N.I. KID Test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  More than 4 weeks of regular n-3 FA supplementation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who are self-reported pregnant or breast feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-existing neurological or medical conditions likely to be a risk factor for&#xD;
           developing depressive symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a first step participants will be screened for in- and exclusion criteria. If participants&#xD;
      can be included into the study we will&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure participant's mental health with behavioural and cognitive assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect biological samples from participants (blood, urine, saliva, hair, and stool)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to recruit a total of 200 participants: 100 cases (from IICT) and 100&#xD;
      controls (recruited for this study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a total recruiting period of 18 months.&#xD;
