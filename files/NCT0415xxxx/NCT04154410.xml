  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether heart rate variability levels and&#xD;
      pupillometric measures are effective objective predictors of anxiety among patients before&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of preoperative anxiety in adults is estimated between 60 and 80% and prevents&#xD;
      a good integration of the information delivered, while seeking more attention from&#xD;
      caregivers. In addition, anxious patients require the administration of higher doses of&#xD;
      hypnotics at anesthetic induction. The pain expressed in the postoperative period is&#xD;
      proportional to preoperative anxiety, with a slower recovery kinetics responsible for&#xD;
      prolonged stay in the recovery room. Finally, the incidence of chronic pain is correlated&#xD;
      with the intensity of preoperative anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the recommendations of the European Anesthesia Society (ESA) emphasize the importance&#xD;
      of managing preoperative anxiety, this dimension is often overlooked and existing methods of&#xD;
      assessment are time consuming and sometime inaccurate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective screening with dynamic monitoring of the level of anxiety in real time is the&#xD;
      necessary step to ensure accurate detection and personalized management of the emotional&#xD;
      state of patients before performing an invasive procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety is an emotional state reflecting an imbalance of cortico-frontal regulation on the&#xD;
      limbic system. The interaction between these two neuronal systems is expressed in particular&#xD;
      by the intensity of the vagal tone and the autonomic nervous system. Exploring the balance&#xD;
      between sympathetic and parasympathetic systems is a promising avenue of exploration for&#xD;
      identifying, predicting, and treating anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two reliable and easy-to-use devices analyzing the expression of the autonomic nervous system&#xD;
      validated in the analysis of nociception in the awake patient or under general anesthesia are&#xD;
      marketed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI) (MDoloris Medical Systems) analyzing oscillatory changes&#xD;
      in heart rate as a function of respiratory time, namely the heart rate variability (HRV) B.&#xD;
      Algiscan (IDMed) analyzing pupil responsiveness to nociception&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of these devices in conscious pre-operative patients could allow a reliable and&#xD;
      objective detection of anxiety while following its kinetic evolution over time. The purpose&#xD;
      of this project is to evaluate the validity of these two devices in the context of&#xD;
      preoperative anxiety. After receiving clear information and giving their written agreement,&#xD;
      patients will be included in the study by the anesthetist physician. During the anesthesia&#xD;
      consultation, the included patients will be subjected to a self-assessment Hospital Anxiety&#xD;
      Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire of level of anxiety.&#xD;
