  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of an innovative two-hand (hand&#xD;
      forceps) fetal head extraction technique during the transverse cesarean sections (LTCS) by&#xD;
      comparing with the conventional one-hand technique used worldwide for centuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary research question of the study is whether two-hand fetal head extraction&#xD;
      technique results in quicker head delivery. The secondary research question is whether&#xD;
      two-hand technique would cause increased incidence of extension of uterine incision as well&#xD;
      as other adverse events while compared to conventional one-hand technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that two-hand technique would speed up fetal head delivery without&#xD;
      increasing the risk of extension of uterine incision as well as other adverse events, in the&#xD;
      meantime, maternal discomfort will be significantly reduced since fundal pressure will not be&#xD;
      required during the fetal head delivery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      It is not unusual that obstetricians struggle with head delivery during the LTCS, when it&#xD;
      occurs, it can not only lead to substantial personal distress for the individual surgeons,&#xD;
      but also frequently require operative delivery (vacuum or forceps), deliberate extension of&#xD;
      hysterotomy (i.e. inverted T-incision on the uterus), or partial transection of rectus&#xD;
      muscles which may be associated with higher maternal and neonatal morbidity as well as&#xD;
      obstetrical and surgical complications for the future pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During LTCS, the fetal head traditionally is delivered by one-hand manual extraction (a&#xD;
      surgeon inserts one hand into the uterus via the hysterotomy and lifts the fetal head out of&#xD;
      maternal pelvis, subsequently significant abdominal pressure is required to squeeze the fetal&#xD;
      head out of hysterotomy) along with application of significant abdominal/fundal pressure.&#xD;
      While abdominal pressure may cause maternal discomfort, in some cases (i.e. obesity with big&#xD;
      pannus or thickened anterior abdominal wall, high-floating/mobile fetal head above the&#xD;
      hysterotomy incision, tight rectus muscles, tight U- or V-shaped transverse hysterotomy&#xD;
      incisions, deflexed fetal head), application of vacuum or obstetrics forceps, deliberate&#xD;
      extension of hysterotomy incision either transversely or vertically (inverted t-incision),&#xD;
      excessive uterine fundal pressure or partially transection of rectus abdominis muscles may be&#xD;
      required. In addition to maternal discomfort due to increased fundal pressure, the result&#xD;
      often is either traumatic or undue delay in delivering the infant. An innovative approach to&#xD;
      manual head extraction, with surgeon's both hands formed as a pair of forceps, has been used&#xD;
      by the PI of this study for years during the LTCS for head extraction in the difficult&#xD;
      situations described above without complication, often time it was used after one hand&#xD;
      approach failed to deliver the infant, vacuum/forceps and abdominal pressure has never been&#xD;
      needed in these cases. One potential argument against two-hand technique is that it could&#xD;
      increase the risk of extension of uterine incision since two hands require more intrauterine&#xD;
      space than one hand. This was never the case based on PI's personal experience, however, no&#xD;
      evidence-based data is available to support or recommend against the clinic use of this&#xD;
      two-hand approach. This study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety outcome of two&#xD;
      different head extraction techniques in a randomized controlled study. If two-hand approach&#xD;
      was approved to be a safe and more effective way for fetal head extraction during LTCS, it&#xD;
      would potentially reduce the likelihood of application of vacuum/forceps and deliberate&#xD;
      extension of hysterotomy (i.e. Inverted T-incision which may disqualify the patient for trial&#xD;
      of labor after C-section [TOLAC] for the future pregnancy since the risk of uterine rupture&#xD;
      may be significantly increased after t-incision was made in the previous pregnancy), in&#xD;
      addition to significant mental stress reduction for surgical team and relief of maternal&#xD;
      discomfort caused by excessive fundal pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of two phases with phase 1 being a prospective case series study for&#xD;
      safety data collection, and phase 2 being a randomized control study that includes two study&#xD;
      groups (two-hand vs. one-hand).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: all OBGYN residents will be trained to learn and grasp the two-hand technique via&#xD;
      watching educational videos and practicing in simulation lab. The technique includes two key&#xD;
      steps. Step 1, insert one hand into the hysterotomy to assess position of fetal head with&#xD;
      vast majority of cases being occiput transverse, then insert the second hand to form a&#xD;
      hand-forceps to cover both ears and lower jawbones on the side. Surgeon's fingers need to&#xD;
      pass mandibles to secure sufficient grip to prevent slipping. Step 2, pulling fetal head out&#xD;
      of hysterectomy, Step 3, delivering posterior shoulder followed by anterior shoulder once&#xD;
      fetal head was delivered. Residents must be signed off by PI based on above criteria prior to&#xD;
      administering the two-hand technique in real patients. Residents will be allowed to apply&#xD;
      two-hand technique when they encounter difficulty delivering fetal head by one-hand technique&#xD;
      and prior to applying vacuum or forceps assisted delivery or extending the hysterotomy&#xD;
      (inverted T incision). Phase 1 will primarily focus on safety assessment of two-hand&#xD;
      technique, therefore, data on extension of uterine incision and neonatal outcome will be&#xD;
      collected. Consent will not be required for the phase 1 since hand-forceps technique will&#xD;
      only be used after conventional one-hand technique failed and before more invasive vacuum or&#xD;
      metal forceps is applied. If increase in negative neonatal outcome is not noted and none of&#xD;
      negative outcomes was considered being associated with two-handed technique, after 30 cases&#xD;
      were assessed, investigators will move on to phase 2 after informing RAC and IRB. Incidence&#xD;
      of spontaneous extension of uterine incision will not be considered primary end point for the&#xD;
      phase 1 since extension can be attributed to many factors (i.e. thin lower uterine segment&#xD;
      due to prolonged labors, bending the hand while lifting fetal head out of lower pelvis, etc.)&#xD;
      rather than the two-hand technique, and it will be unlikely to distinguish the real cause of&#xD;
      extension in phase 1 without doing a head-to-head comparison. The incidence of one handed&#xD;
      technique leading to extended hysterotomy (background incidence) is unknown thus it will be&#xD;
      unrealistic to compare the incidence of extension of hysterotomy observed in phase 1 with&#xD;
      background incidence either.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: After informed consent was obtained either in the women's health center (WHC) or&#xD;
      labor &amp; delivery (L&amp;D), study subjects will be recruited for undergoing an elective cesarean&#xD;
      section. Inclusion criteria include gestational age 37 weeks or above with cephalic&#xD;
      presentation, planned low transverse uterine incision, cervical dilation &lt;= 6cm, station &lt; 0.&#xD;
      All recruited subjects will be randomized to the study or control arm in L&amp;D according to a&#xD;
      computer generated randomized schedule. Group assignment will be concealed in an envelope&#xD;
      labeled with subject number and opened prior to C-section. All deliveries will be timed by a&#xD;
      designated staff using stopwatches from the time of entry into the uterus (insertion of a&#xD;
      surgeon's hand into uterus through the fully transected lower uterine segment) until the full&#xD;
      delivery of the fetal head. Cesarean section will be timed by OR staff as a matter of&#xD;
      routine. Although it may be easy to learn and grasp the skill of two-hand technique, all&#xD;
      house staffs must be trained to use both hands for head extraction in phase 1. If delivery&#xD;
      was not imminent after attempting at manual extraction with one-hand technique in control&#xD;
      group, then the surgeon should proceed with two-hand technique prior to extending the&#xD;
      hysterotomy incision and/or applying vacuum or forceps, and vice versa. The study will be&#xD;
      registered with clinicaltrials.gov. The number of patients approached for study, met&#xD;
      criteria, recruited, and withdrawal will be tracked and recorded. Both intention-to-treat and&#xD;
      per-protocol analyses will be conducted. Aside from an electronic medical record (EPIC),&#xD;
      additional information will be recorded in a separate datasheet such as time from entry of&#xD;
      uterus to delivery of fetal head (U-D interval), whether excessive fundal pressure was&#xD;
      applied (defined as a pressure that was applied by both surgeons or one of surgeons standing&#xD;
      with both feet in a tiptoe position and keeping both arms and elbows straight so that&#xD;
      shoulders are directly over surgeon's hands), whether initial planned technique fails and the&#xD;
      alternative technique succeeds, any laceration or extension of hysterotomy incision (whether&#xD;
      C-section is elective or not, cervical dilatation and station prior to C-section, thickness&#xD;
      of subcutaneous tissue (&gt;6 cm or &lt;=6 cm), head engaged or high floating, direction&#xD;
      [horizontal, vertical, oblique] and location[apex of hysterotomy incision, inferior aspect of&#xD;
      hysterotomy incision, cervical laceration]) of extension, whether deliberate extension of&#xD;
      hysterotomy incision was made and location(lateral extension, inverted T-incision), whether&#xD;
      vacuum or forceps was applied. Time from entry of uterus and fetal head delivery as a primary&#xD;
      outcome as well as other continuous variables with normal distribution, such as age, maternal&#xD;
      weight and BMI, will be analyzed using student's t-test. Non-parametric methods will be&#xD;
      applied to ordinal data or non-normally distributed continuous data. Categorical variables&#xD;
      (i.e. success rate of initial attempt at per-protocol extraction technique) will be analyzed&#xD;
      using Chi-square test. SPSS or SAS will be used for statistical analysis. P&lt;0.05 is deemed&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean U-D intervals using one-hand technique for manual extraction range from 30-60 seconds in&#xD;
      the literature (1-5). Investigators used 45+/-15 seconds as a mean U-D interval, one sided&#xD;
      test, α level of 0.05, 80 % power to detect 30% reduction in U-D interval, a total sample&#xD;
      size of 42 (21 for each group) will be needed. If 20% of study withdrawal was taken into&#xD;
      account, a total of 52 patients need to be recruited.&#xD;
