  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will look at how two different semaglutide versions reach and stay in the blood&#xD;
      after injection. The study aims to show similar levels of semaglutide in the blood when using&#xD;
      the different semaglutide versions. Participants will get 1 of the 2 versions of semaglutide.&#xD;
      Which version participants get is decided by chance. One version is the one that doctors&#xD;
      already can prescribe and the other is the new version. Participants will get the medicines&#xD;
      as an injection under the skin of the stomach with the use of a pen-injector. The type of&#xD;
      pen-injector is different for the two versions of semaglutide. The study will last for about&#xD;
      80-99 days. Participants will have 24 study visits with the study doctor. For 2 of the&#xD;
      visits, participants will stay in the clinic for 4 days and 3 nights. Participants may have&#xD;
      to stop the study if the study doctor thinks that there are risks for their health. Women&#xD;
      cannot take part if pregnant, breast-feeding or planning to become pregnant during the study&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
