      A Phase I Clinical Trial of BAT1306 and BAT8001 Injection in Patients With HER2-positive&#xD;
      Advanced Solid Tumor&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      main purpose: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of BAT8001 in combination with BAT1306&#xD;
      in patients with HER2-positive advanced solid tumors, and to explore the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) to determine the recommended dose for phase II clinical trials (RP2D). Secondary&#xD;
      purpose: (1) Evaluation of pharmacokinetic (PK) and immunogenic characteristics of BAT8001 in&#xD;
      combination with BAT1306. (2) Preliminary evaluation of the antitumor efficacy of BAT8001 in&#xD;
      combination with BAT1306. Exploratory purpose: To explore the efficacy-related biomarkers of&#xD;
      BAT8001 in combination with BAT1306 in the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
