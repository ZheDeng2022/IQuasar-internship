      The purpose of this study is to assess the role of cardiac imaging combined with demographic,&#xD;
      clinical, and biochemical parameters in predicting outcomes following percutaneous mitral&#xD;
      valve intervention in order to facilitate more careful risk stratification, interventional&#xD;
      planning and avoidance of high risk futile procedures.The principle objective of this study&#xD;
      is to determine if transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) can predict changes in left&#xD;
      ventricular (LV) size and function following percutaneous mitral valve intervention (PMVI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mitral regurgitation (MR) is one of the most common valvular abnormalities affecting an&#xD;
      estimated 5 million worldwide. Within Europe it has been recognised as the second most common&#xD;
      valve lesion requiring surgery. By 2030, prevalence is expected to more than double as a&#xD;
      consequence of an ageing population. Mitral regurgitation can be caused by a range of&#xD;
      aetiologies including degenerative or functional abnormalities. Regardless of the underlying&#xD;
      cause, severe MR commonly leads to symptoms of breathlessness and/or arrhythmia, frequently&#xD;
      requiring hospital admission secondary to decompensated heart failure. Aside from a reduction&#xD;
      in cardiac output secondary to the primary lesion, chronic MR also leads to significant left&#xD;
      ventricular remodelling with dilatation and dysfunction of the left ventricle. Left&#xD;
      untreated, such a lesion carries an annual mortality of 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional mitral valve surgery is the recognised gold standard therapy for patients with&#xD;
      moderate to severe or severe mitral regurgitation, symptoms and LV impairment. However for&#xD;
      patients with multiple comorbidities and a high surgical risk, percutaneous mitral valve&#xD;
      intervention presents a novel viable therapeutic option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous mitral valve intervention offers an alternative to conventional open heart&#xD;
      surgery via a minimally invasive route. One such percutaneous technology is the Mitra-Clip&#xD;
      which is deployed and positioned to grasp valve leaflets and create a double orifice. The&#xD;
      primary aim is to reduce the degree of mitral regurgitation with additional clinical outcomes&#xD;
      focussed on symptom relief, enhanced lifestyle and longevity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Foundation studies focussed on Mitra-clip have supported the usefulness of percutaneous&#xD;
      technology with mainstay papers reporting a reduction in mitral regurgitation with&#xD;
      improvement in clinical symptoms and quality of life. When compared to conventional surgery&#xD;
      this approach has demonstrated high levels of safety and efficacy. Current research has also&#xD;
      acknowledged positive left ventricular (LV) remodelling with improvement in ejection fraction&#xD;
      and reduction in LV size as a consequence of percutaneous mitral valve intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac imaging is crucial in the preoperative, device deployment and post intervention&#xD;
      phases of PMVI. TTE, recognised as the mainstay imaging modality in valvular heart disease,&#xD;
      allows for both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of mitral regurgitation. Moreover,&#xD;
      comprehensive assessment of LV size and function can be performed. More recently, very early&#xD;
      myocardial impairment has been demonstrated using a number of sophisticated echocardiographic&#xD;
      markers. Additionally, functional testing including exercise stress echocardiography has&#xD;
      proven diagnostic relevance when uncovering valvular causes of dyspnoea. Unfortunately the&#xD;
      usefulness of both of these echo derived markers in patients with significant mitral&#xD;
      regurgitation undergoing PMVI is poorly understood, demonstrating the need for further&#xD;
      characterisation of these markers in this cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to assess the impact of percutaneous mitral valve intervention on markers of LV&#xD;
      function and the usefulness of functional testing in predicting changes in LV performance.&#xD;
      The investigators propose that cardiac imaging, functional testing and clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory data can be used to predict changes in left ventricular size and function&#xD;
      following percutaneous mitral valve intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial objectives and purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the role of cardiac imaging combined with demographic,&#xD;
      clinical, and biochemical parameters in predicting outcomes following percutaneous mitral&#xD;
      valve intervention in order to facilitate more careful risk stratification, interventional&#xD;
      planning and avoidance of high risk futile procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principle objective of this study is to determine if transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)&#xD;
      can predict changes in left ventricular (LV) size and function following percutaneous mitral&#xD;
      valve intervention (PMVI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluation of the usefulness of functional testing, namely exercise stress&#xD;
           echocardiography (ESE), and its role in discriminating mitral regurgitation (MR)&#xD;
           patients who demonstrate improved LV parameters following PMVI from those who do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assessment of the relationship between TTE, ESE, Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) and&#xD;
           Cardiac Computed Tomography (CT) for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assessment of the relationship between improvements in LV performance and the degree of&#xD;
           residual MR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Exploration and characterisation of the relationship between changes in LV parameters&#xD;
           and clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assessment of the usefulness of TTE parameters combined with functional, clinical,&#xD;
           biochemical parameters in providing a better prediction of postoperative outcomes&#xD;
           following PMVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Exploration of the relationship between improved outcomes and right ventricular (RV)&#xD;
           size and function and right ventricular systolic pressures (RVSP).&#xD;

      cardiac intervention. Additionally a post procedure follow up blood test will be performed&#xD;
      (approximately 3-6 months). Aside from routine blood tests, a small volume of additional&#xD;
      blood will be obtained and analysed to test for Troponin T, ST2 and Galectin-3. On completion&#xD;
      of testing, blood sample will be destroyed.&#xD;
