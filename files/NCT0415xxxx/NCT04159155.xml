  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This a phase II and III study whose purpose is to compare how long various treatment regimens&#xD;
      can keep the cancer from worsening or coming back in people with serous or p53 abnormal&#xD;
      endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided into three cohorts: Early stage cohort, advanced stage cohort, and&#xD;
      exploratory cohort. Each cohort will have different arms to examine different treatment&#xD;
      regimens to determine the best regimen for each cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll participants into the early stage cohort at this time. The early stage&#xD;
      cohort will compare the following treatments after standard of care surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel alone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy with cisplatin, followed by chemotherapy&#xD;
           with carboplatin and paclitaxel.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no standard or usual treatment for serous or p53 abnormal endometrial&#xD;
      cancer after standard surgery. Additional treatment may sometimes be given after the main&#xD;
      treatment in hopes of preventing the cancer from worsening or coming back (called adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not fully know whether adjuvant therapy after surgery is useful in early stage&#xD;
      endometrial cancer. It is also not known what the best adjuvant therapy after surgery is. The&#xD;
      most commonly given adjuvant therapy is chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel.&#xD;
      Sometimes, chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be given. There is not enough information&#xD;
      available as to how useful adjuvant therapy is and what the most useful type of treatment is.&#xD;
      This study will look at adjuvant chemotherapy alone compared with adjuvant radiation therapy&#xD;
      and chemotherapy, after standard of care surgery, in patients with serous or p53 abnormal&#xD;
      endometrial cancer.&#xD;
