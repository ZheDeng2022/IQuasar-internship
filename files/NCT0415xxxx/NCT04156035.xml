  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is firstly designed to investigate acute and delayed effects of a single dose of&#xD;
      ketamine on functional brain changes during emotional and cognitive challenges and at rest.&#xD;
      Secondly, it aims to investigate whether functional brain changes after ketamine require&#xD;
      increased glutamatergic signaling and will accordingly be modulated after pretreatment with&#xD;
      lamotrigine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine, its increasing use as an AD and the&#xD;
      recent (2019) FDA approval of ketamine nasal spray as medication for treatment-resistant&#xD;
      depression, the exact neurobiological mechanisms underlying its effects remain unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are numerous reasons, why so far there has been no coherent explanatory framework. Most&#xD;
      previous studies focused on investigating a single domain such as functional connectivity&#xD;
      (e.g. Deakin et al., 2008; Scheidegger et al., 2012), functional brain changes to either&#xD;
      cognitive (e.g. Honey et al., 2005; Driessen et al., 2013) or emotional challenge (e.g.&#xD;
      Scheidegger &amp; Grimm et al., 2016; Reed et al., 2019), perfusion (e.g. Pollack et al., 2015),&#xD;
      magnetic fields (Salvadore et al., 2010) or neurotransmitter concentrations (e.g. Abdallah et&#xD;
      al., 2018). Small sample sizes of as little as 8 subjects, the lack of a control group, the&#xD;
      limited number of timepoints for measurement of the above-mentioned parameters, and the&#xD;
      failure to modulate glutamatergic signalling after ketamine further limit the informative&#xD;
      value of previous findings. What is therefore urgently needed in order to better understand&#xD;
      the mechanisms of ketamine, is a study that combines neuroimaging in several modalities,&#xD;
      investigates acute as well as delayed effects of ketamine and applies an approach to modulate&#xD;
      glutamatergic signaling after ketamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, this study is designed to investigate acute and delayed effects of a single dose&#xD;
      of ketamine on functional brain changes during emotional and cognitive challenge and at rest&#xD;
      as well as to investigate the functional significance of increased glutamatergic signalling&#xD;
      after ketamine. Measurement of functional brain changes will occur during (acute) and 24 hrs.&#xD;
      after a single dose of ketamine, as differential effects are hypothesized. To modulate&#xD;
      glutamatergic signaling after ketamine, a lamotrigine pretreatment protocol will be used. It&#xD;
      is hypothesized that functional brain changes previously linked to ketamine require increased&#xD;
      glutamatergic signaling and will be attenuated by pretreatment with lamotrigine. To test&#xD;
      these hypotheses, we will implement a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group design&#xD;
      with 3 treatment conditions (lamotrigine + ketamine, placebo + ketamine, placebo + placebo).&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo two scanning sessions (acute + post 24 hrs.). In order to include&#xD;
      baseline values as covariates in the analyses, imaging will begin 10 minutes before infusion&#xD;
      of ketamine/placebo. Pretreatment with lamotrigine or matching placebo will occur 2 hours&#xD;
      before the ketamine/placebo infusion. Blood samples will be taken at 0:30, 1:00, 1:30, 2:55&#xD;
      and 4 hours following oral drug administration to determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      lamotrigine, and at 40 minutes after commencing ketamine infusion to confirm target ketamine&#xD;
      plasma levels.&#xD;
