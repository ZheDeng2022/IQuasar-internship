  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis underlying this proposal is that deficits of synaptic plasticity underlie the&#xD;
      slow-wave activity (SWA) abnormalities observed n major depressive disorder (MDD), and that&#xD;
      manipulating SWA may serve to circumvent these deficits by facilitating an increase in&#xD;
      synaptic strength via the inhibition of synaptic down-scaling, thereby improving plasticity&#xD;
      and mood.&#xD;

      VISIT 1: Screening. Participants who meet initial inclusion criteria via phone screen will be&#xD;
      invited to the laboratory for an in-person screening visit that includes additional screening&#xD;
      (e.g. Medical history, TMS eligibility, hearing test for SW disruption procedure), and a&#xD;
      structured clinical interview to determine final study eligibility. All subjects will receive&#xD;
      verbal and written explanation of the general goals and risks of the study and will sign an&#xD;
      informed consent. At this session, participants will also have the opportunity to become&#xD;
      acquainted with the TMS and SW disruption procedures. In the case that remote visits are&#xD;
      being utilized, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, this will be separated into a virtual&#xD;
      visit (consent, clinical interview, etc. - anything that can be conducted remotely will be)&#xD;
      and an in-person visit (hearing test, TMS demonstration). Participants will also choose two&#xD;
      dates, at least two nights apart and at most separated by two weeks, for the in-lab visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At-home Sleep Recording. For 7 days prior to the in-lab study visits, participants will be&#xD;
      asked to keep a consistent at-home sleep schedule, based on habitual rise time (e.g., 10:30&#xD;
      PM - 6 AM). Participants will also consent to refraining from napping, using alcohol and&#xD;
      drugs, and limiting caffeine use to one caffeinated beverage before noon throughout the&#xD;
      study. These procedures will be confirmed using actigraphy, and sleep diary. Actigraphy&#xD;
      provides a validated measure of sleep-wake patterns based on light and activity levels&#xD;
      utilizing a wrist-watch like device (Actiwatch 2 and Actiwatch Spectrum Pro, Philips&#xD;
      Respironics, Inc.). Sleep diaries will be used to document bedtime and rise time, and several&#xD;
      other sleep parameters. Participants will also be asked to note if actigraphs were removed,&#xD;
      for how long and for what purpose. Sleep diaries will be completed via the REDCap web-based&#xD;
      application if participants have consistent Internet access. Paper and pencil versions of&#xD;
      sleep diaries will also be available. Study staff will compare across these methods to verify&#xD;
      adherence to study guidelines prior to the in-lab study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT 2: Baseline Night. Visit 2 and Visit 3 occur on two separate days, in a counterbalanced&#xD;
      design to ensure no order or learning effects. The following procedure description will occur&#xD;
      in half of participants where Visit 2 precedes Visit 3; however identical procedures will be&#xD;
      used for the remaining half of participants where Visit 3 will precede Visit 2. Participants&#xD;
      will arrive at the Clinical Research Center for Sleep (CRCS) at 8pm on Visit 2. Following&#xD;
      their arrival and orientation, EEG electrodes will be applied. Participants sleep will then&#xD;
      be monitored overnight. In the morning, participants will have their blood drawn, and after a&#xD;
      light breakfast, the HAM-D will be administered, and then participants will be asked to fill&#xD;
      out mood questionnaires (BDI, VAS, PANAS, KSS), and complete a battery of tasks including&#xD;
      memory tasks, and resting EEG. They will then be accompanied to the Richards Building to&#xD;
      complete the TMS protocol, before returning to the CRCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT 3: Slow-wave Disruption. Procedures for Visit 3 are identical for those for Visit 2,&#xD;
      with the exception of the following: Utilizing real-time EEG monitoring during sleep, left&#xD;
      (C3) and right central (C4) channels will be continuously inspected. Whenever two delta waves&#xD;
      (14 Hz; 75 V) appear within 15 seconds, an acoustic stimulus (i.e. tone; frequency = 1000 Hz;&#xD;
      intensity = 20100 dB) will be administered through a speaker mounted above the bed, beginning&#xD;
      with the lowest intensity (20 dB) and increased by 5 dB intervals if no response occurs&#xD;
      (sleep stage shift, K complex, EEG desynchronization, mixed and fast frequency, alpha burst,&#xD;
      muscle tone increase, slow eye movements). Utilizing this methodology, the type and incidence&#xD;
      of tones played will be tailored to each participant to suppress slow waves without arousing&#xD;
      the subject. Disruption of SWA will take place without waking the subject or decreasing total&#xD;
      sleep time. The selective SW disruption procedure has been described in detail elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS The TMS system is housed in the Richards Biomedical Building. Only individuals trained by&#xD;
      the IDE sponsor (Desmond Oathes, Ph.D.) and Center Director (Yvette Sheline, M.D.) will&#xD;
      dispense TMS. Since all TMS procedures are being conducted in Dr. Sheline's lab, all plans&#xD;
      for receipt, storage, labelling, dispensing, returning of failed devices, and destruction&#xD;
      will fall under the center's SOPs.&#xD;
