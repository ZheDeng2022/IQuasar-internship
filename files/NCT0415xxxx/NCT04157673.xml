      memory/executive function and/or decision-making.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine if a cognitive intervention is an efficacious method&#xD;
      for improving medication adherence in adults with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      Participants in this study will complete assessment sessions, as well as intervention&#xD;
      sessions over a 15 week period. During this time, medication adherence will be monitored&#xD;
      using a MEMS cap. The investigators hypothesize that, following the cognitive intervention,&#xD;
      there will be improvements in participants' medication adherence, as well as in facets of&#xD;
      memory.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention being researched is called episodic future thinking (EFT), which consists of imagining specific instances of one's future. In this study, participants will engage in EFT focused on imagining taking one's medication, guided by a research staff member in their intervention sessions in addition to weekly check-in calls across an 8-week period following a 6-week baseline period. The research staff member will conduct the intervention session using a semi-structured interview format in which they work to identify situations in which the participant encounters challenges with taking their medication and will ask questions to prompt the participant to imagine what successful medication adherence would consist of. Sessions may also involve imagining positive events resulting from successful medication adherence and the details surrounding those events.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adults over the age of 18 with prediabetes or Type 2 Diabetes currently prescribed at least&#xD;
        one oral medication for blood glucose regulation, or for related comorbidities e.g.,&#xD;
        hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and are relatively non-adherent to taking them (&lt; 80% of&#xD;
        prescribed doses taken), but are motivated and/or have the intent to better comply with&#xD;
        their medication regimen, will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes: Participants must have a diagnosis of prediabetes or Type&#xD;
        2 Diabetes within the last 2 years or meet criteria for prediabetes or Type 2 Diabetes. The&#xD;
        American Diabetes Association guidelines (Group, 2003) defines prediabetes and Type 2&#xD;
        Diabetes as Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) 100mg/dl or greater, 2h glucose 140mg/dl or&#xD;
        greater after Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of&#xD;
        approximately 5.4% or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy: Women who are pregnant or lactating will be excluded from participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Substance use, abuse, or dependence: Individuals that currently have problems with&#xD;
        substance dependence, addiction, or problematic substance use that would limit&#xD;
        participation (e.g., binge drinkers, alcoholics, daily stimulant/opiate users) will be&#xD;
        excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Conditions that affect adherence: Participants should not have a condition that would limit&#xD;
        participation which include medical conditions that would affect individuals' ability to&#xD;
        use the computer for prolonged period of time; leave the individual unable to ambulate;&#xD;
        unmanaged psychiatric disorder (e.g., depression, anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity&#xD;
        disorder, schizophrenia), cognitive impairment that would impact memory (e.g., symptomatic&#xD;
        concussion), or an intellectual impairment that would impact study adherence. Additionally,&#xD;
        participants should be able to attend to all intervention sessions. If a participant is not&#xD;
        able to make most sessions (e.g. participant is out of town during most of the study for&#xD;
        work or vacation travel), they may be excluded from the study Prior participation in&#xD;
        similar studies: Individuals who have recently participated in a laboratory study using&#xD;
        similar methods may also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Use of medication adherence aids: individuals who currently use aids to assist with&#xD;
        medication adherence (e.g., pill organizers, reminder apps)may be excluded&#xD;
