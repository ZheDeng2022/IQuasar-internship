  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will involve the collection and analysis of urine samples from non-pregnant women&#xD;
      to determine the existence of alternating redox status between two consecutive menstrual&#xD;
      cycles.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The Sponsor believes there is variability in the relative redox status in women's urine&#xD;
      across menstrual cycles. This validation study will involve the collection and analysis of&#xD;
      urine samples from non-pregnant women to determine the existence of alternating redox status&#xD;
      between two consecutive menstrual cycles. If the hypothesis is proved, future research could&#xD;
      examine if there are related fertility issues.&#xD;

             might, in the investigator's opinion, preclude completion of the study or suggest that&#xD;
             an exclusion criterion will ensue.&#xD;
&#xD;
