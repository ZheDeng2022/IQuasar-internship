  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants are seeking to unleash the full therapeutic potential of a newly developed,&#xD;
      customizable and potentially commericializable 10-channel Functional Electrical Stimulation&#xD;
      (FES) to rehabilitate the gait of chronic stroke survivors. Patricipants will utilize the&#xD;
      theory of muscle synergies from motor neurosciences, which are defined as neural modules of&#xD;
      motor control that coordinate the spatiotemporal activation patterns of multiple muscles, to&#xD;
      guide our personal selections of muscles for FES. Before applying FES stimulations to chronic&#xD;
      stroke survivors, participants will have to define normal muscle synergies from age-matched&#xD;
      healthy control participants (1 session for each participant). After comparing the difference&#xD;
      in muscle synergies in both healthy subjects and chronic stroke survivors, participants are&#xD;
      attempting to rehabilitate the gait of chronic stroke survivors by using the wearable. Each&#xD;
      chronic stroke survivor will undergo 18-session FES training (~ 1 month).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that FES will promote motor recovery by supplying the missing normal&#xD;
      muscle synergies to chronic stroke survivors at their supposed times of activations in each&#xD;
      step cycle during interventional training. It is also expected that the walk synergies of the&#xD;
      paretic side of chronic stroke survivors should be more similar to healthy muscle synergies&#xD;
      at the two post-training time points than before training. The healthy normal muscle&#xD;
      synergies will be defined by EMG recordings from the recruited healthy participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the leading causes of long-term adult disability worldwide. The impaired&#xD;
      ability to walk post-stroke severely limits mobility and quality of life. Many&#xD;
      recently-developed assistive technologies for gait rehabilitation are at present only&#xD;
      marginally better at best than traditional therapies in their efficacies. There is an urgent&#xD;
      need of novel, clinically viable, and effective gait rehabilitative strategies that can&#xD;
      provide even better functional outcome for stroke survivors with diverse presentations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the many new post-stroke interventions, functional electrical stimulation (FES) of&#xD;
      muscles remains attractive. FES is a neural-rehabilitative technology that communicates&#xD;
      control signals from an external device to the neuromuscular system. There is increasing&#xD;
      recognition that rehabilitation paradigms should promote restitution of the patient's muscle&#xD;
      coordination towards the normal pattern during training, and FES can achieve this goal when&#xD;
      stimulations are applied to the set of muscles whose natural coordination is impaired. For&#xD;
      this reason, FES is a very promising interventional strategy. Existing FES paradigms,&#xD;
      however, have yielded ambiguous results in previous clinical trials, especially those for&#xD;
      chronic survivors, likely because either stimulation were applied only to single or a few&#xD;
      muscles, or the stimulation pattern did not mimic the natural muscle coordination pattern&#xD;
      during gait. A multi-muscle FES, when applied to a larger functional set of muscles and&#xD;
      driven by their natural coordination pattern, can guide muscle activations towards the normal&#xD;
      pattern through neuroplasticity, thus restore impairment at the level of muscle-activation&#xD;
      deficit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our project is to rehabilitate the gait of chronic stroke survivors by delivering&#xD;
      stimulations to multiple muscles, in their natural coordination pattern, using our wearable.&#xD;
      participants will utilize the theory of muscle synergy from motor neuroscience to guide our&#xD;
      personalizable selections of muscles for FES. Muscle synergies are hypothesized neural&#xD;
      modules of motor control that coordinate the spatiotemporal activation patterns of multiple&#xD;
      muscles. Our customizable FES pattern for each stroke survivor will be constructed based on&#xD;
      the normal muscle synergies - identified from age-matched healthy subjects - that are absent&#xD;
      in the stroke survivor's muscle pattern during walking. Since muscle synergies represent the&#xD;
      natural motor-control units used by the nervous system, reinforcement of their activations&#xD;
      through FES should lead to a restoration of normal neuromuscular coordination, thus more&#xD;
      natural post-training gait.&#xD;
