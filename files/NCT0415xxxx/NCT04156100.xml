      This study is an open-label, Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic profiles of AGEN1223 as a single-agent and in combination with balstilimab,&#xD;
      as well as to assess the maximum tolerated dose and determine the RP2D of AGEN1223 as a&#xD;
      single-agent and in combination with balstilimab in subjects with advanced solid tumors. This&#xD;
      Phase 1 study will be conducted in an accelerated titration (for the first 2 single agent&#xD;
      AGEN1223 dosing cohorts) and standard 3+3 dose escalation format. Study drug treatment will&#xD;
      be administered on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle for up to 2 years or until any progressive&#xD;
      disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity is reported. The timing of the administration of doses&#xD;
      may be adjusted for management of adverse events (AEs). The safe starting dose of AGEN1223&#xD;
      single-agent will be at the estimated minimally anticipated biological effect level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment phase is divided into 3-week cycles with associated evaluations and procedures&#xD;
      that must be performed at specific time points. Tumor assessments will be conducted every 6&#xD;
      weeks (±7 days) from first dose until treatment discontinuation or disease progression. In&#xD;
      subjects that discontinue treatment for reasons other than PD, imaging will continue until PD&#xD;
      or initiation of a new therapy. If the subject discontinues treatment because of PD, imaging&#xD;
      may be performed if clinically beneficial or if deemed necessary by the investigator until&#xD;
      the initiation of new antineoplastic therapy. This must be approved by the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will be established to assess safety and determine dose&#xD;
      escalation.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Any relevant bispecific antibody, and/or anti-PD-1/PDL1 agents. For selected&#xD;
             indication cohorts, prior treatment may be permitted after discussion with the&#xD;
             Sponsor. Prior therapy with PD-1/PDL1 inhibitor may be allowed in agreement with the&#xD;
             Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Received prior systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy, biological therapy, radiotherapy, or&#xD;

&#xD;
         15. History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, active infections, or&#xD;
             laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with&#xD;
