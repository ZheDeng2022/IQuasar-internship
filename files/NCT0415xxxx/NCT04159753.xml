  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are evaluating if subjects who have already experienced tonic spinal cord&#xD;
      stimulation would have a better pain relief status with burst spinal cord stimulation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a controlled trial with subjects that have an already-implanted SCS device (Eon&#xD;
      Mini™) and are not satisfied with their pain relief status. As part of medical standard of&#xD;
      care, patients with already-implanted Eon family tonic implantable pulse generators (IPGs)&#xD;
      have the opportunity to experience burst stimulation for 30-Day Trial FDA approved. The aim&#xD;
      of the study record patients experience during the 30-Day Trial using standard&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
