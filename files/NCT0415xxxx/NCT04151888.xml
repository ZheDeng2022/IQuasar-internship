      This study was aimed to assess the efficacy and factors affecting the success of hot water&#xD;
      irrigation in management of posterior epistaxis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epistaxis has been reported to occur in up to 60% of general population.This condition has&#xD;
      incidence peaks at ages younger than 10 years and older than 50 years. Epistaxis appears to&#xD;
      occur more in males than females . In rare cases massive nasal bleeding can lead to death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasal bleeding usually responds to first aid measures such as compression.When Epistaxis&#xD;
      doesn't respond to simple measures. The source of bleeding should be located and treated&#xD;
      appropriately. Treatment options to be considered include topical vasoconstriction, chemical&#xD;
      cautery, electrocautery, nasal packing, posterior gauze packing, use of balloon system, and&#xD;
      arterial ligation or embolization. Hospital admission should be considered with patients with&#xD;
      comorbid conditions or complication of blood loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasal Hot water irrigation was first described by Guice in 1878 as an effective method of&#xD;
      treating severe life-threatening epistaxis. However, the technique was already in use by&#xD;
      nineteenth century obstetricians as a method of treating postpartum bleeding . In the second&#xD;
      half of the twenties century, nasal packing products and the development of endoscopic sinus&#xD;
      surgery almost completely replaced the irrigation technique as treatment for posterior&#xD;
      epistaxis. However, Stangerup et al. (1996) have demonstrated that hot water irrigation,&#xD;
      using temperatures of up to 50Â°C, produces vasodilation and oedema of the nasal mucosa&#xD;
      without the risk of necrosis and accelerating the clotting cascade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hot water irrigation had a higher success rate (55 %) in treating posterior epistaxis,&#xD;
      compared with nasal packing (44 %) .Using a modified irrigation technique, was able to stop&#xD;
      bleeding permanently in up to 82 %of cases of posterior epistaxis, including patients&#xD;
      receiving antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants . During a follow-up period of four to 24&#xD;
      months. Furthermore, successful hot water irrigation was associated with less nasal trauma,&#xD;
      significantly less pain, fewer surgical procedures and avoidance of a hospital stay.&#xD;
