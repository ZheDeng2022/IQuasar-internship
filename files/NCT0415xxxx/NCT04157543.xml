  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex (TFCC) is the main stable structure of the distal ulnar&#xD;
      joint (DRUJ), and the damage of the triangular fibrocartilage complex is the most common&#xD;
      cause of pain in the ulnar side of the wrist in the young athlete population. Once TFCC is&#xD;
      injured, arthroscopic surgery is a common repair method. The postoperative analgesic method&#xD;
      is generally oral or injection analgesic. In recent years, electroacupuncture(EA) has been&#xD;
      widely used to relieve pain after surgery, and many studies have confirmed that it is&#xD;
      effective. However, there is no evaluation of analgesic efficacy after arthroscopic repair of&#xD;
      the TFCC. Therefore, it is hoped that the efficacy of electroacupuncture for analgesia after&#xD;
      arthroscopic repair of the TFCC is demonstrated by this study. And, the investigators also&#xD;
      hope the investigators can reduce the use of painkillers through electroacupuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:It is expected that 30 patients will be randomly assigned to the following groups:&#xD;
      electroacupuncture group(EAG), EA at points; non-point group (NPG), EA at non-points, control&#xD;
      group (CG) without EA&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. electroacupuncture group(EAG): EA at points after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. non-point group (NPG): EA at non-points after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Control group: only injection painkiller were used before surgery&#xD;

&#xD;
        2. non-point group (NPG): EA at non-points after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mode of operation: After the patient has returned to the recovery room, take the needle after&#xD;
      30 minutes, and then statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupoint selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. true acupoints: needles were inserted to Kunlun(BL60) and Sanyinjiao(SP6) contralateral&#xD;
           to the operated leg and deqi sensation elicited at acupoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. false point: the needles were inserted to Zusanli(ST36) and Shangjuxu(ST37)&#xD;
           contralateral to the operated leg and deqi sensation elicited at acupoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Control group:only injection and oral painkiller were used before surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Record the time required for the first injection of analgesics&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The number of doses of injection painkiller used in 36 hours after surgery (count)&#xD;
