    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of ICV delivery of CT-010 via an implantable pump and a cranial port and dual lumen&#xD;
      catheter (CIC) in subjects with focal seizures, with temporal lobe onset with or without&#xD;
      secondary generalization. Up to 70 subjects will be enrolled. Eligible subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either CT-010 or placebo treatment. Up to 20 clinical centers&#xD;
      will be enrolled.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy patients that are refractory to oral anti-epileptic drug (AED) treatment have&#xD;
      significantly higher mortality, higher morbidity, higher economic costs and diminished&#xD;
      quality of life compared to those who suffer from epilepsy that can be adequately controlled&#xD;
      with medical management. Current options for refractory patients include neurosurgical brain&#xD;
      resection, responsive neurostimulation, and vagal nerve stimulation. None of these options is&#xD;
      satisfactory due to the low applicability of surgery for patients with poorly localized or&#xD;
      multifocal seizures and the limited success of currently available alternative treatment&#xD;
      options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients with medically refractory focal epilepsy will be treated with&#xD;
      intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of CT-010, a reformulation of valproate, using&#xD;
      an implantable drug pump system. This is a randomized, double-blind Phase 2 study evaluating&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of this therapy. Clinical assessments, adverse events (AEs), seizure&#xD;
      diaries, concomitant medications, blood samples and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will be&#xD;
      collected and reviewed at designated time points. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and&#xD;
      electroencephalography (EEG) will also be performed. Subjects will have their surgery, dose&#xD;
      changes and pharmacokinetics performed in an inpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be enrolled based on Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria and undergo a 6-week baseline&#xD;
      period confirming and establishing monthly seizure rate. Following the baseline period&#xD;
      subjects will undergo system implant and a 1-month implant recovery period. Following&#xD;
      successful implant and recovery subjects will be randomized to either active therapy or&#xD;
      placebo for a 3-month blinded evaluation period. At the conclusion of the blinded evaluation&#xD;
      period, subjects will roll into an Open Label Extension Period, CLN100P.02. Subjects that&#xD;
      were randomized to placebo will receive active therapy during CLN100P.02.&#xD;
