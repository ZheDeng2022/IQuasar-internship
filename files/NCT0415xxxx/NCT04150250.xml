  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial was designed to assess safety and preliminary efficacy of oral doses of iOWH032 on&#xD;
      diarrhea output and clinical symptoms after a cholera challenge in healthy adult&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of a screening phase, an inpatient containment period with challenge with&#xD;
      Vibrio cholerae on Day 1 followed by treatment with iOWH032 or placebo and a post-challenge&#xD;
      observation period until discharge, an outpatient follow-up period of at least 28 days, and a&#xD;
      final follow-up (by telephone) 6 months post-challenge (Day 180) for the collection of&#xD;
      serious adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either iOWH032 500 mg every 8 hours for three&#xD;
      days or matching placebo. Blinded therapeutic dosing will start at the onset of diarrhea or&#xD;
      by 48 hours after ingesting the challenge inoculum of V. cholerae. The observation and&#xD;
      management of cholera diarrhea and symptomatology will occur on an inpatient isolation&#xD;
      research ward over a duration of approximately 11 days, including a three-day course of&#xD;
      antibiotics to treat all participants prior to discharge from the inpatient unit.&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>A total of 47 healthy adults were enrolled at one clinical research site in the United States. Participants were confined in an inpatient isolation research ward for a duration of approximately 11 days until discharge criteria were met.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio stratified by blood type status (O vs. Non-O) to receive either iOWH032 500 mg every 8 hours for three days or matching placebo.</pre_assignment_details>

Diarrhea was defined as a grade 3 or higher stool based on the following scale:&#xD;

Grade 2 - soft (normal stool, does not take the shape of the container)&#xD;
Grade 3 - thick liquid (diarrhea, takes the shape of the container readily)&#xD;
Grade 4 - opaque watery diarrhea&#xD;
Grade 5 - rice water diarrhea (clear watery)&#xD;
