      A Phase I-II, First-in-Human Study of SKB264 in Patients with Locally Advanced&#xD;
      Unresectable/Metastatic Solid Tumors who are refractory to Available Standard Therapies.&#xD;
      Patient must have historically documented, incurable, locally advanced or metastatic cancer&#xD;
      that are refractory to standard therapies of one of the following types:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Triple negative breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Epithelial ovarian cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Gastric adenocarcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Small cell lung cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Urothelial carcinoma&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, Phase I-II, first in human (FIH) study for SKB264 as monotherapy in&#xD;
      patients who have locally advanced unresectable or metastatic solid tumor that is refractory&#xD;
      to all standard therapies. TROP2 (trophoblast antigen 2) assessments will not be performed&#xD;
      prior to enrollment but it will be assessed retrospectively. Confirmation of TROP2&#xD;
      (trophoblast antigen 2) expression by immunohistology or other means is not required, but the&#xD;
      Sponsor will request fresh tumor biopsy or tissue specimens from archived materials for&#xD;
      determination of TROP2 (trophoblast antigen 2) expression retrospectively. The patient must&#xD;
      be, in the judgment of the investigator, an appropriate candidate for experimental therapy&#xD;
      whose tumor is refractory to standard therapies. Patients will receive study drug as a single&#xD;
      IV infusion at the prescribed dose level at each administration. Cycles will continue until&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The study is divided into 2 parts (Phase I and&#xD;
      Phase II).&#xD;
