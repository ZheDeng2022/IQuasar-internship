  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Central nervous system lymphoma (CNSL) is a rare brain tumor constituting 3% of all newly&#xD;
      diagnosed brain tumors, and 2% to 3% of all cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. There are two&#xD;
      subtypes of CNSL. Owing to its low incidence, there is limited prospective and/or randomized&#xD;
      data to guide the therapy of CNSL. Current knowledge about optimal diagnostic, prognostic and&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies of CNSL is urged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immune system plays a fundamental role in controlling and eradicating cancer but is held&#xD;
      in check by inhibitory receptors and ligands. These immune checkpoint pathways, which&#xD;
      normally maintain self-tolerance and limit collateral tissue damage during anti-microbial&#xD;
      immune responses, can be co-opted by cancer to evade immune destruction. A plethora of&#xD;
      regulatory molecules have been identified. Among them, three have been studied most&#xD;
      intensively: cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) binding to CD80 or CD86, programmed&#xD;
      cell death protein 1 (PD-1) binding to PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) or PD-L2, and SIRPαbinding to&#xD;
      CD47. Agents inhibiting CTLA-4, PD1, PD-L1 and CD47 are showing compelling antitumor activity&#xD;
      in several solid and hematological cancers. Exploring the role of immune checkpoint pathways&#xD;
      in CNSL may help us to establish the rational targeted therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will investigate the protein expression of several specific&#xD;
      molecules in immune checkpoint pathways such as PD-L1, PD-L2 and CD47 in the large&#xD;
      neurological resection specimens by immunohistochemical staining of patients with CNSL.&#xD;
      Besides, the concentrations of above molecules and other prognostic relevant factors such as&#xD;
      chemokine CXCL13, Interleukin-10 and soluble CD19 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at initial&#xD;
      diagnosis and after treatment will be evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.&#xD;
      About 100 patients with CNSL will be recruited. The protein expression of the above molecules&#xD;
      will be correlated with the clinical outcome of patients with CNSL. The feasibility of&#xD;
      adopting these CSF molecules as useful diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers in CNSL will also&#xD;
      be investigated.&#xD;

      Goal The goal and purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical implications and&#xD;
      functional roles of immune checkpoint pathways in CNSL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The adoption of protein expression of immune checkpoint pathways (CTLA-4, PD-L1, PD-L2,&#xD;
           CD47) as a prognostic factor in patients with PCNSL. To fulfill this aim, the protein&#xD;
           expression of CTLA-4, PD-L1, PD-L2, and CD47 in the neurosurgical resection specimens of&#xD;
           patients with PCNSL will be evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) techniques. The&#xD;
           results will be correlated with clinical features and outcome of the patients with CNSL.&#xD;
           Once parameters for these tissues are established it will be possible to speculate about&#xD;
           the tumor grade, survival and response to treatment of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The feasibility of adopting CSF CTLA-4, PD-L1, PD-L2, and sCD47 as useful diagnostic and&#xD;
           prognostic biomarkers in patients with CNSL. To fulfill this aim, the concentrations of&#xD;
           CSF CTLA-4, PD-L1, PD-L2 and sCD47 will be evaluated at the timings of initial diagnosis&#xD;
           and after each cycle of systemic chemotherapy by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays&#xD;
           (ELISAs). The concentrations of these CSF molecules at initial diagnosis will be&#xD;
           correlated with the prognosis of patients with CNSL. Besides, the investigators will&#xD;
           compare the serial follow-up concentrations of these markers after each cycle of&#xD;
           systemic chemotherapy to find out whether the presence of decreased concentrations will&#xD;
           response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This may help to discovery new diagnostic, prognostic and potential therapeutic strategies&#xD;
      for patients with CNSL.&#xD;
