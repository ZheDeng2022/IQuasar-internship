    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well bendamustine and rituximab in combination with copanlisib work in&#xD;
      treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. Drugs used&#xD;
      in chemotherapy, such as bendamustine and rituximab, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Copanlisib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some&#xD;
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving bendamustine and rituximab with copanlisib may&#xD;
      work better than bendamustine and rituximab alone in treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia or&#xD;
      small lymphocytic lymphoma.&#xD;

      This is a dose de-escalation study of copanlisib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive copanlisib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 or days 1 and&#xD;
      15 (depending on dose level). Patients also receive rituximab IV on day 1 and bendamustine IV&#xD;
      on days 1 and 2 of cycles 1-4. Patients who achieve at least a partial response&#xD;
      (MRD-positive) continue on treatment for 2 additional cycles. Treatment repeats every 28 days&#xD;
      for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning&#xD;
      cycle 7, patients receive copanlisib IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 15 for an additional 6&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 14 days, then periodically&#xD;
      for up to 3 years.&#xD;
