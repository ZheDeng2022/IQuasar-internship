  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a clinical study on the safety, efficacy and I phase of single center, single&#xD;
      arm, open-dose climbing, intravenous infusion of Anti- Epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR)&#xD;
      Chimeric Antigen Receptor(CAR) T cells modified by C-X-C Chemokine receptor type 5(CXCR 5) in&#xD;
      patients with advanced adult non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the dose(number of cells by body weight) and time of infusion should be&#xD;
      recorded in detail according to the dosage of slope climbing and single infusion. The safety&#xD;
      of chimeric antigen receptor T(CAR-T) cells treatment was evaluated by observing the adverse&#xD;
      events after cell therapy. The effectiveness of CAR-T treatment was initially assessed&#xD;
      compared with the results of the patient's own previous standard treatment plan. Blood was&#xD;
      collected before and within 12 months after infusion to detect the number and activity of&#xD;
      CAR-T cells and evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of CAR-T cells.&#xD;
