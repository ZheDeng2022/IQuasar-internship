  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will complete a 49-day, multi-phase feeding study to evaluate the effect of pea&#xD;
      fiber supplementation on gut community structure and features of host biological state&#xD;
      (plasma proteome/ metabolome). Subjects will be asked to continue to consume their habitual&#xD;
      diet (free diet phase) for 4 days prior to being provided with a diet high in saturated fat&#xD;
      (HiSF) and low in fruits and vegetables (LoFV) in the form of packed-out meals and snacks to&#xD;
      consume for the following 45 days. Ten days after starting to consume the HiSF-LoFV diet,&#xD;
      subjects will supplement their diet with pea fiber for a total of 21 days; the energy&#xD;
      contribution from the HiSF-LoFV diet will be reduced accordingly to maintain energy needs&#xD;
      during this time. After completing the pea fiber supplementation phase of the study subjects&#xD;
      will revert back to consuming the HiSF-LoFV only diet for the final 14 days. Stool, urine and&#xD;
      blood will be sampled periodically throughout.&#xD;
