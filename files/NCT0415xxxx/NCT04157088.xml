  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers in this study want to compare the effects of drug darolutamide and drug&#xD;
      enzalutamide on physical function, including balance and daily activity, in patients with&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Both darolutamide and enzalutamide are approved&#xD;
      AR inhibitors used for the treatment of patients with CRPC. AR inhibitor is a substance that&#xD;
      keeps androgens (male sex hormones) from binding to proteins called androgen receptors, which&#xD;
      are found in normal prostate cells, some prostate cancer cells, and in some other cells.&#xD;
      Preventing this binding blocks the effects of these hormones in the body and therefore keeps&#xD;
      prostate cancer cells from growing. Patients participating this study will receive either&#xD;
      darolutamide or enzalutamide tablets. To evaluate the physical function, patients will be&#xD;
      asked to make some movements like rising from a chair, walking three meters, etc.&#xD;
      Additionally, researchers also want to find out the survival of patients and if patients have&#xD;
      fatigue (feeling tired), cognitive (learning and thinking) problems, or other medical&#xD;
      problems during the trial. Brand name of darolutamide is Nubeqa; brand name of enzalutamide&#xD;
      is Xtandi.&#xD;
