      1. Investigators will determine the feasibility of a virtual reality pain control program&#xD;
           (VR-PCP) as a non-pharmacologic adjunct for pain management while in the hospital (i.e.&#xD;
           patient ability and willingness to use the system measured by average time spent on the&#xD;
           device).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigators will evaluate if there is a difference between the average daily use of&#xD;
           opioid medications taken by patients who received usual care pain management versus&#xD;
           patients using a VR-PCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigators will assess for differences in short-term postoperative patient-reported&#xD;
           pain intensity (PROMIS Patient Intensity v1.0) for patients who received usual care pain&#xD;
           management versus those who also have access to a VR-PCP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Orthopedic surgeons rank third amongst physician prescribers of opioids to adults in the&#xD;
      United States4. The deleterious effects of the opioid epidemic have been well studied at both&#xD;
      the individual and population level.2 3 Orthopaedic trauma patients in particular have high&#xD;
      rates of psychological stress and disability related to protracted narcotic usage 5. However,&#xD;
      opioid medications may not need to be the mainstay of pharmacologic pain management for&#xD;
      patients with orthopaedic injuries. For example, one recent study from the Netherlands showed&#xD;
      that 82% of patients with ankle fractures treated in the United States were prescribed&#xD;
      opioids at discharge, whereas only 6% of Dutch patients were given narcotics. 6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-pharmacologic interventions for pain management in the acute orthopaedic injury setting&#xD;
      deserve full investigation. Virtual reality for pain management has been used in burn&#xD;
      patients, pediatric patients, for procedures under local anesthesia and in the chronic pain&#xD;
      setting. Results of these investigations are promising and demonstrate reduced narcotic usage&#xD;
      and improved pain scores.7 8 9 Currently, there are no published reports on the use of&#xD;
      virtual reality for pain management in the orthopaedic literature. By investigating VR as a&#xD;
      non-pharmacologic intervention for pain, orthopaedic trauma patients may be able to avoid the&#xD;
      known risks of narcotic medication while still controlling their pain and regaining function&#xD;
      after their injury. Our study will lay groundwork for longer-term studies to evaluate the&#xD;
      impact of virtual reality on functional outcomes, opioid usage after hospital discharge and&#xD;
      patient satisfaction scores. VR can also be investigated for post-operative pain control&#xD;
      across other orthopedic subspecialties.&#xD;
