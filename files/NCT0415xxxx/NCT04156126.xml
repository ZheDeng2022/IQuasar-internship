      Pregnancy is a unique period which requires alterations in the immune system to allow for&#xD;
      tolerance of a haploidentical fetus. The goal of this study is to measure maternal blood&#xD;
      levels of proteins known to promote immune tolerance in early implantation and pregnancy to&#xD;
      look for associations between tolerance, miscarriage and failed embryo transfer. Establishing&#xD;
      predictive factors of miscarriage and failed in vitro fertilization could have implications&#xD;
      for a large portion of couples and serve to guide current and future family planning efforts.&#xD;

      There is increasing evidence of the importance of T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-containing&#xD;
      protein 3 (Tim-3) in suppressing allograft rejection, and thus it is hypothesized to play a&#xD;
      role in pregnancy. Galectin-9 (Gal-9) is a ligand for Tim-3 activation which promotes Th1&#xD;
      apoptosis signaling. Activation of Tim-3 by Gal-9 has also been shown to suppress NK cell&#xD;
      cytotoxicity at the maternal-fetal interface. Previous studies have evaluated Tim-3&#xD;
      expression on NK cells in the first trimester and found in comparison to normal pregnancies,&#xD;
      patients with recurrent miscarriage had decreased Tim-3 expression and less anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokine production. In a mouse model, transfer of Tim-3 expressing NK cells reduced&#xD;
      miscarriage rates. During the first trimester, Gal-9 levels increase and remain elevated&#xD;
      throughout pregnancy. Preliminary data in a small population of patients who had miscarriages&#xD;
      were found to have significantly lower Gal-9 levels detected at 8 weeks gestation compared to&#xD;
      those who continued on to have a term pregnancy. Additionally there is evidence that Gal-9&#xD;
      increases production of interleukin (IL-4), and in patients with recurrent miscarriage IL-4&#xD;
      levels are decreased [5]. These identifications have prompted further investigation into&#xD;
      predictive value of Gal-9 and IL-4 levels in early pregnancy on the outcome of a pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF), have been shown to&#xD;
      have a critical role in pregnancy at both the local and systemic level. Locally, CD56+&#xD;
      uterine natural killer cells within the endometrium express higher levels of VEGF in women&#xD;
      with recurrent miscarriage versus women with proven fertility. Histological differences in&#xD;
      VEGF expression and placental vascular bed patterns have been observed in tissue from&#xD;
      patients with a miscarriage compared to women with a viable pregnancy. Serum VEGF levels are&#xD;
      significantly different in patients with recurrent pregnancy loss than in women with proven&#xD;
      fertility [8]. Serum VEGF levels, including VEGF-A, -C, and -D, are significantly higher at 8&#xD;
      weeks gestation in pregnancies that result in a spontaneous loss compared to pregnancies that&#xD;
      go on to result in a live birth. Therefore, additional studies are needed to establish if&#xD;
      early first trimester serum levels of VEGFs, Gal-9, and IL-4 are significantly different in&#xD;
      pregnancies that result in miscarriage or live birth. Miscarriage affects approximately&#xD;
      15-20% of pregnancies. Therefore, establishing predictive factors of miscarriage could have&#xD;
      implications for a large portion of couples and could serve to guide current and future&#xD;
      family planning efforts. It is, essential to gain an understanding of mechanisms underlying&#xD;
      infertility and miscarriage, so that more effective treatments and protocols can be&#xD;
      developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis states low levels of Gal-9 and IL-4, and high levels of VEGF at the time&#xD;
      of embryo transfer will be predictive of failed embryo transfer and spontaneous miscarriage.&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the maternal blood levels of galectin-9, IL-4 and VEGF-A,-C,-D on the&#xD;
      day of embryo transfer in cycles that result in live birth versus no live birth, or that&#xD;
      result in miscarriage compared to live birth.&#xD;
