  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to assess differences in the microbiome between women with&#xD;
      and without endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second goal of this study is to assess immunologic differences between the eutopic (within&#xD;
      the uterus) and ectopic (outside of the uterus) endometrial tissue in women with&#xD;
      endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to investigate these areas of interest, 25 women with endometriosis and 25 women&#xD;
      without endometriosis will be enrolled. All women will be undergoing a previously scheduled&#xD;
      surgical procedure at which time presence or absence of endometriosis will be confirmed and&#xD;
      specimens will be obtained.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a chronic gynecologic condition where implants of endometrial glands and&#xD;
      stroma are present outside of the uterus. It occurs in 6-10% of women of reproductive age and&#xD;
      is characterized by dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, or infertility. In&#xD;
      addition to symptom burden, there are significant direct costs related to diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of disease, as well as indirect costs related to absenteeism from school and work,&#xD;
      loss of productivity, and unemployment. The estimated national economic burden in the United&#xD;
      States related to these costs is approximately 78 billion dollars per year. While clinical&#xD;
      signs and symptoms may be suggestive of endometriosis, the gold standard for diagnosis&#xD;
      requires surgical confirmation of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of endometriosis is complex and likely multifactorial with genetic,&#xD;
      epigenetic, environmental, and immunologic factors. An increasing number of studies have also&#xD;
      suggested the role of the microbiome in human health and development of disease. This study&#xD;
      aims to investigate possible differences in the microbiome and immunologic factors that could&#xD;
      contribute to pathogenesis of this disease. Findings from this study could potentially&#xD;
      contribute to the development of of a less invasive, non-surgical diagnostic test for&#xD;
      endometriosis.&#xD;
