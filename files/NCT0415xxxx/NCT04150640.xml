      This is an open label, phase II, multi-site trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      combination of 5-FU, oxaliplatin and nal-IRI (plus trastuzumab for HER2-positive tumors) as&#xD;
      first-line therapy for participants with advanced Esophageal and Gastric Adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      (EGA). The investigators hypothesize that this drug combination will be better tolerated than&#xD;
      current first-line chemotherapy combinations for this disease.&#xD;

      This is an open label, phase II, multi-site trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      combination of 5-FU, oxaliplatin and nal-IRI (plus trastuzumab for HER2-positive tumors) as&#xD;
      first-line therapy for participants with advanced Esophageal and Gastric Adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      (EGA). Participants in Cohort 1 will receive 5-FU, oxaliplatin and nal-IRI. Participants in&#xD;
      Cohort 2 will receive trastuzumab in addition to 5-FU, oxaliplatin and nal-IRI. Chemotherapy&#xD;
      doses will be the same for both cohorts and will follow the same dose modifications for&#xD;
      toxicities. Nal-IRI will be administered first. 5-FU and Oxaliplatin and trastuzumab will be&#xD;
      administered after nal-IRA as per institutional standards when similar regimens (such as&#xD;
      FOLFIRINOX) are administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1 (HER2-negative tumors): Initially, 13 evaluable participants will be accrued to&#xD;
      Cohort 1. If at most 5 objective responses are observed among the 13 subjects, then the study&#xD;
      will be terminated early due to an unacceptably low response rate. Otherwise, an additional&#xD;
      15 evaluable participants will be enrolled in the second stage for a total of 28 evaluable&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2 (HER2-positive tumors): A total of 6 subjects will be enrolled to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of the proposed 5-Fluorouracil, Oxaliplatin and liposomal Irinotecan&#xD;
      combination in HER2-positive subjects.&#xD;

    <measure>Cohort 1: Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>ORR will be calculated by combining the number of participants who achieve complete response and partial response per RECIST 1.1 criteria, from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the start of treatment). An ORR of 40% or less for proposed combination of 5-Fluorouracil, Oxaliplatin and nal-IRI during 1st line treatment of advanced esophageal and gastric adenocarcinoma in HER2-negative subjects will be considered as unacceptably low. The number and frequencies of objectives responses will be summarized in tabular format. The ORR will be reported along with the corresponding one-sided 90% confidence intervals.</description>

    <measure>Cohort 2: Incidence of Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of cohort 2 (HER2-positive EGA) is to evaluate safety and tolerability of the studied drug combination. Toxicities and adverse events will be summarized by type and severity in tabular format.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS will be defined from the date study enrollment to the date of progression event or death. If a participant does not experience a progression event at the end of the follow-up period, then the PFS will be censored at the last assessment date. PFS will be analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Median PFS will be reported along with the corresponding 90% confidence interval which will be constructed using the nonparametric Brookmeyer-Crooley method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control Rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The DCR is the proportion of all participants with stable disease (SD) for 8 weeks, or partial response (PR), or complete response (CR) according to RECIST 1.1, from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the start of treatment).DCR will be reported along with the corresponding 90% confidence intervals which will be constructed using the Wilson score method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS will be defined from the date study enrollment to the date of progression event or death. If a participant does not experience a progression event at the end of the follow-up period, then the PFS will be censored at the last assessment date. PFS will be analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Median PFS will be reported along with the corresponding 90% confidence interval which will be constructed using the nonparametric Brookmeyer-Crooley method.</description>

    <description>PFS will be defined from the date study enrollment to the date of progression event or death. If a participant does not experience a progression event at the end of the follow-up period, then the PFS will be censored at the last assessment date. PFS will be analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.
