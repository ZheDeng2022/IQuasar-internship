  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication of malignancies, in particular to lung&#xD;
      cancer. Patients with lung cancer in surgical and medical departments are at high risk of VTE&#xD;
      development. Prophylaxis is one major way to to prevent it. Currently, VTE prophylaxis is&#xD;
      mainly based on VTE-risk assessment. However, all patients hospitalized for cancer are at&#xD;
      intermediate or high risk of VTE but their bleeding risk vary. To improve effect of VTE&#xD;
      prophylaxis and reduce bleeding events in patients with lung cancer, we will conduct an&#xD;
      open-label parallel randomized clinical tria to assess the effect of bleeding risk based&#xD;
      prophylaxis strategy among lung cancer patients. We hypothesize that VTE prophylaxis based on&#xD;
      bleeding risk assessment with a short post-discharge treatment course is superior to VTE&#xD;
      propohylaxis based on VTE risk assessment among hospitalized patients with lung cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of 3200 eligible patients will be randomized into experimental or control group with&#xD;
      an allocation rate of 1:1. Stratified by medical/surgical units, block randomization with a&#xD;
      varying block size of 4 or 6 will be adopted to randomize patients into experimental or&#xD;
      control group. In experimental group, patients will undergo bleeding risk assessment and&#xD;
      receive prophylaxis according to bleeding risk during hospitalization, and they will also&#xD;
      receive an extended pharmacological prophylaxis of 5mg Rivaroxaban once daily for up to 15&#xD;
      consecutive days after discharge. In control group, patients will receive routine VTE&#xD;
      prophylaxis, VTE risk assessment and prophylaxis if indicated during hospitalization&#xD;
      according to current policies for hospitals in China but no further treatment prophylaxis&#xD;
      after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both groups will be followed up for 30 days. The primary outcome is symptomatic&#xD;
      and asymptomatic objectively proven VTE (deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism&#xD;
      (PE)) within 30 days after initiation of randomization. Ultrasound and CTPA will be performed&#xD;
      to detect DVT and PE, respectively. Clinically relevant bleeding (non-major clinically&#xD;
      relevant and major bleeding, HIT) and death are secondary outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomization and sequence generation A computerized random-number generator will be used to&#xD;
      generate the allocation sequence. In this multicenter trial involving 10 hospitals,&#xD;
      randomization procedures will be organized centrally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratified block randomization with a varying block size of 4 or 6 will be used to allocate&#xD;
      patients into experimental or control group. Patients with lung cancer will be stratified&#xD;
      into those under planned medical or surgical treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each stratum, patients will be blocked according to their admission sequence. Four or six&#xD;
      patients consecutively admitted will be one block depending on the block size. In each block,&#xD;
      patients will be randomly allocated into experimental or control group according to sequence&#xD;
      generated in advance by software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation concealment/Blinded randomization Patient assignments will be enclosed in a&#xD;
      sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes (SNOSE). Clinicians in charge of patient&#xD;
      enrollment will not know the allocation sequence until eligible patients who meet inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria are enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent statistician will generate the random allocation sequence. Physicians will&#xD;
      enroll participants and assign interventions in experimental or control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding/Open label This is an open-label trial that patients, clinicians and researchers&#xD;
      will know allocation assignments after enrollment. But imaging experts providing the duplex&#xD;
      ultrasound and CTPA results will be blinded in order to objectively assess the 30-day&#xD;
      CTPA-proven VTE incidence and other outcomes in both groups. An independent data monitoring&#xD;
      board will evaluate the trial data and safety.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will undergo a bleeding risk assessment to determine their entering VTE prophylaxis. Low bleeding risk patients will have once daily sc LMWH prophylaxis. Intermediate bleeding risk patients will have q 12 h sc low dose unfractionated heparin prophylaxis. High bleeding risk patients will have mechanical prophylaxis. Assigned prophylaxis can be interrupted as clinical judgement requires, e.g., for peri-procedural reasons. When patients are discharged, if they have low risk of bleeding at the time of discharge, whatever their bleeding risk assessment at the time of randomization, will begin 5 mg rivaroxaban prophylaxis (two 2.5 mg tablets) once daily with food, starting on the day of discharge, for 15 days.</description>
