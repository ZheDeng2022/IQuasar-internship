  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Double-blind, randomized, 3 group in situ study to assess effect of three toothpastes on&#xD;
      enamel remineralization, as measured by change in integrated mineral loss (∆∆Z). The study&#xD;
      will examine the efficacy of an experimental sodium monofluorophosphate (SMFP) toothpaste, a&#xD;
      standard SMFP toothpaste and a negative control toothpaste with no fluoride.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Double-blind, randomized, 3 group, in situ enamel remineralisation study. This study will&#xD;
      accept up to 60 adult subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria in anticipation that&#xD;
      at least 50 subjects will complete the study. All 60 subjects will have two human enamel&#xD;
      specimens (one enamel specimen type C and one enamel specimen type N) placed in their partial&#xD;
      denture for analysis by transverse microradiography (TMR) and of those sixty subjects, a&#xD;
      subset will have an additional two enamel specimens (type N) placed in their partial denture&#xD;
      for TMR measurement. All enamel specimens will have been partially demineralized using lactic&#xD;
      acid in the laboratory prior to placement in subjects' dentures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a dental prophylaxis at the start of the trial and then brush their&#xD;
      teeth with a fluoride-free toothpaste for the following 2 to 3 days. For the washout phase&#xD;
      between each crossover period, subjects will return to brushing with their regular toothpaste&#xD;
      for 4 to 5 days and then receive a dental prophylaxis and brush their teeth with a&#xD;
      fluoride-free toothpaste for the 2 to 3 days before the next test period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each test period, subjects will be asked to brush with their allocated toothpaste at&#xD;
      home twice daily for 4 weeks taking care to not brush the enamel specimens. The brushing&#xD;
      procedure will be performed at home each morning following breakfast and right before going&#xD;
      to bed on each evening. Subjects must wear their partial denture for 24 hours a day during&#xD;
      the test phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At final visit of each test period, subjects will be instructed to brush their teeth with the&#xD;
      randomly assigned trial toothpaste. Enamel specimens will be removed from denture and&#xD;
      transferred to analyst for laboratory analyses.&#xD;

        Key Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Be wearing a removable mandibular partial denture that fits comfortably enough to wear&#xD;
             24 hours a day and willing to have their partial denture modified to accommodate the&#xD;
             enamel test specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have completed and been accepted into the Oral Health Research Institute's screening&#xD;
             for partial denture panel (#110007150).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have no current active caries or periodontal disease that may compromise the trial or&#xD;
             health of the person. Persons exhibiting localized periodontal conditions who, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the trial dentist, will not be negatively affected by participation in&#xD;
             intra-oral studies may be accepted. Persons with caries may participate if the carious&#xD;
             lesions have been restored prior to beginning the first treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Be willing to comply with all subjects' responsibilities (be willing and capable of&#xD;
             wearing their removable partial dentures 24 hours per day during the treatment&#xD;
             periods, attend appointments, follow brushing instructions, use non zinc adhesive in&#xD;
             upper denture only etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have an unstimulated salivary flow rate of at least 0.2 ml per minute as determined by&#xD;
             a five-minute salivary flow test at screening and a stimulated salivary flow rate of&#xD;
             at least 0.8 ml per minute as determined by a two-minute stimulated (gum base)&#xD;
             salivary flow test at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        Key Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Currently pregnant, intending to become pregnant during the trial period or&#xD;
             breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have a history of significant adverse effects following use of oral hygiene products&#xD;
             such as toothpastes and mouth rinses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have any allergy to ingredients in the trial toothpaste products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Currently be taking antibiotics or have taken antibiotics in the two weeks prior to&#xD;
             the beginning the first treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have factors which could contraindicate their participation, such as any condition&#xD;
             requiring the need for antibiotic premedication prior to a dental treatment, a&#xD;
             condition requiring the need for long-term antibiotic use, blood thinning medications*&#xD;
             that prohibit the safe conduct of a dental cleaning* or previous use of the weight&#xD;
             loss medications Fen Phen® or Redux®. *Note: Subjects who are taking blood thinners in&#xD;
             which written verification is obtained from their physician indicating their PT/INR&#xD;
             levels (anti-coagulation blood levels) are at an acceptable level to avoid serious&#xD;
             complications, such as bleeding during dental cleaning, may be accepted into the&#xD;
             trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Currently taking or have ever taken a bisphosphonate drug (i.e. Fosamax®, Actonel®,&#xD;
             Boniva®, Reclast®, or Zometa®) for treatment of osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Currently taking fluoride supplements, required to use a fluoride mouth rinse or have&#xD;
             received a professional fluoride treatment in the two weeks preceding specimen&#xD;
             placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Participation in another clinical trial/study within 30 days preceding the present&#xD;
             trial/study.&#xD;
