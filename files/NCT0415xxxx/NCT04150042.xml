    <textblock>
      The clinical trial is a phase 1, single-arm trial that will evaluate the safety of the&#xD;
      investigational treatment on pancreatic cancer in patients who have an inherited, deleterious&#xD;
      BRCA1 or BRCA2 genetic alteration. The investigational treatment will involve 2 cycles of a&#xD;
      combination of intravenous melphalan, BCNU, low-dose I.V. ethanol, vitamin B12b, and vitamin&#xD;
      C in association with autologous hematopoietic stem cell infusion. A dose-escalation schedule&#xD;
      will be employed for vitamin C&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the current clinical trial, participants with BRCA-related metastatic pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      will receive a combination of melphalan, BCNU, low-dose ethanol, vitamin B12b, and vitamin C&#xD;
      in conjunction with autologous stem cell infusion. The drug combination is designed to&#xD;
      address multiple mechanisms of melphalan resistance. The purpose of the ethanol is the&#xD;
      protection of RBC catalase activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Treatment Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hematopoietic Stem Cell Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and if needed Plerixafor, will be used to&#xD;
                mobilize bone marrow stem cells, which will be collected by apheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. At least 2 bags of CD34+ cells, each containing at least 2 × 10^6 cells/kg, will be&#xD;
                prepared and stored.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells will only occur prior to the first cycle&#xD;
                of investigational therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. If there is not a sufficient mobilization of stem cells for at least 2 cycles of&#xD;
                chemotherapy, then no investigational drugs will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigational Drug Therapy and Stem Cell Infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. All subjects will receive two cycles of investigational drug therapy with stem cell&#xD;
                infusion unless precluded by adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Subjects will receive on day -2:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. BCNU (150 mg/m^2 I.V.).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Melphalan (100 mg/m^2 I.V.).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. Vitamin B12b (1450 mg/m^2 I.V.).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  4. Vitamin C (a dose-escalation schedule will be employed beginning with 3 g/m^2&#xD;
                     I.V. and escalating to a maximum of 8 g/m^2 I.V.).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  5. Ethanol (3.5 g/m^2 I.V. as cosolvent with the BCNU infusion, followed by 0.5&#xD;
                     g/h I.V. for 23 h).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. On day 0, at least 2 × 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg will be infused as per the institution's&#xD;
                standard procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Subjects will receive supportive care as per the institution's standard procedures&#xD;
                before, during, and after the investigational drug therapy and stem cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional Cycles a. Subjects will receive a second cycle of the investigational&#xD;
           treatment described immediately above in &quot;Investigational Drug Therapy and Stem Cell&#xD;
           Infusion,&quot; with an interval of approximately 6 weeks between cycles.&#xD;

             from prior chemotherapy are still potentially eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No chemotherapy within 2 weeks of enrollment.&#xD;
