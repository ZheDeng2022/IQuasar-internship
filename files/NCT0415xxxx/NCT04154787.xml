        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female or male adult (≥18 years) subjects at screening visit with a diagnosis of&#xD;
             idiopathic (primary) MN confirmed by renal biopsy within 24 months prior to screening.&#xD;
             A renal biopsy may be taken at any time during the run-in period to confirm the&#xD;
             diagnosis of MN and facilitate subject eligibility, if the most recent biopsy was&#xD;
             performed greater than 24 months prior to the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anti-PLA2R antibody titer of ≥ 60 RU/mL at screening visit. If sites opt to use a&#xD;
             local laboratory, with prior agreement with sponsor, an anti-PLA2R titer performed&#xD;
             within 4 weeks prior to screening visit can be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Urine protein ≥ 3.5 g/24h at screening and baseline visits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≤50% reduction in both anti-PLA2R level and 24h urine protein between screening and&#xD;
             baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Estimated GFR (using the CKD-EPI formula) ≥ 30 mL/min per 1.73 m2 at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving stable dose at the maximum recommended dose according to local guidelines or&#xD;
             maximum tolerated dose of ACEi and/or ARB and/or statins and/or diuretics for at least&#xD;
             8 weeks prior to Day 1&#xD;

             malignancies, infections or chronic intake of drugs (e.g. gold salts, NSAIDs,&#xD;
             penicillamines)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnostic renal biopsy showing evidence of crescent formation in glomeruli,&#xD;
             suggestive of an alternative or additional diagnosis to primary idiopathic MN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous treatment with B-cell depleting or B-cell modifying agents such as, but not&#xD;

             chlorambucil, mycophenolate mofetil (or equivalent), cyclosporine, tacrolimus or&#xD;
             azathioprine within 90 days prior to Day 1. Low dose systemic corticosteroid therapy&#xD;
             is permitted, though the subject should have been on stable dose equivalent to ≤10 mg&#xD;
             prednisolone for at least 90 days prior to Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous treatment with gemfibrozil or strong CYP2C8 inhibitors such as clopidogrel&#xD;
             within 7 days prior to Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence or suspicion (based on judgment of the investigator) of active infection&#xD;
             within 30 days prior to Day 1, or history of severe recurrent bacterial infections&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known contra-indications for the use of rituximab, including hypersensitivity to the&#xD;
             active substance or to murine proteins, or to any of the excipients (sodium citrate,&#xD;
             polysorbate 80, sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, water for&#xD;
             injections). Other contra-indications for the use of rituximab, including active,&#xD;
             severe infection, patients in a severely immunocompromised state, severe heart failure&#xD;
             (NYHA Class IV) or severe, uncontrolled cardiac disease.&#xD;
