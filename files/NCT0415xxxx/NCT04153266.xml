    <textblock>
      Background: Oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) is a condition with an increased risk of oral&#xD;
      cancer. Due to the current changes in the factors associated with these diseases (because of&#xD;
      human papillomavirus), it is expected that those who have no history of smoking or alcohol,&#xD;
      young (&lt;50 years old), and white male would be commonly affected. Those individuals require a&#xD;
      higher need for information, preferred a more active role in decision-making, and have a&#xD;
      longer lifespan than older individuals. There remain no detailed studies of whether the&#xD;
      informational needs delivered to patients with OED met their needs or indeed what information&#xD;
      such patient may wish. A few tools are available to evaluate the IN of patients with head and&#xD;
      neck disorders. However, the items of these instruments were dedicated to a particular&#xD;
      disease (e.g. cancer) and hence are not applicable to be used for OED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project aims: To evaluate the psychometric properties of the Oral Epithelial Dysplasia&#xD;
      Informational Needs Questionnaire (ODIN-Q), developed and revised in the preliminary work for&#xD;
      the proposed study, in a cohort of patients with OED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timescale: 19 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical significance: This questionnaire can be useful in clinical practice. It could help&#xD;
      to meet the patient's information needs and plan educational interventions for those showing&#xD;
      unmet needs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) is a disease associated with an increased risk of oral cancer&#xD;
      between 6% and 36% compared to disease-free individuals. In the United Kingdom, oral cancer&#xD;
      is among the 15 most common cancers, with approximately 6,000 new cases per year and these&#xD;
      numbers are expected to rise in the few coming years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research showed the importance of patient education and the provision of information in&#xD;
      shared-decision making and management of chronic and cancer-linked disease such as perhaps&#xD;
      OED. However, patients may not be satisfied with the information provided by healthcare&#xD;
      professionals, despite the extensive nature of the information provided. Having unmet&#xD;
      informational needs may associate with higher anxiety levels which in turn could affect the&#xD;
      patient's well-being and cooperation with the treatment provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Avoiding these undesirable health outcomes requires the delivery of tailored and&#xD;
      patient-centred care that provides information based on what patients truly need and prefer.&#xD;
      One increasingly common method to do so is to obtain this information by informational needs&#xD;
      questionnaires. These questionnaires have been developed for other medical conditions&#xD;
      including chronic diseases and some cancers, but none of these is known to be appropriate to&#xD;
      use for OED specifically. Hence, a specific tool to determine the informational needs and&#xD;
      preferences of patients with OED may help to achieve these objectives effectively. The data&#xD;
      collected by this tool may help to acknowledge the impact of the illness on physical and&#xD;
      psychological well-being. Furthermore, this data could be used to produce a source of OED&#xD;
      information (such as a patient information leaflet) that reflects the IN of this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the preliminary work for this study, the Oral Epithelial Dysplasia Informational Needs&#xD;
      Questionnaire (ODIN-Q) was developed by adopting existing valid and reliable instruments that&#xD;
      explore the information need of patients with potentially malignant disease elsewhere in the&#xD;
      body, using experts input. The questions were then formulated and tested for content validity&#xD;
      by clinicians (n=12) and patients (n=5), with unclear, irrelevant, redundant, and&#xD;
      unacceptable items omitted. The final 35-item ODIN-Q includes two scales: (1) amount of&#xD;
      information already received (too much, enough, not enough and none) and (2) degree of&#xD;
      importance of the information (very, yes, not very, not at all).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the objectives of this study are to (1) test the newly developed ODIN-Q in a cohort of&#xD;
      patients with OED; (2) to investigate the correlations between patients' informational needs&#xD;
      and both of psychological variables (e.g. anxiety and depression) and quality of life; and&#xD;
      (3) to develop and a Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) for OED based on patients' needs and&#xD;
      preferences.&#xD;
