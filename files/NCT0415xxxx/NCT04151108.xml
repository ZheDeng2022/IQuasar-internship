  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As humans age, there is a gradual loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength, termed&#xD;
      sarcopenia. The underlying causes of sarcopenia are yet not fully elucidated but are thought&#xD;
      to be multifactorial and include increased levels of systemic pro-inflammatory mediators, a&#xD;
      decrease in anabolic hormones and changes in the neuromuscular system. Furthermore, physical&#xD;
      inactivity, chronic diseases, immobilisation and hospitalisation are known to play an&#xD;
      important part in the development of sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of sarcopenia ranges from 20-30% (aged &gt;70yrs) within the general community.&#xD;
      However, the prevalence of sarcopenia in geriatric patients after an acute hospital admission&#xD;
      is substantially higher, estimated at â‰ˆ50%. Furthermore, successive events of hospitalisation&#xD;
      have been suggested to contribute to the development of sarcopenia, as even short periods&#xD;
      (4-5 days) of skeletal muscle disuse are known to induce muscle atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean length of hospital stay in geriatric wards due to acute illness or hip-fracture is&#xD;
      typically 7 to 11 days during which the level of physical activity is strongly reduced&#xD;
      leading to an accelerated loss of muscle mass that many older patients never recover from.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Notably, a substantial part of the deterioration in functional capacity could be avoided just&#xD;
      by counteracting loss of muscle mass during hospitalization. As such, we need to identify&#xD;
      sensitive biological, clinical and functional biomarkers predicting loss of muscle mass and&#xD;
      function during hospitalization to identify patients at risk of developing sarcopenia.&#xD;
      Additionally, it is crucial to investigate the association of these biomarkers with hospital&#xD;
      length of stay, as hospitalisation has been suggested to contribute to the development of&#xD;
      sarcopenia while longer hospital stays may increase patient risk of hospital-acquired&#xD;
      infections and place an economic burden on society.&#xD;
