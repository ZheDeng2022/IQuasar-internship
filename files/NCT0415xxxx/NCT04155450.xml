      Low back pain is one of the most common problem affecting one's daily living activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      McKenzie Method of Mechanical Diagnostic Therapy (MDT) is an appealing modality of treatment.&#xD;
      McKenzie classified the lumbar back pain into three categories i.e. lumbar postural syndrome,&#xD;
      lumbar dysfunction syndrome and lumbar derangement syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progressive extension bias limb loading exercises at lumbar region emphasizes on lumbar&#xD;
      extensor musculature. The purpose of the current study is to determine the effects of&#xD;
      extension biased lumbar limb loading exercises along with McKenzie extension protocols in the&#xD;
      management of patients with lumbar derangement syndrome, which will also be a cost effective&#xD;
      management option. It will also add to the existing pool of knowledge in the fields of&#xD;
      conservative low back pain treatment, physical therapy, orthopedic manual therapy and&#xD;
      musculoskeletal medicine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is one of the most common problem affecting one's daily living activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Back pain results from multifactorial etiology with anatomical, psychological, physiological&#xD;
      and social consequences and it is often classified as acute, sub-acute and chronic according&#xD;
      to pain duration. Upto 71% of people with acute low back pain in primary care report&#xD;
      persistent symptoms and therefore there is requirement for effective treatments in those who&#xD;
      have not recovered after acute phase. Therapeutic exercises, manual therapy, functional&#xD;
      training, modalities, traction, endurance training of back extensors, Kinesio-taping, trigger&#xD;
      point therapy, deep friction massage are some of the procedures being safely and effectively&#xD;
      applied by physical therapists to combat back discomfort or disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      McKenzie Method of Mechanical Diagnostic Therapy (MDT) approach was developed by Robin&#xD;
      McKenzie who was a physical therapist from New Zealand back in 1950s. MDT is an appealing&#xD;
      modality of treatment focusing on five areas of benefit-including reliable assessment, early&#xD;
      prognosis, self-treatment, better outcomes and prevention of recurrence. The evaluation also&#xD;
      determine who will get benefit from treatment and who will require another treatment&#xD;
      protocols. McKenzie classified the lumbar back pain into three categories i.e. lumbar&#xD;
      postural syndrome, lumbar dysfunction syndrome and lumbar derangement syndrome based on&#xD;
      symptomatic or mechanical responses observed during repeated lumbar end range movements. The&#xD;
      McKenzie Institute Lumbar Spine Assessment will be used to classify the patients into&#xD;
      different syndromes and to choose the desired one fulfilling the inclusion criteria of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When normal tissues are deformed over a prolonged period it ends with postural syndrome like&#xD;
      slouched posture and the postural syndrome may lead to dysfunction or derangement syndromes.&#xD;
      Deformation of structures and tissues that causes pain at end ranges of available motion is&#xD;
      characterized as dysfunction syndrome. Derangement syndrome is related to displacement of&#xD;
      intervertebral disc with or without involvement of radiating pattern of pain along with back&#xD;
      pain and fluctuations in symptoms or pain with directional movements can be observed due to&#xD;
      force changes on affected intervertebral disc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Centralizing and Peripherilizing are two important concepts with a strong association towards&#xD;
      derangement syndrome. Centralizing reveals that movements or loading moves the most distal&#xD;
      pain proximally while Peripherilizing shows movements or loading moves the pain more&#xD;
      distally. McKenzie lumbar extension exercises results in reduction, abolition or&#xD;
      centralization of symptoms. In Lumbar derangement syndromes following MDT classification&#xD;
      system, a subgroup in which symptoms improve with lumbar extension is labeled as posterior&#xD;
      derangement syndrome whereas the subgroup in which symptoms improve with lumbar flexion is&#xD;
      labeled as anterior derangement syndrome. Work of many researchers, like Peterson, Machado&#xD;
      and Paatelma, provided the strongest evidence regarding the validity of McKenzie method of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progressive limb loading exercises at lumbar region fall under two categories, one group&#xD;
      emphasis on abdominal musculature and the second group emphasize on lumbar extensor&#xD;
      musculature. Patient begins from quadruped position and progress towards prone position&#xD;
      initiating with low intensity training and progressing towards greater intensity along with&#xD;
      spinal compression in case of lumbar extensors. Progression towards prone position at the end&#xD;
      range of motion requires greater control of neutral spine thus providing excellent&#xD;
      stabilization of lumbar extensors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trial on McKenzie treatment approach in people with chronic low back&#xD;
      pain conducted by M.H Halliday et al. provide preliminary evidence that treatment effects of&#xD;
      McKenzie Exercises are greater when the core principles are followed with significant&#xD;
      reduction in pain and disability of 15.2 [95% CI 7.6 to 22.7] and 11.7 [95% CI 5.4 to18.0].&#xD;
      Srivastav et al. conducted a study at mechanical low back pain with significant improvement&#xD;
      having p&lt;0.05 at NPRS &amp; MODI after application of lumbar stabilization exercises along with&#xD;
      conventional physical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An international survey conducted in 15 different countries in 2019 regarding McKenzie&#xD;
      classification system involving 64.8% lumbar, 29.6% cervical, 5.6% thoracic spine of 750&#xD;
      patients fulfilling MDT criteria revealed 0.1% postural syndrome, 1.7% dysfunction syndrome,&#xD;
      75.4% derangement and 22.8% other. In derangement syndrome 82.5% were extension biased thus&#xD;
      Derangement is the most commonly encountered pain syndrome and extension is so far the most&#xD;
      common directional preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the help of this study the investigators can determine the effects of extension biased&#xD;
      lumbar limb loading exercises along with McKenzie extension protocols in the management of&#xD;
      patients with lumbar derangement syndrome, which will also be a cost effective management&#xD;
      option. It will add to the existing pool of knowledge in the fields of conservative spinal&#xD;
      management, physical therapy, orthopedic manual therapy and musculoskeletal medicine.&#xD;
