  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients aged 75 years and older, polypathology is frequent and often associated with&#xD;
      polypharmacy. This polypharmacy coupled with a lack of proactive elderly care can sometimes&#xD;
      lead to hospitalisation. Due to comorbidities and complex problems, management of geriatric&#xD;
      patients usually requires a multidisciplinary approach. In Toulouse University Hospital,&#xD;
      elderly inpatients can benefit from a geriatric assessment by a Geriatric Mobile Team.&#xD;
      Whether this team improve the prescriptions through the advice of a clinical pharmacist has&#xD;
      not been demonstrated yet.&#xD;

      All participants will be identified via the geriatrician of the mobile geriatric team with&#xD;
      the following inclusion criteria: age ≥ 75 years, ≥ 5 medications per day and being&#xD;
      hospitalised either in emergency room, short-stay medicine unit or in a surgery department.&#xD;
      For each patient, the pharmacist will detect potentially inappropriate prescribing (based on&#xD;
      explicit criteria and an implicit approach) and liaise with the geriatrician for drug&#xD;
      optimisations. The pharmaceutical advice will be added to the geriatrician's written report,&#xD;
      and then addressed to the relevant physician. The implementation of the proposals will be&#xD;
      evaluated immediately at the end of hospitalisation, and then reassessed three months later&#xD;
      by calling the patient and/or his community pharmacist. A total of 250 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled over a 12 month-period. The evolution of potentially inappropriate prescribing will&#xD;
      be assessed and their cost evaluated.&#xD;

Data collection on comorbidities, medication and laboratory results.&#xD;
A pharmacist's evaluation of the prescriptions based on the patient's conditions and on the current recommendations for clinical practice.&#xD;
A detailed feedback to the geriatrician.&#xD;
A written report addressed to the attending physician</description>
