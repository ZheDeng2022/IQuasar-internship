  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyper-vigilance, focusing, avoidance are part of the vocabulary used by the clinician who&#xD;
      deals with chronic pain. These notions refer to the functioning and dysfunction of so-called&#xD;
      &quot;selective&quot; attention. These &quot;selective attentional biases&quot; are believed to be responsible,&#xD;
      in part, for the development and maintenance of negative pain-related thoughts (such as&#xD;
      catastrophic thoughts), inappropriate behaviours (such as inactivity and fear of movement)&#xD;
      and unpleasant emotions (such as stress or anger). In addition, they would also be a powerful&#xD;
      indicator of the onset of post-operative pain and could limit the effectiveness of&#xD;
      therapeutic management. Therapeutically, attention bias can be &quot;managed&quot; through attentional&#xD;
      re-training techniques (ABMs) that teach patients to direct their attention differently.&#xD;
      These techniques have been widely validated in anxious or addictive populations but have&#xD;
      never been used to date in chronic pain patients. This home-based attention bias management&#xD;
      (e-retraining) would represent, for chronic pain patients, an additional tool aimed not only&#xD;
      at reducing their pain but also at achieving other associated factors such as anxiety,&#xD;
      stress, catastrophic thoughts, avoidance behaviours and quality of life.&#xD;

      After obtaining the patients' agreement, they will be randomized in one of the 3 experimental&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  G1: Attentional training to avoid threatening, negative or pain-related information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  G2: Attention training for vigilance for positive emotional information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  G3: neutral attentional training (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted from the patient's home via a connection to the protected site of&#xD;
      the Nantes University Hospital. The various questionnaires will be completed from the secure&#xD;
      site of the Nantes University Hospital and the computerized experimental tasks will be&#xD;
      carried out using the Inquisit software (WEB version at home).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will begin with an evaluation of the patients' attention and psychological&#xD;
      processes (completion of questionnaires + 2 attention tasks), during a follow-up visit to the&#xD;
      urology department of the University Hospital of Nantes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, an 8-week attentional re-training program (2 training sessions per week) will be&#xD;
      proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 8 weeks, an evaluation (Questionnaires + attention tasks) will be offered&#xD;
      to patients always from home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, a final evaluation, 4 weeks after the end of the re-training, will always be&#xD;
      proposed from the patient's home.&#xD;
