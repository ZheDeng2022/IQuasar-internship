    <textblock>
      Prospective study is to compare between different nephrolithometric scoring systems in&#xD;
      prediction of PCNL outcomes in terms of efficacy , success rate and safety in Adult patients&#xD;
      with UUT stones unilateral or bilateral, single or multiple, Pelvic or calyceal, primary or&#xD;
      recurrent, both gender attending Assuit Urology &amp; Nephrology University Hospital.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of urolithiasis is approximately 5% to 10% in the general population, In an&#xD;
      active urologic department, 30% of the surgical working load is known to be related to&#xD;
      treatment of renal and ureteral stones (1, 2). Since the original description of stone&#xD;
      removal through a percutaneous nephrostomy tract by Fernstrom and Johansson in 1976,&#xD;
      percutaneous stone removal has evolved into a highly developed procedure practiced by many&#xD;
      urologists (3). Several new techniques and technologies recently have emerged that simplified&#xD;
      the procedure, allowed to take on more challenging cases and made it safer and less painful&#xD;
      for patients (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nephrolithometric scoring systems have been introduced to overcome limitations for systematic&#xD;
      and quantitative assessment of the outcomes of PCNL. Moreover, preoperative patient&#xD;
      counselling necessitates the development of an integrated scoring system to assess PCNL&#xD;
      complexity for optimal decision-making Nephrolithometric scoring systems include the Guy's&#xD;
      Stone Score (5), S.T.O.N. E. (Stone Size, Tract length, Obstruction/hydronephrosis, Number of&#xD;
      involved calyces, Essence/Hounsfield units) nephrolithometry scoring system (6), The Clinical&#xD;
      Research Office of the Endourology Society (CROES) nomogram (7), and the Seoul National&#xD;
      University Renal Stone Complexity (S-ReSC) score (8,9). All these nephrolithometry scoring&#xD;
      systems (NLSS) aim for preoperative prediction of stone-free status (SFS) and complications&#xD;
      through assessment of the complexity of different cases undergoing PCNL. NLSS do not only&#xD;
      consider the imaging criteria of stones and renal anatomy, but also relevant patient&#xD;
      characteristics such as body mass index, previous renal surgery, and surgeon experience. The&#xD;
      Guy's Stone Score, S.T.O.N.E. nephrolithometry score and CROES nomogram consist of 11&#xD;
      variables, including four shared parameters (stone size, location, number, and staghorn&#xD;
      status). Other variables which are considered by these three NLSS are stone density, renal&#xD;
      anatomy, tract length, obstruction of renal pelvis, case load/year, prior treatment history,&#xD;
      and the presence of spina bifida or spinal injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Guy's Stone score categorises PCNL cases into four grades, increasing in complexity from&#xD;
      Grade 1 to Grade 4, depending on patients' past medical history and non-contrast CT (NCCT)&#xD;
      (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The S.T.O.N.E. nephrolithometry scoring system assesses PCNL complexity by nine different&#xD;
      possible scores, ranging from 5 to 13, according to five NCCT-calculated parameters including&#xD;
      stone size, tract length, obstruction/ hydronephrosis, number of involved calyces, Essence/&#xD;
      Hounsfield units (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      the CROES nephrolithometric nomogram predicts treatment success using plain X-ray of the&#xD;
      kidneys, ureters and bladder considering the stone burden, count, and location, in addition&#xD;
      to case volume and prior stone treatment (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total score to predict the chance of treatment success is the sum of individual scores&#xD;
      derived from each predicting variable; the higher the score, the higher the chance of&#xD;
      treatment success, while a patient with a low score has a low chance of achieving a SFS (7).&#xD;
      On the other hand, the S-ReSC score is calculated by counting the number of sites involved in&#xD;
      the renal pelvis and calyces, regardless of stone parameters or renal anatomy. This system&#xD;
      assigns a score from 1 to 9 depending mainly on the number of sites involved; the renal&#xD;
      pelvis (1), superior and inferior major calyces (2-3), anterior and posterior minor calyces&#xD;
      of the superior (4-5), middle (6-7), and inferior calyces (8-9).&#xD;
