  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects of ESK981 and nivolumab and to see how well they&#xD;
      work for the treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other&#xD;
      places in the body (metastatic). ESK981 is an investigational drug that targets several&#xD;
      important pathways that are believed to play a role in the spread of cancer. Immunotherapy&#xD;
      with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. This study is&#xD;
      being done to see if giving ESK981 and nivolumab together works better in treating metastatic&#xD;
      castration resistant prostate cancer compared to usual treatments.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the prostate specific antigen (PSA) &gt;= 50% response rate (PSA50) from&#xD;
      baseline using the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria to&#xD;
      pan-VEGFR/TIE2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor CEP-11981 (ESK981) plus nivolumab in men with&#xD;
      metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have progressed on enzalutamide&#xD;
      (an oral androgen-receptor inhibitor) and/or abiraterone acetate (an androgen synthesis&#xD;
      inhibitor) and chemotherapy (docetaxel and/or cabazitaxel).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the safety and tolerability of ESK981 plus nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the time to PSA response (TTPR) in patients with mCRPC. II. To determine the&#xD;
      duration of PSA response (PRD) in patients with mCRPC. III. To determine PSA progression&#xD;
      rates as defined by the PCWG3 criteria. IV. To determine PSA progression free survival (PPFS)&#xD;
      as defined by the PCWG3 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE/EXPLORATORY/TERTIARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess exploratory biomarkers from blood and tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ESK981 orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 5 consecutive days per week, followed&#xD;
      by a 2-day break. Patients also receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) on day 1 of each cycle.&#xD;
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 5 years.&#xD;
