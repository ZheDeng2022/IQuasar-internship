      Purpose: This early phase 2 clinical trial aims to evaluate the therapeutic effects and&#xD;
      safety of apatinib in radiation-induced brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further study details as provided by Sun Yet-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University /&#xD;

&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure: The proportion of patients with an objective response defined as ≥&#xD;
      25% reduction in brain edema volume on MR fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is high in China especially in southern&#xD;
      China. Radiotherapy is the mainstay of therapy for NPC and greatly improves patient survival.&#xD;
      Along with promising therapeutic effects, complications such as radiation dermatitis,&#xD;
      temporal lobe necrosis, cognitive impairment, and cranial nerve injury are also associated&#xD;
      with radiotherapy. Previously, corticosteroids were considered conventional treatment for&#xD;
      radiation-induced brain injury (RI). Unfortunately, only 20% patients with early phase RI&#xD;
      seem to benefit from corticosteroid treatment. Moreover, the long-term use of steroids is&#xD;
      associated with substantial adverse effects. Recently, bevacizumab, an anti-vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) recombinant monoclonal antibody, has been introduced as an&#xD;
      efficient treatment for RI. However, the risk of severe adverse effects to bevacizumab, e.g.&#xD;
      severe hypertension, proteinuria, nasopharyngeal necrosis and bleeding, limits its usage in&#xD;
      certain patients with RI. Apatinib mesylate tablet is an oral small molecule tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor (TKI), which can specifically bind to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2&#xD;
      (VEGFR-2) and strongly inhibit neovascularization. Apatinib is currently used as a third-line&#xD;
      treatment for advanced gastric cancer. Previous studies and clinical observation showed that&#xD;
      apatinib could significantly improve brain injury after radiation, reduce brain tissue&#xD;
      exudation and reduce edema. In this study, investigators will discuss the therapeutic effect&#xD;
      of apatinib on RI and evaluate its safety through a prospective phase II clinical trial. It&#xD;
      is hopeful to explore a new and effective method for the treatment of RI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives: The primary objective of this phase II, open-label, single-arm designed&#xD;
      clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in patients with RI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase II, open-label, single-arm designed clinical trial. Participants are&#xD;
      enrolled and administrated with oral apatinib mesylate tablet for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: Participants receive oral apatinib with a dosage of 250mg once daily for 4 weeks, in&#xD;
      the absence of unacceptable toxicity or severe deterioration.&#xD;
