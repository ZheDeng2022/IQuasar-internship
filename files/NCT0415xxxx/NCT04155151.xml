  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of using the 6 minute walk test (6MWT) as&#xD;
      a cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) screening tool. The screening would take place when the&#xD;
      patient attends the hospital for their initial surgical outpatient appointment. By screening&#xD;
      all potential major intra-abdominal surgery patients for a period of 6 months and recording&#xD;
      the distance walked in the 6 minutes (6MWD) the aim is to produce a threshold distance for&#xD;
      the patients of Sheffield that would identify those with sufficient CRF what would allow them&#xD;
      to proceed to surgery without further investigations or fitness interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having identified the fit it would allow the perioperative team to focus resources on the&#xD;
      less fit with the aim of improving CRF and other elements that would lead to reduced&#xD;
      postoperative morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other primary aims include noting the time to surgery. This data will inform on wither&#xD;
      instigation of the early screening test would facilitate enrolment and completion of an&#xD;
      exercise programme before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim is to assess the relationship between the 6MWD and routine CPET to confirm&#xD;
      if those that walk the furthest are in fact the fittest.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study that would run for a period of 6 months. The&#xD;
      population proceeding to undergo major abdominal surgery is estimated to be 500 patients a&#xD;
      year. The primary aim is to invite all patients being considered for major abdominal surgery&#xD;
      to participate in a simple screening test of fitness, the 6 minute walk test (6MWT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants would be identified by the participating surgical teams during their&#xD;
      first visit to this institutions Surgical Outpatient Department (SOPD). Upon identification&#xD;
      the individual would be provided with information designed to be read on returning to the&#xD;
      waiting area from the SOPD clinic room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study walker, who would be an appropriately trained research nurse or outpatient clinic&#xD;
      support worker, would approach the patient to answer questions and provide further&#xD;
      information if required. Consent for participation would then be obtained. The participating&#xD;
      individual would then be walked the short distance to the testing area and would be offered a&#xD;
      seat whilst the 6MWT procedure was explained in more detail. Time would be allowed for&#xD;
      questions. The 6MWT would be then conducted as per the American Thoracic Society guidance.&#xD;
      Heart rate will be recorded manually both at baseline and at the cessation of the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the 6MWT patients could either depart the hospital or return to the SOPD if it was&#xD;
      felt a period of recovery was required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 6 minute walk distance (6MWD) would be recorded against the patient's participant study&#xD;
      identification number. Patient identifiers that would link the patient study number to a&#xD;
      particular patient would be stored safely behind lock and key or encryption when electronic.&#xD;
      The case report forms will be paper to allow timely collection of data and this information&#xD;
      will be collated onto a spreadsheet which will facilitate future analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At a later date information will also be collected on date of operation, this will be used to&#xD;
      assess the present 'window' of opportunity for enrolling the less fit into an exercise&#xD;
      programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between the 6MWD and the&#xD;
      objectively measured anaerobic threshold and peak oxygen consumption that will be obtained&#xD;
      when some of these patients undergo cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) as part of their&#xD;
      standard pathway to surgery. Reports produced following CPET interpretation are stored as&#xD;
      PDFs upon this institutions server, named individuals involved in collecting data for this&#xD;
      study will have access to the this server to complete case report forms that require details&#xD;
      from the CPET reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be undertaken on the population that participates in the 6MWT,&#xD;
      the population will be split into quartiles based on what the investigators know about our&#xD;
      non-cardiopulmonary surgery population following analysis of our CPET database. Those deemed&#xD;
      significantly less fit occupied the lowest quartile. The aim would be to assess for&#xD;
      population normality and produce thresholds for the most fit; the greatest distance walked by&#xD;
      25% of the population with the least fit the lowest 25% of the population. The middle 50%&#xD;
      would be less fit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linear regression analysis will be used to determine the 6MWD threshold that correlates with&#xD;
      a level of anaerobic threshold or peak oxygen consumption objectively measured by CPET,&#xD;
      deemed acceptable and indicating those individuals for whom no further preoperative&#xD;
      interventions are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 12 months of 2017 the investigators undertook 483 preoperative major abdominal&#xD;
      surgery cardiopulmonary exercise (CPET) tests. The investigators anticipate collecting 6MWT&#xD;
      data on 250 patients and CPET data on at least 240 patients. Hopefully all those who undergo&#xD;
      CPET will have consented to undergo a 6MWT whilst in the SOPD during their first visit on&#xD;
      their pathway toward surgery.&#xD;
