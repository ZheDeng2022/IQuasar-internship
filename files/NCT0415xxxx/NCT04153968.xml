  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since no quantitative information currently exists on how effectively the pro-vitamin A&#xD;
      carotenoid (pVAC) β-cryptoxanthin (βCX) is converted to vitamin A (VA) in humans, this proof&#xD;
      of principle study aims to compare the efficacy of both βCX and β-carotene (βC) to yield VA&#xD;
      from biofortified maize. This data is critical before the breeding strategy for biofortified&#xD;
      maize is directed towards high βCX-containing varieties in order to reduce VA deficiency in&#xD;
      low-income countries.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in reducing vitamin A (VA) deficiency worldwide, the prevalence remains&#xD;
      highest and unchanged in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Efficacy studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that increasing provitamin A carotenoid (pVAC) intake through consuming pVAC&#xD;
      biofortified crops results in increased circulating β-carotene (βC) and VA body stores. It&#xD;
      has also been shown that consumption of biofortified maize improved VA total body stores&#xD;
      (TBS) as effectively as preformed VA supplementation, and significantly improved visual&#xD;
      function in marginally VA deficient children. Despite the fact that βC is the primary focus&#xD;
      of breeding programs for pVAC biofortified maize, there is convincing evidence that&#xD;
      comparable dietary intakes of βC and β-cryptoxanthin (βCX) would result in 7-fold greater&#xD;
      concentrations of βCX in blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to determine for the first time the bioefficacy of βCX in comparison to&#xD;
      βC in humans using state of the art isotope dilution techniques in combination with&#xD;
      compartmental modelling. The project is conducted in two phases: Phase 1) the determination&#xD;
      of best time points for assessment of βCX bioconversion, intestinal and postintestinal&#xD;
      bioefficacy as well as quantifying TBS of VA in healthy volunteers; Phase 2) to test the&#xD;
      bioefficacy of βCX and βC in maize by comparing a high βCX and low βC maize variety to a high&#xD;
      βC and low βCX maize variety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 of the study involves 1 long study day (D0), where 10 ml of blood will be taken every&#xD;
      2 hours, via cannulation, for a total of 12 hours (70 ml of blood total). Subsequently, there&#xD;
      are 13 followup visits on the mornings of Days 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 14, 21, 28, 35, 49, 63, 77,&#xD;
      and 91 where one 10 ml blood sample is taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 of the study involves 2 whole days (D0 and D21) where approximately 10 ml of blood&#xD;
      will be taken every 30-60 minutes, via cannulation, for a total of 8 hours (110 ml of blood&#xD;
      total). Subsequently, there are 3 follow-up visits on the mornings of Days 1, 7, and 22 where&#xD;
      one 10 ml blood sample is taken on each occasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the mornings of the long/whole study days at either D0 or D21, participants will receive&#xD;
      the muffin test meal before stable isotopes, dissolved in sunflower oil, are administered via&#xD;
      oral pipette. At D0 or D21, the total dose of pVACs (labelled and unlabelled carotenoids)&#xD;
      consumed in the muffin and oil is 3 mg alongside 0.4 mg of pre-formed VA.&#xD;
