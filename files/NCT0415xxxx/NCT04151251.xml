  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While many interventions have targeted hospital staff to improve sleep, few have been&#xD;
      successful, and often suffer from limited adherence to staff protocols. Given preliminary&#xD;
      data that suggests that empowered patients are more likely to obtain better sleep and have&#xD;
      objectively lower noise levels in their rooms, it is plausible that partnering directly with&#xD;
      patients can mitigate sleep loss and improve health outcomes. Patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive the I-SLEEP education and empowerment program and test the effectiveness of this&#xD;
      program on patient sleep and health outcome in the hospital and post-discharge. The aim of&#xD;
      the project is to reduce environmental, healthcare-related, and patient-related factors that&#xD;
      disrupt sleep of hospitalized patients by use of patient education and empowerment&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Karolinska Sleep Log - Sleep Times</measure>

    <measure>Frequency of Sleep Disruptions in the Hospital Setting</measure>
    <time_frame>Through stay in the hospital until discharge, usually 2-3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Administered to obtain a subjective view of typical disruptions to sleep such as bed comfort, room temperature, and pain. Items will also assess the disruptions that are caused by healthcare, such as vital signs, medication administration, and lab-work. This survey includes an item on how disruptive noise was to the patient's sleep, broken down into as many sources of hospital noise as possible.</description>

    <description>Patients who are not randomized into the I-SLEEP intervention will receive a sleep kit that includes an eye mask, earplugs, and headphones.They will still receive the usual standard of care provided by clinicians which includes measures to reduce unnecessary nighttime disruptions and limiting excessive noise within the hospital setting.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Sleep Kit + Empowerment</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>A short video will be shown on iPads and a brochure will be given that both describe the importance of good sleep and how to facilitate it with good sleep hygiene.&#xD;
The video will show a few reasons why someone might not get optimal sleep while in a hospital, and offer advice to address this from a doctor. The brochure will be kept to no higher than a 6th grade reading level, considered optimal for health education materials. Text will be kept brief and to the point. To account for vision problems, we will use &gt;12-point font &amp; leave a large portion of each page empty. Visual Aids &amp; graphics will be employed when possible.&#xD;
All of this is given in addition to the usual standard of care provided by clinicians.</description>
