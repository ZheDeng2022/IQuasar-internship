  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exaggerated inflammation in the body and brain is thought to play a role in the vulnerability&#xD;
      to and aggravation and perpetuation of adverse consequences among those with posttraumatic&#xD;
      stress disorder (PTSD). The proposed study begins the process of investigating the use of a&#xD;
      natural immunoregulatory/anti-inflammatory probiotic, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG;&#xD;
      ATCC53103), to treat chronic symptoms associated with PTSD among Veterans. By looking at the&#xD;
      impact of probiotic supplementation on biological signatures of increased inflammation, as&#xD;
      reflected by biomarkers of inflammation, gut microbiota composition, intestinal permeability,&#xD;
      stress response, decision making, and PTSD symptoms, this study may identify a novel&#xD;
      intervention for the treatment of symptoms associated with this frequently occurring&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      United States military Veterans from recent conflicts are coping with symptoms related to&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Many Veterans are resistant to conventional health and&#xD;
      mental health interventions (e.g., medication, psychotherapy), and often symptoms are not&#xD;
      significantly improved by traditional treatments. Alternative treatment methods are needed.&#xD;
      An underlying feature of PTSD is exaggerated inflammation, both peripherally and in the&#xD;
      central nervous system, which is thought to play an important role in the vulnerability to,&#xD;
      aggravation of, and perpetuation of adverse consequences of this condition. Therefore, an&#xD;
      innovative intervention strategy would be the use of immunoregulatory/anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      probiotics to reduce inflammation. In this study, the investigators will investigate the&#xD;
      effects of an 8-week oral administration of an immunoregulatory probiotic, Lactobacillus&#xD;
      rhamnosus GG (LGG; ATCC53103), a probiotic shown to have anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
      immunoregulatory effects (i.e., decreases in C-reactive protein [CRP]). Project aims will be&#xD;
      assessed using a longitudinal, double blind, randomized placebo-controlled design. After&#xD;
      initial evaluation procedures to confirm PTSD diagnosis, 59 participants will be randomized&#xD;
      to probiotic supplementation and 59 will be randomized to placebo supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim. Demonstrate the effects of LGG in a cohort of OEF/OIF Veterans with PTSD and&#xD;
      Functional Bowel Disorders (FBD), including IBS, on plasma CRP concentrations (mechanistic,&#xD;
      primary outcome), and PTSD symptom severity (clinical, exploratory). Additional biological&#xD;
      signatures associated with this condition will be considered exploratory, including gut&#xD;
      microbial community and intestinal permeability [IP]), other biological signatures of&#xD;
      inflammation, as well as stress responsivity and decision making. Hypothesis 1.1. Those who&#xD;
      receive LGG supplementation will respond with lower plasma levels of CRP as compared to those&#xD;
      allocated to placebo. Exploratory Hypothesis 1.2. Those who receive LGG supplementation will&#xD;
      respond with decreased PTSD symptoms (PCL-5), as compared to those allocated to placebo.&#xD;
      Exploratory Hypothesis 1.3. Those who receive LGG supplementation will respond with increased&#xD;
      abundance of LGG and community-level shifts (e.g.,increased alpha diversity) in the gut&#xD;
      microbiota (measured using qRT-PCR and DNA sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, respectively),&#xD;
      decreases in IP (decreased fatty acid binding protein 215 and D-amino acid oxidase16),&#xD;
      increases in plasma concentrations of anti-inflammatory biomarkers (IL-10, IL-4), decreases&#xD;
      in additional plasma biomarkers of inflammation (IL-6, IL-8, IFNγ, IL- 1α, IL-1β, and&#xD;
      IL-12p70), reduced stress response (biological and psychological) during and after Cyberball,&#xD;
      and improved decision-making (measured by performance on the modified Iowa Gambling Test&#xD;
      [mIGT]) as compared to those allocated to placebo. Exploratory Hypothesis 1.4. The effect of&#xD;
      LGG supplementation on stress response, decision-making, and PTSD symptom severity is&#xD;
      mediated by effects of LGG supplementation on the gut microbiota, intestinal permeability,&#xD;
      and plasma biomarkers of inflammation.&#xD;
