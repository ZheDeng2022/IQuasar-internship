      Short Study Title: RICE - Radio-Immuno-Chemotherapy of Cancer of the Esophagus&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Phase: Phase II&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research hypothesis: The investigators aim at evaluating if (I) esophageal cancer is&#xD;
      susceptible to immunotherapeutic approaches based on interference with the PD1 / PDL1 axis,&#xD;
      if (II) treatment of locally advanced tumors by immunotherapeutic approaches increases cure&#xD;
      rate and if (III) combination with radiotherapy is feasible and increases anti-tumor&#xD;
      immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives: The primary objective is to evaluate safety and efficacy (measured by an&#xD;
      increase of pathological complete response rate from 20% to 35%) of the fully human&#xD;
      monoclonal IgG1 antibody durvalumab targeting the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in&#xD;
      combination with neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy, followed by surgery for locally advanced&#xD;
      esophageal cancer and cancer of the gastric esophageal junction (GEJ).&#xD;
