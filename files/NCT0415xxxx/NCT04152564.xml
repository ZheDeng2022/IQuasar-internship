      60 Patients will be randomly assigned using computer generated randomization program&#xD;
      (http://www.randomizer.org) into two groups, First group (Control group ,Group of continous&#xD;
      epidural infusion [CEI]), where patients will receive continuous epidural infusion of&#xD;
      L-bupivacaine 0.125 % at a rate of .1 ml/kg/h during the first 48 hours after surgery. Second&#xD;
      group (Group of continous preperitoneal infusion [CPI]), where patients will receive&#xD;
      continuous pre-peritoneal wound infusion with L-bupivacaine 0.25% at 10 ml/h during the first&#xD;
      48 hours after surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will receive IV morphine when needed for a period of 48 hours with a PCA device&#xD;
      programmed to deliver 1 mg/dose with a 10-minute lockout time without background infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CEI group The epidural catheter will be placed via a paramedian approach as close as possible&#xD;
      to the surgical procedure via the inter-vertebral space (from T7 to T10) so that the affected&#xD;
      dermatomes of the surgical wound would receive the benefits of bupivacaine infusion. Proper&#xD;
      placement of the catheter was verified through an aspiration test and a test dose (2 ml) of&#xD;
      lidocaine 2%. At the end of surgery, a 14 ml bolus of L-bupivacaine 0.125 will be&#xD;
      administered through the catheter and then a continuous rate of .1 ml/kg/h infusion of&#xD;
      L-bupivacaine 0.125 will be delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPI group At the end of surgery and after the closure of the peritoneal layer, the catheter&#xD;
      will be allocated above the peritoneum within the musculofascial layer and secured to the&#xD;
      skin with an occlusive dressing. Thereafter, a 20 ml bolus of L-bupivacaine 0.25% will be&#xD;
      administered through the catheter and then a continuous fixed-rate infusion of L-bupivacaine&#xD;
      0.25% will be delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures The primary outcome will be the pulmonary effects including&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Respiratory mechanics: Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) &amp;Forced Expiratory Volume in one second&#xD;
      (FEV1) will be assessed preoperatively and at 12h, 24h and 48 hours postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Secondary outcome of the study will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac enzymes: Troponin I and plasma BNP levels will be measured preoperatively and&#xD;
           postoperative day 1 and day 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intensity of pain at rest and during pain-provoking movements (deep breathing, coughing,&#xD;
           mobilization) measured by VAS pain score immediately postoperative then at 2, 4 ,6 ,12,&#xD;
           24 ,36 &amp;48 hours after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemodynamic variables including (systolic and diastolic BP, heart rate, oxygen&#xD;
           saturation &amp; respiratory rate) measured preoperatively (baseline measurement) then&#xD;
           immediately postoperative and at 2, 4 ,6 ,12, 24 ,36 &amp;48 hours after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood gases will be drawn preoperatively and at 12 hour interval in the PACU for&#xD;
           assessment of Oxygen tension (PO2) &amp; Co2 tension (PCO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Morphine titration and dosage required in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  IV PCA Total morphine consumption during first 48 hours postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time of return of intestinal sounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CVP will be measured preoperatively and at post anaesthesia care unit for crude&#xD;
           assessment of cardiac function&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quality of night sleep assessed at 8:00 am on postoperative days 1 and 2 using a&#xD;
                verbal numerical scale (VNS) ranging from 0 (poor quality) to 10 (excellent&#xD;
                quality).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient satisfaction with the quality of postoperative analgesia 48 hours after the&#xD;
                end of surgery, assessed on a 5-point scale (completely dissatisfied, dissatisfied,&#xD;
                not satisfied nor dissatisified, satisfied or completely satisfied [34].&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  side effects, including hemodynamic variables (hypotension &amp; bradycardia), supine&#xD;
                hypotension ,shivering ,bladder distension and PONV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complications of Thoracic epidural as (Inadvertent intrathecal injection, Spinal&#xD;
           hematoma, Spinal abscess, superficial cellulites, PDPH, Nerve injury &amp;Back pain) will be&#xD;
           assessed and managed&#xD;
