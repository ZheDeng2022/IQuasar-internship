The subject holds the ETDRS 2000 chart near card (Chart 1) at 40cm using the string to ensure proper working distance. With the subject's binocular distance refraction in place, plus power is increased in +0.25 increments binocularly until the subject can read the 0.0 logMAR line.

    <description>The amplitude of accommodation is the maximum potential increase in optical power that an eye can achieve in adjusting its focus. The amplitude of accommodation will be assessed binocularly first at distance with an introduction of minus power over the distance prescription to stimulate accommodation. Instruct the subject to focus on 20/20 line of the ETDRS charts at 4m, and slowly add minus power in -0.25D steps until the subject reports first sustained blur on the line. Record the dioptric value where the subject reports the first sustained blur. Subtract the distance prescription from this value to obtain the Accommodative Amplitude using this method repeat three times).
