    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit 60 family caregivers of older adults with cognitive impairment&#xD;
      or dementia to participate in a pilot feasibility and acceptability trial of Mindfulness&#xD;
      Coach, an mHealth mobile application that delivers mindfulness therapy. Mindfulness Coach is&#xD;
      a self-guided mHealth intervention designed to help individuals learn MT, an evidence-based&#xD;
      treatment to enhance health, wellness and mental health. The app also offers a library of&#xD;
      information about MT (e.g., &quot;how to anchor participants' attention&quot;), 12 audio-guided&#xD;
      mindfulness exercises, and a catalog of additional exercises available for free. In addition&#xD;
      to collecting data about the feasibility and acceptability of Mindfulness Coach with&#xD;
      caregivers of patients with dementia or cognitive impairment, the investigators will also&#xD;
      collect data on preliminary efficacy of Mindfulness Coach at relieving symptoms of caregiver&#xD;
      burden, anxiety, stress and depression.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of Mindfulness Coach for stress and caregiver burden in caregivers of persons with&#xD;
      dementia. The investigators will recruit participants across three outpatient geriatric&#xD;
      primary care sites in the RWJ Barnabas Healthcare system: Monmouth, Monroe and New Brunswick.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness Coach is a self-guided mHealth intervention designed to help individuals learn&#xD;
      MT, an evidence-based treatment to enhance health, wellness and mental health. The app also&#xD;
      offers a library of information about MT (e.g., &quot;how to anchor your attention&quot;), 12&#xD;
      audio-guided mindfulness exercises, and a catalog of additional exercises available for free.&#xD;
      The app tracks progress over time with a mindfulness mastery assessment, has customizable&#xD;
      reminders which the patient will learn to set during orientation, and goal-setting and&#xD;
      tracking features, which the patient will learn to customize during orientation. Mindfulness&#xD;
      Coach was designed by a multidisciplinary team of experts in telehealth, technology and&#xD;
      mental health from the VA's National Center for PTSD and the Department of Defense's National&#xD;
      Center for Telehealth and Technology and is free and available on iOS and Android. In this&#xD;
      study, the intervention will be introduced during 1 in-person session by a trained research&#xD;
      assistant with 1-2 booster instructional phone call at 7 and 14-days to ensure that the&#xD;
      participant knows how and is encouraged to use the app. The participant will also be provided&#xD;
      with a laminated card that provides the basic instructions. The investigators will encourage&#xD;
      the participant to use Mindfulness Coach weekly for 8 weeks, or more if desired, as this&#xD;
      treatment dose is commensurate with most in-person MT psychotherapy treatment protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and Sample Size:The investigators will recruit 60 patients from three RWJ Barnabas&#xD;
      sites: Monmouth, Monroe and New Brunswick. Caregivers will be recruited by physician&#xD;
      referral. Physicians will identify patients with a diagnosis of dementia or cognitive&#xD;
      impairment and their family caregivers. The term &quot;family caregiver&quot; refers to any family&#xD;
      member or relative who is involved in a patient's health care because of a personal&#xD;
      connection, not for financial compensation. Family caregivers are eligible if they are age 21&#xD;
      or older, English-speaking, currently own a mobile device (smartphone or tablet) and spend at&#xD;
      least 10 hours per week providing care to the older adult patient. Procedures: Providers will&#xD;
      notify study coordinator of patients who have a diagnosis of dementia or cognitive impairment&#xD;
      and typically have a family caregiver present during medical visits. Emails will be sent to&#xD;
      providers to inquire about potential subjects. The study research assistant (RA) will call&#xD;
      potential subjects to obtain consent for a phone screen. The screen will include questions&#xD;
      about current caregiving practices and questions about mobile device usage (e.g., do&#xD;
      participants own a smart phone or tablet? How often do participants use this device?). If a&#xD;
      patient is eligible and interested in participating, an in-person baseline assessment and&#xD;
      orientation will be scheduled at the primary care provider's office. Informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained in person prior to the baseline assessment. The baseline assessor will also be the&#xD;
      individual who orients participants to Mindfulness Coach. Follow-up interviews will be&#xD;
      conducted via telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The orientation will consist of the following components: 1.) education about the app, its&#xD;
      developers and MT (to establish credibility); 2.) discussion of goals of the app; 3.)&#xD;
      procedural information about how to launch and navigate the app; and 4.) assessment of&#xD;
      participant's ability to use the app: participants must be able to meet pre-established&#xD;
      criteria of being able to open, launch, navigate and use the app independently prior to the&#xD;
      end of the orientation session. During orientation, study personnel will discuss the benefits&#xD;
      of daily, brief (5-15 minutes) mindfulness practice and ask participants if daily practice is&#xD;
      a goal they would be willing to set. If the participant is amenable, study personnel will&#xD;
      help participants set reminders (push notifications) within Mindfulness Coach to facilitate&#xD;
      daily practice. The investigators will work with each participant to set mindfulness practice&#xD;
      goals that are tailored to the unique needs of each participant. Participants will also be&#xD;
      given a laminated instructional card explaining how to access and use Mindfulness Coach.&#xD;
      Booster sessions: The study RA will schedule a 1-week booster phone call with intervention&#xD;
      participants to troubleshoot potential difficulties users may be experiencing with the&#xD;
      application. At this session, participants will be asked if they have used the app in their&#xD;
      first week. If they have not, the investigators will schedule an additional follow up booster&#xD;
      session phone call at 2-weeks to provide additional troubleshooting and encouragement.&#xD;
