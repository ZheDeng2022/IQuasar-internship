  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the quality of cardio-pulmonary&#xD;
      resuscitation(CPR) delivered by EMS professionals and whether this quality can be improved by&#xD;
      implementing real-time feedback during the event and an oral post-event debriefing procedure&#xD;
      based on the actual event performance data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether CPR quality can be improved by implementing&#xD;
      real-time feedback and immediate oral structured post-event debriefing in out-of-hospital&#xD;
      cardiac arrest (OHCA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study is to assess the current quality of CPR delivered by emergency&#xD;
      medical services (EMS) during OHCA events in the Capital Region of Denmark. Furthermore, to&#xD;
      investigate if CPR quality can be improved by applying real-time feedback during OHCA&#xD;
      resuscitation attempts and to investigate if structured oral post-event debriefing delivered&#xD;
      immediately after a resuscitation attempt and based on data from the defibrillator can&#xD;
      further improve CPR quality&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that adding real-time and post event feedback can improve the&#xD;
      compression rate, compression depth, overall CPR hands-on time (CPR fraction), and recoil&#xD;
      with at least 15% in total for both interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a prospective study design data is retrieved from the standard defibrillator (ZOLL X&#xD;
      series) through ZOLL RescueNetÂ® Case Review (software for post-event review, analysis, and&#xD;
      debriefing) from ZOLL Medical Corporation, Massachusetts, United States of America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of three consecutive phases. Phase one with no feedback / debriefing&#xD;
      available for EMS. Phase two with real-time feedback during the event and phase three which&#xD;
      adds post-event debriefing to real-time feedback. We expect to be able to include at least&#xD;
      500 cases in each phase.&#xD;
