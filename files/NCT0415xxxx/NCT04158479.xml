    <textblock>
      Extracorporeal life support (ECLS), also known as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO),&#xD;
      is an extracorporeal technique of providing effective cardiac and respiratory support to&#xD;
      patients with lungs and/or heart failure. There was a growth in ECLS cases, centers, and&#xD;
      center scale in China during the past decade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center registry was conducted by Chinese Society of Extracorporeal Life Support.&#xD;
      The objectives were to investigate China statistics of ECLS and to evaluate the short-term&#xD;
      and long-term outcomes of patients with ECLS.&#xD;
