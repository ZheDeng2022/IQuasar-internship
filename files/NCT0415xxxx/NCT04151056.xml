  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the social problems are hidden behind clinical diagnostics. This may lead to&#xD;
      overdiagnosis and overtreatment of some discomforts/pathologies that are observed in primary&#xD;
      care centers that may respond better to community level interventions and promotion of health&#xD;
      actions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is longitudinal , multicentered, pre and post intervention study, conducted by health&#xD;
      professionals of central Catalonia sanitary region during 2019 Prior to the intervention, the&#xD;
      number and type of social coded diagnoses in the clinical history is going to be described.&#xD;
      Subsequently, an intervention will be carried out: training the professionals in the&#xD;
      homogeneous codification of five selected social determinants. This codification will be&#xD;
      systematically applied .The number and type of social diagnostics registered in the pre and&#xD;
      post-intervention periods is going to be compared. Finally, the impact analysis of the social&#xD;
      determinants is going to be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afterwards the investigators plan to search solutions at Community level for the select&#xD;
      social diagnoses&#xD;
