&#xD;
      Study protocol Objective Abnormal platelet function remains one of the main causes of severe&#xD;
      bleeding during cardiac surgery, especially in the era of widespread evolution in&#xD;
      antiplatelet therapy as standard of care in cardiac surgery patients. Additionally,&#xD;
      conventional cardiopulmonary bypass is identified as a significant attributor to&#xD;
      pathophysiologic derangement in coagulation and platelet dysfunction, induced by prolonged&#xD;
      contact of blood with foreign surfaces, severe haemodilution, hypothermia and systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory response. Minimally invasive extracorporeal circulation (MiECC) reflects the&#xD;
      technological progress in cardiopulmonary circuits and offers improved perfusion conditions.&#xD;
      The multiple electrode platelet aggregometry analysis can be a useful point-of-care&#xD;
      diagnostic tool, assessing platelet receptors inhibition and aggregation, thus providing&#xD;
      real-time information perioperatively. Our objective is to investigate the potential&#xD;
      protective effect of MiECC on coagulation and platelet function and postoperative bleeding in&#xD;
      a series of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design This is a prospective cohort study. 57 adult patients presented for elective cardiac&#xD;
      surgery were recruited in the study. Informed consent was obtained by all patients. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria were defined as follows: unwillingness to participate, preoperative platelet count&#xD;
      ⩽150 × 109/mm3, age &lt;18 or &gt;79 years, emergency procedure, redo surgery, a known coagulation&#xD;
      disorder and inaccurate documentation of preoperative antiplatelet medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods All patients were managed by the same surgical team and anaesthesiologist. They all&#xD;
      received general anaesthesia in accordance with our institutional protocol. A dose of 15mg/kg&#xD;
      tranexamic acid was given at induction of anaesthesia and after protamine administration.&#xD;
      Surgery was performed under normothermia using a standard median sternotomy and MiECC modular&#xD;
      (Type IV) circuit was used in all patients during CPB. An activated clotting time (ACT) value&#xD;
      &gt;300sec was aimed for patients undergoing CABG and an ACT&gt;400sec for all other valve or&#xD;
      complex surgery. Reversal of heparin was accomplished with protamine at a heparin-protamine&#xD;
      titration ratio of 0.75.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperatively demographics, comorbidities, use of anticoagulants, antiplatelet medication&#xD;
      were collected and intraoperatively type of operation, duration of CPB, duration of aortic&#xD;
      cross-clamp, and heparin and protamine doses were recorded. Fibrinogen levels (mg/dL) were&#xD;
      measured before surgery (baseline) and after arrival in the ICU. Postoperative bleeding at 12&#xD;
      and 24 hours, as defined according to the universal definition of bleeding, was recorded, as&#xD;
      well as intraoperative and 24-hour transfusion requirements (including blood products or&#xD;
      coagulation factors concentrates) and major adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet aggregation was measured on two time points: T1 = arriving in operating room before&#xD;
      any drug or fluid administration and T2' = 20 minutes after heparin reversal with protamine,&#xD;
      in whole hirudin containing blood samples using the ROTEM platelet (TEM International GmbH,&#xD;
      Munich, Germany), which evaluates impedance aggregometry. Specific reagents were chosen: 1.&#xD;
      adenosine diphosphate (ADP) known as ADPtest to evaluate ADP function and thienopyridine&#xD;
      efficiency, 2. thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP) known as TRAPtest assay for&#xD;
      assessment of blockage of GPIIb/IIIa or protease-activated receptor (PAR). Abnormal values&#xD;
      were indicative of platelet dysfunction. Regarding thromboelastometry, parameters that were&#xD;
      recorded included the EXTEM and the FIBTEM assay. EXTEM and FIBTEM assays were performed at&#xD;
      two time points: T1: before anaesthesia induction and fluid administration and T2: after&#xD;
      removal of aortic cross clamp. Clotting time (CT) reflecting initiation of the clotting&#xD;
      cascade and clot formation time (CFT) reflecting fibrin polymerization and clot stabilization&#xD;
      were measured in EXTEM assay. Maximum clot firmness (MCF), indicating clot strength, was&#xD;
      measured in EXTEM and FIBTEM assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Plan The SPSS v.25.0 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Ill, USA) was&#xD;
      utilized for all statistical analyses. The significance level was set at p≤0.05 for the&#xD;
      tested hypotheses. Continuous variables are presented as mean and standard deviation (SD).&#xD;
      Categorical variables are expressed as absolute values and relative frequencies. Measures at&#xD;
      the two time points were assessed for normality using the Kolmogorov Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk&#xD;
      tests and then analyzed with paired samples t-test or Wilcoxon U-test, as appropriate. For&#xD;
      continuous variables, correlations were examined with Pearson or Spearman correlation&#xD;
      according to the distribution of the data. Regression was performed for the primary outcome&#xD;
      variables. A binary logistic regression model was used to estimate the multivariate&#xD;
      predictive ability of perioperative variables on the primary outcome.&#xD;
