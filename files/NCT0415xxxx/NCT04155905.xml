    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial was carried in the period between May 2018 and April 2019,&#xD;
      on 70 patients undergoing fistulotomy for treatment of simple perianal fistula. Patients were&#xD;
      randomly allocated into two equal groups each 35 patients, group A; underwent fistulotomy&#xD;
      without marsupialization of the edges of fistulotomy wound. And group B; underwent&#xD;
      fistulotomy with marsupialization of the wound edges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in this study are those suffering simple non recurrent perianal fistula&#xD;
      with ASA I and II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigator excluded patients with secondary anal fistula, complex fistula, anal&#xD;
      incontinence, previous anal surgery and any disease or drug that affects wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were subjected to thorough history taking and careful anal examination to assess&#xD;
      the sphincter integrity, define the fistulous track and internal opening, endo anal&#xD;
      ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging was ordered when needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fistulotomy was done under spinal anesthesia in the lithotomy position after skin preparation&#xD;
      and patient draping; anal examination under anesthesia was done, identification of the&#xD;
      internal opening carried out using palpation and inspection using proctoscope, injection of&#xD;
      hydrogen peroxide in the external opening done if internal opening couldn't be defined&#xD;
      easily, then the fistulous track was probed, it was laid open using diathermy, in group B the&#xD;
      wounds was marsupialized by suturing the skin edges to the edges of the track floor using&#xD;
      absorbable sutures (polygalactin) 3\0. Figures (1) and (2) shows the probed fistulous track&#xD;
      and its' wound after marsupialization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative non adherent dressing impregnated with local anesthetic cream was applied to&#xD;
      the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonsteroidal analgesic injection was given in injection form as per need. Follow up was&#xD;
      carried out in outpatient clinic by the study surgeons, patients who agreed for participation&#xD;
      in the study was instructed to visit the clinic every week for the first three post-operative&#xD;
      months then every month for the next 3 months and lastly two visits after 3 and 6 months, the&#xD;
      attending surgeon records follow up data including status of wound healing, anal continence&#xD;
      and fistula recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An informed written consent was taken from all study participants. Randomization was done&#xD;
      using computer program. The study was approved from institutional review board and the&#xD;
      ethical committee from our university.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data, operative data, and postoperative data including pain, post-operative&#xD;
      complications and time taken for complete wound healing were collected, properly analyzed&#xD;
      using the paired t test and Z test using SPSS program.&#xD;
