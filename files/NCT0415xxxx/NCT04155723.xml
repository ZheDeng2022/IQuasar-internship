  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The administration of medication, fluid resuscitation, or even nutrition in intensive care&#xD;
      unit (ICU) patients, requires one or more infusion lines which can be peripheral or central.&#xD;
      Midline catheter is a 10 to 20 cm long peripheral venous catheter, which can be used for up&#xD;
      to 28 days. These features make it a good alternative to central venous and conventional&#xD;
      peripheral venous catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Midlines are routinely used in the ICU of Lorient Hospital, currently inserted by doctors. In&#xD;
      association with the Regional Health Agency, the investigators are currently implementing a&#xD;
      project of task delegation to ICU nurses, so that they could insert Midlines' catheters. The&#xD;
      aim of the study is to increase the use of Midlines in the unit to reduce the exposure to&#xD;
      central venous catheters and their complications, such as infections or thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to conduct a prospective monocentric study to compare the frequency&#xD;
      of Midlines'use, before and after the task delegation. The primary objective is to compare&#xD;
      the duration of exposure to central venous catheters between the two periods. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to compare the duration of exposure to peripheral venous catheters and&#xD;
      Midlines, and the catheter-related infections and thrombosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The administration of medication, fluid resuscitation, or even nutrition in intensive care&#xD;
      unit (ICU) patients, requires one or more infusion lines which can be peripheral or central.&#xD;
      Although central venous catheters (CVC) are often mandatory in ICU, the risk of&#xD;
      catheter-related infections should lead to consider the insertion of peripheral venous&#xD;
      catheters. However in ICU patients, presence of edema or poor venous condition may not allow&#xD;
      placement of peripheral venous catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Midline catheter is a 10 to 20 cm long peripheral venous catheter, which can be used for up&#xD;
      to 28 days (according to manufacturer recommendations). These features make it a good&#xD;
      alternative to central venous and conventional peripheral venous catheters. They are placed&#xD;
      at the bedside, peripherally into the cephalic or basilic vein, with the tip reaching the&#xD;
      axillary vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Midlines are routinely used in the ICU of Lorient Hospital, currently inserted by doctors.&#xD;
      Studies have shown the feasibility and the safety of delegating to nurses placement of CVC&#xD;
      and Midlines. In association with the Regional Health Agency, the investigators are currently&#xD;
      implementing a project of task delegation to ICU nurses, so that they could insert Midlines'&#xD;
      catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Midlines' implementation has been associated with a decrease in the use of CVC and&#xD;
      catheter-related infections. To our knowledge, no study investigated the placement of&#xD;
      Midlines by nurses in the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to conduct a prospective monocentric study to compare the frequency&#xD;
      of Midlines' use, before and after the task delegation. The primary objective is to compare&#xD;
      the duration of exposure to central venous catheters between the two periods. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to compare the duration of exposure to peripheral venous catheters and&#xD;
      Midlines, and the catheter-related infections and thrombosis. Complications related to&#xD;
      Midlines' placement would also be recorded.&#xD;
