  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of tDCS timing on safety&#xD;
      memory in PTSD. A total of 90 participants will be randomized equally across one of three&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. One group receiving active stimulation during extinction and sham during consolidation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. One group receiving sham stimulation during extinction and active during consolidation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. One group receiving sham stimulation both during extinction and consolidation&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also include an online sub-study focused on contextual processing along the&#xD;
      PTSD spectrum. A maximum of 500 participants will be recruited using an online, panel-based&#xD;
      platform.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a three-arm study composed of four to five visits over an approximate period of three&#xD;
      weeks. Ninety participants will be exposed to a fear conditioning, extinction and recall&#xD;
      paradigm at three separate study visits; one of these study visits will include active or&#xD;
      sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for a period of 15-20 minutes. Additional&#xD;
      study procedures will include a screening period and two optional MRI scans, one done on&#xD;
      study day 2 and one done on study day 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUB-STUDY: The objective of this sub-study is to test performance differences between&#xD;
      configural and elemental contextual processing in individuals across the PTSD spectrum using&#xD;
      an online, panel-based platform. Following a within-subjects study design, 500 adult&#xD;
      participants, 18 years and older, will be asked to complete experimental tasks that assesses&#xD;
      configural and elemental contextual learning and memory. They will also provide demographic&#xD;
      information and complete questionnaires.&#xD;
