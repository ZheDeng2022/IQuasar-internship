  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, phase III trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of Toripalimab injection (JS001) combined with&#xD;
      platinum-based doublet chemotherapy versus placebo combined with platinum-based doublet&#xD;
      chemotherapy in resectable stage IIIA NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects meet all the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be paralleled assigned according&#xD;
      to the stratification factors as below :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pathological type: squamous cell carcinoma vs. non-squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PD-L1 status: PD-L1 expression ≥1% vs. PD-L1&lt;1% or not evaluable&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Planned surgical operation:pneumonectomy vs. lobectomy Neoadjuvant therapy should be&#xD;
           started within 3 days after randomization. , Toripalimab IV 240mg Q3W will be given&#xD;
           combined with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy for three cycles in the neoadjuvant&#xD;
           setting in the experimental group; Every 3 weeks of treatment is regarded as one cycle,&#xD;
           in which combined therapy is given in the first day of every cycle. Placebo combined&#xD;
           with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy will be given for three cycles in the control&#xD;
           group instead..&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the subjects will receive preoperative radiological and surgical evaluation 3-5 weeks&#xD;
      afterneoadjuvant therapy..&#xD;
&#xD;
      ,All the qualified subjects will receive radical excison based on the surgical operation&#xD;
      criteria of the World Association for Lung Cancer Research within 4-6 weeks after neoadjuvant&#xD;
      therapy. Pathologic staging based on AJCC Cancer Staging Manual (version 8) of the whole&#xD;
      specimens will be performed by the local pathologist. And then all the specimens will be sent&#xD;
      to the BIPR for further evaluation.. All the subjects accept the radical operation will&#xD;
      receive one cycle of postoperative neoadjuvant therapy, i.e., Toripalimab IV 240mg / placebo&#xD;
      + platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, 30 days after the operation. In case of no indication&#xD;
      for radiotherapy, it will proceed to consolidation treatment period three weeks later; if&#xD;
      indicated for radiotherapy, it will proceed to consolidation treatment period 30 days after&#xD;
      theradiotherapy. In the consolidation treatment setting , JS001 is given byIV 240mg in each&#xD;
      cycle of every 3 weeks for a total of 13 cycles i in the experimental group; placebo is given&#xD;
      by IV 240mg in each cycle of every 3 weeks for a total of 13 cycles in the control group.&#xD;
      Adverse events (AE) will be monitored throughout the study, and the seriousness will be&#xD;
      graded tothe guideline in national cancer institute (NCI) common terminology criteria for&#xD;
      adverse events (CTCAE) version 5.0 or above. The safety will be followed up in the subjects&#xD;
      who have received treatment and discontinued the drug prematurely. All the subjects will be&#xD;
      followed up for overall survival, until death, withdrawal of informed consent or end of&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
