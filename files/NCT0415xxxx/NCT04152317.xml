  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The medication misoprostol is used to facilitate the entry into the uterus of hysteroscopy&#xD;
      surgery equipment and this research aims to compare the results of the use of this drug in&#xD;
      two different doses trying to find the optimal one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform this work we will use the misoprostol and will perform a questionnaire that will&#xD;
      be asked during hospitalization, before, during and the 12hours after the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients who meet the inclusion criteria after signing the Informed Consent Form will be&#xD;
      allocated into two groups getting misoprostol 200mcg or misoprostol 800mcg.&#xD;

      Background: Hysteroscopy represents a minimally invasive procedure that has been increasing&#xD;
      its adoption in the treatment of many cervical canal and uterine cavity disorders. However,&#xD;
      difficulties related to the introduction of the equipment through the cervix are frequent.&#xD;
      Although several studies suggest advantages in the cervical preparation with misoprostol,&#xD;
      reducing the resistance of the uterine cervix, systematic reviews are unison to indicate the&#xD;
      need for clarification on the ideal dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: Compare the intra and postoperative results of patients submitted to cervical dilatation&#xD;
      for surgical hysteroscopy with previous use of misoprostol at doses of 200mcg or 800mcg for&#xD;
      uterine cervix preparation at Recife school hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Randomized, quadruple-blind clinical trial with patients who underwent cervical&#xD;
      dilatation prior to surgical hysteroscopy at Recife school hospitals, Pernambuco. Patients&#xD;
      included will be allocated randomly into two groups. The first group will use misoprostol in&#xD;
      the dosage of 200mcg and the second, will use the dosage of 800mcg. Administration, via the&#xD;
      vaginal route, will occur 12 hours before performing the operative hysteroscopy. The&#xD;
      following variables will be studied: cervical canal width, cervical length, degree of&#xD;
      difficulty, duration and failure of cervical dilation, side effects, surgical complications&#xD;
      and patient's satisfaction. For statistical analysis, chi-square tests of association,&#xD;
      Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney tests will be used to compare the groups, with an alpha error&#xD;
      of less than 5% being considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects: This study will comply with Resolution 466/12 of the National Health Council&#xD;
      and was submitted to and approved by the Professor Fernando Figueira Integral Medicine&#xD;
      Institute Research Ethics Committee, beginning only after this approval. All participants&#xD;
      will only be included if they voluntarily agree to participate by signing the Free and&#xD;
      Informed Consent Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no conflicts of interest.&#xD;
