          4. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum beta human&#xD;
             chorionic gonadotropin test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Male subjects and female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use an&#xD;
             effective method of contraception per institutional standard prior to the first dose&#xD;
             and for 90 days after the last dose of ZN-c3.&#xD;

                  abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or&#xD;
                  study drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study&#xD;
                  results, and in the judgment of the Investigator would make the subject&#xD;
                  inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;
