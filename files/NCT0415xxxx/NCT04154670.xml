&#xD;
         12. Subject has used any prescription drugs within 14 days prior to dosing or any dietary&#xD;

             past 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Presence of laboratory abnormalities or clinically significant medical condition that&#xD;
             in the opinion of the Investigator may place the subject at an unacceptable risk as a&#xD;
             participant in this study or may interfere with the interpretation of the study&#xD;
             results.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Changes in prescription medications within 14 days prior to dosing or anticipated&#xD;
