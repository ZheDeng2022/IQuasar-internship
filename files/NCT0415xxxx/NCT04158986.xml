      In a randomized controlled trial, the effects of a nurse-driven post-discharge intervention&#xD;
      for patients with liver cirrhosis compared with standard follow-up will be investigated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since 1970 the mortality from cirrhosis has increased with 26.7 %, with a 50% mortality rate&#xD;
      within 2 years of diagnosis. Grave complications result in functional impairment and reduced&#xD;
      quality of life. 20-37 % of patients with liver cirrhosis are readmitted less than 30 days&#xD;
      after a hospitalization for decompensation. These patients have a higher 90-day mortality&#xD;
      rate than those who avoid readmission. Re-admissions have great personal-, societal- and&#xD;
      economic consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a randomized controlled trial, the effects of a nurse-driven post-discharge intervention&#xD;
      for patients with liver cirrhosis, compared with standard follow-up will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention, based on concepts from Family Nursing, will comprise three home-visits&#xD;
      within eight weeks after discharge including therapeutic conversations focusing on&#xD;
      strengthening participants' family relationships and social networks, disease education and&#xD;
      help to initiate contact to municipal offers. After 12 weeks the participants will be&#xD;
      followed-up by telephone.&#xD;

    <description>Home visits based on the concepts of Family Nursing:&#xD;
The participants will receive three home visits by a nurse who is trained in the Family Nursing principles during the first 12 weeks after discharge.&#xD;
The home visits will comprise of:&#xD;
Filling in the Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire.&#xD;
Therapeutic conversations including drawing and review of genogram and eco-map.&#xD;
Information about- and help to initiate contact to relevant municipal offers.&#xD;
Evidence-based information based on the patient's current problems or symptoms, base-line knowledge and receptiveness.&#xD;
Follow-up telephone calls:&#xD;
• After the first 12 weeks participants will be followed-up by telephone monthly during the following 12 weeks.&#xD;
Pamphlet:&#xD;
• All participants will receive a pamphlet with brief information regarding preventive measures and early signs of decompensation as well as relevant contact details. The pamphlet will be handed out before discharge</description>
