      Prospective, Open-Label, Single-Center Pilot Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is aimed to evaluate the histologic effects of a unipolar microplasma electrode pin&#xD;
      radiofrequency device (Alma Lasers OPUS system) on the abdominal skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include up to 2 subjects. Each subject will have a single cutaneous treatment&#xD;
      of their lower abdomen, with variable treatment parameters. Punch biopsies will be obtained&#xD;
      from each treatment section, for in-vivo histological evaluations.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject seeking surgical correction of abdominal tissue laxity with an abdominoplasty&#xD;
             within the subsequent 1-12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject abdominal skin must be of appropriate quality to allow for proper study&#xD;
             treatment, as judged by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject must be willing to have punch biopsy specimens obtained from all treated&#xD;
             areas following treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The Subject must sign a statement of informed consent to the Investigator and Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject is less than 18 or greater than 75 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject with excessive superficial skin laxity and/or striae of the abdomen, which&#xD;
             would prevent proper study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A subject that is unwilling to have punch biopsy specimens obtained from treated&#xD;
             areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject with a history of allergy to lidocaine or epinephrine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Known history of keloids or bleeding/coagulation disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Presence of surgical or non-surgical scars in the area to be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Active inflammatory or infectious process or any other active or serious skin disease&#xD;
             in the area to be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Planned surgical procedures with incisions and suturing in the area to be treated&#xD;
             during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects who have had (or plan to have during the course of the study) an abdominal&#xD;
             skin treatment with any exclusionary treatments, medications, and/ or devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects who have used oral isotretinoin or other oral retinoids during the study in&#xD;
             the prior 12 months or planning to be on them during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects receiving antiplatelet, anticoagulant, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
             agents within 2 weeks of treatment, or planning to receive during the course of the&#xD;
             study; in whom, in the Investigator's opinion, administration of radiofrequency&#xD;
             treatment may cause procedure-related complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Women who are pregnant, nursing or intend to become pregnant over the duration of the&#xD;
             study, or women who are of childbearing potential not protected by an effective&#xD;
             contraceptive method of birth control. Pregnancy status should be checked by urine&#xD;
             testing at baseline (Day 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subjects who are unwilling or unable to give written consent to participate in the&#xD;
             study or unable to comply with the requirements of the clinical trial protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subjects who have received an experimental drug or device within the previous 3 months&#xD;
             prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subjects who are known as alcohol or drug abusers.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Subjects who are suffering from any physical or psychological condition, or are under&#xD;
             treatment for any such condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may&#xD;
             constitute an unwarranted risk or which may affect the subjects' compliance or&#xD;
             adherence to study procedures.&#xD;
