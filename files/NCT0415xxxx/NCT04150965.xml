  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This a Phase I/II randomized trial for patients with relapsed refractory Multiple Myeloma who&#xD;
      have relapsed after treatment with prior therapies. The protocol is designed to evaluate two&#xD;
      agents, Anti-LAG-3 and Anti-TIGIT, in order to understand their immunologic effects and&#xD;
      safety both as single agents and in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone. In these&#xD;
      arms, patients will be treated with either Anti-LAG-3 or Anti-TIGIT respectively for one&#xD;
      cycle as single agent followed by the addition of pomalidomide and dexamethasone in&#xD;
      combination for subsequent cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third arm allows patients to be treated with the FDA approved combination of elotuzumab&#xD;
      plus pomalidomide and dexamethsone as a control. This arm will thus allow a concurrent&#xD;
      standard of care comparator for the experimental arms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll 104 patients to one of three treatment arms. The study is open to&#xD;
      patients relapsing with refractory Multiple Myeloma who have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  received 3 prior lines of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  exposed to each of these 3 drug classes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  IMiD&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  proteasome inhibitors, and&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  relapsed and refractory are defined using the IMWG criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  disease that is non-responsive while on salvage therapy or progresses within 60&#xD;
                days of last therapy in patients who have achieved minimal response or better at&#xD;
                some point previously to then progressing in their disease course.&#xD;
