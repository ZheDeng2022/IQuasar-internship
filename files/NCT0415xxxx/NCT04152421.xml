  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a common disease with a high rate of recurrence. It is a major public health&#xD;
      problem with significant health costs. World Health Organization estimates that 34 million&#xD;
      people worldwide are affected by depression but not treated. Common barriers to accessing&#xD;
      care in depression would be: the high cost of therapy, long waiting times, low presence of&#xD;
      therapists in some communities, travel difficulties, fear of being &quot;stigmatized&quot;, not to&#xD;
      mention the presence of negative biases towards psychotherapy. Behavioural and Cognitive&#xD;
      Therapies are standardized psychotherapies using operationalized methodologies and offering a&#xD;
      pedagogical approach to learning specific change techniques and skills. They are the&#xD;
      treatment of choice for many of the mental disorders, including depression, which has been&#xD;
      proven effective through numerous scientific studies. They are now recognized by the French&#xD;
      Authority for Health as the most scientifically validated psychotherapies and are recommended&#xD;
      in particular for the treatment of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a context of constant development of information technology and the Internet, computer&#xD;
      programs and websites concerning health, and in particular mental health, have emerged. Among&#xD;
      the mental health programs, Computer Based Cognitive Behavior Therapy programs in&#xD;
      English-speaking countries now offer patients remote Internet-based behavioural and cognitive&#xD;
      therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These programs, which are not available in France, have been the subject of numerous&#xD;
      meta-analyses demonstrating their therapeutic effectiveness. Some of these Computer Based&#xD;
      Cognitive Behavior Therapy programs such as Beating The Blues® are recommended by health&#xD;
      organizations such as the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence in the&#xD;
      treatment of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This advent of computerized therapies is part of a movement to raise awareness of the&#xD;
      epidemiological extent of mood disorders and the inadequacy of management methods. These&#xD;
      &quot;therapist-free&quot; programs are, via an interactive and multimedia interface, an alternative&#xD;
      means of care, making it possible to overcome the usual obstacles to accessing care. In our&#xD;
      opinion, they represent an important area of research in an increasingly computerized health&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to study the acceptability and effectiveness of the pilot of a Computer Based&#xD;
      Cognitive Behavior Therapy targeting depression developed at the University of Nice Sophia&#xD;
      Antipolis; in three dimensions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical: via scales for measuring depressive symptomatology and depression&#xD;
           characteristics;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cognitive: via specific scales of cognitive-behavioural dimensions and validated in&#xD;
           depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Neurophysiological: via electroencephalographic markers linked to cognitive processes;&#xD;
           The research framework would be that of a prospective trial. This work bridges the gap&#xD;
           between neurosciences, neuropsychology and the psychiatric clinic, while at the same&#xD;
           time being part of a commitment to research in the field of &quot;e-health&quot;.&#xD;
