  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITN) has contributed to the substantial reduction in&#xD;
      malaria cases and deaths. This progress is threatened by increasing resistance commonly used&#xD;
      insecticides in mosquito populations. Newly developed, next-generation ITNs using two&#xD;
      insecticides or an insecticide synergist and an insecticide are effective against resistant&#xD;
      mosquitoes, but large-scale uptake of these nets has been slow due to higher costs and lack&#xD;
      of enough evidence to support broad policy recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study will occur alongside a pilot distribution of next-generation ITNs&#xD;
      and collect data over three years on their entomological and epidemiological impact as well&#xD;
      as anthropological factors that influence their uptake and use. Data collection will occur in&#xD;
      three districts: one receiving dual-active ingredient ITNs, Interceptor® G2 (BASF), one&#xD;
      receiving a standard pyrethroid long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN), Interceptor® (BASF),&#xD;
      and one receiving PermaNet®3.0 (Vestergaard) an LLIN containing an insecticide and an&#xD;
      insecticide synergist. Data will be collected on malaria vector bionomics, disease&#xD;
      epidemiology, and human behaviors in order to help better demonstrate the public health value&#xD;
      of next-generation ITNs and to support donors, policymakers, and National Malaria Control&#xD;
      Programs in their ITN decision-making and planning processes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization's (WHO) 2018 World Malaria Report estimates that in 2017, 219&#xD;
      million cases of malaria occurred worldwide resulting in 435,000 deaths, 93% of which&#xD;
      occurred in Africa. While this represents a remarkable improvement in comparison with 2000,&#xD;
      with malaria deaths having fallen by 40% in Africa, the downward trends in incidence and&#xD;
      mortality stalled between 2015 and 2017. This recent failure to maintain the hard-won&#xD;
      progress, let alone accelerate progress towards elimination, over the past three years has&#xD;
      caused WHO to describe the global fight against malaria as being at a cross roads, calling&#xD;
      for increased funding and highlighting the need to develop, optimize, and implement new tools&#xD;
      to combat malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Universal coverage of populations at risk with malaria vector control interventions-primarily&#xD;
      insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS)-in malaria-endemic&#xD;
      countries is a global and national priority because of its fundamental importance for malaria&#xD;
      control and elimination. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of these tools is threatened by the&#xD;
      emergence and spread of pyrethroid resistance in key mosquito populations, which is now&#xD;
      reported in more than 85% of all malaria endemic countries and poses significant risk to the&#xD;
      future impact of these tools. Emerging evidence suggests, however, that increasing mosquito&#xD;
      mortality-and thereby continuing to reduce malaria transmission-is possible in areas with&#xD;
      pyrethroid resistance by introducing new insecticide formulations for IRS and ITNs. For&#xD;
      example, Protopopoff et al. showed in Tanzania that the distribution of LLINs with piperonyl&#xD;
      butoxide (PBO) plus pyrethroid reduced malaria prevalence by 13% compared to standard&#xD;
      pyrethroid-only LLIN distribution (42% vs. 29%; p=0.0011), and Tiono et al., working in&#xD;
      Burkina Faso, showed that the distribution of a dual active-ingredient ITN reduced clinical&#xD;
      malaria incidence by 22% (Incidence Rate Ratio = 0.88; p=0.04) and potentially infective&#xD;
      mosquito bites by 51% (entomological inoculation rate ratio = 0.49; p&lt;0.0001) compared to the&#xD;
      distribution of a standard pyrethroid-only LLIN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there is evidence that standard LLINs can continue to provide effective personal&#xD;
      protection to regular net users in regions with resistant vector populations, new classes of&#xD;
      ITNs developed to perform against pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes have been developed, with&#xD;
      early trials and modelling suggesting that they may provide superior protective efficacy&#xD;
      against malaria in areas with pyrethroid-resistant vectors. Access to these new&#xD;
      resistance-breaking ITNs is restricted by need for efficacy data for continuing policy&#xD;
      recommendations, high prices, lack of evidence of cost effectiveness compared to&#xD;
      pyrethroid-only LLINs, and consequent poor demand in an uncertain market. Interceptor® G2&#xD;
      (IG2) (BASF), a new type of ITN consisting of two active ingredients including a mixture of a&#xD;
      pyrethroid (alpha-cypermethrin) and a pyrrole (chlorfenapyr) insecticide, recently achieved&#xD;
      WHO prequalification listing demonstrating that it performs to the thresholds required of&#xD;
      pyrethroid-only LLINs and has no known specific side effects. While the IG2 ITN has been&#xD;
      subsequently registered and approved for use in Burkina Faso based on this WHO listing the&#xD;
      Roll Back Malaria Vector Control Advisory Group guidance indicates that dual active&#xD;
      ingredient ITNs will require further epidemiological evidence before policy recommendations&#xD;
      are made for their use in preference to pyrethroid-only LLINs in certain settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Global Fund and Unitaid have developed a market shaping program for IG2 and other ITNs&#xD;
      with novel insecticide formulations. Evidence on the efficacy of IG2s will be generated by&#xD;
      the project through two randomized control trials taking place in Benin and Tanzania. In&#xD;
      addition, through this program, these next-generation ITNs will be made available to&#xD;
      countries for incorporation into their national distribution programs as pilot distributions&#xD;
      with the aim of determining real-world effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in different&#xD;
      contexts. In addition to the pilot distribution of IG2s taking place in Burkina Faso, three&#xD;
      other countries will be piloting IG2s as part of the New Nets project: Mali, Mozambique, and&#xD;
      Rwanda. This research will utilize these pilot distributions to understand the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of the new ITNs in the chosen settings. The NMCP in Burkina Faso, in&#xD;
      discussion with the Global Fund, chose to incorporate IG2 ITNs into the upcoming 2019 mass&#xD;
      distribution campaign. This study covers gathering information to determine the public health&#xD;
      impact of the IG2 ITNs in Burkina Faso, in comparison to sites that will receive standard&#xD;
      pyrethroid-only LLINs or PBO LLINs during the mass campaign. The aim of this research is to&#xD;
      better understand the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of IG2 ITNs in Burkina Faso and to&#xD;
      collect data on community uptake of the ITNs. During the upcoming pilot implementation,&#xD;
      entomological, epidemiological, and anthropological data will be collected in up to three&#xD;
      study districts, one that will receive IG2 ITNs, one comparator district that will receive&#xD;
      standard LLINs, and one additional comparator district that will receive PBO LLINs. Data will&#xD;
      be analyzed, and results disseminated to support the NMCP, donors, policymakers, and other&#xD;
      national and regional stakeholders in their ITN decision-making and planning processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the New Nets Project initiative to catalyze the market introduction of&#xD;
      next-generation ITNs, Burkina Faso will be piloting the deployment of next-generation ITNs in&#xD;
      selected districts where enhanced surveillance activities will be used to support&#xD;
      observational impact analyses. This study aims to provide National Malaria Control Programs&#xD;
      (NMCP), international donors and other key stake holders with evidence on the impact&#xD;
      next-generation ITNs on malaria burden. The decision on which type of ITNs to be distributed&#xD;
      and where to distribute them were all made by the national control program with the support&#xD;
      of international donors. These ITNs have gone through the country's appropriate registration&#xD;
      process prior to their purchase and delivery in-country. This observational study is&#xD;
      opportunistic in the sense that it is taking advantage of the decision of the national&#xD;
      program to distribute the different ITNs (standard and next-generation) in different&#xD;
      districts to evaluate their impact on malaria burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these districts, epidemiological, entomological, and anthropological data will be&#xD;
      collected with the primary goal of evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      deploying next-generation ITNs. Each component specifically aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Epidemiological component - measure the epidemiological impact of the new IG2 ITNs,&#xD;
           standard LLINs, and PBO LLINs in real deployment scenarios through observational&#xD;
           studies. These studies will compare trends in (1) malaria case incidence rates passively&#xD;
           reported to the national health system (passive case detection, PCD) and (2) malaria&#xD;
           infection prevalence, measured through Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs), in children 6 to&#xD;
           59 months of age from annual cross-sectional surveys during peak transmission periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Entomological component - evaluate the impact of IG2 ITNs on vector populations and&#xD;
           biting rates, compared to standard and PBO LLINs, through national mosquito surveillance&#xD;
           data that will measure trends in species- specific (1) adult vector densities (2) indoor&#xD;
           and outdoor human landing rates (3) estimated entomological inoculation rates and (4)&#xD;
           insecticide resistance patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropological component - map the social determinants of impact for IG2 LLINs and&#xD;
           determine transmission risk defined as the intersection between time at risk of mosquito&#xD;
           blood feeding and human activities not under protection of an ITN, through gathering&#xD;
           evidence on LLIN uptake and usage. The collection of reliable data on such patterns,&#xD;
           both indoors and outdoors, becomes thus an essential component of the evaluation of the&#xD;
           ITN pilots for both modeling and contextual analysis of impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Costing and cost-effectiveness component - estimate the cost and cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
           IG2 ITNs in southwest Burkina Faso through data on the price of the product, delivery&#xD;
           and deployment costs, and product effectiveness based on case incidence rates measured&#xD;
           during the epidemiological component of this study. Additionally, mean costs per case&#xD;
           averted that might occur in other contexts will be modeled and incorporated into the&#xD;
           cost-effectiveness evaluations.&#xD;

        Cohorts will be selected from the population of five districts, Banfora, Gaoua, Orodara,&#xD;
        Nouna, and Tougan, that will receive nets as part of the Burkina Faso mass distribution&#xD;
        campaign of ITNs. The districts have similar malaria transmission dynamics. Routine data&#xD;
        provided by in-country stakeholders show that these districts are comparable in underlying&#xD;
        malaria prevalence, incidence, vector species composition, and insecticide resistance&#xD;
        status, as well as general climate and geographic similarities. The three southern&#xD;
        districts (Orodara, Gaoua, Banfora) will receive enhanced data collection support, and the&#xD;
        two northern districts (Nouna and Tougan) will be analyzed using routine health system&#xD;
