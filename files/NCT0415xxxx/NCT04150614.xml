  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing either an autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant&#xD;
      (HSCT) and receiving preparative chemotherapy experience a considerable amount of&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Current strategies at reducing CINV in this&#xD;
      patient population are suboptimal due to lack of efficacy and supportive evidence, potential&#xD;
      for increased adverse events, and drug-drug and drug-disease contraindications.&#xD;

      Patients undergoing either an autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant&#xD;
      (HSCT) and receiving preparative chemotherapy experience a considerable amount of&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Current strategies at reducing CINV in this&#xD;
      patient population are suboptimal due to lack of efficacy and supportive evidence, potential&#xD;
      for increased adverse events, and drug-drug and drug-disease contraindications. This study&#xD;
      will be an open-label, prospective trial randomizing patients at a 1:1 ratio, to either one&#xD;
      of two 5-hydroxytrytamine 3 (5-HT3) antagonists, transdermal granisetron or intravenous&#xD;
      (i.v.) ondansetron, in combination with other standard, routinely administered anti-emetic&#xD;
      drugs (dexamethasone). Rescue antiemetics will be administered at any time during the study&#xD;
      period for vomiting or severe nausea at the request of the patients or as recommended by the&#xD;
      attending physicians. For the granisetron treatment arm, patients will be educated and&#xD;
      instructed to self-administer a single transdermal granisetron patch one-two days&#xD;
      (approximately 24-48 hours) prior to start of the preparative regimen. An additional dose of&#xD;
      transdermal granisetron will be administered 7 days after the initial granisetron dose. For&#xD;
      the ondansetron treatment arm, patients will receive the standard dose and schedule of&#xD;
      intravenous ondansetron that is routinely administered for each respective preparative&#xD;
      regimen. Use of rescue medications will be assessed daily during chemotherapy, and for 7 days&#xD;
      after the last chemotherapy drug administration (delayed phase). Nausea, vomiting, and&#xD;
      treatment-related side effects will be documented and followed during this same time period.&#xD;
      A quality of life questionnaire (MDASI-BMT) will be administered at Day + 7 (7 days after day&#xD;
      of infusion). All other aspects of patient care (i.e., chemotherapy administration,&#xD;
      supportive care, etc.) and laboratory monitoring will adhere to the routine standard of care&#xD;
      operating procedures for stem cell transplant patients.&#xD;
