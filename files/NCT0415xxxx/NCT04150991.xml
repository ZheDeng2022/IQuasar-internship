  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is the most common syndromic cause of obesity. Individuals with&#xD;
      PWS characteristically experience excessive weight gain and severe hyperphagia with food&#xD;
      compulsivity in early childhood, which often leads to the onset of obesity and metabolic&#xD;
      complications. The pathogenesis of hyperphagia and progressive weight gain in PWS is far from&#xD;
      being understood, and thus efficacious interventions are still under development. Emerging&#xD;
      evidence indicates an important etiological contribution of dysbiotic gut microbiota in the&#xD;
      hyperphagia, obesity and metabolic abnormalities associated with PWS, implicating a&#xD;
      potentially effective target for appetite control and alleviation of obesity in PWS. This&#xD;
      study aims to evaluate whether dietary fibers can improve hyperphagia and metabolic profile&#xD;
      in children with PWS, and further will determine if these improvements correlate with&#xD;
      dietary-fiber-induced changes of the gut microbiota. Twenty children with PWS (age 5-17&#xD;
      years) will receive 3-week fiber or placebo treatment and 3-week alternate treatment with a&#xD;
      4-week washout period in between. A validated PWS-specific hyperphagia questionnaire will be&#xD;
      used to assess the severity of hyperphagia in participants. Fasting blood and fecal samples&#xD;
      will be collected for the analyses of appetite-related hormones, metabolic biomarkers,&#xD;
      bacterial composition and gut metabolites. This study should provide potential new approaches&#xD;
      for effective non-pharmacologic treatment of excessive weight gain and hyperphagia associated&#xD;
      with PWS to improve overall health and quality of life in affected patients.&#xD;

      Background: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is the most common syndromic cause of obesity.&#xD;
      Individuals with PWS characteristically experience excessive weight gain and severe&#xD;
      hyperphagia with food compulsivity in early childhood, which often leads to the development&#xD;
      of obesity and metabolic complications. The pathogenesis of hyperphagia and progressive&#xD;
      weight gain in PWS is far from being understood, and thus efficacious interventions are still&#xD;
      being developed. Emerging evidence indicates an important etiological contribution of&#xD;
      dysbiotic gut microbiota to the hyperphagia, obesity and metabolic abnormalities associated&#xD;
      with PWS, implicating a potentially effective target for appetite control and alleviation of&#xD;
      obesity in PWS. The therapeutic potential of manipulating gut microbiota through diet has&#xD;
      been scarcely assessed in PWS; more comprehensive evaluations are greatly needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives: 1) to assess the effects of a 3-week dietary fiber intervention on gut&#xD;
      microbiota, hyperphagia, and metabolic profile in children with PWS; 2) to determine whether&#xD;
      changes in gut microbial composition and function correlate with changes in the degree of&#xD;
      hyperphagia, metabolic hormones, insulin sensitivity, inflammatory markers, and metabolites&#xD;
      implicated in cardiometabolic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodological Approach: In a cross-sectional design, 20 children with PWS aged 5 to 17 years&#xD;
      will be recruited from the Stollery Children's Hospital, Edmonton. Eligible participants will&#xD;
      have normal values of free thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating hormone (either endogenous or&#xD;
      with thyroxine replacement) as well as stable body weight and growth hormone dose. Children&#xD;
      with other clinically significant disease (diabetes mellitus, chronic inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      disease, chronic severe liver or kidney disease), or recent use of medications known to&#xD;
      affect body weight and gut microbiota (investigational drugs, antibiotics, prebiotic and/or&#xD;
      probiotic supplements) will be excluded. Participants will be randomly assigned to consume&#xD;
      either 35 g supplemental fiber mixture/d (oligofructose, resistant maltodextrin, acacia gum,&#xD;
      whole foods, and resistant starch type II) or an equicaloric dose of a 17.6-g maltodextrin&#xD;
      placebo/d (GLOBEÂ® Plus 10 DE Maltodextrin 100200; Ingredion) for 3 wk. This will be followed&#xD;
      by a 4-wk washout period and an alternate treatment for another 3 wk. Fecal samples will be&#xD;
      collected to analyze gut microbiota composition (using 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid [rRNA]&#xD;
      tag sequencing) and function (metabolites produced by microbiota: SCFAs and bile acids).&#xD;
      Microbiota composition will be characterized at phylum to genus level, and sequences will be&#xD;
      clustered to Operational Taxonomic Units to calculate alpha-diversity (by Shannon index).&#xD;
      Fasting blood samples will be used to measure appetite-related hormones, and metabolic and&#xD;
      inflammatory markers. A validated PWS-specific hyperphagia questionnaire will be used to&#xD;
      assess participants' food-related behaviors. A 3-day dietary record including physical&#xD;
      activity questions will be administered for the assessment of macro- and-micronutrient intake&#xD;
      and diet quality as well as physical activity level of the participants. In addition,&#xD;
      anthropometric data (body weight, height and waist circumference [WC]) will be obtained to&#xD;
      track changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: 1) Primary outcome: Change in hyperphagia score; 2) Secondary outcomes: Changes in:&#xD;
      a. Fecal microbial composition and function; b. Hormones (acylated ghrelin, PYY, GLP-1,&#xD;
      adiponectin and leptin; c. Metabolic and inflammatory markers (glucose, insulin, lipids, AST,&#xD;
      ALT, hs-CRP); d. Metabolomics profile (amino acids, branched chain keto acids,&#xD;
      acylcarnitines, ceramides, TMAO, choline and betaine); and e. body weight, height and WC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deliverables: 1) the feasibility of using a fiber intervention to reduce hyperphagia and&#xD;
      improve metabolism and inflammation via beneficial changes in the microbiota in children with&#xD;
      PWS; 2) the particular microbial composition and functional profiles associated with&#xD;
      metabolic improvement and/or weight loss can aid in the future development of&#xD;
      microbial-targeted prebiotic therapies. Results from this study will be used to guide the&#xD;
      design of effective treatment strategies to reduce hyperphagia and improve metabolic health&#xD;
      in children with PWS.&#xD;
