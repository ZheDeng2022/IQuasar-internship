  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, subject- and evaluator-masked,&#xD;
      bilateral-implant study conducted at up to 15 sites worldwide. A total of up to 280 subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio for implantation with either the TECNIS Symfony plus IOL&#xD;
      Model ZHR00V or the Trifocal IOL. This will ensure that data from at least 100 subjects in&#xD;
      the TECNIS Symfony plus lens group and at least 100 subjects in the Trifocal lens group will&#xD;
      be available for analysis at the 6-month follow-up timepoint. All subjects will be followed&#xD;
      for up to 6 months postoperative.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Unmasked study personnel at the site will be trained to the randomization process through the EDC system and will randomize subjects. The surgeon and the operative staff will know which lens type is implanted. There may also be site coordinators and other site study staff, such as those performing slit-lamp exams, who will be unmasked. Unmasked study site staff will be instructed not to disclose the lens type the subject received or to talk about the lens to any masked evaluators or to the study subjects. The subjects and the study technicians performing the postoperative vision tests are to be masked through study completion. To maintain subject masking, a temporary IOL implant identification card will be issued to the subject at the time of surgery. Following completion of the final study exam, each subject will be given the permanent IOL implant identification card.</masking_description>

&#xD;
          -  Potential postoperative best corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) of 0.66 decimal&#xD;
             (20/30 or 6/9 Snellen) or better&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Predicted postoperative corneal astigmatism less than 1.0 D, including posterior&#xD;
             corneal astigmatism (PCA)&#xD;

               -  Require an intraocular lens power outside the available range of +14.0 to +26.0 D&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Irregular corneal astigmatism (as evaluated by topography)&#xD;
&#xD;

                  (e.g., any observed guttata) that are predicted to cause visual acuity loss to a&#xD;
                  level worse than 0.66 decimal (20/30 or 6/9 Snellen) during the study&#xD;
&#xD;

               -  Prior, current, or anticipated use during the 6-month study of tamsulosin or&#xD;
                  silodosin that may, in the opinion of the investigator, confound the outcome or&#xD;
                  increase the risk to the subject (e.g., poor dilation or a lack of adequate iris&#xD;

                       diabetic retinopathy, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pregnancy, planned pregnancy, presently lactating, or another condition&#xD;
