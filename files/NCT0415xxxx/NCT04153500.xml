  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Residents increase their knowledge of female pelvis anatomy using a pelvic floor interactive&#xD;
      model methodology (Pelvic+) compared to the traditional methodology.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the residents' knowledge of the female pelvis anatomy at 3 months post&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine residents' satisfaction with Pelvic+ methodology compared to traditional&#xD;
           methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A multicentre, two arms, parallel randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an educational&#xD;
      intervention to compare knowledge on female pelvis anatomy between Pelvic+ methodology and&#xD;
      traditional methodology at baseline, at completion of intervention and at 3 months&#xD;
      post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teaching Unit of Midwifery of Catalonia. Institut d'Estudis Sanitaris, Barcelona, Spain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Midwives in their 1st year of training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: Accepting an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.2 in a two-sided test, 68&#xD;
      subjects are necessary in first group and 68 in the second to recognize as statistically&#xD;
      significant a difference greater than or equal to 1.66 units. The common standard deviation&#xD;
      is assumed to be 2.17 and the correlation coefficient between the initial and final&#xD;
      measurement as 0.0001. It has been anticipated a drop-out rate of 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to randomisation, consenting Teaching Unit will provide a list of their current&#xD;
      residents' caseload. The number of participants on that caseload who meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria, will be entered into the random numbers generator to create a randomly list in&#xD;
      which to approach potential participants to intervention group or control group. Following&#xD;
      the random list, sealed envelopes will be prepared. When the participant approach, second&#xD;
      researcher will then seek informed consent to participate in the RCT consecutively. Once the&#xD;
      participant has signed the informed consent to participate in the RCT, the first sealed&#xD;
      envelope will be given to her/him sequentially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information contained in the sealed envelope will allocate the participant to room A or&#xD;
      B. Being A: control group; and B: intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In situations where a participant, who had previously signed the informed consent and, before&#xD;
      running the intervention session, decides to withdraw the study, will be removed from the&#xD;
      RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal investigator and the statistician will remain blind to group allocation. Outcome&#xD;
      assessments will only be conducted by principal investigator blind to the intervention and&#xD;
      control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second researcher and professor will remain blind to questions included in both&#xD;
      questionnaires: anatomy and satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Pelvic+ methodology The interventional session (40 minutes total) will consist&#xD;
      of two parts: The 1st one is a lecture of 10 minutes (25% out of the total time) on female&#xD;
      pelvic floor anatomy. In the 2nd part, during 30 min (75%), participants, in small groups of&#xD;
      4 people, will assemble the female pelvic floor interactive model, following the indications&#xD;
      suggested by the second researcher. Pelvic+ is supported by an assembling manual that&#xD;
      participants will be allowed to use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: Traditional methodology A professor/lecturer of anatomy will carry out the&#xD;
      session in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The traditional session will consist of 30 minutes of lecture (75% out of the total time),&#xD;
      where female pelvic floor will be presented throughout theory and images. In the 2nd part,&#xD;
      during 10 min (25%), participants will review anatomical drawings /atlases.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Knowledge of the female pelvis anatomy at 3 months post-intervention with Pelvic+ methodology compared to traditional methodology</measure>
    <time_frame>15 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome of change of knowledge of the female pelvis anatomy at three months post-intervention with Pelvic+ methodology compared to traditional methodology will be measured by a self-completed questionnaire that will be completed by participants in both control and intervention groups prior to the teaching session and then three months post teaching.&#xD;
The following five anatomical topics will be researched:&#xD;
bone structure and obstetrical landmarks&#xD;
ligament structure&#xD;
superficial perineal muscle&#xD;
deep pelvis muscle&#xD;
nerves.&#xD;
Each of the above anatomical topics will be assessed with three questions using a Likert type scale, the total mean scores for each of the anatomical topics pre teaching and at three months post teaching for both the intervention and control groups will then be compared and analysed for comparison between the intervention and control goups.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with Pelvic+ methodology compared to traditional methodology</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with methodology: a likert-scale survey. This will consist of 12 questions with four-point agreement scale (symmetric agree-disagree scale) to measure participants agreement with a variety of statements related to the methodology of the anatomy session: theory, supporting material and time.&#xD;
All participants will be assessed to complete satisfaction questionnaire at the end of the intervention.</description>
