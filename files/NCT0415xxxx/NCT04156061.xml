      This study will recruit 400 participants who are taking part in the Computed Tomography&#xD;
      Coronary Angiography for the Prevention of Myocardial Infarction (SCOT-HEART 2) trial. The&#xD;
      investigator will assess diet, activity and habits at the start of the study and 6 months&#xD;
      later. This will help us understand the effects taking part in the study may have on&#xD;
      lifestyle. In addition, for participants who have CT scans, the investigator will present the&#xD;
      results of the heart from the CT scan. This will help us understand how best to explain the&#xD;
      results of the CT scan to patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a sub-study of the SCOT-HEART 2 trial (which aims to determine the best way to&#xD;
      prevent heart attacks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this sub-study is to determine the effect of getting information on heart&#xD;
      disease risk on lifestyle. At present doctors usually use a &quot;risk score&quot; to identify people&#xD;
      at risk of heart disease who may benefit from medical treatment. In the SCOT-HEART 2 study&#xD;
      the investigator will compare this &quot;risk score&quot; to a specialised heart scan (a computed&#xD;
      tomography coronary angiogram or CTCA scan). In this study the investigator would like to&#xD;
      understand more about the effects of receiving this information about the heart on lifestyle,&#xD;
      including effects on smoking, diet and activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will recruit 400 participants who are taking part in the SCOT-HEART 2 trial. The&#xD;
      investigator will assess lifestyle by using a detailed questionnaire which will be done at&#xD;
      the start of the study and 6 months later. The investigator will also perform some simple&#xD;
      investigations including a carbon monoxide breath test, blood pressure tests and measurements&#xD;
      of activity such as step counts. This will help us understand the effects on lifestyle of&#xD;
      getting information about a &quot;risk score&quot; or having a CT scan. In addition, for people who&#xD;
      have CT scans the investigator will either provide a verbal explanation of the results, as is&#xD;
      usual, or show pictures of the heart from the CT scan. This will help us understand how best&#xD;
      to explain the results of the CT scan to partipants.&#xD;

    <description>The baseline assessment will be completed on the same day as consent is gained. Every patients will complete a comprehensive assessment including questionnaires and objective assessments.&#xD;
Patients randomised to standard care with ASSIGN score alone (n=200) will be invited back approximately 6 months after baseline assessment. The detailed questionnaire, breath test, blood pressure monitoring, and 2-week activity monitor will be repeated. Bloods will be retaken to look at change in lipid levels and HbA1c where appropriate - no more than 30mls will be required.</description>

The review WITH images (VISUAL REPORT N=100) group will have results delivered by the principal investigator (a trained Cardiology Registrar) to ensure a standardised approach to relaying information. These results will be preliminary and focused only on whether the patient has evidence of coronary disease or not. A full report describing the extent of coronary disease, other cardiac problems and incidental findings will follow as per the SCOT-HEART-2 protocol. Patients will be made aware that the presented findings are a focused preliminary report and that a more detailed formal report will follow.</description>
