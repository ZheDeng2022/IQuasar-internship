  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have not been any published studies showing the use of topical nitroglycerin on the&#xD;
      dilatory effect on the posterior tibial or dorsalis pedis arteries. The objective of this&#xD;
      study is to determine the response of the posterior tibial artery and dorsalis pedis artery&#xD;
      to topical administration of nitroglycerin. This study may provide further information for&#xD;
      the utility of this artery in the treatment of peripheral arterial disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study to gather data on&#xD;
      the effect of nitroglycerin on the pedal artery of patients with varying comorbidities.&#xD;
      Patients will be divided into a treatment group and a control group. A detailed history will&#xD;
      be taken from the patient to ascertain risk factors such as Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia,&#xD;
      CAD, PAD, Tobacco abuse, Diabetes Mellitus, Family history of CAD/PAD, or history of&#xD;
      non-healing wounds. Further demographic data such as sex, age, height, weight, body surface&#xD;
      area, and body mass index will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound measurements of the dorsalis pedis and anterior tibial artery will be obtained at&#xD;
      baseline. Measurements will be obtained in the perpendicular plane using B mode on the&#xD;
      vascular ultrasound. The largest diameter will be documented. Measurement of the largest&#xD;
      intima diameter will be obtainedThe image will be temporarily stored for measurement purposes&#xD;
      but will not be saved. The patients will then have differing treatments based on their&#xD;
      groupings into the control or treatments arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient history, demographics and artery measurements will be kept on a password protected&#xD;
      document and assigned a research patient identifier number. Another password protected&#xD;
      document will contain the patient's name and patient identifier number. Only the principal&#xD;
      investigator and sub-principal investigators will have access to these documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the control group will have measurements of their posterior tibial artery or&#xD;
      dorsalis pedis artery bilaterally. The sites of evaluation will be marked with a surgical&#xD;
      marker. A topical moisturizer will be placed 1 cm proximal to the measured areas of the leg&#xD;
      and covered with a dressing bilaterally. Measurements of the arteries will be made at&#xD;
      baseline, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, and 90 minutes. In addition, non-invasive Blood&#xD;
      Pressure measurements will be made at baseline, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, and 90&#xD;
      minutes. The Moisturizer will be removed at 60 minutes bilaterally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the treatment group will again receive measurements of the posterior tibial and&#xD;
      dorsalis pedis arteries bilaterally which will be marked with a surgical marker. Randomly,&#xD;
      the tibial artery or dorsalis artery will be selected and nitroglycerin paste will be placed&#xD;
      1 cm proximal to the measured area of one leg and moisturizer will be placed on the other leg&#xD;
      in order create uniformity. Both legs will be covered with a dressing. These patients will&#xD;
      randomly receive 15mg or 30mg of nitroglycerin. Bilateral measurements of the posterior&#xD;
      tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries will be made at baseline, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, and 60&#xD;
      minutes, 90 minutes. In addition, non-invasive Blood Pressure measurements will be made at&#xD;
      baseline, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, and 90 minutes in the arm. The Moisturizer and&#xD;
      nitroglycerin will be removed at 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data handling and record keeping:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data collected, including demographic information will be kept in the Cardiology research&#xD;
      department, in a cabinet with lock and key. All electronic documents will be password&#xD;
      protected and encrypted. Only the principal investigator and sub-principal investigators will&#xD;
      have access to data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality control and quality assurance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The posterior tibial artery will initially be localized utilizing palpation starting at the&#xD;
      level of the medial malleolus. Positioning will subsequently be confirmed by the use of&#xD;
      ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Dorsalis Pedis artery will be localized utilizing palpitation starting at the level of&#xD;
      the navicular bone. Positioning will subsequently be confirmed by the use of ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When possible there will be an attempt to use measurements at the level of the anatomical&#xD;
      landmark in order to provide standardization Any deviation will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of the Posterior Tibial and Dorsalis pedis arteries diameter and administration of&#xD;
      nitroglycerin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Vascular ultrasound probe will be used to evaluate the diameter of the arteries. The same&#xD;
      vascular probe will be used to evaluate each patient to ensure standard measurements. A&#xD;
      horizontal and vertical diameter will be obtained to obtain an &quot;Averaged diameter&quot;.&#xD;
      Subsequently, the level measured will be marked to ensure rapid and accurate re-evaluation of&#xD;
      the same area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nitroglycerin paste or moisturizer will be added to the treatment/control leg/artery&#xD;
      depending on the arm of the study the patient is randomized to. It will be administered 1 cm&#xD;
      above the site being evaluated. Measurements will be made at 30, 60, and 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible risks include hypotension (although this was not noted in prior studies using&#xD;
      nitroglycerin in the radial artery), headache, rash, possible allergic reaction to any&#xD;
      components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of nitroglycerin on dilatation and spasm of the radial artery has been previously&#xD;
      documented. . As the pedal arteries become more widely used in the treatment of peripheral&#xD;
      arterial disease, a quantification of the effects of nitroglycerin on the pedal arteries will&#xD;
      be beneficial for its potential as an alternative or auxiliary access site in peripheral&#xD;
      cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is exclusively for inpatients. The half-life of nitroglycerin is 30 minutes. As a&#xD;
      result, 2.5 hours after the ointment has been removed, the nitroglycerin will be considered&#xD;
      metabolized. During this time the patient will be closely monitored. Only one patient will be&#xD;
      investigated at a time and the investigator initiating the study will be present on the&#xD;
      medical floor for the duration of the entire examination.&#xD;
