  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the feasibility of conducting a full-scale trial to&#xD;
      explore if there is a change in intervertebral movement following a course of manual therapy&#xD;
      in patients with acute non-specific low back pain (NSLBP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In patients with acute NSLBP, does lumbar intervertebral movement change following a&#xD;
           course of manual therapy?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In patients with acute NSLBP, do those who respond to manual therapy (established by&#xD;
           patient reported outcomes measures) have different intervertebral movement to those who&#xD;
           do not?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-specific low back pain (NSLBP) is a leading cause of disability and work-days lost&#xD;
      worldwide. Yet, in most cases we do not know the specific cause. It is thought to be due to&#xD;
      abnormal movement between the spinal bones (vertebrae). The investigators can now measure&#xD;
      movement between vertebrae using low-dose quantitative fluoroscopy (QF), or motion x-ray&#xD;
      videos. QF is a reliable method of measuring spinal movement which is non-invasive and does&#xD;
      not expose the patient to a lot of radiation. In this study, QF will be used as a measuring&#xD;
      tool to measure spinal movement in patients with acute NSLBP before manual therapy versus&#xD;
      after manual therapy to explore if there is a change in spinal movement. Research suggests&#xD;
      that some patients respond to manual therapy and some do not, a secondary question in this&#xD;
      study is to explore if there are differences in spinal movement between those who respond to&#xD;
      manual therapy (measured using pain and disability questionnaires) and those who do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a feasibility study to determine whether the study can be carried out as a&#xD;
      full-scale trial. Participants will be recruited from the AECC University College (AECC UC)&#xD;
      Clinic. Following an examination, patients with acute low back pain, and who are eligible for&#xD;
      the study will be invited to join. Participants will proceed with initial measurements which&#xD;
      include validated questionnaires and QF. Following these measurements participants will be&#xD;
      randomised into two groups, each containing 15 participants. Both groups will receive an&#xD;
      evidence-informed home management booklet, the manual therapy group will receive five manual&#xD;
      therapy treatments in two weeks. Participants will return for follow-up measurements two&#xD;
      weeks after baseline measurements.&#xD;
