      The purpose of this clinical trial is to investigate the efficacy of a single iLux® treatment&#xD;

    <measure>Mean Change in Dry Eye (SPEED) Questionnaire From Baseline at 1 Month</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The mean change in dry eye symptoms from Baseline based on the SPEED questionnaire score was evaluated 1 month after iLux treatment. The SPEED questionnaire evaluates dry eye symptoms based on symptom frequency and severity. A lower SPEED score represents less frequent and/or less severe symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Meibomian Gland Score at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the meibomian gland score, secretion characteristics of 15 meibomian glands along the lower eyelid were evaluated including five glands each in the temporal, central and nasal regions of the lower eyelid. For each gland, secretion characteristics were graded as 3 (clear liquid), 2 (cloudy liquid), 1 (inspissated/ toothpaste consistency) and 0 (no secretion). The total meibomian gland score is the sum of the grades for all 15 glands with a range between 0 and 45. A higher score reflects less meibomian gland dysfunction.</description>

    <measure>Comfortable Contact Lens Wear Time at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pre-lens Tear Break-up Time at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The pre-lens tear film is the layer of tears located on top of the contact lens (i.e., between the eye lid and the contact lens). The time required for a dry spot to appear on the contact lens surface after blinking is referred to as the pre-lens tear break-up time. Three measurements are taken and averaged together. A higher number represents a longer pre-lens tear break-up time.</description>

             purposes of this study, active ocular disease is defined as infection or inflammation&#xD;
             which requires therapeutic treatment. Mild (i.e. not considered clinically relevant)&#xD;
             lid abnormalities (blepharitis, meibomian gland dysfunction, papillae), corneal and&#xD;
             conjunctival staining and dry eye are not considered active ocular disease.&#xD;
             Neovascularization and corneal scars are the result of previous hypoxia, infection or&#xD;
             inflammation and are therefore not active.&#xD;
