      The sperm of the KO mouse shothe investigatorsd severe defects of all found compartments:&#xD;
      acrosome, nucleus, midpiece and tail. The investigators also found SEPT12 co-localizes and&#xD;
      interact with SEPT1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, and 14 in sperm. Interestingly, some of these&#xD;
      septins form filaments with SEPT12 in cells. Based on these findings, it is hypothesized that&#xD;
      (1) The core complex of SEPT12 filament consists of SEPT12-7-6-2-2-6-7-12; (2) Septin12&#xD;
      mutations, genetic variants, as the investigatorsll as haploinsufficiency disrupt SEPT12&#xD;
      filament and macro-complex; (3) Other SEPT's (e.g. SETP4, SEPT14) are also involved in the&#xD;
      functionality of SEPT12; and (4) SEPT12 macro-complex is critical for compartment formation&#xD;
      during terminal differentiation of male germ cells. The proposed study is designed to confirm&#xD;
      the above hypotheses, to deconstruct mammalian SEPT12 complex, and to elucidate the&#xD;
      functional significance of Septin12 mutations. In the proposed study, the investigators will&#xD;
      use different methods, including proteomics, immunofluorescence assay, co-&#xD;
      immunoprecipitation, pull-down assay, protein domain mapping, and protein complex&#xD;
      fractionation to test the above hypothesis. The investigators have created a mouse carrying&#xD;
      an important Septin12 mutation. In the proposed study, the investigators plan to knock out&#xD;
      Septin14 in the mouse. SEPT14 interacts with SEPT12 and is also predominantly expressed in&#xD;
      sperm. The mouse models and research tools could be used to explore the role of septins&#xD;
      during spermiogenesis, to deconstruct the SEPT12 complex in the mammalian sperm, and to&#xD;
      elucidate the functional significance of the Septin 12 mutations. Our findings may provide&#xD;
      novel insight into the pathways human spermatogenesis, and has the potential to lead to&#xD;
      development of therapeutic models for male infertility, and design of male contraceptives.&#xD;

      Redundancy and Interchangeability of Septins Septins 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, and 12 have been knocked&#xD;
      out in the mouse model. Although SEPT4 abundantly expressed in different tissues, Septin4 KO&#xD;
      mice only shothe investigatorsd male reproductive failure. SEPT12 is exclusively expressed in&#xD;
      the post-meiotic germ cells, and Septin12+/- KO mice shothe investigatorsd spermatogenetic&#xD;
      failure. In one study, SEPT5 deficiency decreased anxiety-related behavior, increased&#xD;
      prepulse inhibition and delayed acquisition of rewarded goal approach, independent of mouse&#xD;
      genetic backgrounds. In another study, Septin3-/- and Septin5-/-mice did not show any overt&#xD;
      phenotypes. Knockout of a ubiquitously expressed septin, Septin6, also did not result in&#xD;
      abnormal phenotypes. SETP11 is ubiquitously expressed, and Sept11 null mutation died in&#xD;
      utero. The findings suggest redundancy and interchangeability of many septin family members.&#xD;
      Among the septin family members, SEPT12 and 14 may deserve special attention for the&#xD;
      reproductive biologists because they are mainly expressed in the testis.&#xD;
