  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enhanced recovery pathways (ERPs) emphasize evidence-based, multimodal anesthetic and&#xD;
      analgesic choices to minimize opioid consumption while providing adequate pain control after&#xD;
      surgery. Although ERPs for spine surgery are now being described, few pathways include&#xD;
      regional analgesia. The Erector Spinae Plane Block (ESPB) may represent a novel opportunity&#xD;
      to incorporate regional analgesia into ERPs for spine surgery. To date, there is minimal data&#xD;
      to support the utility of ESPB in spine surgery, and this block has not yet been evaluated in&#xD;
      complex spine surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to see whether ESPB will reduce opioid consumption and pain scores, and&#xD;
      improve patient recovery during the first 24 hours after complex spine surgery when included&#xD;
      in a comprehensive ERP.&#xD;
