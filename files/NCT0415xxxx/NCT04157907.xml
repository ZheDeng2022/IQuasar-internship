    <textblock>
      Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a pervasive mental disorder characterized by&#xD;
      emotional instability, self-destructive behavior, identity problems and unstable&#xD;
      relationships. Persons with this disorder usually experience significant distress in terms of&#xD;
      depression, anxieties, suicidal behavior, and difficulties in close relationships as well as&#xD;
      with work- and social functioning. Recent research has found the prognosis of BPD to be&#xD;
      better than previously assumed, and many patients improve from treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mentalization based therapy (MBT) is a specialized evidenced based therapy for patients with&#xD;
      BPD. Like for other specialized treatments for this disorder, the outcome of therapy is&#xD;
      typically variable, some patients respond well to treatment, whereas others respond less. It&#xD;
      is therefore important to understand how treatment works in order to improve therapies and&#xD;
      tailor treatment to individual patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mentalizing is the ability to understand ourselves and others in terms of mental states, like&#xD;
      intentions, feelings, desires, attitudes, and so on, or briefly; the ability to mind own and&#xD;
      other's minds. Impaired mentalizing capacity is an assumed core aspect of BPD, underlying&#xD;
      many of the symptoms of this disorder. MBT focuses on the patients mentalizing difficulties&#xD;
      and is typically offered as a long-term combined treatment program comprising individual and&#xD;
      group therapy, as well as psychoeducation. Several studies have documented positive effects&#xD;
      of MBT in terms of reduced suicidal behavior, symptoms, interpersonal problems, medication,&#xD;
      and health service use. It is assumed that such clinical improvement is made possible by&#xD;
      helping the patients to develop their mentalizing abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yet, no study has investigated whether patients' mentalizing capacity changes during MBT, or&#xD;
      to what degree outcome of MBT is mediated by improved mentalizing. Mentalizing is, however, a&#xD;
      complex phenomenon and difficult to measure. Research in this area has been hampered by a&#xD;
      lack of suitable methods. Mentalizing is usually operationalized as Reflective Functioning&#xD;
      (RF) assessed by the RF Scale. The gold standard is to apply the RF Scale on the Adult&#xD;
      Attachment Interview. However, this is a time consuming and costly method, and there is a&#xD;
      need for testing other methods as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of the project is to study treatment processes in MBT for patients with BPD.&#xD;
      It focuses on patients' mentalizing difficulties before, during and at the end of therapy.&#xD;
      Mentalizing is assessed using different methods. Our main research questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To what degree does patients' level of RF change during MBT?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is there a relationship between RF and outcome of MBT?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What is the relationship between RF and therapy processes in MBT?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Is it possible to identify in-session processes that promote mentalizing?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. What is the clinical utility of various methods of RF assessment?&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Borderline personality disorder (BPD) BPD is a pervasive mental disorder&#xD;
      characterized by emotional instability, self-destructive behavior, identity problems and&#xD;
      unstable interpersonal relationships. The disorder is associated with high levels of symptom&#xD;
      distress, suicidal behavior, psychosocial impairment, and high rates of comorbid mental&#xD;
      disorders such as mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders, as well as significant health&#xD;
      service utilization and costs. Recent research has found the prognosis of BPD to be better&#xD;
      than previously assumed. Yet, despite high rates of diagnostic remission many patients&#xD;
      continue to have poor vocational and social functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several specialized and evidence based psychotherapies targeting characteristic BPD symptoms&#xD;
      have been developed during the past decades, like Dialectical behavioral therapy,&#xD;
      Transference focused therapy, Schema focused therapy and Mentalization based therapy. Across&#xD;
      specific treatment approaches the outcome of therapy is typically variable, some patients&#xD;
      respond well to treatment, whereas others respond less or even deteriorate. It is therefore&#xD;
      important to understand how treatment works in order to improve therapies and tailor&#xD;
      treatment to individual patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mentalization based therapy (MBT) MBT is a manualized psychodynamic psychotherapy which&#xD;
      focuses specifically on the patients' mentalizing difficulties. Mentalization is defined as&#xD;
      the capacity to perceive human behavior as expressions of mental states, like thoughts,&#xD;
      affects, dreams and intentions, and is usually operationalized as Reflective Functioning (RF)&#xD;
      assessed by the RF Scale. Impaired mentalizing capacity is an assumed core aspect of BPD&#xD;
      underlying characteristic features such as poor affect regulation, impulse control problems,&#xD;
      and incoherent internal representations of self and others leading to unstable relationships&#xD;
      and self- esteem. MBT is prototypically a combined treatment program comprising individual&#xD;
      and group therapy, as well as psychoeducation. Several studies, including RCTs have&#xD;
      documented positive effects of MBT in terms of reduced suicidal behavior, symptoms,&#xD;
      interpersonal problems, medication, and health service use. There are also indications that&#xD;
      MBT may be particularly helpful for more severely disturbed patients with extensive&#xD;
      comorbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yet, no study has investigated whether patients' mentalizing capacity changes during MBT, or&#xD;
      to what degree outcome of MBT is mediated by improved RF. One study found that outcome of two&#xD;
      different treatment approaches (not MBT) differentially depended on patients' pretreatment&#xD;
      levels of RF, indicating that RF may be a valuable variable for treatment selection and&#xD;
      outcome. There are also indications that RF may improve during Transference focused therapy.&#xD;
      However, there is a general lack of studies investigating the role of RF in the unfolding of&#xD;
      psychotherapy processes and outcome of MBT. Thus, more studies are needed to gain knowledge&#xD;
      of mechanisms of change in MBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RF and psychotherapy processes Common therapeutic factors are factors that are believed to&#xD;
      function across different types of treatment, in contrast to specific factors which are seen&#xD;
      as operating as part of specific therapies and interventions. An early good therapeutic&#xD;
      alliance between patient and therapist is the most widely recognized common factor in&#xD;
      individual therapies. The Working Alliance Inventory is an established method for assessment&#xD;
      of therapeutic alliance in individual therapy. As to group therapies alliance to therapists&#xD;
      and group members, as well as group cohesion are suggested as important common factors, but&#xD;
      the evidence is not consistent. Assessment of therapeutic factors in groups is, however more&#xD;
      complicated due to the many relationships in therapy groups. The Group Questionnaire is a&#xD;
      promising empirically derived instrument intended to comprise important dimensions of a&#xD;
      patient's relationship to his/her therapy group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the relationship between common and specific therapeutic factors is debated, e.g.,&#xD;
      specific interventions and factors may be necessary for common factors to come into play. We&#xD;
      don't know if specific factors in MBT stimulate alliance and outcome, or if there are other&#xD;
      important processes operating. Research should investigate how patients' pretreatment or&#xD;
      in-session RF influence the therapeutic alliance to the individual therapist or group, and to&#xD;
      what degree interventions intended to stimulate mentalization have an influence on patients'&#xD;
      experience of alliance. These are complex processes and other patient characteristic as well&#xD;
      as therapeutic interventions must be taken into account when analyzing such processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of RF The gold standard for assessment of RF is the RF Scale applied on the Adult&#xD;
      Attachment Interview (AAI) with patient's narratives of his/her experiences with early&#xD;
      attachment figures. Yet, the specific mentalizing difficulties often seen in patients with&#xD;
      BPD, is a temporary breakdown of mentalizing, particularly during emotional storms in current&#xD;
      close relationships. One concern is therefore that RF based on the AAI may not be able to&#xD;
      capture such mentalizing collapses. Concordantly, there is incipient evidence that RF based&#xD;
      on the AAI may be rather trait like and slow to change. Researchers in this field are&#xD;
      currently searching for additional methods for RF assessment. For instance, the RF Scale has&#xD;
      been applied to transcripts of therapy sessions, capturing RF as a more fluctuating and state&#xD;
      like phenomenon. So far this adaption has only been used on MBT sessions in a study of 15&#xD;
      patients with comorbid BPD and substance dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To move forward in the understanding of RF and psychotherapy processes in more detail one&#xD;
      should preferably apply different methods for RF assessment. A part of the present project is&#xD;
      therefore to evaluate RF by three different methods based on 1) AAI , 2) in-session&#xD;
      interactions, and 3) a specially developed interview focusing on episodes of temporary break&#xD;
      down of mentalizing ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS The overall aim of the project is to study psychotherapy processes in MBT for patients&#xD;
      with BPD. It focuses on patients' mentalizing difficulties before, during and at the end of&#xD;
      therapy. Mentalization is operationalized as RF and assessed using different methods. The&#xD;
      projects aims to investigate the role of patients' RF for clinical outcome, change in RF&#xD;
      during and across sessions, patient-therapist interactions promoting or hindering reflection,&#xD;
      and other psychotherapy processes that might mediate treatment response. To render possible&#xD;
      studies of more differentiated treatment responses the project includes a variety of&#xD;
      outcomes, ranging from treatment attendance and dropout, clinical symptoms, personality&#xD;
      related variables, global functioning, health service use, and rehabilitation support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To what degree does patients' level of RF change during MBT?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is there a relationship between RF and outcome of MBT?&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Does RF predict clinical outcome in MBT?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Is outcome in MBT mediated by RF?&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Is change in RF associated with change in core BPD problems such as poor affect&#xD;
                regulation, impulse control, and unstable relationships?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What is the relationship between RF and therapy processes in MBT?&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Is RF related to patients' experience of therapeutic alliance in individual and&#xD;
                group therapy?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Is RF related to early drop-out and treatment completion?&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. How does patients' RF interact with other patient characteristics in influencing&#xD;
                therapeutic alliance and outcome?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Is it possible to identify in-session processes that promote mentalizing?&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Does therapist adherence to MBT predict better patient in-session mentalizing or&#xD;
                outcome?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Which in-session processes, including therapist interventions, promote or impede&#xD;
                patient mentalizing?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. What is the clinical utility of various methods of RF assessment?&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. What are the relationships between interview based RF scored on AAI, BPD domain&#xD;
                specific RF scored on a specifically developed &quot;Mentalization breakdown interview&quot;,&#xD;
                and observer rated RF based on video recordings of individual therapy sessions?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. What is the relationship between the various RF assessment methods and intensity&#xD;
                and frequency of mentalization breakdowns?&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Do the different RF assessment methods perform differently regarding prediction and&#xD;
                mediation of clinical outcome?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be conducted at the Personality Outpatient Unit, Section of Personality&#xD;
      Psychiatry, Oslo University Hospital, which is specialized in the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      personality disorders. Currently the unit focuses primarily on BPD. A maximum of sixty&#xD;
      consecutively admitted patients with BPD or BPD traits, age 18-40 years, and 6-10 therapists&#xD;
      from the ordinary staff will be included as participants after informed consent.&#xD;
