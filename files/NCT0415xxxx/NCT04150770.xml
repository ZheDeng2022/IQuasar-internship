  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is designed to test the hypothesis that infliximab is clinically useful for&#xD;
      patients with refractory childhood uveitis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approval of the study was obtained from the hospital's ethical committee. The study design&#xD;
      and methodology followed the tenets of Declaration of Helsinki. All patients were provided&#xD;
      with written informed consent and received a thorough explanation of the study design, aims,&#xD;
      and the off-label use of infliximab, its potential risks and benefits. This is a prospective&#xD;
      non-comparative interventional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive intravitreal injections of suggested dose of infliximab (5&#xD;
      mg/kg/dose) and data will be collected prospectively with regard to ophthalmologic outcomes.&#xD;
      Study participants will be followed for up to 10 months to determine efficacy and side&#xD;
      effects, and an additional 30 days for safety reports. Descriptive statistics will be&#xD;
      gathered on participant demographics, uveitis characteristics, change in immunosuppressive&#xD;
      medications, number of responders, ophthalmologic measures and change in corticosteroid dose&#xD;
      during the study period.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change In LogMAR Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) From Baseline to Each Visit.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participant's best corrected visual acuity was measured using an Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) logMAR chart. On the logMAR scale, 0 is equivalent to 20/20 visual acuity, the range of normal vision is considered to be from -0.2 - 0.1; higher values indicate visual impairment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Anterior Chamber (AC) Cell Grade From Baseline to Each Visit.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Slit lamp examinations were conducted at each visit to assess AC cell count. The number of AC cells observed within a 1 mm Ã— 1 mm slit beam was used to determine the grade according to the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) criteria:&#xD;
Grade 0 = &lt; 1 cell Grade 0.5+ = 1 - 5 cells Grade 1+ = 6 - 15 cells Grade 2+ = 16 - 25 cells Grade 3+ = 26 - 50 cells Grade 4+ = &gt; 50 cells.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Vitreous Haze (VH) Grade From Baseline to Each Visit.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Vitreous haze was measured using dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy (DIO) and assessed by the Investigator according to National Eye Institute (NEI) and SUN criteria:&#xD;
Grade 0: No evident vitreous haze; Grade 0.5+: Slight blurring of the optic disc margin because of the haze; normal striations and reflex of the nerve fiber layer cannot be visualized; Grade 1+: Permits a better definition of both the optic nerve head and the retinal vessels (compared to higher grades); Grade 2+: Permits better visualization of the retinal vessels (compared to higher grades); Grade 3+: Permits the observer to see the optic nerve head, but the borders are quite blurry; Grade 4+: Optic nerve head is obscured.</description>
