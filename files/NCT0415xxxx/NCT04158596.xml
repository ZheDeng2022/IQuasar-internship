    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of SDX-3101 for&#xD;
      treatment of adult patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) by&#xD;
      investigating a vibration pattern of SDX-3101 compared to a control&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common disease (e.g. 11% of adults in the UK report&#xD;
      symptoms of CRS) leading to substantial health and socioeconomic burden with estimated&#xD;
      healthcare costs in the USA of $772/patient/year (2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRS is characterised by the long-term presence of multiple symptoms including facial&#xD;
      pain/pressure in about 80% of CRS patients. Factors contributing to the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      adult CRS include allergies, bacterial biofilms, asthma and exposure to various environmental&#xD;
      pollutants. Computed tomography (CT) scans are often used to identify mucosal thickening and&#xD;
      to identify any comorbid factors such as anatomic abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known from the literature that low vibration frequency can improve blood flow,&#xD;
      significantly reduce inflammation, and increase the fibroblast activity [13]. Therefore,&#xD;
      SynDermix AG created the innovative high-technology, portable medical device SDX-3101&#xD;
      targeting a disease with high unmet medical need. The device offers a drug-free or eventually&#xD;
      an add on treatment complying with the maximum demands of safety for the patients potentially&#xD;
      avoiding undesirable drug effects or surgery. SDX-3101 is indicated for treatment of CRSsNP&#xD;
      in adults&#xD;
