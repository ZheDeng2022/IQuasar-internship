  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No study to date has compared topical DTZ to MEBO ointment in the treatment of anal fissure.&#xD;
      Therefore, the present study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of DTZ to MEBO in the&#xD;
      treatment of acute anal fissure. The investigators propose to conduct a comparative&#xD;
      randomized clinical study. In this study, the investigators will compare patients with acute&#xD;
      anal fissure receiving MEBO ointment vs Topical DTZ ointment vs a combination of MEBO and DTZ&#xD;
      ointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEBO in combination with DTZ is more effective than DTZ or MEBO alone in the treatment of&#xD;
      acute anal fissure.&#xD;

      Trial Design: This trial is designed as a 1:1:1 randomized, controlled, parallel design. The&#xD;
      primary endpoints are change in pain score and wound healing from baseline to 1 week from the&#xD;
      study start date; secondary endpoints are change in pain score and wound healing at 6 and 10&#xD;
      weeks from the study start date, defecation strain score &amp; the patient's global impression of&#xD;
      improvement at 10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments &amp; Visits: The patient will be assessed for pain, wound healing, strain during&#xD;
      defecation, impression of improvement, &amp; adverse events at weeks 1, 6 &amp; 10 after the study&#xD;
      start date. Trained resident or research assistant (RA) will administer the questionnaires on&#xD;
      pain score, strain during defecation, &amp; patient's global impression of improvement. During&#xD;
      the follow-up visits, the average score for each of the pain &amp; defecation strain scores will&#xD;
      be taken for the 3 most recent days that the patient has defecated. The patient will be given&#xD;
      a paper diary to record the pain score &amp; strain score during defecation 3 days prior to the&#xD;
      follow-up clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: The investigators will design this superiority trial as three-arm trials, where&#xD;
      one arm is Diltiazem, second is MEBO, &amp; last is a combination of both. Assuming that the pain&#xD;
      score difference between both treatments will be 0.5 points with a 1-point standard deviation&#xD;
      on the numeric rating scale (5 for DTZ &amp; 3 for combination arm DTZ &amp; MEBO), &amp; using an alpha&#xD;
      of 0.05 &amp; a power of 80%, a sample size of 47 patients in each arm is needed. After&#xD;
      accounting for a 30% loss to follow up, 61 patients will need to be recruited in each arm.&#xD;
      The total number of patients to be recruited in the three arms is 183 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: At the American University of Beirut Medical Center, patients with acute anal&#xD;
      fissure are treated at the outpatient center (private &amp; outpatient clinics) of the hospital&#xD;
      by all the general surgeons. The patients will be introduced to the study by their attending&#xD;
      physician. If the patient agrees to participate, the RA (part of the research team) will&#xD;
      approach &amp; screen the patient according to the defined inclusion &amp; exclusion criteria. If the&#xD;
      patient is found eligible for the study, the RA will discuss the study &amp; obtain his/her&#xD;
      informed consent. The expected recruitment rate is 4 patients/week. The first 2 visits of the&#xD;
      patient to the clinic at weeks 1 &amp;6 from the start date of the study are part of clinical&#xD;
      care &amp; the patient will not be reimbursed for these visits. The last visit to the clinic that&#xD;
      will take place at week 10 will be for follow-up as part of the research, so the patient and&#xD;
      physician will be reimbursed for transportation and professional fees, respectively, by the&#xD;
      research grant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASSIGNMENT OF INTERVENTIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence Generation: Participants will be randomly assigned to their treatment in a 1:1:1&#xD;
      ratio, according to a computer-generated schedule, stratified by type of treatment (MEBO or&#xD;
      DTZ), using permuted blocks of variable sizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation Concealment Mechanism: Random sequence generation will be selected by CRI&#xD;
      biostatistician using computer software. The CRI person will hold details of the blocking &amp;&#xD;
      block sizes in a separate document unavailable to those involved in the study so ensure&#xD;
      allocation concealment. The CRI person will not share the treatment intervention with study&#xD;
      personnel until baseline characteristics are collected, &amp; the patient is recruited into the&#xD;
      trial. The physician will contact the CRI biostatistician &amp; receive treatment allocation, so&#xD;
      he/she can prescribe the ointment to which the patient is randomized to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation: The CRI biostatistician, who is not involved in this study, will generate the&#xD;
      randomization sequence &amp; keep hold of it. The patient will be recruited &amp; consented without&#xD;
      any knowledge about their allocation arm. The allocation will be revealed only to the&#xD;
      physician to administer the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding: The physician &amp; the patient will not be blinded to the allocation, but the rest of&#xD;
      the study team will be blinded. It is difficult to blind the physician or patient because of&#xD;
      the characteristic smell of MEBO that is easily recognizable. Also blinded to allocation is&#xD;
      the physician who will assess for outcomes, the RA who are collecting the data, &amp; data&#xD;
      analyst.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION, MANAGEMENT, &amp; ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Methods: Data on basic demographics of the study subjects, relevant risk&#xD;
      factors, confounders, &amp; indication for the type of treatment will be collected at baseline&#xD;
      using protocol-specific standardized case report forms (CRF). The CRF will be completed by&#xD;
      the RA directly from patients, following informed consent &amp; prior to the administration of&#xD;
      treatment. The different sections of that data will be collected at the different points in&#xD;
      time of the study by questionnaires administered by the study RA to the patient. Evaluators&#xD;
      are requested to fill immediately a case report form each time an outcome evaluation on a&#xD;
      study subject is performed. These forms will be handed in the same setting to the RA who will&#xD;
      take care of storing them. To improve retention &amp; compliance to the study, the investigators&#xD;
      will contact the patient ahead of time, &amp; help schedule their clinic visits on time to&#xD;
      collect the outcomes. When a patient fails to comply with the follow-up exams, the&#xD;
      investigators will collect applicable data on the phone (Appendix C). For those who drop from&#xD;
      the study, the investigators will analyze their basic demographic &amp; disease data to determine&#xD;
      whether or not those are similar to those who stayed on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management: The RA will enter the data from the CRFs on the study data excel sheet&#xD;
      within 1 week of its collection. The data will be manually entered twice &amp; independently by&#xD;
      the RA &amp; another member of the study team. Data will be entered as the actual numeric values&#xD;
      or categorical variables, initially. In the end, the statistician will code all the data in&#xD;
      preparation for analysis. The principal investigator (PI) will perform spot checks on the&#xD;
      data &amp; will review weekly all the CRF &amp; assessment collection sheets performed within each&#xD;
      week. At AUBMC, data will be stored on the AUB intranet server on the PI's computer. All&#xD;
      research members will have access to the data. The Case Report Forms will be stored in a&#xD;
      locked cabinet in the PI office 3 years following the publication of study results. The&#xD;
      investigators will provide an SOP detailing data management procedure to ensure consistency&#xD;
      in case of a change in the study members. Audits will be performed monthly on 20% of the&#xD;
      charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods: the investigators will compare the three arms for the primary,&#xD;
      secondary, &amp; exploratory outcomes. The investigators will use the chi-square or Fischer exact&#xD;
      test if the expected count of any of the outcomes is less than 5 per cell for analysis of the&#xD;
      incidence of categorical outcomes (like wound healing). The investigators will use the&#xD;
      independent t-test for analysis of the continuous outcomes (like pain score, defecation&#xD;
      strain score, Patient's Global Impression of Improvement). The investigators will calculate&#xD;
      relative risk with corresponding 95% confidence intervals to compare the incidence of the&#xD;
      categorical outcomes while reporting a difference in means for the continuous outcomes. SPSS&#xD;
      version 20 will be used to conduct the analysis. A 2 sided p-value will be set at 5%. The&#xD;
      univariate analysis will be performed separately for the two primary outcomes &amp; the three&#xD;
      secondary outcomes at weeks 1, 6 &amp; 10. Multivariate analysis for change in pain score &amp; wound&#xD;
      healing will be performed using linear regression and logistic regression respectively,&#xD;
      controlling for age, gender, duration of the anal fissure since presentation, analgesic&#xD;
      medications intake (only with pain score), defecation strain score. The investigators will&#xD;
      perform both ITT &amp; PP analysis for all outcome measures. The ITT analysis will include all&#xD;
      patients randomized per arm. In case of failure of treatment in one of the arms, those who&#xD;
      will switch to another arm will be still analyzed as part of the arm initially randomized to.&#xD;
      Multiple imputation methods will be used to handle missing data. To assess the effect of&#xD;
      missing data on the analysis, sensitivity analyses will be performed. The study&#xD;
      biostatistician will perform the best case scenario, worst-case scenario, &amp; group averages.&#xD;
      The investigators will assess the baseline characteristics of those who will be lost to&#xD;
      follow up, which would help understand what were the potential outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MONITORING&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Monitoring Committee: The DMC will be independent of the PI &amp; funders of the trial &amp;&#xD;
      composed of a surgeon, an internist, a nurse, a biostatistician, &amp; a representative from the&#xD;
      patient advocacy office at AUBMC. The internist will have a clinical research background. The&#xD;
      nurse is chosen from the inpatient floors, to make sure that there is no interaction with&#xD;
      study subjects. All members should not have any conflict of interest related to the study.&#xD;
      The DMC will be chaired by the internist, who has to keep a record of the meetings &amp;&#xD;
      recommendations for future reference. Since this is an investigator-initiated trial, the PI&#xD;
      will appoint the DMC members. The DMC will meet every other month, at times of scheduled&#xD;
      interim analysis, &amp; upon conclusion of the study. The primary role of the DMC is to review&#xD;
      accumulating data &amp; alert the steering committee if there are alarming rates of side effects&#xD;
      (SE) in any arm of the trial. This committee doesn't have executive power to stop the trial&#xD;
      or modify treatment. The committee will report results to the PI. In addition, the DMC will&#xD;
      keep track of the accrual rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim Analysis: The interim analysis will be done 3 times throughout the study; upon&#xD;
      recruiting quarter, two-quarters, &amp; three-quarters of the study population. The study&#xD;
      biostatistician who is blind to the treatment allocations will conduct the interim analysis &amp;&#xD;
      will use the O'Brien Fleming stopping rules. The study biostatistician will report the&#xD;
      results of the interim analysis to the DMC confidentially. At each interim-analysis&#xD;
      interpretation, the DMC will alert the PI if one arm is found to be beyond doubt either more&#xD;
      beneficial or more harmful than the other arm. The PI will take into consideration the&#xD;
      results of the interim analysis, opinion of the DMC, &amp; various important factors to decide&#xD;
      upon the fate of the trial. The chairperson of the DMC will monitor the ClinicalTrials.gov&#xD;
      website for registration of new trials &amp; for newly reported results from trials addressing&#xD;
      the similar questions as this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Harms: The adverse effects can be part of the outcome measures detailed earlier in the&#xD;
      protocol or other not specified SEs. Either way, any SE will be reported &amp; the subject will&#xD;
      be managed according to the standard of care or the preference of the treating physician. In&#xD;
      case any adverse effects arise outside scheduled follow-up time, the patient will be seen by&#xD;
      the treating physician in an extra add-on visit. Those who fail (meaning those who do not&#xD;
      report any pain improvement after two weeks of treatment) from either the MEBO or the&#xD;
      Diltiazem arm will be switched to the combination arm. If these patients also fail to improve&#xD;
      after 2 weeks on the combination arm, then the patient will be offered surgery. If the&#xD;
      patient refuses to switch to the combination arm &amp; wishes to proceed to surgery immediately,&#xD;
      then the patient will be directed to surgery. In case of failure of the treatment, which is&#xD;
      after 6 weeks of treatment, the patient will undergo surgery. The patient may also undergo&#xD;
      surgery in case he/she decides to stop medical therapy during the treatment period &amp; proceed&#xD;
      to surgery. There is no standard for the risk of failure of topical therapy to necessitate&#xD;
      surgery. Hence, the risk of failure cannot be evaluated with the use of MEBO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary physician who is treating the patient will be responsible for the management of&#xD;
      the SEs.&#xD;
