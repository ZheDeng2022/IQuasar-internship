  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and Obesity is a growing health problem worldwide. Lifestyle changes such as&#xD;
      decreased physical activity, increased sedentary behaviour and unhealthy eating habits has&#xD;
      contribute to this problem. According to World Health Organization (2016), more than 1.9&#xD;
      billion adults aged 18 years and older were overweight (39% of men and 40% of women).Regular&#xD;
      exercise is the key contributor to energy expenditure and is essential for energy balance and&#xD;
      weight control. Interval training (IT) has been commonly used for decades with purpose to&#xD;
      improve body health and reduce weight loss and this exercise differs from the conventional&#xD;
      aerobic exercise and endurance exercise as IT typically involves repeated bouts of relatively&#xD;
      intense exercise interspersed by periods of lower- intensity effort or complete rest for&#xD;
      recovery. One of the most common type of IT is sprint interval training (SIT). SIT involves&#xD;
      'supramaximal' effort (&gt;100% VO2max) work bouts, traditionally structured as four to six 30s&#xD;
      all-out effort and each round separated by 4 minutes of recovery period of a low intensity&#xD;
      exercise. Potential physiological adaptation of SIT are highlighted by various studies&#xD;
      reporting cardiovascular, skeletal muscle adaptations, increase fat oxidation that facilitate&#xD;
      increases in both aerobic and anaerobic performance. In addition, SIT is able to improve&#xD;
      maximal rate of oxygen consumption (VO2max), at the same time improving the peripheral&#xD;
      vascular structure and function, enzymes of fat metabolism and increases insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
      Previous SIT studies have included young healthy men and women, healthy obese young women,&#xD;
      all of which have shown that SIT is effective for fat loss and improvement of some health&#xD;
      parameters. However, whether SIT protocol is equally effective in improving the&#xD;
      anthropometric measures in men and women remain unknown.&#xD;

      Total of 80 eligible male (n=40) and female (n=40) young adults will be equally recruited&#xD;
      using block randomization and chosen based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Before&#xD;
      the study, all participants will be informed of the potential risks and benefits of the&#xD;
      study. During the study period, participants will be instructed to avoid any form of physical&#xD;
      activity besides the study protocol. Both groups will perform SIT protocol on a&#xD;
      electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer three times per week for 6 weeks. Every session,&#xD;
      participants start with a 5 minutes warm up at 50- 60% of heart rate maximum (HRmax) and&#xD;
      follow by four 30-s all out bouts intersperse with 4 minutes of recovery (passive or no load&#xD;
      cycling). For confirmation of all-out effort, participant are required to maintain his or her&#xD;
      cycling cadence at least 60 rpm or above. Intervention will end with a 5 minutes cool down at&#xD;
      50- 60% of HRmax. Total duration for each session will be 28 minutes. If a participant misses&#xD;
      fewer than three sessions per week non- consecutively, the sessions missed will be replace at&#xD;
      the end of period. However, if participants misses three or more sessions, he or she will be&#xD;
      excluded from the study. Outcome measures will be assessed at baseline and at end of 6 weeks&#xD;
      of intervention.&#xD;
