    <textblock>
      To study the etiology and the epigenetic pathways leading to and regulating chronic itch.&#xD;
      Similarly, to examine the mechanisms underlying skin changes, including epigenetic&#xD;
      alterations while also testing the efficacy of medications, especially topical intervention.&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim to examine chronic sensory disorder mechanisms related&#xD;
      to chronic itch.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Itch was recently identified as one of the top three priority topics in dermatology at a&#xD;
      Research Agenda Conference sponsored by the American Academy of Dermatology in 2012. Chronic&#xD;
      itch is a complex phenomenon, involving the skin, immune and nervous systems to various&#xD;
      degrees. Therefore, focusing on a particular pruritic disease will enable us to work out the&#xD;
      underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that occur between the skin and the brain to&#xD;
      establish a rational treatment approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is defined as a chronic inflammatory dermatological disease&#xD;
      characterized by immunological and neurological cutaneous hyperreactivity with ongoing itch&#xD;
      and inflammation. It is linked to an atopic predisposition with skin barrier abnormalities,&#xD;
      recurrent delayed-type inflammations; frequently the development of IgE-mediated inhalant and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal-related immediate type reactions. It is estimated that the prevalence for AD&#xD;
      is at least 17% of the population lifetime worldwide with some reports of increasing&#xD;
      prevalence in the last decades. It is also increasingly being observed in the aging&#xD;
      population with dry, itchy skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various topical and systemic therapies are available and choices are based on disease extent,&#xD;
      presence of acute flare, and age of the patient. Unfortunately, itch in AD can be challenging&#xD;
      to control; although multiple topical and systemic treatments are available, to date no&#xD;
      universally accepted treatment exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have previously shown that opioid receptors play an important role in&#xD;
      pruritus. Therefore, the investigators plan on expanding on previous and ongoing experiences&#xD;
      with opioid antagonists and study the epigenetic and molecular mechanisms behind. Moreover,&#xD;
      the investigators have recently discovered that the endogenous opioid ligand Met-Enkephalin&#xD;
      influences circadian rhythm by binding directly to CLOCK gene promoters in the nucleus, which&#xD;
      then change the amplitude and phase-shift these genes in keratinocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultimately, the investigators would like to evaluate the effectiveness of topical application&#xD;
      of Naltrexone in an effort to potentially help to treat chronic, untreatable itch and learn&#xD;
      more about peripheral disorders of sensation (itch and pain).&#xD;

    <description>For the study arm A, to evaluate circadian rhythm of itching, patients will record for 7 days 6 times daily in a booklet the itch intensity on a visual analog scale (VAS) scale. These time points for itch intensity recording will be hours after time of awakening (AW), so they will be AW+2h, AW+4h, AW+6h, AW+8h, AW+10h, AW+12h. Patients are to document all their pruritus attacks at these time points. On day 8 the investigators will collect suction blisters (4-5 10mm blisters) at these 6 time points from unaffected skin on the trunk. For this purpose, the investigators will use the commercially available 47mm orifice plate (Electronic Diversities, Finksburg MD, USA) with 4-5 x10mm openings for each time point and use the 4-5 1mm blister roofs for harvesting.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients will start with placebo in week 2 and move on to naltrexone treatment in week 3. There will be a wash-in phase during week 1. Following week 2 and week 3, at visits 3 and 4, patients will be asked for the area where they are experiencing most intense itch and the investigators will take suction blisters from that area before any treatment. They will be told to bring the medication they have been using and they will apply this topically. After an hour, another suction blister will be taken from the same area. This will ensure the study is still blinded as neither the physician or the participant will know whether the medication was a placebo or not. Participants may apply their topical treatment as often as he wishes.</description>
