      This is a single arm, multi-center, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      tisagenlecleucel in Chinese pediatric and young adult subjects with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)&#xD;

      The study will have the following sequential phases for all subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-Treatment (Cell Product Preparation and Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment and Follow-up Tisagenlecleucel infusion should occur within 16 weeks of&#xD;
           informed consent. The total duration of the study is 5 years. After tisagenlecluecel&#xD;
           infusion, efficacy will be assessed monthly for the first 6 months, then quarterly up to&#xD;
           2 years and semi-annually afterwards up to 5 years, or until the subject relapses.&#xD;
