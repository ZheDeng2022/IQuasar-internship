      Introduction Adult living related donor hepatectomy is associated with pain due to the&#xD;
      sub-costal j-shaped incision, rib retraction using Thompson retractor, and diaphragm&#xD;
      irritation1. The incidence of severe pain after donor hepatectomy is 11 to 37%2. Therefore&#xD;
      adequate analgesia is important for optimum perioperative safety profiles and speedy&#xD;
      recovery. Poor pain management is associated with risk of atelectasis, respiratory failure,&#xD;
      and delayed discharge from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      so this study is comparison of two technique (Thoracic epidural analgesia vs Erector spinae&#xD;
      plane block) to relieve pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) is commonly used for pain management in donor&#xD;
      hepatectomies. TEA reduces activation of the sympathetic outflow, surgical stress response,&#xD;
      and pain-associated tachycardia and hypertension which can cause perioperative myocardial&#xD;
      ischemia. TEA decreases stress-induced gastrointestinal disruption, immunosuppression, and&#xD;
      decreases postoperative opioid requirement. TEA promotes expiratory intercostal and abdominal&#xD;
      muscle tone and facilitates diaphragmatic excursion thus reduce the risks of atelectasis,&#xD;
      pneumonia, and respiratory failure. However, TEA has its own drawbacks, e.g. hypotension&#xD;
      caused by the inhibition of the sympathetic outflow, which can be associated with the&#xD;
      administration of large amounts of crystalloids and colloids. Other complications may include&#xD;
      failure to produce analgesia in 20% of patients3, intravascular cannulation leading to local&#xD;
      anesthetic toxicity, unintentional dural punctures, paraesthesia, post-operative&#xD;
      coagulopathies, epidural abscess, and epidural hematomas resulting in paraplegia1, 3.&#xD;
      Considering these merits and demerits, TEA is the widely accepted choice for postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia in living related donor hepatectomies1, 3,4, 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is a novel ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia technique&#xD;
      described in 2016 6 for the management of thoracic and abdominal pain. Ultrasound guidance is&#xD;
      used to inject a local anesthetic in the interfacial plane between the erector spinae muscle&#xD;
      and the associated transverse process of the spine. The mechanism of action is by the spread&#xD;
      of local anesthetic anteriorly to the dorsal and ventral rami of the thoracic and abdominal&#xD;
      spinal nerves 7. The absence of blood vessels in this vicinity shows the usefulness of this&#xD;
      technique in the patients, who are prone to coagulopathies making it safer with lesser&#xD;
      expertise, and with less procedural complications 8. The ESPB is an avascular plane block&#xD;
      therefore, it results in lower plasma volumes rise due to reduced uptake of the local&#xD;
      anesthetic by plasma hence the duration of action of local anesthetic is long. An ESPB at T5&#xD;
      level is sufficient to have a unilateral multi-dermatomes sensory block ranging from T1 to L3&#xD;
      level10 when used as a continuous block. Various case reports demonstrate its efficacy in a&#xD;
      wide spectrum of specialities like acute and chronic pain management, thoraco-abdominal&#xD;
      surgeries, neuropathic and post-traumatic pain 4, 7, 8,9 , 10. A comparison of continuous&#xD;
      epidural versus single shot intrathecal morphine was made and assessed the quality of&#xD;
      analgesia by a visual analog scale (VAS) and the additional IV analgesic requirements were&#xD;
      56% in cases of epidural 11 used for sample size calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, no randomized control study has been performed to compare the efficacy of a&#xD;
      continuous ESPB with that of a continuous TEA for living related donor hepatectomies. Thus&#xD;
      the aim of this study is to compare the postoperative analgesic efficacy and adverse effects&#xD;
      of continuous ESPB to that of a continuous TEA in patients undergoing adult living donor&#xD;
      hepatectomies. Investigators have hypothesized that continuous ESPB would provide better&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia with fewer adverse effects. The primary outcome is post-operative&#xD;
      pain scores using the visual analog scale (V.A.S) for pain at rest and at maximal inspiration&#xD;
      during the post-operative period at PACU, 1, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours. The secondary outcomes&#xD;
      include lung incentive spirometry volumes, the dosage of adjunct nalbuphine used,&#xD;
      hypotension, tachycardia, post-operative coagulopathy, early mobilization and discharge from&#xD;
      surgical I.C.U (S.I.C.U).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology After approval from the institutional and ethical review board and written&#xD;
      informed consent, patients were randomized into either the TEA group or the ESPB group using&#xD;
      the sealed enveloped method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The study will be a single-blinded, prospective, comparative, randomized control&#xD;
      trial. The participants will be assigned to one of two groups; Group A will include patients&#xD;
      receiving continuous TEA, whilst Group B will include patients receiving continuous ESPB.&#xD;
      Both groups will receive their respective intervention after induction with standard general&#xD;
      anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding is done at the level of assessor. The primary assessor will be blind with the type&#xD;
      of technique applied and fill the Proforma according to standard routine with the same drug&#xD;
      infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population The study will include all adult patients undergoing elective living related&#xD;
      donor hepatectomies for liver transplant surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting Study will be conducted in the liver transplant operating rooms of Shifa&#xD;
      International Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration The study duration will be of up to 12 months from the date of approval of the&#xD;
      study from the hospital's institutional and ethical review board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Randomization will be done by the simple random sampling technique using the&#xD;
      sealed envelope method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Sample size was calculated by the WHO sample size calculator and using the&#xD;
      following parameters; Level of significance - 5% Power of the test - 80% Proportion of&#xD;
      patients requiring opioid in epidural group - 0.56 (ref no.13) Anticipated proportion of&#xD;
      patients requiring opioid in ESP group - 0.25 Sample size - 30 patients in each group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction of General Anaesthesia In the operating room, the patient will be positioned on the&#xD;
      operating table; the standard monitors: non-invasive blood pressure, ECG, pulse oximetry will&#xD;
      be applied. A 20 gauge intravenous cannula will be secured on the dorsum of the hand and&#xD;
      connected to a maintenance intravenous fluid therapy. The patient will be pre-oxygenated for&#xD;
      3 minutes with oxygen. The patient will be administered injection Ondansetron (0.1mg/kg) and&#xD;
      injection Midazolam (0.02mg/kg) intravenous to start with. The patient will be induced with&#xD;
      injection Buprenorphine (0.02mg/kg) and injection Propofol (2 mg/kg) mixed with Lidocaine (60&#xD;
      mg), and atracurium (0.5 mg/kg), after which an endotracheal tube will be inserted and&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation will be initiated. A radial arterial line and a central venous line&#xD;
      will be inserted. Both TEA and ESPB catheters will be placed after induction of general&#xD;
      anesthesia for surgery by experienced practitioners in the left lateral decubitus position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Data for the study will be collected by a standardized performa which will&#xD;
      record all the required variables of the study. Confidentiality of patient's data will be&#xD;
      maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis The data will be analyzed by using the IBM SPSS software, version 25.0, for&#xD;
      Windows.&#xD;
