  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) refractory to treatment is marked by failure of fear&#xD;
      extinction and its biological substrate, amygdala reactivity to trauma reminders. Decades of&#xD;
      research have clarified the neuronal mechanisms coordinating fear extinction and&#xD;
      consolidation. Fear cells and extinction cells in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) alter their&#xD;
      firing rate based on the nature of the stimulus and the influence from the medial prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex (mPFC) and the ventral hippocampus (vHPC). Together, the BLA, mPFC, and the vHPC form&#xD;
      an anxiety-processing network where the BLA links stimulus to emotion, the vHPC provides&#xD;
      memory context, and the mPFC coordinates extinction or consolidation. Local field potential&#xD;
      (LFP) recordings from the BLA have revealed specific signals that correspond to an enhanced&#xD;
      fear state. Previous studies have shown that neuromodulation of the BLA can promote&#xD;
      extinction in a rodent model and in a treatment-refractory PTSD patient. This action is&#xD;
      likely carried by disrupting fear signals within the BLA; however, continuous&#xD;
      neurostimulation may also disrupt normal function of the amygdala. The present application&#xD;
      proposes to investigate the use of Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS, Neuropace) in six (6)&#xD;
      veterans suffering from severe treatment-resistant PTSD. This dual-activity device will allow&#xD;
      us to chronically record LFPs from the BLA under specific conditions such as fear&#xD;
      conditioning, exposure to trauma reminders, and emotional memory encoding and retrieval. In&#xD;
      addition, the neural activity will be captured during real-life symptoms of flashback and&#xD;
      nightmares. These recordings will provide the specific electrophysiological biomarkers of&#xD;
      hypervigilance and re-experiencing. The device will then be programmed to detect and treat&#xD;
      these biomarkers with a pre-determined electrical pulse. The patients will be followed&#xD;
      prospectively using psychological scales but also with functional neuroimaging and&#xD;
      electroencephalograms. These modalities will be used to determine the extent of circuit&#xD;
      engagement as a result of the therapy. By approaching PTSD from a fear processing mechanism&#xD;
      perspective, our project will serve as a proof of concept for other circuit-based therapies&#xD;
      in psychiatry. This proposal is a multi-departmental effort involving 11 investigators across&#xD;
      7 departments and requires a close collaboration between clinical and basic scientists. As a&#xD;
      result, the findings underlying chronic recordings will bridge the basic science results from&#xD;
      fear conditioning research to clinical neural processes in PTSD patients.&#xD;
