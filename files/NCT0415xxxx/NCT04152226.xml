  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open- label, single- dose, dose escalating evaluation of the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of three dose levels of DBI-001 in patients with Tinea pedis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the current protocol is to establish the safety and tolerability of a single&#xD;
      application of J. lividum to the feet of patients with proven T. pedis. In addition, the&#xD;
      effect of J liv on the T. pedis will also be evaluated.&#xD;

      Open- label, single- dose, dose escalating evaluation of the safety and tolerability of three&#xD;
      dose levels of DBI-001 in patients with Tinea pedis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives and Purpose The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of DBI-001 in patients with Tinea pedis. Secondly to evaluate presence or&#xD;
      persistence of J. lividum of DBI-001 following a single application of DBI-001. Thirdly to&#xD;
      see the effect on the abundance of T. rubrum. Lastly to see the effect of a single&#xD;
      application of DBI-001 on the signs and symptoms of interdigital T. pedis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tolerability will be evaluated through assessment of selected local signs and symptoms (pain&#xD;
      / burning / stinging, pruritus, erythema, edema, and scabbing / crusting). Any local skin&#xD;
      reaction that requires use of a concomitant therapy or study discontinuation will be reported&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A single center open label dose escalating study design will be used in a population of patients with interdigital Tinea pedis. Each subject will have a single application of the test article applied to each foot. The three test articles will be a low dose, medium and a high dose of J. lividum. Each of the three groups will have 4 subjects. After the first cohort has completed their day 7 visits and if no significant tolerability of safety issues is identified the second cohort will be enrolled. After the second cohort has completed the day 7 visits and if no significant tolerability or safety issues are identified the third cohort will be enrolled.&#xD;
At all evaluations, signs and symptoms of application site reactions will be recorded at baseline, as well as days 2, 3, 7, 14, and 28.</intervention_model_description>
