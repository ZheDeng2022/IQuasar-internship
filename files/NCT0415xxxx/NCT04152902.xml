  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapy for end-stage achalasia is under debate: comparative data on the long-term functional&#xD;
      results of myotomy and oesophagectomy are lacking. The study aimed to compare the objective&#xD;
      outcomes and quality of life after oesophageal myotomy and oesophagectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study included 31 patients (57 years) who underwent the Heller-Dor procedure with&#xD;
      verticalisation of the distal oesophagus (pull-down technique dedicated to sigmoid oesophagus&#xD;
      treatment) and 29 patients (recurrence free, 64 years) (p=0.539) who underwent oesophagectomy&#xD;
      for end-stage achalasia or for cancer, extracted from a database designed for prospective&#xD;
      clinical research. The objective outcomes of treatment were evaluated with semi-quantitative&#xD;
      scales investigating dysphagia, reflux symptoms and endoscopic oesophagitis. Quality of life&#xD;
      was assessed with the SF-36 questionnaire.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients were extracted from a database designed for prospective clinical research on benign&#xD;
      and malignant oesophageal diseases. For this study, the investigators considered patients who&#xD;
      underwent operations for end-stage achalasia from January 1987-July 2018 and patients who&#xD;
      survived after primary esophagectomy for oesophageal cancer between January 2008 and December&#xD;
      2018 without undergoing neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy. End-stage achalasia was diagnosed on&#xD;
      the basis of clinical history, upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy and barium swallow&#xD;
      results (oesophageal diameter larger than 6 cm, distal oesophagus kinked towards the left&#xD;
      side, outside the axis). Standard oesophageal manometry, or more recently, high-resolution&#xD;
      manometry, was routinely performed. Cases of pseudo-achalasia (oesophageal dilation secondary&#xD;
      to organic stenosis of the cardia) were excluded based on clinical, endoscopic and histology&#xD;
      patterns. In the presence of end-stage achalasia Pull-down Heller-Dor was the first primary&#xD;
      treatment option for patients with the following: a) no severe mucosal inflammation or&#xD;
      moderate/high grade dysplasia and b) redo surgery exclusively for dysphagia relapse due to&#xD;
      insufficient myotomy. Esophagectomy was the treatment of choice for patients with the&#xD;
      following: a) relapsed dysphagia after myotomy due to scarring that caused stenosis of the&#xD;
      cardia, b) iterative surgery, c) cancerization risk patterns, and d) a diagnosis of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pull-down Helle-Dor procedure aimed to restore the vertical axis of the intraabdominal&#xD;
      portion of the oesophagus as much as possible. In brief, before performing the myotomy and&#xD;
      the anterior fundoplication, at least 6 cm of the mediastinal oesophagus was fully isolated;&#xD;
      two or more U intramuscular stitches were applied on the curling of the right side of the&#xD;
      oesophagus, pulled down and rotated towards the right side of the gastro-oesophageal&#xD;
      junction. The pull-down Heller-Dor operation was performed under manometric control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophagectomy was performed with open technique, or recently, with a minimally invasive&#xD;
      technique. The stomach was always the oesophageal substitute, and the oesophagogastric&#xD;
      anastomosis was preferably located at the thoracic dome or at the neck to minimize the risk&#xD;
      of postoperative reflux oesophagitis or cancer growth in the residual dilated oesophagus.&#xD;
      Patients who underwent esophagectomy for cancer not related to achalasia were extracted from&#xD;
      the relative case series to form a control group that matched the end-stage achalasia study&#xD;
      group according to age and surgical technique; these patients had not undergone neoadjuvant&#xD;
      or adjuvant chemotherapy and were cancer free at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of achalasia symptoms was calculated starting from the date of onset to the date&#xD;
      of surgery at the investigator's institution. After surgery, the patients underwent a timed&#xD;
      follow-up composed of clinical interviews, upper GI tract barium swallow and endoscopy. The&#xD;
      symptoms were evaluated according to semi-quantitative scales graded from 0 (absence) to 3&#xD;
      (maximal intensity) based on Van Trappen's criteria for dysphagia and Visick's criteria for&#xD;
      gastro-oesophageal reflux. Upper GI endoscopy aimed to detect post Heller's myotomy reflux&#xD;
      oesophagitis, Barrett's oesophagus and areas suspected for dysplasia or cancer. Reflux&#xD;
      oesophagitis was initially assessed according to the Savary-Miller and Ismail Beigi criteria&#xD;
      and successively assessed according to the Los Angeles classification. The final outcome of&#xD;
      surgical therapy was assessed according to a semi-quantitative scale graded as excellent,&#xD;
      good, fair and poor, according to quantitative grades for dysphagia, reflux symptoms and&#xD;
      oesophagitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life was assessed by the version of the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36)&#xD;
      validated for Italy. The questionnaire was a generic Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL)&#xD;
      measure that investigated eight specific health domains: physical functioning (PF),&#xD;
      restrictions in activities due to physical (RP) or emotional health (RE), bodily pain (BP),&#xD;
      general health (GH), vitality (VT), mental health (MH) and social functioning (SF). The SF-36&#xD;
      scores for each health domain ranged from 0 (poor HRQL) to 100 (best HRQL). Patients&#xD;
      self-administered the questionnaires they received in mail for the specific purpose of this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
