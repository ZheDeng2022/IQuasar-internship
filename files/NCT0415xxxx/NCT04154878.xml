  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As we live longer our population experiencing heart failure (HF) continues to grow consuming&#xD;
      an increasing percent of healthcare dollars. Systolic heart failure or pump failure is easy&#xD;
      to recognize and measure and is expressed as ejection fraction. Diastolic heart failure (DHF)&#xD;
      or failure to fill adequately is much more difficult to quantify with no single measure or&#xD;
      number being used to express the severity instead groupings are used with normal and Grade I,&#xD;
      II or Grade III to classify with Grade III being the direst.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) and Heart Failure with Preserved&#xD;
      Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) are used to identify the primary clinical presentation of HF but do&#xD;
      not adequately describe the combined effect often presenting within the same subject. It is&#xD;
      estimated 35 to 50% of those with HFrEF, having Left Ventricle Ejection Fraction (LVEF) &lt;&#xD;
      50%, and 50 to 70% of those with HFpEF, having ejection fraction â‰¥ 50%, also have moderate to&#xD;
      severe diastolic dysfunction (DD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is two fold. The first is to determine if the rate of change&#xD;
      measured from the left ventricular inflow inspiratory phase Doppler waveform provides insight&#xD;
      into a cause of diastolic heart failure by comparing echocardiographic data points obtained&#xD;
      prior to and immediately following optimization of a bi-ventricular pacemaker. This HF&#xD;
      population requires an ejection fraction of 35 percent or lower to qualify for the device.&#xD;
      These echocardiograms have been previously completed and will be reanalyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second purpose is to determine if relationships between different features of a LV volume&#xD;
      curve can be used to generate a single number to describe global diastolic function using the&#xD;
      same echocardiograms from the pacemaker group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be compared to a small group of healthy normal participants as a control for&#xD;
      validation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to introduce novel measurements to improve the classification of&#xD;
      ventricular diastolic performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 consists of 100 subjects who were referred and received echo&#xD;
      guided biventricular pacemaker optimization. This retrospective component data is being&#xD;
      retrieved to compare baseline and final cardiac performance measures. Comparisons will be&#xD;
      made between Doppler and 3D echo diastolic and systolic markers. The Doppler diastolic&#xD;
      markers will include D-E slope measuring the rate of pressure equalization between the left&#xD;
      atrium (LA) and left ventricle (LV) during inspiration and expiration. MV VTI, the velocity&#xD;
      time integral of the left ventricular inflow tract (LVIT) a surrogate measure for LV filling&#xD;
      volume, averaging three consecutive complexes and minimal and maximal variability. TDI,&#xD;
      tissue Doppler Imaging, when coupled with LVIT measures provides an estimation of left&#xD;
      ventricular diastolic pressure. IRT, isovolemic relaxation time, an indicator of LA preload,&#xD;
      S/D ratio, an indicator of LA compliance/pressure compared to pulmonary venous pressure. LAv,&#xD;
      LA volume, a criteria for diastolic dysfunction grading. TRvmax, tricuspid regurgitation&#xD;
      maximum velocity, used to estimate right ventricular systolic pressure. 3D measures will be&#xD;
      obtained from the volume curve generated from the 3D full volume image acquisition. The 2&#xD;
      slopes being compared are the initial filling (R1) and intermediate filling (R2) rates of&#xD;
      volume change over time or R1/R2. LV ejection fraction, diastolic filling time (DFT),&#xD;
      ejection time (ET), heart rate (HR), initial filling time (IFT), and stroke volume (SV) are&#xD;
      all being measured from the 3D volume curve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2 consists of normal healthy participants to serve as a comparison providing HF&#xD;
      diseased state differentiation. All baseline measures performed in cohort 1 will be done for&#xD;
      cohort 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective/Aim/Goal/Hypothesis Hypothesis: To determine if LV volume curves can be&#xD;
      used to generate a single number that globally describes diastolic function and identify&#xD;
      relationship to current grouping algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective/Aim/Goal/Hypothesis Hypothesis: To determine if the pulse wave Doppler of&#xD;
      the left ventricular inflow tract D-E slope measure and changes correlate with changes in&#xD;
      diastolic performance of the LV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Does weighting of the volume curve analysis with various features of the curve&#xD;
      such as stroke volume, initial filling volume, and initial filling volume percent provide&#xD;
      greater sensitivity or specificity in differentiating diastolic performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This study is a retrospective observational data analysis of echocardiographic&#xD;
      images and Doppler waveforms comparing data between measurements and calculations taken at&#xD;
      baseline and after final programming of biventricular pacemaker devices performed during a&#xD;
      single visit. Additionally, the echo data from 5 normal healthy participants will be acquired&#xD;
      during a single visit to establish normal values and demonstrate reproducibility.&#xD;
