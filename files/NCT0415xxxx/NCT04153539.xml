      This study aims to assess the effects of acute exposure to traffic-related air pollution and&#xD;
      the underlying mechanisms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized, crossover trial among 72 healthy young adults in&#xD;
      Shanghai, China. The eligible participants will be randomly divided into 2 groups (36&#xD;
      volunteers per group). During the first stage, participants will be requested to take one&#xD;
      walking task (from 13:00 to 17:30). The exposed group will walk along a busy road and be&#xD;
      exposed to traffic-related air pollution, while the control group will walk in a traffic-free&#xD;
      park. During the first 3 hours, all participants will rest for 30 minutes after each&#xD;
      15-minute walking. From 16:00, participants will stop walking and rest for 1.5 hours. Then&#xD;
      both groups will enter a 2-week washout period. In the second stage, there will also be one&#xD;
      walking task (from 13:00 to 17:30). The two groups will exchange their walking sites and&#xD;
      repeat the previous trial. Physical examinations will be performed both before and after each&#xD;
      walking task. Besides, we will ask volunteers to stay in school during the two days before&#xD;
      walking. Health examinations include symptoms questionnaires, blood pressure tests, Holter&#xD;
      monitoring, and spirometry. We plan to collect blood, urine, oropharyngeal swabs, and exhaled&#xD;
      breath condensate before exposure, about one hour after exposure, and next morning.&#xD;
