  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a) the feasibility of applying a painful exercise&#xD;
      program in the treatment of subacromial shoulder pain and b) the time needed to collect&#xD;
      clinical outcomes for a future randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise therapy is the first choice of treatment in the management of subacromial shoulder&#xD;
      pain (SSP). Guidelines suggest active rehabilitation program for at least three months and&#xD;
      existing research highlights the importance of progressive loaded exercise therapy at higher&#xD;
      dosage. However, it is not clear which is the best type of exercise and if pain should be&#xD;
      provoked during exercise. Recent research found that painful exercises are beneficial in&#xD;
      short term on pain and function in patients with different kinds of chronic musculoskeletal&#xD;
      pain. The aim of the future randomized clinical trial is to investigate if &quot;exercising into&#xD;
      pain&quot; gives better results in term of clinical outcomes compared to a non-painful exercise&#xD;
      program. Since the intervention consists in painful exercises, it is essential to test the&#xD;
      rate of adherence in the intervention group (both during physiotherapist-led session and&#xD;
      home-based exercises). Moreover, the practicability of clinical questionnaire via online&#xD;
      survey will be tested and the time needed to collect clinical data will be calculated as&#xD;
      well. Furthermore, feedback from physiotherapists and participants will be collected and&#xD;
      analyzed.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>measurement every week, change from baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is analysed in terms of attendance to the physiotherapist-led sessions and adherence to the home-exercise protocol. Good level of adherence is defined by: attendance of 7/9 (80%) of physiotherapist led-sessions and 22/27 (80%) days of home-exercises completed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>There are 13 items, divided in two subscales: pain (5 items) and function (8 items). Each item is scored from 0 (no pain/no difficulty) to 10 (worst imaginable pain/so difficult it requires help) on a NPRS. The final score is a percentage derived from an average of the two subscales, where higher score means worse outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Voluntary Contraction (MVC) in internal rotation, external rotation, scaption</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is measured with the Hand-Held Dynamometer. The unit of measure is Newtons.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Range of Movement (ROM) in internal rotation, external rotation, scaption</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is measured with the inclinometer. The unit of measure is degrees.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Scapular dyskinesis</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is measured with visual observation during the following clinical tests: 1) scapular dyskinesis at rest and during movement (loaded and unloaded, in abduction and in flexion); the presence of winging, tilting or abnormal scapular movement determines the judgement about scapular dyskinesis (yes/no) at rest and during movement; 2) the scapular assistance test (SAT); if the pain reduces after the SAT, the test is considered positive; 3) scapular retraction test (SRT); if the pain reduces after the SRT, the test is considered positive.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline,6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of 16 items and it has 2 subscales: Physical Activity (FABQ-PA, range: 0-24) and Work (FABQ-W, range: 0-42) higher scores mean more fear avoidance beliefs affecting physical activity and/or work.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fear of Pain Questionnaire (FPQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is a shortened version of the Fear of Pain Questionnaire-III. The total score ranges between 9 and 45; higher scores mean more fear and anxiety associated with pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Acromiohumeral Distance (AHD)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is measured with the Ultrasound machine at rest and at 60 degress of elevation in the scapular plane. (in millimiters)</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Supraspinatus tendon thickness (STT)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is measured with the Ultrasound machine in the Crass position (in millimeters)</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Occupation ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>AHD and STT will be combined in the occupation ratio to report how much space is occupied in the subacromial space, represented by the AHD, by the supraspinatus tendon. It is in percentage.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Global perceived effect (GPE)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week, 6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is measured on a 7-Likert Scale, ranging from 1 (way much better) to 7 (way much worse); higher scores mean worst global perceived effect.</description>
