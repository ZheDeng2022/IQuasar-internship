    <textblock>
      Background: Currently, periodontal treatment, both surgical and non-surgical, leaves sequelae&#xD;
      in the vast majority of patients, dentine hypersensitivity (HSD) is one of the most&#xD;
      important. For this reason, it is necessary to correctly diagnose this condition, to achieve&#xD;
      a correct treatment of it. HSD is a condition frequently, which has been described as acute,&#xD;
      provoked pain, which is not attributable to any other dental pathology. Its current&#xD;
      prevalence is unknown, but it occurs in most patients after their periodontal treatment, and&#xD;
      also in healthy patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Course objective: To compare the clinical efficacy in reducing dentinal hypersensitivity in&#xD;
      patients treated with dentifrices based on hydroxyapatite / 5% potassium nitrate / sodium&#xD;
      monofluorophosphate 1450ppm and 5% potassium nitrate / 1426ppm sodium fluoride, during a&#xD;
      period of evaluation of 8 weeks Materials and methods: A randomized clinical trial will be&#xD;
      conducted. Inclusion criteria will be: patients ≥ 18 years, dentinal hypersensitivity in at&#xD;
      least one tooth (incisors, canines, premolars) of analogous visual scale ≥4, healthy patients&#xD;
      and patients with pathologies, controlled, absence of pathologies that contraindicate&#xD;
      participation in the study. Exclusion criteria will include: teeth with extensive or&#xD;
      defective fillings, tooth decay and pulpitis, dental crack, unit fixed prosthesis and plural&#xD;
      fixed prosthesis, pregnant patients, regular anti-inflammatory treatment, allergy to any of&#xD;
      the components of the study, hypersensitivity treatment Recent dentistry Patients will be&#xD;
      assigned to two groups. The experimental group (n = 16) will be delivered with hydroxyapatite&#xD;
      nanocrystals (VITIS® sensitive) and the control group (n = 16) will be given a paste with 5%&#xD;
      potassium nitrate (Sensodyne True White), and after performing an instruction for use on the&#xD;
      first visit, four subsequent visits will be made at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after the initial&#xD;
      visit. At each visit the hard and soft tissue exam will be performed; and also cold, heat,&#xD;
      evaporative and electrical tests will be carried out on the teeth that will be included in&#xD;
      the study. The tests will be performed by two previously calibrated researchers, and then the&#xD;
      results will be entered into a computer program to perform the effectiveness calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: The results of the present study would demonstrate that there is a general&#xD;
      decrease in dentinal hypersensitivity in both groups, during the 8-week study period,&#xD;
      presenting a significantly greater improvement in dentin hypersensitivity in either of the&#xD;
      two control groups.&#xD;

      Keywords: Dentine hypersensitivity, desensitizing paste, hydroxyapatite, potassium nitrate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, periodontal treatment, both surgical and non-surgical, leaves sequelae in the vast&#xD;
      majority of patients. The loss of clinical insertion level could be an early indicator or a&#xD;
      possible risk factor for dentine hypersensitivity (HSD) (15). Therefore, it is necessary to&#xD;
      correctly diagnose this condition, to achieve a correct treatment of it, which can be&#xD;
      performed both in the clinic and at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HSD is a condition frequently present in individuals, leading them to seek help from a&#xD;
      dentist. It has been described as an acute, provoked pain, which is not attributable to any&#xD;
      other dental pathology. Its current prevalence is unknown, but it occurs in most patients&#xD;
      after their periodontal treatment, and also in healthy patients. (12) To determine the&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of HSD, it is necessary to deepen the history, the assessment of the&#xD;
      patient's pain through a self-assessment system such as the visual analogue scale (VAS), the&#xD;
      differentiation between other pathologies using different tools and clinical interpretation,&#xD;
      since that the ongoing processes that determine and maintain the opening and permeability of&#xD;
      dentinal tubules are still under discussion. Multiple therapeutic modalities are used to&#xD;
      manage HSD according to the intensity of pain and patient education, such as the use of&#xD;
      remineralizing, desensitizing, blocking, analgesic dentifrices to restorative dentistry&#xD;
      therapies, mucogingival surgeries, among others (14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research question of this study is: Is the application of a toothpaste based on&#xD;
      hydroxyapatite / 5% potassium nitrate / sodium monofluorophosphate 1450ppm nano-crystals more&#xD;
      effective compared to the application of a 5% potassium nitrate / fluoride toothpaste Sodium&#xD;
      1426ppm in the treatment of HSD? The general objective is to compare the clinical efficacy in&#xD;
      reducing HSD in patients treated with dentifrices based on nano crystals of hydroxyapatite /&#xD;
      5% potassium nitrate / sodium monofluorophosphate 1450ppm and potassium nitrate 5% / sodium&#xD;
      fluoride 1426ppm, during an evaluation period 8 weeks The importance of this study lies in&#xD;
      the lack of information and quality studies that really assess the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      various types of desensitizing toothpastes, so as to be clear about the most effective&#xD;
      dentifrices and direct the dentist in the treatment of HSD&#xD;
