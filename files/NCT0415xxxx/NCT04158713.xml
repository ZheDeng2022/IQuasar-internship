      2.3.3 Short technical protocol summary Background: Pregnant women represent a vulnerable&#xD;
      population for malaria. HIV-infected women are particularly at risk. In HIV-infected pregnant&#xD;
      women, WHO recommends daily cotrimoxazole (CTX), an antifolate drug, for malaria&#xD;
      chemoprevention and prophylaxis against opportunistic infection. However, there is&#xD;
      cross-resistance with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), and high levels of antifolate&#xD;
      resistance threatens the antimalarial effect of CTX. Recent trials with intermittent&#xD;
      preventive therapy (IPT) with mefloquine in HIV-infected women on daily CTX, suggested that&#xD;
      chemoprevention with an effective antimalarial markedly improves the protection against&#xD;
      malaria compared to daily CTX alone. However, mefloquine was not well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-acting combination of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) is well tolerated and has&#xD;
      shown great promise as IPTp in HIV-negative women in East-Africa. Chemoprevention with&#xD;
      monthly DP has also been explored in HIV-infected pregnant women on daily CTX in Uganda.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the study was inconclusive because malaria transmission was too low and a&#xD;
      clinically relevant drug interaction with efavirenz (EFV) was found reducing the exposure to&#xD;
      DP. WHO now recommends dolutegravir (DTG) based combination antiretroviral therapy (ARTs) as&#xD;
      the preferred firstline regimen including for pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimester of&#xD;
      pregnancy for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. As a result, many&#xD;
      countries in Africa are now transitioning to DTG-based combination antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
      (cARTs). No such drug-drug interaction is expected between DTG and DP. We will, therefore,&#xD;
      assess the safety and efficacy of malaria chemoprevention with monthly DP in HIV-infected&#xD;
      women on daily CTX and DTG-based cARTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and methods: This is a 2-arm, individually-randomized, multi-centre,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled superiority trial comparing the safety and efficacy of daily CTX plus&#xD;
      monthly DP ('CTX-DP') versus daily CTX plus monthly placebo-DP (i.e. 'CTX-alone', control&#xD;
      arm) to reduce malaria and the adverse effects of malaria in 898 (449 per arm) HIV-infected&#xD;
      pregnant women on DTG-based cARTs. The study will be conducted in 8 hospitals in Kenya and&#xD;
      Malawi in high SP-resistance areas with a high prevalence of malaria. These are the same&#xD;
      sites where the sister trial in HIV-uninfected women is being conducted in Kenya and Malawi&#xD;
      (IMPROVE trial). Both the mother and baby will be followed for 6-8 weeks after delivery. The&#xD;
      study is powered at 80% (alpha=0.05) to detect â‰¥50% relative risk reduction (RR=0.50) in the&#xD;
      primary outcome (cumulative incidence of malaria infection) from 12% in the CTX-alone arm&#xD;
      (control arm) to 6% in in the interventions arm allowing for 20% non-contributors. The trial&#xD;
      includes a pharmacokinetic assessment, cardiac monitoring for safety, assessment of&#xD;
      antimalarial drug and the impact on immune responses to malaria and other pathogens.&#xD;

      2.3.4 Long technical protocol summary Title: Chemoprevention with monthly IPTp with&#xD;
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for malaria in HIV-infected pregnant participants on daily&#xD;
      cotrimoxazole in Kenya and Malawi: a multi-centre placebo-controlled trial(IMPROVE-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and rationale: In malaria-endemic Africa, HIV and malaria conspire to increase the&#xD;
      risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes. For HIV-infected pregnant women, WHO recommends daily&#xD;
      cotrimoxazole (CTX) for chemoprevention for malaria and prophylaxis against opportunistic&#xD;
      infection. However, there is cross-resistance with SP, and high levels of antifolate&#xD;
      resistance threaten the antimalarial effect of CTX. Recent trials in HIV-infected pregnant&#xD;
      women who received daily CTX plus IPTp with mefloquine, suggested that chemoprevention with&#xD;
      an effective antimalarial markedly reduces the risk of malaria compared to daily CTX alone.&#xD;
      However, mefloquine was not well tolerated. The long-acting combination of&#xD;
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) is well tolerated and has shown great promise as IPTp in&#xD;
      HIV-negative women in East-Africa. Chemoprevention with monthly DP has also been explored in&#xD;
      HIV-infected women on daily CTX in Uganda. Unfortunately, the study was inconclusive as&#xD;
      malaria transmission was too low. Furthermore, a clinically relevant drug-drug interaction&#xD;
      between DP and efavirenz (EFV) was found to reduce DP drug levels. Following the&#xD;
      recommendation from WHO, many countries in Africa are transitioning from EFV-based to&#xD;
      dolutegravir (DTG) based combination antiretroviral therapy (cARTs). WHO now recommends&#xD;
      DTG-based cARTS as the preferred first-line cART regimen in the 2nd and 3rd trimester of&#xD;
      pregnancy. No such drug-drug interaction is expected between DTG and DP. We will therefore&#xD;
      assess the safety and efficacy of malaria chemoprevention with monthly DP in HIV-infected&#xD;
      women on daily CTX and DTG-based cARTs. We will therefore assess the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      malaria chemoprevention with monthly IPTp with DP in women on daily CTX and DTG-based cARTs&#xD;
      and daily CTX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall aim: To provide WHO with evidence on whether monthly IPTp-DP can improve current&#xD;
      policies to control malaria in HIV-infected pregnant women on daily CTX in areas with high&#xD;
      levels of parasite resistance and malaria in East and Southern Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To determine if monthly IPTp-DP in HIV-infected pregnant women receiving&#xD;
      daily CTX is safe and superior to daily CTX-alone for controlling malaria infection in areas&#xD;
      with high antifolates resistance to SP and CTX in Malawi and Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: Monthly IPTp-DP in women receiving daily CTX is superior to daily CTX-alone in&#xD;
      controlling malaria infection during pregnancy in HIV infected women on antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview Study Design: This multi-centre trial will be conducted in antenatal clinics in 8&#xD;
      hospitals in Kenya and Malawi located in areas with high prevalence of HIV and malaria and&#xD;
      with high anti-folate resistance of the malaria parasite. These are the same sites where the&#xD;
      sister trial in HIV-uninfected women (all gravidae) is being conducted in Kenya and Malawi&#xD;
      (IMPROVE trial: NCT03208179). Overall, 898 (449 per arm) HIV-infected pregnant women who are&#xD;
      16 to 28 weeks pregnant assessed by ultrasound dating, will be randomised to receive one of&#xD;
      the two interventions. Permuted block randomisation stratified by site (i.e. hospital) and&#xD;
      HIV-status (known-positive and newly-diagnosed) will be used. Allocation concealment will be&#xD;
      ensured by using sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes. The study will include&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic studies and cardiac monitoring in a sub group of women. Other components&#xD;
      include molecular marker studies of antimalarial resistance. We will also look at the impact&#xD;
      on biomarkers of placental function and trans-placental antibody transfer and multi-pathogen&#xD;
      neonatal cell mediated immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Interventions: Daily CTX for all trial participants receiving cARTs in addition to: a)&#xD;
      monthly-DP ('CTX-DP'), or b) monthly DP-placebo ('CTX-alone') (control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up procedures: Monthly visits during pregnancy, and then at delivery. Mother and&#xD;
      newborn follow-up at 7 days and 6-8 weeks post-partum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: The cumulative incidence of malaria infection detected from 2 weeks after&#xD;
      the first day of the first dose of the first course to delivery inclusive, defined as the&#xD;
      presence of peripheral (maternal) or placental (maternal) Plasmodium infection detected by&#xD;
      either molecular diagnostics (henceforth referred to as PCR), microscopy, RDT or placental&#xD;
      histology (active infection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: 898 (449 per arm), allowing for 20% loss to follow-up. Data Analysis:&#xD;
      Log-binomial regression will be used to analyse the primary outcome, controlled for site and&#xD;
      gravidity.&#xD;
