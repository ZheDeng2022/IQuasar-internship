  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV), if left untreated it&#xD;
      can lead to chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and cancer. HCV is a blood borne virus, the key&#xD;
      risk group for HCV infection are those who currently inject drugs, or have done in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For many years the treatment of chronic HCV infection was based on therapies that had&#xD;
      significant side effects, long treatment period and were between 50-70% effective, this&#xD;
      impacted on patient acceptability and compliance. However, for those completing the treatment&#xD;
      and undergoing this &quot;personal trial&quot; literature describes the transformative experience of&#xD;
      HCV cure and how people took steps towards a &quot;normal life&quot; moving beyond substance use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent advances in Direct-Acting Antiviral (DAA) medicines available to cure HCV have&#xD;
      transformed treatment with shorter treatment periods, few side effects, ease of&#xD;
      administration and improved efficacy. However, there is a potential paradox, in that the&#xD;
      DAA-based regimes provide a reliable cure, for a large majority of patients, with a&#xD;
      relatively small treatment burden, but may not be a &quot;personal trial&quot; and may have a lesser&#xD;
      impact on rehabilitation and recovery from substance use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The success of attempts of the group cured of HCV with DAAs, to progress down a recovery&#xD;
      pathway and to resume activities thought of as being part of normal citizenship, are&#xD;
      therefore unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the types of activities that people cured of HCV undertake and the&#xD;
      success of their recovery pathway, post-treatment with DAAs over a two year follow-up period.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study uses an ethnographic case study approach using mixed methods to describe the&#xD;
      journey towards citizenship of people cured of HCV with DAAs through their recovery from&#xD;
      substance use. Qualitative and quantitative data will be collected from participants in a&#xD;
      series of three interviews over the course of a two year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data collated will describe the views and experiences of those in this specific&#xD;
      social situation and examine how this narrative evolves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data (Substance use (WHO ASSIST 3.0 Q2), Social Identity mapping, Short&#xD;
      Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS), Participant capture form data - financial&#xD;
      inclusion, household income and employment data) will be collected to demonstrate a physical&#xD;
      quantifiable change to allow for data triangulation to describe the phenomenon under study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ethnographic case study will be delivered through the immersion of a qualitative&#xD;
      researcher within the context of a community centre providing care for people who use drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cairn Centre in Dundee is a partnership with Hillcrest, NHS Tayside, Dundee City Council&#xD;
      and other voluntary sector partners. The centre is placed at the heart of the community in&#xD;
      Dundee City and acts as an interface between people who inject drugs and the agencies that&#xD;
      are established to support them. The Cairn centre offers a drop-in recovery cafe run by&#xD;
      volunteers, providing a warm and welcoming environment for anyone interested in recovery. The&#xD;
      atmosphere allows informal support for people with their recovery and a chance to socialise&#xD;
      and meet other people in recovery. The centre also provides a backdrop for a variety of other&#xD;
      sources of support available including drug and alcohol treatment, Blood Borne Virus testing&#xD;
      and treatment, dentistry, ophthalmology, sexual health service, Keep Well Health checks,&#xD;
      welfare and legal advice, housing and homeless advice, families mutual aid, overdose&#xD;
      prevention training and naloxone as well as a variety of recovery groups helping people&#xD;
      develop new skills and interests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cairn centre is Dundee's busiest injecting equipment provision (IEP) provider and&#xD;
      provides support and advice to active drug users as well as those in more advanced stages of&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also utilise other locations to capture the views of others who may not visit&#xD;
      this setting. Utilising other locations adds to the validity of the study to capture the&#xD;
      universe of experiences of those with problematic substance use treated with direct-acting&#xD;
      antivirals and recognises that as people progress along a recovery journey their social&#xD;
      setting may change. Other locations include drop-in services, hubs and Recovery Cafes run by&#xD;
      third sector partners within Dundee, Angus and Perth &amp; Kinross Health and Social Care&#xD;
      Partnerships. NHS Tayside locations that provide drug services and community pharmacy&#xD;
      contractors will also be utilised as locations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethnographic case study Development of semi-structured interviews. An inductive approach will&#xD;
      be taken to develop semi-structured interviews. A cohort of participants will be interviewed&#xD;
      using broad, open interviews to explore the universe of experiences of this participant group&#xD;
      in relation to substance use, testing and/or treatment of hepatitis C with direct&#xD;
      acting-antivirals and life circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Themes will be explored until there is a consensus and no new emerging themes are identified.&#xD;
      Explicit and Implicit emergent themes from the inductive interviews will be explored and&#xD;
      evaluated by the researcher with triangulation within the research team alongside the&#xD;
      literature and evidence of the theoretical frameworks &quot;Recovery Capital&quot; and &quot;Identity&#xD;
      Theories&quot; to generate qualitative research questions. The qualitative research questions will&#xD;
      be further explored by developing semi-structured interviews around the themes identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researcher observation field notes The researcher will record participant observations during&#xD;
      the interviews to provide rich verbatim descriptions of the specific situations, events and&#xD;
      behaviours of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thematic Analysis Thematic analysis will be used to identify, analyse and report patterns&#xD;
      (themes) within the data using the computer assisted qualitative data analysis package NVivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coding strategy will be open and emergent to allow new and emerging themes to be captured&#xD;
      accurately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researcher triangulation of themes and coding strategy will be used to validate themes and&#xD;
      minimise researcher bias. Cohen's Kappa coefficient will be reported at each stage to assess&#xD;
      interpreter agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each interview and observation stage themes identified by the research team will be&#xD;
      validated with participants to check the interpretation captured both implicit and explicit&#xD;
      meanings of the pervious interview. This will be carried out at the end of the interview to&#xD;
      minimise recall bias and influence of current interview stage answers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The narrative and connecting analysis completed after the second interview stage will allow&#xD;
      for a theory to be generated describing an authentic and accurate narrative of the personal&#xD;
      value of cure of Hepatitis C. This theory will be tested at the final interview stage to&#xD;
      allow for causal validation using the approaches of modus operandi and searching for negative&#xD;
      cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data collection Participant Capture Form Participant data will be collected at&#xD;
      baseline, 2nd visit and 3rd visit to record age, gender, ethnic background, financial&#xD;
      inclusion, household income and employment data, current and/or previous treatment for&#xD;
      problematic substance use and any previous history of hepatitis C infection. Baseline is&#xD;
      defined in this study as first visit after consent is given. Questions that cannot change&#xD;
      will only be asked at baseline, for example ethnic origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked questions to identify demographics to ensure participants are&#xD;
      purposively selected to describe the universe of themes and experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questions included are part of the Scottish Survey Core Questions and are recommended for&#xD;
      use in other surveys due to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparability across surveys is improved&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thoroughly tested questions to provide confidence that participants understand what is&#xD;
           being asked&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questions have been widely consulted on to reduce risk of offence when asking questions&#xD;
           about a sensitive subject The researcher will assist the participant to complete these&#xD;
           questions. Participants may decline to answer these questions if they find the subject&#xD;
           difficult or embarrassing, in this event this will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      World Health Organisation Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (WHO&#xD;
      ASSIST 3.0) The Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) was&#xD;
      developed for the World Health Organization (WHO) to detect and manage substance use and&#xD;
      related problems in primary and general medical care settings. This study will utilise&#xD;
      Question 2 of the WHO ASSIST screening tool to provide a measure of substances used and&#xD;
      frequency within the last three months. The question uses a 5 point Likert scale to provide a&#xD;
      quantitative measure of substance use at that point in time. The participant will complete&#xD;
      this form with the assistance of the researcher if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social Identity Map- Ascertaining identity resources (SIM - AIRing) The participants will be&#xD;
      asked to place their social networks on a mapping tool that will provide a graphic&#xD;
      representation of the social network at that point in time. The participants name will not be&#xD;
      recorded on the map, only the participant ID number. The map will demonstrate the number of&#xD;
      social contacts within the network, a measure of the relationship (inner circle, outer circle&#xD;
      and influence) and the substance use status of the members of the network. Participants will&#xD;
      be asked to assign pseudo identities for their social network members. The pseudo identity is&#xD;
      known only to the participant and will be insufficient for the researcher to identify an&#xD;
      actual person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will rate the importance of their social network members (indicated by&#xD;
      placing them in the inner or outer circle) and indicate their status as user, non-user or in&#xD;
      recovery. Social contact pseudo identities will be assigned coloured dots to indicate their&#xD;
      status: red for active user, green for non-user and blue for individuals in recovery. This&#xD;
      tool provides a quantitative measure of social network and will be mapped at each interview&#xD;
      stage so that longitudinal insights into the change in social influences may be clearly&#xD;
      described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher will assist the participant to complete this map.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS) Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      complete the self-reported short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS) with&#xD;
      assistance from the researcher if required. The measure is a list of 7 positive mental health&#xD;
      statements with 5 response categories assigned scores and the total scores calculated.&#xD;
      Movements in the total wellbeing score have been valuated using the wellbeing valuation&#xD;
      method and represent the additional money the average individual would need to improve their&#xD;
      wellbeing, which is the same as the improvement in their SWEMWBS score. This measurement can&#xD;
      then be used to calculate a social value impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection A baseline measure of patient demographics will be recorded at the first&#xD;
      interview stage and at each interview to describe any changes over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed over a 2 year interval with an aim of 3 contacts over that&#xD;
      period. Interviews at baseline and followed up between 6-18 months after baseline and at the&#xD;
      end point over a 2 year period. Qualitative and Quantitative data will be collected and&#xD;
      analysed at each interview stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A narrative of the final destinations achieved for those cured of HCV using DAAs will be&#xD;
      reported with a description of how this cure changes participant's perspectives on their&#xD;
      place in society, a personal value of a cure and changes in social network structures.&#xD;
