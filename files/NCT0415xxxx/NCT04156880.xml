  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer among women in worldwide and the second leading&#xD;
      cause of cancer-related death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the corner stone of BC screening, mammography is recognized as one of useful imaging&#xD;
      modalities to reduce BC mortality, by virtue of early detection of BC. However, mammography&#xD;
      interpretation is inherently subjective assessment, and prone to overdiagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI)-Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems,&#xD;
      characterized by embedded deep-learning algorithms, have entered into the field of BC&#xD;
      screening as an aid for radiologist, with purpose to optimize conventional CAD system with&#xD;
      weakness of hand-crafted features extraction. For now, stand-alone performance of novel&#xD;
      AI-CAD tools have demonstrated promising accuracy and efficiency in BC diagnosis, largely&#xD;
      attributed to utilization of convolution neural network(CNNs), and some of them have already&#xD;
      achieved radiologist-like level. On the other hand, radiologists' performance on BC screening&#xD;
      has shown to be enhanced, by leveraging AI-CAD system as decision support tool. As increasing&#xD;
      implementation of commercial AI-CAD system, robust evaluation of its usefulness and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness in clinical circumstances should be undertaken in scenarios mimicking real&#xD;
      life before broad adoption, like other emerging and promising technologies. This requires to&#xD;
      validate AI-CAD systems in BC screening on multiple, diverse and representative datasets and&#xD;
      also to estimate the interface between reader and system. This proposed study seeks to&#xD;
      investigate the breast cancer diagnostic performance of AI-CAD system used for reading&#xD;
      mammograms. In this work, we will employ a commercially available AI-CAD tool based on&#xD;
      deep-learning algorithms (IBM Watson Imaging AI Solution) to identify and characterize the&#xD;
      suspicious breast lesions on mammograms. The potential cancer lesions can be labeled and&#xD;
      their mammographic features and malignancy probability will be automatically reported. After&#xD;
      AI post-processing, we shall further carry out statistical analysis to determine the accuracy&#xD;
      of AI-CAD system for BC risk prediction.&#xD;

        This is a single institutional retrospective cohort study of patients with mammographic&#xD;
        examinations. All patients' data will be retrieved via the electronic patient database of&#xD;
        our institution. Patient demographics, imaging and histological data, disease and treatment&#xD;
        history will be recorded, including age at onset, details of chemotherapy, time interval of&#xD;
        metastasis from diagnosis, surgery for the primary tumor, the length of survival, clinical&#xD;
        outcome and so on.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who had undergone standard mammography including craniocaudal (CC) and&#xD;
             mediolateral oblique (MLO) views..&#xD;

          -  Histopathology-proven diagnosis is available for patients with breast malignancy,&#xD;
             including invasive breast cancer, carcinoma in situ, and borderline lesion et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As reference standard of benign nature, results from pathology or clinical long-term&#xD;
             follow-up (&gt;=2 years) examinations are available for cases without breast malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

          -  Patients without available pathologic diagnosis or long-term follow-up (&gt;=2 years)&#xD;
             examinations.&#xD;

             mammoplasty) prior to first mammography.&#xD;
