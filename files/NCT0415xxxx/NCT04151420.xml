  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic relapsing immune mediated inflammatory disease&#xD;
      (IMID) of the gastrointestinal tract. Like all IMIDs (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis) a&#xD;
      complex interaction between a genetically altered immune response, the gut microbiota and&#xD;
      environmental factors is causing the disease. Systemic suppression of the immune response&#xD;
      with corticosteroids, immunomodulatory, biologicals and combination therapies increases the&#xD;
      risk of opportunistic infections in IBD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on mild and moderate infections in medically treated IBD patients is scarce, mainly&#xD;
      since infections treated by the general practitioner or in an outpatient setting are not&#xD;
      systematically registered in real life. To help gastroenterologists with clinical decision&#xD;
      making, real world data with long term follow-up concerning the risk for infectious&#xD;
      complications, is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several observations underline the importance of real world data on mild and moderate&#xD;
      infections in medically treated IBD patients. Mild and moderate infections mostly have a&#xD;
      benign course, but they take longer to clear and have a large impact on (work)disability and&#xD;
      quality of life in IBD patients. Recurrent infections influences peoples willingness to use a&#xD;
      drug and negatively effects adherence. Furthermore, recurring mild and moderate infections&#xD;
      might prognosticate serious infections, and systematic assessment of all infections could be&#xD;
      used to timely adjust treatment regimens and prevent serious infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators of this study previously developed a questionnaire on self-reported&#xD;
      infections according to the FDA guideline for patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) by&#xD;
      interviewing 36 patients with IBD and through input of expert meetings with&#xD;
      gastroenterologists, IBD specialists, rheumatologists, immunologists and IBD-nurses. This&#xD;
      questionnaire has already been implemented in myIBDcoach, a validated telemedicine system&#xD;
      implemented in routine care for over 4000 patients with IBD in the Netherlands. Assesment of&#xD;
      reliability and validity are the last steps in validation of this remote monitoring tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study the investigators aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the reliability, construct validity and criterion validity of a remote monitoring&#xD;
           tool (questionnaire) for infections as last step in the validation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the relative risk of all infections (mild, moderate and severe) in a real-life&#xD;
           population for IBD patients on different maintenance treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identify the predictors and risk factors of mild and moderate infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assess the relation between patient reported infections and the risk for serious&#xD;
           infectious complications&#xD;

    <description>There will be no treatment intervention in the current study (no drugs will be used). Instead, patients are enrolled in a routine care eHealth care-pathway with myIBDcoach. MyIBDcoach (MijnIBDcoach, Dutch, Sananet Care B.V., Sittard, The Netherlands, https://www.mijnibdcoach.nl) is a web-based platform for home-monitoring and patient- provider communication in patients with IBD.&#xD;
Patients already using the myIBDcoach will be informed on this study. Patients will be asked to continue routine care including monitoring of PROs through the myIBDcoach. When a patient completes the infections disease questionnaire for the first time, this will be regarded as the starting point (T=0) for this patient. Patients will complete the questionnaire every three months after the starting point as part of their routine follow-up. Results from these questionnaires will be stored electronically and will be analyzed alongside medical records of GP's and drug delivery data from pharmacies.</description>
