      This single-arm, non-randomized, dose escalation phase I clinical trial will assess primarily&#xD;
      the safety and secondarily the efficacy of episcleral topotecan in patients with active de&#xD;
      novo or recurrent intraocular retinoblastoma in at least one eye following completion of&#xD;
      first-line therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Retinoblastoma is the most common pediatric malignant intraocular tumor and originates from&#xD;
      the retina. Treatment of eyes with advanced intraocular retinoblastoma remains a challenge.&#xD;
      The historic standard of care for patients with unilateral disease is enucleation and for&#xD;
      those with bilateral disease, a variety of modalities have been tried. These include&#xD;
      radiation therapy, systemic chemotherapy, periocular administration of chemotherapy,&#xD;
      selective intra-arterial chemotherapy, and intravitreal chemotherapy. Unfortunately, all of&#xD;
      these modalities are associated with significant morbidity and investigators are looking for&#xD;
      new ways to treat these patients either with novel directed drug delivery methods or with new&#xD;
      less toxic agents. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of topotecan delivered&#xD;
      directly to the eye using a novel sustained-release topotecan episcleral delivery system&#xD;
      (also referred to as a Chemoplaque) in patients with active de novo or recurrent intraocular&#xD;
      retinoblastoma in at least one eye following completion of first-line therapy. The study&#xD;
      intervention involves the insertion and removal of the Chemoplaque, examinations under&#xD;
      anaesthesia (EUAs), visits to clinic to monitor for adverse events throughout, and post&#xD;
      plaque removal toxicity evaluation. EUAs, clinic visits and laboratory tests are standard of&#xD;
      care for retinoblastoma patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age: Participants must be &lt; 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnosis and Treatment. Participants must have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Unilateral Group D or earlier-stage intraocular retinoblastoma in which enucleation is a&#xD;
        recommended therapy, with no previous local or systemic therapy for retinoblastoma with&#xD;
        intraocular calcium in the tumor-containing eye by ophthalmic ultrasound or neuroimaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR Active residual or recurrent intraocular retinoblastoma in at least one eye following&#xD;
        completion of first-line therapy (focal therapy for IIRC Group A eyes, or systemic or&#xD;
        intra-arterial chemotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        One eye will be the Study Eye. When participants have two eyes with retinoblastoma, the eye&#xD;
        with worst disease or best vision potential will be designated the Study Eye. There will&#xD;
        only be one eye per child treated in this Phase I study, since treatment of two eyes would&#xD;
        double the systemic dose of drug. The Non-study eye will be treated by standard of care,&#xD;
        with only focal therapy during the Study Period, if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must have demonstrated intraocular calcium in the tumor-containing eye by ophthalmic&#xD;
        ultrasound or by neuroimaging as part of standard retinoblastoma diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Study eye must have vision potential, at least light perception vision in the tumor-bearing&#xD;
        eye either with pupil response testing or demonstration of avoidance behavior to light&#xD;
        presentation in the affected eye, and no clinical features suggestive of high risk of&#xD;
        extraocular extension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Performance Level: Lansky greater than or equal 50 (&lt;16 years of age); Karnofsky&#xD;
        performance scale of &gt;50 (&gt;16 years of age).&#xD;

                  defined as not receiving platelet transfusions for at least 7 Days prior to&#xD;
                  enrollment)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin greater than or equal 8.0 g/dL at baseline (may receive RBC&#xD;
                  transfusions)&#xD;

&#xD;
             6 to &lt; 7 years 1 1&#xD;
&#xD;
             The threshold creatinine values in this Table were derived from the Schwartz formula&#xD;
             for estimating GFR utilizing child length and stature data published by the CDC.&#xD;

        the investigator) within one week prior to initiation of protocol therapy are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy and lactation. Females of reproductive potential must have a negative serum&#xD;
        pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to initiation of protocol therapy. Due to the unknown&#xD;
        but potential risk for adverse events (AEs) in nursing infants secondary to treatment of&#xD;
        the mother with the study agents, breastfeeding must be discontinued if the mother is&#xD;
        treated on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Compliance. Any condition of diagnosis that could in the opinion of the Principal&#xD;
        Investigator or delegate interfere with the participant's ability to comply with the study&#xD;
        instruction, might confound the interpretation of the study results, or put the participant&#xD;
        at risk.&#xD;
