    <textblock>
      The utilization of doxycycline for SBP prophylaxis is a novel practice at MDMC. Therefore, an&#xD;
      assessment of safety and efficacy is needed in order to generalize this practice. The&#xD;
      publication of this study can potentially introduce a new alternative to guideline-directed&#xD;
      therapies for secondary prevention of SBP. Doxycycline is non-inferior to guideline-directed&#xD;
      therapies regarding safety and efficacy in primary and secondary prophylaxis for SBP.&#xD;

      Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a common and serious complication in cirrhotic&#xD;
      patients with a reported mortality rate of 20 to 30%.1-3 A SBP diagnosis requires abdominal&#xD;
      paracentesis and is made in the presence of an elevated ascitic fluid absolute&#xD;
      polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) count without an evident intra-abdominal, surgically&#xD;
      treatable source of infection.2,3 Common pathogens associated with SBP are Gram-negative&#xD;
      colonic organisms. However, in recent years, Gram-positive pathogens have become more common,&#xD;
      suggesting the need to evaluate SBP management.1,4-6 The recurrence rate of SBP after an&#xD;
      initial episode has been reported to be as high as 70%.1-3 Currently, the American&#xD;
      Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) and European Association for the Study of&#xD;
      the Liver (EASL) guidelines recommend the use of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, norfloxacin,&#xD;
      or ciprofloxacin for the prevention of recurrent SBP. Fluoroquinolones as a class have had&#xD;
      increased black box warnings in recent years, making ciprofloxacin fall out of favor for&#xD;
      long-term prophylaxis.5 Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim is extensively metabolized by the liver&#xD;
      and is contraindicated in marked liver impairment.8 Therefore, it is necessary to search for&#xD;
      a prophylaxis alternative with similar efficacy and a better safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doxycycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers Gram-positive bacteria, including&#xD;
      Streptococcus spp., resistant strains of Staphylococcus and Enterococcus, and Gram-negative&#xD;
      bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae. One randomized trial in cirrhotic patients with a&#xD;
      previous episode of SBP showed that doxycycline was associated with a reduction in&#xD;
      inflammatory markers, such as interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein, suggesting potential&#xD;
      benefits of doxycycline in this patient population.7 At Methodist Dallas Medical Center&#xD;
      (MDMC) and the Liver Institute at MDMC, doxycycline has been utilized for both primary and&#xD;
      secondary prevention of SBP. In order to compare doxycycline with guideline-directed&#xD;
      therapies for SBP prevention in cirrhotic patients, a retrospective, cohort study was&#xD;
      designed to review patients who meet the criteria from July 2014 to July 2018. This study&#xD;
      aims to compare the efficacy of doxycycline with that of guideline recommended therapies for&#xD;
      primary and secondary SBP prophylaxis, the safety of doxycycline with that of guideline&#xD;
      recommended therapies for primary and secondary SBP prophylaxis, and identify the association&#xD;
      between chemoprophylaxis and the risk of infections from multidrug resistant organisms&#xD;
      (MDROs) in SBP.&#xD;
