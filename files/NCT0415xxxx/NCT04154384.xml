  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall hypothesis of this randomized-controlled trial is that the introduction of a Life&#xD;
      Care Specialist (LCS) as a novel member of the clinical care team will help reduce opioid&#xD;
      utilization, decrease pain scores, and improve patient understanding of their addiction risk&#xD;
      in the aftermath of orthopaedic trauma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioids are psychoactive substances (narcotics) primarily used for pain relief by producing&#xD;
      morphine-like effects. Although regularly prescribed by physicians, opioids (including&#xD;
      morphine, codeine, and oxycodone) are highly addictive. Opioids block feelings of pain and&#xD;
      trigger a release of dopamine. Dependence occurs with repeated use, as the parts of the brain&#xD;
      naturally responsible for releasing dopamine rely on the drug for proper function. When&#xD;
      avoided, patients quickly experience severe withdrawal symptoms similar to the flu.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the United States, millions are prescribed opioids for pain relief. Every day, more than&#xD;
      115 people die from overdose. The highest among them are people aged 25 to 54 years.&#xD;
      Addiction treatment costs near $78.5 billion and rising, less than 10% of people in need are&#xD;
      receiving it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the orthopaedic trauma population at Grady Healthcare in Atlanta, Georgia, 20% of&#xD;
      patients report a history of substance abuse, 30% have previously used opioid medications for&#xD;
      pain, and nearly 25% report taking opioid pain medications up to 1 year after their trauma.&#xD;
      Trauma patients are particularly at high risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Christopher Wolf Crusade (CWC) is a 501C3 non-profit providing preventative solutions,&#xD;
      education, and advocacy for the American opioid epidemic. CWC's primary focus is to introduce&#xD;
      a behavior-specific intervention at the time of inpatient hospitalization for trauma to&#xD;
      decrease overall opioid utilization and improve pain control in the post-trauma time period.&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to introduce the LCS to the healthcare field to focus on pain&#xD;
      management and addiction prevention for patients. The LCS is a behavior-based pain &quot;coach&quot;&#xD;
      who educates patients on risks of opioid dependence and offers non-traditional&#xD;
      non-pharmacologic options for pain control. In addition, the LCS will act as a liaison&#xD;
      between the patient and the physician to ensure that traditional pharmacologic-based pain&#xD;
      control regimens are optimized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pain management protocol was refined through a pilot, single-center study where the LCS&#xD;
      provided personalized pain management strategies to patients combating pain. Participants in&#xD;
      the single-arm pilot portion of the study were enrolled beginning in February 2020 and data&#xD;
      collection for these 121 participants was completed April 15, 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical trial portion of this study will include 200 patients who will be consented,&#xD;
      enrolled, and randomized in a 1:1 fashion to A) receive the current standard-of-care for pain&#xD;
      management in the aftermath of trauma or B) additional LCS intervention. All participants&#xD;
      will have the same quantity and quality of interaction with their usual clinical providers&#xD;
      and will be followed in the orthopaedic trauma clinic at routine post-operative intervals (2&#xD;
      weeks, 6 weeks and 3 months post-operatively).&#xD;

    <description>For participants in the dual-arm, clinical trial portion of the study, severity of insomnia, sleep disruption, and sleep quality over the past seven days is assessed with the 4-item PROMIS Sleep Disturbance - Short Form. Responses are given on a 5-point Likert scale where 1 is equivalent to best possible and 5 is equivalent to worst possible. Raw scores are converted to t-scores ranging from 0 to 100, with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. Scores below 50 indicate better sleep than the average person.</description>

Responses to the 4 items are given on a 5-point Likert scale where 1 = unable to do and 5 = without any difficulty. Raw scores are converted to t-scores ranging from 0 to 100, with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. Scores above 50 indicate better physical function than the average person.</description>

    <description>For participants in the dual-arm, clinical trial portion of the study, the extent to which pain has impeded engagement with social, cognitive, emotional, physical, and recreational activities over the past 7 days is assessed with the PROMIS Pain Interference - Short Form. Responses to the 4 items are given on a 5-point Likert scale where 1 = not at all and 5 = very much. Raw scores are converted to t-scores ranging from 0 to 100, with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. Scores below 50 indicate less pain interference than the average person.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Opioid Literacy Tool (OLT) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (during inpatient hospitalization), Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>For participants in the dual-arm, clinical trial portion of the study, accuracy of knowledge about opioids (3 questions) and opioid-related risks (5 questions) is assessed with an OLT. Accuracy of opioid knowledge responses are given on a dichotomous scale (yes/no). Responses for accuracy of knowledge about opioid-related risks are given on a 7-point scale where 1 = definitely true and 7 = definitely false. For these 5 questions, total scores range from 5 to 35 and higher scores indicate improved literacy (accurate understanding of prescription opioid addiction-risk, opioid dependance and risk of opioid overdose).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Primary Care Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Screen (PC-PTSD-5) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>For participants in the dual-arm, clinical trial portion of the study, the Primary Care Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Screen for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5; PC-PTSD-5) will be administered. The PC-PTSD-5 is a 5-item instrument used to assess previous exposure to traumatic events and subsequent presence of the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Responses are given as &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; and each response of &quot;yes&quot; is scored as one point. Total scores range from 0 to 5 where higher scores indicate greater symptoms of PTSD. In primary care settings, a minimum of 3 points is considered probable PTSD.</description>

    <measure>Patient Satisfaction Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>For participants in the single-arm pilot study and in the dual-arm, clinical-trial portion of the study, patient satisfaction with clinical care will be assessed with a modified Press Ganey Integrated Survey. Integrated study-specific questions will align with the conventional rating scale of &quot;strongly agree&quot; - &quot;strongly disagree&quot;. This survey will capture a comprehensive picture of each participant's care experience. Higher scores indicate higher satisfaction and will be compared among study arms and to the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) comparative feedback database.</description>

    <description>In addition to receiving current standard-of-care for pain management in the aftermath of trauma, participants will have the full communication of opioid risk - via the validated Opioid Risk Tool (ORT) and a detailed substance abuse and mental health screening. As part of the daily LCS intervention, the inpatients will engage in behavioral pain management, opioid education and harm-reduction strategies (naloxone education), while also being screened for eligibility for respective referrals for complex needs, such as mental health and substance use disorders. Upon discharge, each participant will be educated by the LCS on future available modes of contact (telephone, email, video-call, follow up- visits at 2-, 6- and 12-weeks).</description>
