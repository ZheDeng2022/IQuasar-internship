  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior to caesarean section, patients should fast from solid food for 6 hours and from clear&#xD;
      fluids for 2 hours. Carbohydrate drinks can also be consumed up to 2 hours before surgery.&#xD;
      These drinks have been shown to improve patient well-being after surgery and may potentially&#xD;
      improve the neonatal blood glucose level after delivery and reduce the risk of a low blood&#xD;
      glucose level. This study aims to assess the influence of pre-operative carbohydrate drinks&#xD;
      on blood glucose levels of the baby at delivery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients recruited to the study will be randomised to one of 3 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will receive standard care as per our current practice. This includes fasting from&#xD;
      solids for 6 hours prior to surgery and clear fluids for up to 2 hours prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 will receive a carbohydrate (CHO) drink preoperatively as well as adhering to&#xD;
      standard care. Patients will be allowed to drink this CHO drink as required from admission to&#xD;
      hospital on the morning of their surgery. They will also receive a further 400ml bolus at 2&#xD;
      hours prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 will receive an apple juice drink preoperatively as well as adhering to standard&#xD;
      care. Patients will be allowed to drink this apple juice drink as required from admission to&#xD;
      hospital on the morning of their surgery. They will also receive a further 400ml bolus at 2&#xD;
      hours prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the start of surgery, the patients non-dominant hand grip strength will be assessed&#xD;
      using the dynamometer. Their subjective sense of thirst and hunger will be assessed. Their&#xD;
      fasting times for food and fluids will be recorded. The patients' blood glucose will be&#xD;
      measured from a blood sample as their intravenous cannula is inserted. The maternal urinary&#xD;
      ketones will be measured from a urine sample upon insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neonatal blood cord glucose will be measured from both an arterial and venous cord blood&#xD;
      sample after delivery. This will be performed by the trained anaesthesia research fellow.&#xD;
      Should hypoglycemia be identified, the hospital's neonatal hypoglycemia algorithm will be&#xD;
      followed appropriately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be followed up at 24 hours by an outcome assessor blinded to the group&#xD;
      allocation. Numerical rating scale (NRS) pain scores, postoperative nausea and vomiting and&#xD;
      quality of recovery will be assessed at the patients beside. All neonates will be followed up&#xD;
      to calculate admissions to neonatal unit and the number of glucose sachets required for&#xD;
      hypoglycemia.&#xD;
