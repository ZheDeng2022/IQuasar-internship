  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is focused on estimating the impact of a tele-sleep intervention on&#xD;
      patient-centered outcomes relevant to former football players, including a) sleep duration,&#xD;
      quality, and daytime impairment; b) pain, pain catastrophizing, physical and emotional&#xD;
      functioning; c) mood; d) quality of life, with the longer-term goal to evaluate the impact on&#xD;
      cardiovascular health risk. The evidence-based 'Brief Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia' (BBTI)&#xD;
      will be utilized and tailored it to meet the needs of former football players.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot work will serve as the foundation for a larger, future clinical trial that&#xD;
      utilizes a durable approach for improving sleep health with potential influence pain and&#xD;
      quality of life as well as future studies to evaluate the implementation and scalability of&#xD;
      BBTI in novel populations.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will plan to enroll 40 participants. Players will be recruited from the&#xD;
      Harvard Football Players Health Study cohort from across the US via email and telephone&#xD;
      invitations. Following screening, if the participant is eligible and interested, they may&#xD;
      consent to enroll in the study. Participants will receive evidence-based 'Brief Behavioral&#xD;
      Therapy for Insomnia' (BBTI), tailored to meet the needs of former football players. BBTi is&#xD;
      a brief, efficacious treatment that focuses on modifying behaviors, rather than cognitive&#xD;
      domains. The treatment emphasizes education, motivational tools, and specific behavioral&#xD;
      recommendations (e.g., restricting time in bed). BBTI has been previously delivered remotely&#xD;
      and this intervention will be delivered by phone by sleep interventionists including trained&#xD;
      social workers, psychologists, and nurse practitioners. Participants will complete an intake&#xD;
      session with their interventionist followed by a 'treatment session' a week later wherein the&#xD;
      interventionist will provide education about sleep regulation and create an individualized&#xD;
      schedule of sleep/wake times for the participant. This will be followed by 3 brief weekly&#xD;
      check-in calls to review progress, address questions and concerns, and adjust the behavioral&#xD;
      treatment plan as the participant progresses. The participant will complete a daily sleep&#xD;
      diary throughout the intervention to inform the treatment. Participants will also complete&#xD;
      baseline, endpoint and follow-up questionnaires to assess outcomes and intervention&#xD;
      acceptability and feasibility. Participants will receive compensation for their&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;

    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Sleep Disturbance, 8b Endpoint</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS Sleep Disturbance measures self-reported sleep quality and associated daytime functioning during the past seven days. The measure includes 8-items with higher scores indicating greater sleep disturbance. The minimum score is 8 and the maximum score is 40.

    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS Sleep Impairment measures self-reported perceptions of alertness, sleepiness, and tiredness during usual waking hours, and the perceived functional impairments during wakefulness associated with sleep problems or impaired alertness during the past seven days. The measure includes 8-items with higher scores indicating greater sleep impairment. The minimum score is 8 and the maximum score 40.

    <measure>Response to treatment (baseline to endpoint)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 vs. Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Previous 'Brief Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia' interventions have defined response to treatment as a change in the PSQI score of ≥3 points (Buysse, 2011). The PSQI, or the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, is a validated instrument which assesses self-reported sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month interval. The minimum score is 0 and maximum score is 21. Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality.</description>

    <description>Previous 'Brief Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia' interventions have defined remission as the response criterion (change in the PSQI score of ≥3 points) plus a final PSQI score &lt;5 (Buysse, 2011). The PSQI, or the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, is a validated instrument which assesses self-reported sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month interval. The minimum score is 0 and maximum score is 21. Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality.</description>

    <measure>PROMIS Pain intensity, 3a (Endpoint)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS Pain intensity 3a is a self-report measure that assesses how much a person hurts (intensity or severity) in the past 7 days. The measure includes three items rating pain from &quot;Had no pain&quot; = 1 to &quot;Very severe&quot; = 5, therefore the response range is 3-15 with higher scores indicating greater pain intensity. Item responses are combined to yield a T-score with population mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10.</description>

    <description>PROMIS Pain interference 8a assesses self-reported consequences of pain on relevant aspects of one's life in the past 7 days.&#xD;
The measure includes 8-items rating pain from &quot;Not at all&quot; = 1 to &quot;Very much&quot; = 5, therefore the response range is 8-40 with higher scores indicating greater pain interference. Item responses are combined to yield a standardized T-score with a mean of 50, and a standard deviation of 10.</description>

    <measure>Insomnia Severity Index, ISI (Endpoint)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Insomnia Severity Index is a 7-item self-report questionnaire assessing the nature, severity, and impact of insomnia in the last month. A 5-point Likert scale is used to rate each item (e.g., 0 = no problem; 4 = very severe problem), yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 28. The total score is interpreted as follows: absence of insomnia (0-7); sub-threshold insomnia (8-14); moderate insomnia (15-21); and severe insomnia (22-28).</description>
