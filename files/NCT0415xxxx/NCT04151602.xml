  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading infectious disease killer globally and leading cause of&#xD;
      death in persons with HIV. The most effective way to reduce TB incidence and mortality is to&#xD;
      interrupt transmission. This requires finding and treating individuals with TB disease early,&#xD;
      including those with subclinical disease. Molecular epidemiologic studies and mathematical&#xD;
      models have shown that the primary approach to case finding-household contact&#xD;
      tracing-identifies only 8-19% of transmissions in high TB and TB/HIV burden settings. Thus&#xD;
      there is a clear need to identify new groups and settings where TB transmission occurs.&#xD;
      Spatial clustering of individuals with higher rates of progression from infection to disease,&#xD;
      such as those with HIV and malnourishment, can also form transmission hotspots. Illicit drug&#xD;
      (i.e., methamphetamines, crack/cocaine, opiates) users have higher TB infection prevalence&#xD;
      and disease incidence compared to non-users, likely due to significant within-group&#xD;
      transmission and/or clustered vulnerability. Increased transmission among people who use&#xD;
      illicit drugs (PWUD) could result from creation of more efficient TB transmitters, increased&#xD;
      close contact among transmitters, increased rates of primary progression from infection to&#xD;
      disease among contacts, or a combination. Interrogation of illicit drug user networks for TB&#xD;
      transmission, therefore, holds great potential as a target for early case identification and&#xD;
      linkage to treatment, with potential benefit for halting transmission to the broader&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

      A cross-sectional, observational study design using respondent driven sampling (RDS) will be&#xD;
      used for this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Aim 1, individuals will be recruited who currently use meth and/or Mandrax to assess TB&#xD;
      exposure, incipient TB prevalence, and TB disease prevalence in the network. RDS will be used&#xD;
      to seek out 750 meth/Mandrax users. Initial seeds (N=4) will be individuals from the&#xD;
      investigator's current R01, the Tuberculosis treatment outcomes and alcohol use study (TRUST)&#xD;
      cohort who have had active pulmonary TB disease in the prior 1-2 years and report current&#xD;
      meth/Mandrax use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Aim 2, individuals from Aim 1 identified to have possible TB disease will be screened and&#xD;
      enrolled to estimate the proportion that reflect recent transmission via genotyping and&#xD;
      social epidemiologic links.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Aim 3, the investigators will examine physiologic factors that may make PWUD more&#xD;
      efficient TB transmitters. 50 PWUD participants from Aim 2 will be recruited who have active,&#xD;
      untreated pulmonary TB and 50 individuals with active, untreated pulmonary TB who do not use&#xD;
      meth/Mandrax, matched on age and gender will be recruited&#xD;
