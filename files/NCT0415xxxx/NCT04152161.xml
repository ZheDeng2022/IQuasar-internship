             severe asthma, or any acute or chronic illness that might affect the safety,&#xD;
             immunogenicity, or efficacy of study vaccine in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any current medical, psychiatric, occupational, or substance abuse problems that, in&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Urinalysis abnormality greater than Grade 1 on the Toxicity Scale (with the exception&#xD;
             of hematuria in a menstruating female), or urinalysis abnormality judged clinically&#xD;
