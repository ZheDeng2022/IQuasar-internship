  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Automated Insulin Delivery (AID) systems have now become an important standard-of-care for&#xD;
      people with T1D and have demonstrated a reduction, but not elimination, of hypoglycemia&#xD;
      during long-term studies. One limitation of current AID systems is that they have no&#xD;
      knowledge about the context or environment that a person is currently experiencing.&#xD;
      Contextual patterns can potentially improve the performance of an AID by recognizing&#xD;
      environments or patterns of living that are related to changes in glucose. The team at OHSU&#xD;
      is developing a context-aware glucose prediction algorithm that will capture context data&#xD;
      from the patient both indoors and outdoors. This context data will be provided to the&#xD;
      algorithm to allow for detecting contextual patterns that might relate to high or low&#xD;
      glucose. The goal of this study will be the creation of a data set that will include&#xD;
      contextual patterns along with glucose, insulin and physiological data.&#xD;

      Subjects will be on study for 28 days. Sensor glucose, activity, exercise, insulin, indoor&#xD;
      and outdoor contextual patterns and meal data will be collected during this time. Subjects&#xD;
      will wear the Dexcom G6 CGM system and a physical activity monitor for the entire 28 days.&#xD;
      Subjects will continue to use their own insulin pump. Subjects will be asked to also wear a&#xD;
      MotioWear indoor/outdoor context-aware tracking tag and to install the MotioWear beacons&#xD;
      within their home. Subjects will be randomized to complete either aerobic, high intensity&#xD;
      interval training, or resistance exercise videos twice weekly at home during weeks 1 and 2&#xD;
      and once during weeks 3 and 4. Subjects will also ingest a self-selected meal prior to these&#xD;
      prescribed exercise sessions. Subjects will eat a high carbohydrate dinner once each week on&#xD;
      the same day at the same approximate time of day (but not on the exercise days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will use the T1 DEXI mobile app created by OHSU to capture meal and exercise data&#xD;
      along with photos of meals the day of exercise and the day after. While at home, subjects&#xD;
      will check CBG before and after exercise, for symptoms of hypoglycemia, and for Dexcom G6&#xD;
      alarms for sensor &lt;70 mg/dL and &gt;250 mg/dL.&#xD;
