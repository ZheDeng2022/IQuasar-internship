  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with cirrhosis are likely to develop overt hepatic encephalopathy for which&#xD;
      diagnostic modalities and treatment options are limited. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      determine if individuals with cirrhosis who experience hepatic encephalopathy would benefit&#xD;
      from investigational microbiota restoration therapy due to their inherent cognitive&#xD;
      alterations. Analysis for a correlation between changes in microbiome composition and&#xD;
      specific blood biomarkers could allow for earlier diagnosis of HE which could then be treated&#xD;
      earlier and with novel treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that changes in an individual's cognition due to HE-related&#xD;
      liver cirrhosis can be stabilized and/or improved through investigational microbiota&#xD;
      restoration therapeutic treatment. The main objective of this study is to determine if&#xD;
      investigational microbiota restoration therapeutic treatment alters the cognitive function in&#xD;
      individuals with cirrhosis who have been previously diagnosed with overt hepatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy (HE). Once individuals have one HE episode, they are more likely to experience&#xD;
      additional episodes, even after complying with standard of care. The number of HE episodes&#xD;
      each study group experiences during the post-treatment follow-up will be compared among&#xD;
      treatment groups. It is also anticipated that cognitive improvement will correlate with&#xD;
      specific changes in the intestinal microbiota composition of these individuals likely&#xD;
      shifting their microbiome away from baseline samples and becoming more like donor samples.&#xD;
      Novel blood biomarkers potentially related to episodes of HE will be assessed in individuals&#xD;
      before and after treatment.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Study individuals will be placed into one of four study treatment groups: High dose investigational microbiota restoration therapeutic RBX7455 group, Low dose investigational microbiota restoration therapeutic RBX7455 group, or a pill quantity-matched Placebo group. Individuals will be randomized in a 1:1:1/2:1/2 manner. It is anticipated of the 75 potentially enrolled individuals, 50 will receive active treatment (high or low dose investigational microbiota restoration therapeutic) and 25 will receive placebo.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in cognitive function at 1 month post-FMT as measured by change in response times on EncephalApp (Stroop test)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Determine whether microbiota restoration therapy improves cognition 1 month after treatment by measuring differences in time scores from EncephalApp. The app times participants in seconds (s) in variations of the Stroop Test. The average (s) across all trials will be reported as well as the difference in (s) between (trial 1)-(trial 5). Longer completion times indicate greater cognitive impairment, while a decrease in completion time from trial 1 to trial 5 indicates learning (cognitive improvement).&#xD;
The scale for this measure is theoretically 0s-500s.</description>

    <measure>Engraftment of FMT as assessed by change in type and abundance of gut microbiota following shotgun sequencing</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is anticipated that with treatment, changes in the intestinal microbiota composition of these individuals will likely shift their microbiome to contain different species. Microbiome analyses will measure, at the family and genus level, which bacteria are present and their relative abundance. Samples from the same individual at different time points will be compared as well as differences between treatment groups at each time point.</description>
