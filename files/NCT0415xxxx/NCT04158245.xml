    <textblock>
      This is a pilot phase 2 single-arm study, of men with metastatic castration-resistant&#xD;
      prostate cancer (mCRPC). Patients will be treated with any of the approved life-prolonging&#xD;
      therapies: abiraterone 1000 mg daily plus prednisone 5 mg (or dexamethasone 0.5 mg) daily,&#xD;
      enzalutamide 160 mg daily, or docetaxel 50 mg/m2 every two weeks or 75 mg/m2 every three&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is a hormonally-driven disease and androgens are key in the growth of both&#xD;
      normal prostate and prostate cancer cells. Once mCRPC is evident, most patients receive a&#xD;
      second-generation hormonal therapy to further suppress the synthesis or androgens&#xD;
      (abiraterone) and to block androgen receptor (AR) activation, nuclear translocation and DNA&#xD;
      binding (enzalutamide).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional imaging of prostate cancer has limitations in staging, restaging after&#xD;
      biochemical relapse, and response assessment. Functional imaging with positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) can target various aspects of tumor biology and is clearly superior in the&#xD;
      detection of extra-prostatic disease. 18F-fluciclovine is a synthetic amino acid transported&#xD;
      across mammalian cell membranes by amino acid transporters that are upregulated in prostate&#xD;
      cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18F-fluciclovine is approved for PET imaging to identify sites of prostate cancer recurrence&#xD;
      in men with rising prostate specific antigen (PSA) following prior definitive treatment. This&#xD;
      study describes the changes in 18F-fluciclovine PET scan and compare these results with PSA&#xD;
      and conventional computerized tomography (CT) and bone scans, in mCRPC patients treated with&#xD;
      abiraterone acetate-prednisone, enzalutamide or docetaxel.&#xD;

    <description>The use of 18F-fluciclovine PET scanning will allow a more sensitive assessment of mCRPC patients at the initiation of systemic therapy and changes observed in 18F-fluciclovine PET will correlate better with the serologic changes in PSA, allowing superior disease monitoring, as compared to conventional imaging modalities. In addition, 18F-fluciclovine PET will detect heterogeneity in disease response and thus identify potential lesions amenable to targeted therapy.</description>
