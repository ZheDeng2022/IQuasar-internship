  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, randomised, open-label, parallel-group, active-controlled, phase IV&#xD;
      study to assess the reduction of daily Symbicort® maintenance to anti-inflammatory reliever&#xD;
      treatment only in participants with severe eosinophilic asthma on Fasenra® treatment, while&#xD;
      maintaining asthma control.&#xD;
    </textblock>

    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted at 24 study sites in 3-5 countries. The study duration for each&#xD;
      participant will be approximately 52-56 weeks. Approximately 240 participants with severe&#xD;
      eosinophilic asthma taking high-dose Inhaled corticosteroids/ long-acting β2-agonist&#xD;
      (ICS/LABA) who have been treated for severe eosinophilic asthma with at least 3 consecutive&#xD;
      doses of Fasenra® and have clinically responded since the start of Fasenra® treatment&#xD;
      (defined for the purpose of this study as an Asthma control questionnaire-5 item (ACQ-5&#xD;
      score) &lt;1.5 at Visit 1 and Visit 2b) will be enrolled into this open-label study. The study&#xD;
      consists of a Screening Visit (Visit 1) and 4- to 8-week screening and run-in period (to&#xD;
      align the randomisation study visit with the next Fasenra® injection), a reduction period of&#xD;
      32 weeks, and a 16-week maintenance period.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Patient must be aged 18 years old or above at the time of consenting to study&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Documented current maintenance treatment with high-dose ICS/LABA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. ACQ-5 score &lt;1.5 at Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Treatment with Fasenra® for the indicated diagnosis of severe eosinophilic asthma and&#xD;
             has received at least 3 consecutive doses (&gt;8 weeks) prior to Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Male or female.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Negative serum pregnancy test at Visit 1 for women of childbearing potential (WOCBP).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. WOCBP must agree to use a highly effective method of birth control (confirmed by the&#xD;
             Investigator) from randomisation throughout the study duration and within 12 weeks&#xD;
             after the last dose of study treatment. Highly effective forms of birth control (those&#xD;
             that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and&#xD;
             correctly) include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Combined (oestrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated&#xD;
                  with inhibition of ovulation-oral, intravaginal, or transdermal.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of&#xD;
                  ovulation-oral, injectable, or implantable.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intrauterine device (IUD).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bilateral tubal occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sexual abstinence, ie, refraining from heterosexual intercourse (the reliability&#xD;
                  of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the&#xD;
                  clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Vasectomised sexual partner (provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of&#xD;
                  the WOCBP study patient and that the vasectomised partner has received medical&#xD;
                  assessment of the surgical success).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women not of childbearing potential are defined as women who are either permanently&#xD;
        sterilized (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy), or who are&#xD;
        postmenopausal. Women will be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for&#xD;
        ≥12 months prior to the planned date of randomisation without an alternative medical cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following age-specific requirements apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women &lt;50 years old will be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic&#xD;
             for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatment and have&#xD;
             follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in the postmenopausal range. Until FSH is&#xD;
             documented to be within menopausal range, treat the patient as WOCBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women ≥50 years old will be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic&#xD;
             for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For randomisation at Visit 2b, patients should fulfil the following criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. History of exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids or hospitalisation during&#xD;
             the last 3 months prior to Visit 1 or during the run-in period.&#xD;
