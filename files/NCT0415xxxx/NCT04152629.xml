  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a four-month, phase IV, open-label study of ADHD symptomatology and functional&#xD;
      outcomes in pediatric (6 to 17 years old) and adult (≥18 years or older) patients with ADHD&#xD;
      treated with FOQUEST or VYVANSE.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After giving written, informed consent or assent (for patients &lt;18 years old), patients will&#xD;
      be screened to ascertain their suitability for the study according to the patient selection&#xD;
      criteria (Section 4). Based on clinician assessment, patients will be assigned to receive&#xD;
      either FOQUEST or VYVANSE. Patients will be titrated to their optimal dose of ADHD medication&#xD;
      based on Investigator judgement. At monthly visits, patients will have their ADHD&#xD;
      symptomatology evaluated by the Investigator (ADHD-Rating Scale-DSM 5 Version [ADHD-RS-5])&#xD;
      and will complete questionnaires on functional outcomes (Weiss Functional Impairment Ratings&#xD;
      Scale - Parent [WFIRS-P] or Weiss Functional Impairment Ratings Scale - Self [WFIRS-Self]),&#xD;
      morning and evening behaviours (Daily Parent Rating of Evening and Morning Behaviours -&#xD;
      Revised [DPREMB-R] or Adult ADHD Quality of Life Rating Scale - Revised [AAQoL-R]) and&#xD;
      Patient Sleep &amp; Satisfaction survey (PSS). Safety will be evaluated through non-directed&#xD;
      spontaneous adverse event (AE) reporting. Patients will be monitored for signs of&#xD;
      suicide-related behavior, as per standard of care. A post-study safety follow-up phone call&#xD;
      (conducted between 7 and 14 days post-last visit) will assess patients for any adverse events&#xD;
      that occur following their last dose of medication received as part of the study. Following&#xD;
      the last dose of study medication, the patient's continuing, post-study ADHD treatment will&#xD;
      be based on Investigator discretion and standard of care.&#xD;

    <description>The ADHD Rating Scale DSM-5 (ADHD-RS-5) is a clinician-rated scale that reflects current symptoms of ADHD based on DSM-5 criteria. It is a global assessment that measures the severity of symptoms from visit to visit, but is not utilized to assess symptoms of ADHD over the course of the day. The ADHD-RS-5 consists of 18 items that are grouped into two subscales (hyperactivity/impulsivity, and inattention). Higher score means higher frequency and severity of symptoms.</description>
