      Artificial eye blinking stimulation following damage to the facial nerve. Group 1 - Patients&#xD;
      with a persistent unilateral facial paralysis (palsy) that underwent an operation for facial&#xD;
      reanimation Group 2 - Patients with temporary unilateral facial paralysis, secondary to&#xD;
      unilateral Bell's palsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To evaluate whether the Neurotigger device can elicit a complete or a&#xD;
      partial eyelid closure of the affected eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: To optimize the location of the Neurotrigger's electrodes, and define&#xD;
      the level of the pain generated, if any, during device implementation and stimulation, as&#xD;
      well as the method for the personal adjustment of the precise pattern of stimulation&#xD;
      (strength, intensity, other features) to achieve eye blinking for different patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will involve two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Patients with a continuous unilateral facial paralysis that underwent an operation&#xD;
      for facial reanimation will be enrolled at least one year after the operation according to&#xD;
      review of medical records of the Department of plastic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Patients with temporary unilateral facial paralysis secondary to Bell's palsy as was&#xD;
      identified in the admission to the Hospital Department of Plastic Surgery or to the&#xD;
      Department of Ear, Nose and Throat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After being identified eligible to participate in the study, the patients will be invited to&#xD;
      join the study, sign on the written informed consent, and their demographic and medical&#xD;
      history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients identified to belong to these study groups in other hospitals may join the study,&#xD;
      after pre-evaluation and medical record analysis by the study Principle Investigator&#xD;
      (PI)/Co-PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be constructed in two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 - The first stage is composed of a one-time participation for about three hours. This&#xD;
      feasibility stage involves:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Verifying compliance of the patients with the research inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Completion of the study clinical report form (CRF) for this stage&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Placement of the single use mini-electrodes that will be adhered to the facial skin near&#xD;
           the non-blinking eye and coupled to the Neurotrigger stimulator to elicit eyelid&#xD;
           closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial report will then be issued to summarize the patient's experience of using the&#xD;
      system in the first testing attempt to identify a complete or partial eye blinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants identified to respond to the stimulator at a partial or complete eye closure&#xD;
      level, will be invited to continue to use the device for additional two hours in the hospital&#xD;
      premises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A summary meeting will then be held to issue a summary report covering the overall patient's&#xD;
      experience of using the system throughout the testing period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this first stage is to examine the possibility of closing the patient eyelid&#xD;
      completely or partially, optimize electrode position, and maximize the patient's comfort&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A profile of system efficacy in generating eyelid closure will then be generated including&#xD;
      the characterization of the stimulus pattern (intensity, frequency, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: The purpose of this stage is to examine how a continued use of the device by the&#xD;
      patient may improve outcomes, and reduce complications that are derived of the facial nerve&#xD;
      paralysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be enrolled to the second phase up to one year from the first phase visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this second stage the duration of the participation is about three weeks (six days a week)&#xD;
      and includes daily use of the device for up to 10 hours a day. During nights the patient will&#xD;
      continue is standard pattern of either eye closure or leaving the eye open, as the patient&#xD;
      used to do prior to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This stage will involve a patient with a partner that is designated to support the patient&#xD;
      closely during the placement and adjustment of the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient and the partner will both obtain a detailed mutual training of placing the&#xD;
      electrode and device, activating the device (partner) and its use (patient) to assure&#xD;
      complete assistance and guidance in installing the system and its use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to starting this stage the patient will undergo eye examination and will complete a&#xD;
      Patient Graded Instrument for Facial Nerve Paralysis - The FaCE Scale Questionnaire - to&#xD;
      evaluate the life quality with the facial nerve paralysis (Laryngoscope. 2001&#xD;
      Mar;111(3):387-98.Validation of a patient-graded instrument for facial nerve paralysis: the&#xD;
      FaCE scale. Kahn JB et al.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are provided with help desk number to answer questions and queries during the study&#xD;
      period as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will get a clear guidance of the possibility to get support at home by experience system&#xD;
      user or by phone-call or by videoconference (Skype or the like) by communicating with the&#xD;
      experienced Sponsor's personnel who can help them adjust the electrode to the face and&#xD;
      reducing discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of a skin rush or any skin discomfort, the patient will call the clinic and will be&#xD;
      invited to medical examination and, if necessary, for treatment of a rush reducing and&#xD;
      calming ointment and be advised of re-using the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will make an intermediate evaluation at one and a half week and a final visit at&#xD;
      three weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last visit will include eye examination to compare the eye functioning before and after&#xD;
      Phase 2, and the completion of a FaCE Scale Questionnaire to evaluate potential improvement&#xD;
      in life quality.&#xD;
