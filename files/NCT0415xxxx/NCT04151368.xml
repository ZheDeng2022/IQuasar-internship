  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) with immediate reconstruction is one of the standard of care&#xD;
      surgical treatments of breast cancer (BC) and is used for risk reduction in patients with a&#xD;
      high risk for BC. While this method shows satisfactory oncologic and good cosmetic outcomes,&#xD;
      its drawbacks include compromise of the skin flap vascularization due to skin incision,&#xD;
      nipple-areolar complex (NAC) malposition/distortion and visible scar on the breast. NSM also&#xD;
      has technical challenges of dissecting and removing larger specimens through limited&#xD;
      incisions and concerns regarding oncologic effectiveness due to difficulties in visualizing&#xD;
      regions of the breast remote from the incision. To improve cosmetic outcomes after NSM, a&#xD;
      modification of this technique using a surgical robotic system was recently described. In a&#xD;
      limited number of studies, the robotic NSM (RNSM) with immediate prosthetic breast&#xD;
      reconstruction (IPBR) was shown to be feasible and safe, as well as led to excellent cosmetic&#xD;
      outcomes and patient satisfaction. There are limited number of centers in North America and&#xD;
      none in Canada that offer RNSM-IPBR. The investigators hypothesize that RNSM-IPBR is a&#xD;
      feasible and safe technique that can be utilized in our institution and that it can provide&#xD;
      superior cosmetic outcomes with less morbidity and higher patient satisfaction compared to&#xD;
      the traditional NSM-IPBR. The aim is to conduct a single-arm prospective study to investigate&#xD;
      the safety and feasibility, as well as cosmetic, surgical complication and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction parameters of NSM-IPBR performed in the University Health Network (UHN). This&#xD;
      study will serve a foundation for potential introduction of a novel surgical approach in our&#xD;
      institution and will make it available for treatment and prevention of breast cancer in&#xD;
      Canadian women. The study will also serve as pilot data for future potential studies,&#xD;
      including randomized-controlled trials (RCT) comparing RNSM with conventional NSM. As such,&#xD;
      the study will further our approach to innovation in breast surgical oncology within Canada&#xD;
      and North America.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm prospective study to assess feasibility and safety (primary outcomes),&#xD;
      as well as patient satisfaction, cosmetic and oncologic outcomes of RNSM-IPBR in women with&#xD;
      BC or at high risk of BC treated at UHN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study are to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Feasibility of RNSM-IPBR through assessing operative parameters (such as time of&#xD;
           procedure, robot docking time, conversion to conventional NSM-IPBR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Safety of RNSM-IPBR through assessing rate of morbidity from surgical complications&#xD;
           (such as wound infection, flap and NAC necrosis, postoperative hematoma/bleeding, seroma&#xD;
           requiring aspiration, implant loss, anesthesia related complications and need for&#xD;
           reoperation with one month due to complications) and mortality due to the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient satisfaction from RNSM-IPBR through assessing psychological, physical, sexual&#xD;
           well-being, as well as satisfaction with breast, overall outcome and care through&#xD;
           patient reported outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Cosmetic outcomes of RNSM-IPBR, such as distortion or malposition of NAC and scarring,&#xD;
           rate of reoperation due to unacceptable cosmetic outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Short- and long-term oncologic outcomes of NSM-IPBR, such as positivity of margins,&#xD;
           breast cancer incidence and recurrence rate, as well as overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale of the study is to investigate a novel technique of RNSM-IPBR that might have&#xD;
      superior cosmetic and patient satisfaction outcomes, as well as lower rates of complications,&#xD;
      based on a small number of previously published studies from Europe and Asia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once enrolled, clinical, radiologic, and pathologic data will be collected for each&#xD;
      participant at the initial visit and follow up data will be collected via available&#xD;
      electronic patient records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RNSM-IPBR will be performed by previously described method (Toesca et al.) using an&#xD;
      extra-mammary axillary incision along the mid-axillary line in the axillary fossa. We will&#xD;
      use Da Vinci Si Surgical System® (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA) available at Toronto&#xD;
      General Hospital, UHN.&#xD;
