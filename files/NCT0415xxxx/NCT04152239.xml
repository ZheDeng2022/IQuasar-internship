  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diagnosis and treatment of small bowel pathologies remain challenging due to the long length&#xD;
      of the small bowel. Obscure gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding with negative upper and lower GI&#xD;
      workup, suspected inflammatory bowel disease, and suspected tumors of the small bowel often&#xD;
      require small bowel investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While video capsule endoscopy (VCE) and computed tomography (CT) enteroclysis (CTE) are often&#xD;
      the initial diagnostic modalities for suspected small bowel pathologies and can provide&#xD;
      structural information of the small bowel mucosa, biopsy or therapy for the detected&#xD;
      pathology could not be performed with VCE or CTE. In patients who require biopsy or therapy&#xD;
      of the detected small bowel pathology, deep enteroscopy would be the procedure of choice in&#xD;
      modern clinical practice before subjecting patient to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic and therapeutic deep enteroscopy can be performed by balloon overtube assisted&#xD;
      enteroscopy (eg, double balloon enteroscopy (DBE), single balloon enteroscopy (SBE) or spiral&#xD;
      overtube assisted enteroscopy (SE). Despite the difference in equipment design of DBE, SBE,&#xD;
      and SE, the concepts for small bowel intubation by pleating the intestine over the endoscope&#xD;
      are the same behind these techniques. Depending on the location of the small bowel pathology&#xD;
      reported by VCE or CTE, antegrade (oral route), retrograde (anal route), or combined&#xD;
      antegrade and retrograde deep enteroscopy for total enteroscopy can be performed.&#xD;

      Diagnosis and treatment of small bowel pathologies remain challenging due to the long length&#xD;
      of the small bowel. Obscure gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding with negative upper and lower GI&#xD;
      workup, suspected inflammatory bowel disease, and suspected tumors of the small bowel often&#xD;

&#xD;
      While video capsule endoscopy (VCE) and computed tomography (CT) enteroclysis (CTE) are often&#xD;
      the initial diagnostic modalities for suspected small bowel pathologies and can provide&#xD;
      structural information of the small bowel mucosa, biopsy or therapy for the detected&#xD;
      pathology could not be performed with VCE or CTE. In patients who require biopsy or therapy&#xD;
      of the detected small bowel pathology between the ligament of Treitz and ileocecal valve,&#xD;
      deep enteroscopy would be the procedure of choice in modern clinical practice before&#xD;
      subjecting patient to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic and therapeutic deep enteroscopy can be performed by balloon overtube assisted&#xD;
      enteroscopy (eg, double balloon enteroscopy (DBE), single balloon enteroscopy (SBE) or spiral&#xD;
      overtube assisted enteroscopy (SE)). Despite the difference in equipment design of DBE, SBE,&#xD;
      and SE, the concept for small bowel intubation by pleating the intestine over the endoscope&#xD;
      is the same behind these techniques. Depending on the location of the small bowel pathology&#xD;
      reported by VCE or CTE, antegrade (oral route), retrograde (anal route), or combined&#xD;
      antegrade and retrograde deep enteroscopy for total enteroscopy can be performed. In patients&#xD;
      with suitable anatomy, total enteroscopy by antegrade approach alone may be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DBE was introduced in 2001 and has been the most studied form of modern deep enteroscopy. In&#xD;
      a recent systematic review of 12823 procedures, the overall diagnostic yield was found to be&#xD;
      68.1%. The pooled total enteroscopy rate was 44% by the combined anterograde and retrograde&#xD;
      approach or antegrade-only approach. The pooled minor and major adverse event (eg,&#xD;
      perforation, bleeding, pancreatitis, aspiration pneumonia) rates were 9.1% and 0.72%,&#xD;
      respectively. Despite its clinical utility, long procedure time (usually more than 1 to 1.5&#xD;
      hour) and the need for 2-operators are often regarded as drawbacks of DBE. SE was&#xD;
      subsequently designed to address this issue with the use of a spiral overtube by manual&#xD;
      rotation for efficient small bowel intubation. When compared to balloon overtube assisted&#xD;
      enteroscopy, the main advantage of SE is the relative reduction in procedure time. However,&#xD;
      the total enteroscopy rate of SE is lower, mainly due to difficult overtube and endoscope&#xD;
      passage in retrograde procedures. Adverse events with SE (eg, minor mucosal tears,&#xD;
      perforation, etc) have been reported to be 0.3%. Because both DBE and SE have its own&#xD;
      shortcomings, the need to further improve the current technology of deep enteroscopy has&#xD;
      always been present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a motorized spiral enteroscope (MSE) (Olympus Medical, Tokyo, Japan) has become&#xD;
      available and has the potential to address the shortcomings of the DBE and SE. MSE is an&#xD;
      enteroscope equipped with a short spiral overtube propelled by a endoscopist-controlled motor&#xD;
      contained in the handle of the endoscope. The endoscopist controls the left-right and up-down&#xD;
      movements by the usual manuvers while the forward or backward advancement of the enteroscope&#xD;
      would be contolled by a foot pedal that activates the spiral overtube rotation. The basic&#xD;
      principle of small bowel pleating over the endoscope by the use of an overtube to achieve&#xD;
      deep small bowel intubation is similar to that of DBE and SE. During the procedure, a visual&#xD;
      force gauge allows the operator to monitor the direction of overtube rotation and the&#xD;
      resistance applied to the spiral overtube in the small bowel. If excessive rotational&#xD;
      resistance is detected, the motor would be stopped automatically to avoid mucosal trauma in&#xD;
      the intestine. The initial experience of MSE in patients with small bowel pathology and&#xD;
      colonic pathology appears promising with a diagnostic yield of 76 - 88%, therapeutic yield of&#xD;
      76%, a total enteroscopy rate of 70% (combined antegrade and retrograde approaches or&#xD;
      antegrade alone approach) and shorter procedure time (&lt; 40 minutes). Based on data from three&#xD;
      studies including a total of 110 MSE procedures, no serious adverse event such as perforation&#xD;
      has been reported. The overall adverse event rate including erosion, mucosal tear, hematoma,&#xD;
      transient swallowing discomfort, etc, was reported to be 20% in a study with 30 patients.&#xD;
      Despite its potential to improve the clinical management of patients with small bowel&#xD;
      disorders, current data on the diagnostic and therapeutic utility of MSE is from expert&#xD;
      European centers and remains limited. Investigators therefore propose this study to evaluate&#xD;
      the utility of the MSE in patients with suspected small bowel pathology.&#xD;
