      This study is a prospective, multi-center, open-label phase I trial designed to determine the&#xD;
      MTD of IP oxaliplatin when given in combination with mFOLFIRI. This will be conducted&#xD;
      according to a traditional 3+3 dose-escalation schedule and halted once MTD is established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consent and once deemed eligible for trial participation, patients will receive four&#xD;
      cycles of study therapy. During therapy, patients will be monitored for dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicities and adverse events. After completion of all four cycles patients will be followed&#xD;
      until resolution of any ongoing study treatment-related adverse events, initiation of&#xD;
      alternative treatment, and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug treatment will be administered on day one of a 14-day cycle and the DLT evaluation&#xD;
      period will be defined as the first three cycles of combination treatment (from cycle one day&#xD;
      one to the last day of cycle three). The severity of AEs will be graded according to the&#xD;
      NCI-CTCAE version 5.0 A standard 3+3 dose escalation design will be used to determine the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) while ensuring the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of the treatment. The study will test three dose levels of oxaliplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Level 2 105 mg/m2 IP every 2 weeks Subjects will be accrued in cohorts of 3 to 6&#xD;
      subjects per dose level starting at Dose Level 0 (85 mg/m2). Escalation will continue until&#xD;
      DLT stopping rules are met or the highest dose level is reached.&#xD;
