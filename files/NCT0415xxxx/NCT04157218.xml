  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skin aging is a continuous and inevitable presses usually starting at the age of&#xD;
      mid-twenties, this prosses affects all facial layers including skin, subcutaneous fat,&#xD;
      superficial muscular aponeurotic system (SMAS), deep facia, the retaining ligaments, muscle&#xD;
      activity, and even facial bony structure . The clinical outcome of this process causes the&#xD;
      aging signs of the face and neck, including loose facial skin, sagging cheeks, excess skin&#xD;
      hanging from the lower jawline and excess fat in the neck .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last decade with the introduction of absorbable threads, thread lifting has gained&#xD;
      interest and popularity among patients and physicians, as noninvasive technique to treat&#xD;
      ptotic skin and reposition of ptotic soft tissue into a more anatomical direction.&#xD;
      Histopathological studies indicated that dermal and subcutaneous foreign body reaction after&#xD;
      inserting the threads, in forms of collagen deposition, and fibrosis , could explain the&#xD;
      tightening effect throughout contracture and remodeling. However, some studies question&#xD;
      efficacy especially in the aspects of durability and patient satisfaction .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another nonsurgical alternative for facial rejuvenation is high-intensity focused ultrasound&#xD;
      (HIFU) therapy, during the past decade, HIFU has been used as a clinical noninvasive surgical&#xD;
      tool to treat tumors, including those of the liver, prostate, and uterus (10-12) The HIFU&#xD;
      devices heat tissue with acoustic energy in a focused, controlled manner. The thermal injury&#xD;
      within the tissue leads to focal necrosis and cellular damage, initiating an inflammatory&#xD;
      cascade that culminates in tissue remodeling, similar to changes that occur after ablative or&#xD;
      nonablative laser treatments .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators hypothesis that the HIFU treatment followed immediately by thread insertion&#xD;
      can amplify and enhance the skin fibrosis, tissue lifting capacity and might give better and&#xD;
      longer clinical results in treating ptotic skin.&#xD;
