      Evaluation of the possible effect of DHA supplementation, combined with interventions aimed&#xD;
      at improving diet and lifestyle, on gut microbiota composition and metabolite production.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Differences in gut microbiota composition and function will be evaluated in obese children&#xD;
      before starting the DHA supplementation and dietary-lifestyle intervention, at the end of DHA&#xD;
      supplementation (4 months) e after 4 months of dietary dietary-lifestyle intervention without&#xD;
      DHA supplementation. The investigators will identify the role of DHA on the intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota and indicative species related to insulin resistance (IR). The investigators will&#xD;
      determine whether DHA supplementation, combined with interventions to improve diet and&#xD;
      lifestyle, reduces adverse metabolic consequences together with their co-morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following tasks will be also performed at t0, t1 and t2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical examination including: physical examination, Tanner score evaluation; Bristol Stool&#xD;
      Chart Blood pressure will be checked in all children by using oscillometric devices validated&#xD;
      in the pediatric age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometry including body circumferences and skinfolds, calculation of BMI z scores and&#xD;
      body composition. Body composition will be assessed using an air displacement plethysmography&#xD;
      system (BOD POD COSMED-USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Food intakes will be recorded by prospective 3-d weighed food records obtained with food&#xD;
           scales. Parents will be advised on how to record all food and beverages consumed during&#xD;
           2 weekdays and 1 weekend day. Quantification and analysis of the energy intake and&#xD;
           nutrient composition will be performed with an ad hoc PC software (MètaDieta®, Me.Te.Da&#xD;
           S.r.l., San Benedetto del Tronto, Italy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mediterranean Diet Quality Index (KIDMED) questionnaire for Mediterranean Diet&#xD;
           assessment. The KIDMED index ranges from 0 to 12, and is based on a 16-question test&#xD;
           that can be self-administered. The sums of the values from the administered test will be&#xD;
           classified into three levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
           8 or more: optimal Mediterranean diet; 4-7: improvement needed to adjust intake to&#xD;
           Mediterranean patterns. 3 or less: very low diet quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematological and biochemical status including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete cell blood count;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic and nutritional parameters according to local routines for childhood obesity&#xD;
      (fasting glucose, fasting insulin, LDL, HDL, total cholesterol, triglycerides, Apolipoprotein&#xD;
      A and Apolipoprotein B levels, transaminases and amma-glutamyl transferase). Oral Glucose&#xD;
      Tolerance Test (OGTT) will be performed. The insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance was&#xD;
      assessed by calculating HOMA index (Homeostasis Model Assessment) and QUICKI (Quantitative&#xD;
      Insulin-Sensitivity Check Index), using the following formulas:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HOMA: fasting plasma insulin in mU/l x FPG in mmol/l/22.5 QUICKI: 1/(log10 fasting plasma&#xD;
      insulin in mU/l + log10 glucose in mg/dl)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory index (VES, high-sensitive CRP, including fecal calprotectin)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver ultrasonography for detection of fatty liver disease&#xD;
