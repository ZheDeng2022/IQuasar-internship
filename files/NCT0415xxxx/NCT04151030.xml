      Placement of a feeding tube through a gastrostomy can be performed endoscopically or&#xD;
      radiologically. While percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement is most&#xD;
      frequently performed using a &quot;pull&quot; technique, this method may not feasible in patients with&#xD;
      malignant, or tight benign, esophageal stenosis. Further, the &quot;pull&quot; technique may drag tumor&#xD;
      cells with the feeding tube and lead to implantation metastasis at the gastrostomy site. A&#xD;
      clinical practice update by the American Gastroenterological Association has recommended that&#xD;
      the pull-through PEG placement method should be avoided in all patients with oropharyngeal or&#xD;
      esophageal cancer. It also recommends that the introducer/Push PEG method should be favored&#xD;
      instead of the pull PEG. In such situations, an introducer-style, &quot;Direct&quot; gastrostomy tube&#xD;
      can be placed endoscopically or radiologically. However, the published data comparing&#xD;
      outcomes and safety of endoscopic &quot;Direct&quot; PEG (D-PEG) and interventional radiological PEG&#xD;
      (IR-PEG) are very sparse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The D-PEG is performed under endoscopic visualization of the gastric wall which facilitates&#xD;
      greater control and allows safe selection of gastrostomy site. Further, the presence of an&#xD;
      endoscope enables transillumination to confirm the absence of intervening abdominal viscera&#xD;
      between the abdominal wall and the anterior wall of the stomach. These advantages are lacking&#xD;
      with the IR-PEG. We hypothesize that D-PEG is safer than IR-PEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this single center, non-randomized study, patients unable to undergo a conventional&#xD;
      per-oral &quot;Pull&quot; PEG and needing a D-PEG will be prospectively enrolled. For the comparison&#xD;
      arm, historical IR-PEG procedures at our center will be assessed. The technical success and&#xD;
      rates of adverse events will be compared between the two arms. Approval from the&#xD;
      Institutional review board has been obtained. Based on our experience, we estimate a sample&#xD;
      size of 40 participants in each arm and anticipate completion of this pilot study by June&#xD;
      2021.&#xD;

      Introduction Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement is a frequently&#xD;
      performed procedure to provide enteral nutrition in patients with dysphagia. Two methods are&#xD;
      used for placing a PEG tube via the mouth: The &quot;Pull&quot; method and the &quot;Push&quot; method(1). In the&#xD;
      &quot;Pull&quot; technique, the feeding tube is pulled from the mouth, through the esophagus and&#xD;
      stomach to the outside. In the introducer-style &quot;Direct&quot; technique, the feeding tube is&#xD;
      pushed from the outside to inside the stomach. Both these techniques are considered safe,&#xD;
      effective, and have their own advantages and disadvantages(2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations of Pull PEG technique The &quot;Pull&quot; PEG technique is challenging in patients with&#xD;
      head and neck malignancies, obstructing esophageal cancers, and laryngeal malignancies. The&#xD;
      severe stenosis often precludes the passage of the adult endoscope as well as the large&#xD;
      internal bumper of the feeding tube which must be pulled through the stenotic upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract. Further, microorganisms and malignant cells from the oropharynx/&#xD;
      esophagus can be pulled by the feeding tube leading to peristomal infections as well as&#xD;
      metastatic deposits at the site of the gastrostomy(3,4). A prospective evaluation of &quot;Pull&quot;&#xD;
      PEGs placed in patients with oropharyngeal and esophageal tumors revealed metastatic deposits&#xD;
      of malignant cells in 9.5% of patients, 16 weeks after the PEG(5). Retrospective assessment&#xD;
      of PEG placement for oropharyngeal cancer demonstrated abdominal wall metastasis of 0.64%(6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct PEG technique The endoscopic Direct PEG (D-PEG) uses the Russel introducer technique&#xD;
      which obviates the passage of the gastrostomy tube through the oropharynx. Further, it can&#xD;
      also be performed with an ultrathin endoscope which is easy to navigate through stenotic or&#xD;
      malignant upper gastrointestinal tract obstructions. The D-PEG requires performance of&#xD;
      gastropexy (attachment of gastric wall to the abdominal wall using sutures) with anchor-like&#xD;
      T-fasteners for easy and safe placement of the PEG tube(2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The D-PEG is performed under endoscopic visualization of the gastric wall which facilitates&#xD;
      greater control and allows safe selection of gastrostomy site. It also obviates the need for&#xD;
      ionizing radiation. Further, the endoscope enables transillumination to confirm the absence&#xD;
      of intervening abdominal viscera between the abdominal wall and stomach. These advantages are&#xD;
      lacking in IR-guided PEG which does not offer endoscopic visualization of the gastric lumen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, patients who fail a per-oral Pull PEG tube placement are typically referred for&#xD;
      IR-guided PEG placement(3). Thus, patients who fail a &quot;pull&quot; PEG procedure, are referred to&#xD;
      IR for a second invasive procedure. However, with the availability of the D-PEG, patients&#xD;
      failing a &quot;Pull&quot; PEG can undergo a PEG placement during the index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recommendations from GI societies A recently published clinical practice update has&#xD;
      recommended that the pull-through PEG placement method should be avoided in all patients with&#xD;
      oropharyngeal or esophageal cancer, to reduce the risk of implantation metastasis. Further,&#xD;
      the authors recommend that the introducer/Push PEG method should be favored instead of the&#xD;
      pull PEG(7,8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis We hypothesize that the D-PEG is safer than the IR-PEG in patients unable to&#xD;
      undergo a per-oral Pull PEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims Primary Aim: Comparison of adverse events of D-PEG vs IR-PEG in patients unable to&#xD;
      undergo a Pull PEG Secondary aims: Comparison of technical success and overall procedure&#xD;
      duration between D-PEG and IR-PEG in patients unable to undergo a Pull PEG The data from this&#xD;
      pilot study will be used to design a multi-center prospective randomized trial comparing&#xD;
      outcomes and safety of D-PEG and IR-PEG. The subsequent trial is intended to be performed at&#xD;
      different centers where these procedures are routinely performed, such as Virginia&#xD;
      Commonwealth University, University of Utah, and Baylor College, TX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot data The investigators have received approval from the institutional review board. We&#xD;
      have performed D-PEG procedure in 13 patients so far with technical success in 12 patients&#xD;
      (92%). There have been no major adverse events including perforation, significant&#xD;
      procedure-related bleeding, or procedure related death. One patient accidentally dislodged&#xD;
      his tube which was replaced without endoscopic intervention (minor adverse event: 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design This will be a prospective study of participants undergoing D-PEG placement&#xD;
      compared with patients who previously underwent IR-PEG placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic/prospective arm The patients who fail the endoscopic pull PEG placement, or are&#xD;
      not candidates for a Pull PEG, will undergo an D-PEG procedure at the time of the index&#xD;
      endoscopy. During the pre-procedure consent process, participants will be offered IR-guided&#xD;
      PEG placement as an alternative. This is the standard of care for patients who present to the&#xD;
      endoscopy unit for PEG tube placement. All standard protocols including pre-procedure&#xD;
      assessment, intra-procedure antibiotic use and post procedure protocols will be observed. In&#xD;
      addition to the standard care which all patients receive, the technical success and adverse&#xD;
      event rates will be recorded. Participants will receive a phone call within 1 week, and&#xD;
      within 30 days of the procedure to assess for any post-procedure complications. These data&#xD;
      will be recorded in the medical chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed at Kansas City VA Medical Center, Kansas City, Missouri. The&#xD;
      procedures will be performed by trained, board-certified gastroenterologists with extensive&#xD;
      experience in placing PEG tubes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis/power analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will compare the technical success of D-PEG versus IR-PEG placement. Technical success is&#xD;
      defined as the successful placement of the D PEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome (adverse event rate):&#xD;
&#xD;
      We assume 15% complications (bleeding, infection, tube dislodgement, perforation) with&#xD;
      IR-PEGs and 5% complications in D-PEGs. With 80% power to test a noninferiority margin of 5%,&#xD;
      we intend to enroll 50 patients in the prospective arm done by endoscopists and 50 patients&#xD;
      in the retrospective arm done by IR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome (technical success) We assume a 95% technical success rate on IR guided&#xD;
      push PEG placement. We also assume a 90% technical success rate on endoscopic push PEG&#xD;
      placement. Using a non-inferior to margin of 20%, and an 80% power to test the hypothesis, we&#xD;
      intend to enroll 50 patients in the prospective arm and 50 patients in the retrospective arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use Student's t-test compare means and chi-square test to compare the two arms. We&#xD;
      will also use multi variate analysis and ANOVA for the analysis of all variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with dysphagia requiring PEG placement will be recruited from the following sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Referred to the GI clinic for placement of a gastrostomy tube Referred by the Kansas City VA&#xD;
      tumor board for placement of a gastrostomy tube (e.g. head and neck cancers and esophageal&#xD;
      malignancies) Outpatient or Inpatient GI consults for gastrostomy tube placement Patient's&#xD;
      meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed above will then be assessed by the&#xD;
      principal investigator and offered enrollment into the study.&#xD;
