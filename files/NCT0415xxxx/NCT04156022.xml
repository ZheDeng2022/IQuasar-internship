  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dystonia is a disorder characterized by excessive involuntary contraction of muscles with&#xD;
      repetitive and patterned movements. The primary focal dystonias are the most common type of&#xD;
      dystonia and include Limb dystonias (like writer's cramp), Cervical dystonia (spasmodic&#xD;
      torticollis), Laryngeal dystonias (like spasmodic dysphonia), and Craniofacial dystonias&#xD;
      (like blepharospasm). The purpose of this study is to create resources to help learn more&#xD;
      about the primary focal dystonias and to develop and validate various dystonia rating scales.&#xD;

      This collaborative, international effort has two primary goals. The first is to create a&#xD;
      biospecimen repository and associated clinical database to be used as a resource for dystonia&#xD;
      and related disease research. The second goal is to create and validate various rating scales&#xD;
      for focal dystonias to be used during a typical clinical examination. Across sites, the&#xD;
      investigators hope to enroll at least 5,000 adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects of this study will be asked to complete a neurological exam which will be&#xD;
      videotaped, complete some questionnaires, and donate a blood sample. A study visit will take&#xD;
      between 45 minutes and 1 hour depending upon which portions of the study a subject completes.&#xD;
      A subset of subjects will be asked to return no more often than once a year for a one hour&#xD;
      follow-up visit.&#xD;
