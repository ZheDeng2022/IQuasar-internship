  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial that will assess the effects of an evidence&#xD;
      based, multi-component, leadership support intervention, Resilience-Supportive Leadership&#xD;
      Training (RESULT), using accelerated learning strategies aimed at improving Service Member&#xD;
      resilience and readiness in the military.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is expected to increase perceptions of resilience-supportive behaviors,&#xD;
      resilience indicators, and related behavioral health outcomes such as emotion regulation,&#xD;
      connectedness, team cohesion, psychological health, and physical health following the&#xD;
      training from the perspective of the Service Member.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of our proposed study is to adapt our existing, evidence-based supportive leadership&#xD;
      training for an active duty population, focusing on training junior leaders in the Army on&#xD;
      ways they can enhance readiness and resilience in their soldiers, as well as their own&#xD;
      resilience. The investigators will draw on best practices from existing military and civilian&#xD;
      programs in a training that is engaging, interactive, and customizable. The investigators&#xD;
      will use micro-learnings - small, bite-sized pieces of information delivered in&#xD;
      non-traditional ways, such as short podcasts or videos to enhance the training and enable it&#xD;
      to be integrated easily into both military and civilian jobs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of our Resilience-Supportive Leadership&#xD;
      Training (RESULT) intervention with U.S. Army soldiers stationed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord&#xD;
      (JBLM) in the State of Washington. The study will include a control group, so The&#xD;
      investigators can better determine whether any observed changes in our participants are due&#xD;
      to our training programs, and not some other factor. The investigators anticipate that the&#xD;
      training programs will have a positive impact on service member readiness and resilience,&#xD;
      psychological health, team cohesion, and reduced loneliness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is designed to benefit not only U.S. Army soldiers but across all military&#xD;
      branches, as well as first-responders and other civilian occupations that face highly&#xD;
      stressful situations as part of their work. Our training will have the potential to&#xD;
      positively contribute to the military by enhancing service member readiness and unit&#xD;
      autonomy, and improving mental and physical health.&#xD;
