    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a kind of kidney cancer. The drug avelumab may&#xD;
      help direct the immune response to the tumors and can prolong the immune response. The drug&#xD;
      IL-15 stimulates certain kinds of white blood cells that have the potential to attack the&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To test whether IL-15 and avelumab administered together are safe and effective at treating&#xD;
      ccRCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -People ages 18 and older with relapsed, metastatic biopsy proven clear cell renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (ccRCC) that has not responded to standard treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood, urine, heart, and lung tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT and PET scans and possible MRI: Participants will lie in a machine that takes&#xD;
           pictures of the body. For the CT scan, they may receive an oral contrast agent by mouth&#xD;
           and normally receive IV contrast through a vein to improve the x-ray images.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor sample to confirm expression of avelumab target: If one is not available,&#xD;
           participants will require a new biopsy that is generally obtained by a needle that is&#xD;
           inserted into the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be get the study drugs by vein for up to four 28-day cycles. The IL-15 will&#xD;
      be given through a vein continuously for the first 5 days (120 hours) of each cycle. They&#xD;
      avelumab will be given through a vein over about 1 hour on days 8 and 22 of each cycle.&#xD;
      Participants will be hospitalized for their 1st week of IL-15 cycle and may be able to&#xD;
      receive their subsequent IL-15 treatment as an outpatient depending on their side effects.&#xD;
      Participants who receive the infusion as an outpatient will return to the hospital each day&#xD;
      for a new bag of IL-15. Participants who cannot or do not want to be treated as an outpatient&#xD;
      will be treated in the hospital during their 5-day IL-15 infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will need a midline venous catheter which is longer than a standard venous&#xD;
           catheter but is still inserted into a peripheral vein in their arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have repeats of blood tests to monitor the blood counts and chemistry&#xD;
           throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have follow-up visits 30 days after their last treatment, every 60&#xD;
           days for the first 6 months, every 90 days for 2 years, then every 6 months.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is among the 10 most frequent diagnostic cancers&#xD;
           in the United States with more than an estimated 62,000 new cases in 2016. The prognosis&#xD;
           for patients with metastatic disease is poor with survival rates of 8%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The immunologic effects of recombinant human Interleukin-15 (rhIL-15), a stimulatory&#xD;
           cytokine that promotes the differentiation and activation of NK cells, monocytes and&#xD;
           longterm CD8+ memory T-cells, has been assessed in several Phase 1 trials in cancer&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Avelumab is an anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) fully human IgG1 antibody that&#xD;
           inhibits PD1/PD-L1 interactions while leaving the PD1/PD-L2 pathway intact and enhances&#xD;
           immune activation against tumor cells. It has received U.S. FDA accelerated approval for&#xD;
           the treatment of patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) and urothelial&#xD;
           carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unlike other approved anti-PD-L1/PD1 antibodies, avelumab induces lysis of tumor cells&#xD;
           via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), indicating an&#xD;
           additionalmechanism of action. However, avelumab has not shown ADCC against normal&#xD;
           immune cell subsets in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  More than 50% of ccRCC is PD-L1+ with higher expression in unfavorable prognostic&#xD;
           tumors. Since the anti-PD-L1 antibody avelumab has shown ADCC activity in vitro, agents&#xD;
           that may enhance ADCC by increasing number and activity of Fc-binding effector cells&#xD;
           -such as rhIL15 - could improve efficacy of avelumab in this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Determine the efficacy of combined continuous intravenous infusion (CIV) rhIL-15 and&#xD;
      avelumab treatment in patients with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 refractory metastatic clear cell renal&#xD;
      carcinoma (ccRCC) by assessing the overall response rate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status of less than or equal to 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically proven metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma with greater than or equal&#xD;
           to 5% expression of PD-L1 in the tumor area confirmed by IHC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have failed or relapsed and have progressive disease after at least 2&#xD;
           prior therapies that include multityrosine kinase inhibitor like axitinib or sunitinib&#xD;
           and an anti-PD1 or PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy like nivolumab which could&#xD;
           have been administered in combination with an anti-CTLA4 agent like ipilimumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate organ and marrow function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Open-label, single-center, non-randomized Phase II study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety Run-in Cohort with 3-6 patients at dose level 2mcg/kg and 4mcg/kg CIV IL-15&#xD;
           (recommended phase II dose) will ensure safety of recommended phase II dose rhIL-15 with&#xD;
           fixed dose avelumab with Dose Expansion Cohort at 4mcg/kg dose level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy of the combination will be assessed in a Simon two-stage phase II design with 9&#xD;
           or 17 patients depending on demonstration of clinical activity in the initial group of 9&#xD;
           patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximum 4 cycles (28-day cycle) of combination therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore both Safety Run-in Cohort and further evaluation in a Dose Expansion&#xD;
           Cohort,the accrual ceiling will be set at 25 patients.&#xD;

             that is different from the lesion biopsied.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;=18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of rhIL-15&#xD;
        in combination with avelumab in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this&#xD;
        study, but may be eligible for future pediatric trials&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Negative serum or urine pregnancy test at screening for women of childbearing&#xD;
             potential (WOCBP).&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone&#xD;
        successful surgical sterilization or who is not postmenopausal. WOCBP must have a negative&#xD;
        pregnancy test (HCG blood or urine) during screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation, and 1 month after completion of rhIL-15 and&#xD;
             avelumab administration. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately.&#xD;

             consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy of grade &gt; 1, with the exception of the&#xD;
             following: alopecia, sensory neuropathy grade &lt;= 2, or other grade &lt;= 2 not&#xD;
             constituting a safety risk based on investigator's judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of immunosuppressive medication, EXCEPT for the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injection (e.g.,&#xD;
                  intra-articular injection)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses &lt;= 10 mg/day of prednisone or&#xD;
                  equivalent; or,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT scan&#xD;
                  premedication).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with previous malignant disease other than the target malignancy within the&#xD;
             last 5 years with the exception of basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or&#xD;
             cervical carcinoma in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of any organ transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vaccination within 4 weeks of the first dose of avelumab. Vaccination with a live&#xD;
             vaccine while on trial is prohibited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and&#xD;
        are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist ) are live attenuated&#xD;
        vaccines, and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar&#xD;
             chemical or biologic composition to rhIL-15 or avelumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing&#xD;
             or active infection requiring systemic therapy, or psychiatric illness/social&#xD;
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability or refusal to practice effective contraception during therapy or the&#xD;
             presence of pregnancy or active breastfeeding. Based on its mechanism of action,&#xD;
             avelumab can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal studies&#xD;
             have demonstrated that inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway can lead to increased risk&#xD;
             of immune-mediated rejection of the developing fetus resulting in fetal death. These&#xD;
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active bacterial infections, documented HIV infection or positive&#xD;
             screening serology, PCR evidence for active or chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C, or&#xD;
             positive screening HBV/HCV serology without documentation of successful curative&#xD;
             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active or history of any autoimmune disease, including asthma requiring&#xD;
             chronic inhaled or oral corticosteroids, or with history of asthma requiring&#xD;
             mechanical ventilation; patients with a history of mild asthma that are on or can be&#xD;
             switched to noncorticosteroid bronchodilator regimens are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiovascular disease: Clinically significant (i.e., active) cardiovascular disease:&#xD;
             cerebral vascular accident/stroke (&lt; 6 months prior to enrollment), myocardial&#xD;
             infarction (&lt; 6 months prior to enrollment), unstable angina, congestive heart failure&#xD;
             (greater than or equal to New York Heart Association Classification Class II), or&#xD;
             serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions including immune colitis,&#xD;
             inflammatory bowel disease, immune pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis or psychiatric&#xD;
             conditions including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or&#xD;
             behavior; or laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study&#xD;
             participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the&#xD;
             interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make&#xD;
             the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;
