  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is to assess&#xD;
      molecular changes that occur in response to physical activity (PA). To achieve this aim,&#xD;
      studies will be conducted in adults and separately in children and adolescents. The UC Irvine&#xD;
      MoTrPAC Pediatric Clinical Center oversees two interrelated study phases in children and&#xD;
      adolescents:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A cross-sectional phase in which molecular transducers (obtained from blood sampling)&#xD;
           are measured in response to an acute exercise challenge (n = 320);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An intervention phase is conducted as a mechanistic randomized controlled trial (RCT).&#xD;
           Participants are recruited from the cross-sectional study phase and randomized to&#xD;
           endurance exercise (EE) training (n = 120) or no exercise Control (n = 50) for a period&#xD;
           of approximately 12 weeks.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching hypothesis is that there are discoverable molecular transducers that&#xD;
      communicate and coordinate the effects of exercise on cells, tissues, and organs, which may&#xD;
      initiate processes ultimately leading to the health benefits of exercise. Because this is a&#xD;
      mechanistic trial, the main goal is not a health-related outcome. Rather, the goal is to&#xD;
      generate a map of the molecular responses to exercise that will be used by the Consortium and&#xD;
      by the scientific community at large to generate hypotheses for future investigations of the&#xD;
      health benefits of PA. Study assessments are completed before and after the intervention&#xD;
      period (exercise or control), and at specific interim time points during the course of the&#xD;
      intervention. An additional focus of the pediatric studies is to examine the impact of sex&#xD;
      and developmental phase (self-reported pubertal stage) during childhood and adolescence on&#xD;
      acute and chronic exercise responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments include measurements of cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength, and body&#xD;
      composition (including whole body bone mineral content) determined by dual-energy x-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry (DXA). There is also collection of blood, monitoring of free-living PA level&#xD;
      using wearable devices, and completion of participant reported outcomes and health status by&#xD;
      interview and/or questionnaire. As part of the MoTrPAC functions, participant data and&#xD;
      biological samples are transferred from the Pediatric Clinical Site to the Consortium&#xD;
      Coordinating Center (CCC) Data Management, Analysis and Quality Control Center (DMAQC) and to&#xD;
      the Biological Sample Repository, and later analyzed by the Consortium Chemical Analysis&#xD;
      Sites (CAS) and the Bioinformatics Center (BIC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological samples collected in this project undergo molecular phenotyping, including&#xD;
      metabolomic, lipidomic, proteomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and genomic analyses. These&#xD;
      assays are done at the MoTrPAC CAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall coordination of the study and analyses occurs at 4 institutions which make up the CCC&#xD;
      and the BIC.&#xD;
