    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, open-label, repeat-dose study designed to assess liver safety, non-liver&#xD;
      safety, and efficacy in subjects who previously experienced liver chemistry test&#xD;
      abnormalities while treated with tolvaptan and were permanently discontinued from the drug&#xD;
      for that reason. Up to 50 eligible subjects will be enrolled and treated with lixivaptan for&#xD;
      52 weeks following titration to an optimal dose.&#xD;

      This is a Phase 3, open-label, repeat-dose study designed to assess liver safety, non-liver&#xD;
      safety, and efficacy in subjects who previously experienced liver chemistry test&#xD;
      abnormalities while treated with tolvaptan and were permanently discontinued from the drug&#xD;
      for that reason. Up to 50 subjects will be enrolled. Evaluations will include frequent&#xD;
      testing of liver chemistry (every week during the Baseline and Titration Periods and every 4&#xD;
      weeks during the Maintenance Period), physical examinations, vital signs, safety labs (serum&#xD;
      chemistry, hematology, urinalysis), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urine&#xD;
      specific gravity and osmolality determinations and trough serum concentration of lixivaptan.&#xD;
      After meeting entry criteria during a 1-3 week Screening Period that can extend up to 8 weeks&#xD;
      for medication adjustment, subjects will enter a 3 week no study treatment Baseline Period to&#xD;
      obtain baseline measurements followed by a 3-6 week Titration Period during which lixivaptan&#xD;
      administered twice daily (BID) will be titrated to a dose that is tolerated and results in a&#xD;
      reduced trough urine specific gravity (or the maximum dose level). The minimum dose to enter&#xD;
      the Maintenance Period is 100 mg BID. Treatment will continue for up to 52 weeks (12 months)&#xD;
      after which study drug will be held, and final assessments obtained during the Follow-up&#xD;
      Period of 4 weeks. The total study duration will be up to approximately 73 weeks (16.8&#xD;
      months).&#xD;

          -  Male or female, between 18 and 65 years of age (inclusive) at the time of Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented diagnosis of ADPKD by imaging or genetic analysis previously treated with&#xD;
             tolvaptan for that indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline eGFR &gt; 20 ml/min/1.73 m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 35 kg/m2 (inclusive) at the time of Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented history of:&#xD;

               -  At least 2 elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, 1 ALT level &gt;2 times&#xD;
                  (x) the upper limit of normal (ULN) and 1 ALT level &gt;3 x ULN while the subject&#xD;
                  was receiving tolvaptan, or within 4 weeks after tolvaptan discontinuation, with&#xD;
                  no other explanation for the ALT elevations. The 2 elevated ALT measurements&#xD;
                  could be recorded during the same instance of liver injury or during distinct&#xD;
                  instances; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least 2 elevated ALT levels, 1 ALT level &gt;2 x the subject's stable baseline&#xD;
                  level and 1 ALT level &gt;3 x the subject's stable baseline level while the subject&#xD;
                  was receiving tolvaptan, or within 4 weeks after tolvaptan discontinuation, with&#xD;
                  no other explanation for the ALT elevations; provided that at least one ALT&#xD;
                  elevation was &gt;2 x ULN. The 2 elevated ALT measurements could be recorded during&#xD;
                  the same instance of liver injury or during distinct instances; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A pattern of ALT elevations deemed by the Investigator to be consistent with&#xD;
                  tolvaptan liver injury with no other explanation for the ALT elevations and&#xD;
                  agreement of the medical monitor and sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;

             x ULN upon rechallenge or the ALT level was increasing but tolvaptan was stopped for&#xD;
             patient safety reasons before it reached &gt; 2 x ULN after having previously normalized.&#xD;
