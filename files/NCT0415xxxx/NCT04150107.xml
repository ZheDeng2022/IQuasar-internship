    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 2 randomized, crossover study comparing ORMD-0801 given QD versus TID&#xD;
      in subjects with T1D. Subjects with T1D will have a screening visit (Visit 1) during which&#xD;
      they will be required to review and sign the informed consent form. Medical history and&#xD;
      demographics will be collected. Vital signs will be measured, physical exam will be&#xD;
      performed, and blood and urine samples will be collected for hematology/chemistry/urinalysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo capsules will be given QD at bedtime during placebo run-in period 10 days prior to&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;

      This study is a Phase 2 randomized, crossover study comparing ORMD-0801 given QD versus TID&#xD;
      in subjects with T1D. Subjects with T1D will have a screening visit (Visit 1) during which&#xD;
      they will be required to review and sign the informed consent form. Medical history and&#xD;
      demographics will be collected. Vital signs will be measured, physical exam will be&#xD;
      performed, and blood and urine samples will be collected for hematology/chemistry/urinalysis.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be scheduled to return to the clinic in 1 week (Visit 2). Subjects&#xD;
      fulfilling all inclusion/exclusion criteria will have a CGM placed, provided with a diary,&#xD;
      dispensed Placebo capsules and asked to return to the clinic in 10 Days (Visit 3, Day 1) for&#xD;
      randomization. At Visit 3, data from CGM will be downloaded and diaries will be collected.&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected in fasting for chemistry and HbA1c. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either ORMD-0801 24 mg given once daily at bedtime, or ORMD-0801 8 mg&#xD;
      given three times a day, 45-90 minutes before meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be instructed to continue their normal diet, and to adjust their basal and&#xD;
      bolus insulin in the normal fashion. Subjects will be instructed to return to the clinic 10&#xD;
      days before Visit 5 (Visit 4, Day 18). At Visit 4, compliance will be assessed, IMP and diary&#xD;
      dispensed and the CGM will be placed. Subjects will be instructed to return to the clinic in&#xD;
      10 days for Visit 5 (Day 28). At Visit 5 a fasting blood sample for chemistry panel and HbA1C&#xD;
      will be drawn and after the diary has been collected and the CGM monitor removed, they will&#xD;
      be crossed over to the alternate treatment regimen. IMP will be dispensed, and the subject&#xD;
      will be asked to return 10 days before Visit 7 for Visit 6 (Day 46). At Visit 6, compliance&#xD;
      will be checked, IMP and diary will be dispensed and the CGM will be placed. Subjects will be&#xD;
      instructed to return in 10 days for Visit 7 (Day 56). At Visit 7 the CGM will be removed,&#xD;
      compliance checked, the diary will be collected, and a blood sample will be drawn for a&#xD;
      chemistry panel and HbA1C. A physical examination will be performed, and the subject will&#xD;
      exit the study. Subjects will be provided with diaries at Visits 2, 4 and 6, and will be&#xD;
      asked to capture the amount of basal and bolus exogenous insulin administered each day and&#xD;
      calculate their carbohydrate count for all meals and snacks over the 10-day CGM monitoring&#xD;
      period. Diaries will be collected at Visits 3, 5 and 7.&#xD;

             duration of the trial and for 14 days after the last dose of blinded investigational&#xD;
             product. Two methods of contraception will be used to avoid pregnancy. Acceptable&#xD;
             combinations of methods include: i. Use of one of the following double-barrier&#xD;
             methods: diaphragm with spermicide and a condom; cervical cap and a condom; or a&#xD;

        subject's preferred and usual lifestyle and if considered acceptable by local regulatory&#xD;
        agencies and ethics committees. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
        sympto-thermal, post-ovulation methods, etc.) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
        contraception.&#xD;
