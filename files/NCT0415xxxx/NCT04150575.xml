      This is a single-arm, open-label, multicentre, phase II clinical study.Subjects can only&#xD;
      enter this study after they meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria.All enrolled patients&#xD;
      will receive the treatment with HLX10 combined with albumin-bound paclitaxel, every 3 weeks,&#xD;
      until progressive disease, initiation of new anti-tumour therapy, death, intolerable&#xD;
      toxicity. Albumin-bound paclitaxel may be used for up to 6 cycles and HLX10 for up to 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
