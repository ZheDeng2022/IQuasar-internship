    <textblock>
      One of the causes of disability in stroke patients is postural disturbances that result in&#xD;
      postural asymmetry in the standing position, characterized during an evaluation on a force&#xD;
      platform by a greater displacement of the center of pressure towards the lesion side and thus&#xD;
      by a greater percentage of weight on the lower limb (Weight -Bearing Asymmetry (WBA)). Today,&#xD;
      the mechanisms of balance disorders in standing position are better understood. Indeed, in&#xD;
      addition to sensory and motor deficits, spatial cognitive disorders also contribute to these&#xD;
      postural disturbances, particularly in right brain damage stroke. This would be the reason&#xD;
      why patients with right brain damage have a more precarious and time-consuming balance to&#xD;
      re-educate than patients with lesions located in the left hemisphere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postural disturbances can also result in a disturbance of balance in the sitting position,&#xD;
      which is a poor prognosis for the acquisition of transfers, standing and walking. To date,&#xD;
      seated postural disturbances are not perfectly described with many differences in the&#xD;
      explanatory mechanisms found in the literature. Thus, some people notice a more pronounced&#xD;
      asymmetry on the medio-lateral plane while others find a more pronounced imbalance at the&#xD;
      antero-posterior plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sitting posture disorders benefit from few instrumental measurement tools outside clinical&#xD;
      measurement scales. A very wide variety of evaluation methods by instrumental measurements&#xD;
      are proposed and not validated. Sensor pad, which are usually used to adjust the bases of&#xD;
      pressure ulcer patients, may be useful in quantifying the postural balance. But since the&#xD;
      involvement of the head and trunk in the sitting posture is well documented in the&#xD;
      literature, the addition of an evaluation of the position of the trunk and head seems&#xD;
      essential. To our knowledge, no author has proposed to quantify sitting balance disorders by&#xD;
      combining a measure of support asymmetry by taking into account the posture of the trunk with&#xD;
      that of the head.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In France, stroke is the third leading cause of death and the first cause of acquired&#xD;
      disability in adults. Approximately 130,000 people suffer a stroke each year. On the other&#xD;
      hand, since the frequency of stroke is age-related, the aging of the population suggests that&#xD;
      the number of people with stroke will increase in the coming years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the causes of disability in stroke patients is postural disturbances. These postural&#xD;
      disturbances cause a greater risk of falls and are a source of loss of autonomy for these&#xD;
      patients. In standing position, during evaluation on a force platform, these postural&#xD;
      disturbances can be characterized by postural asymmetry which results in a greater&#xD;
      displacement of the center of pressure on the lesion side and thus a greater percentage of&#xD;
      support on the lower limb non-paretic (Weight-Bearing Asymmetry (WBA)). Today, the mechanisms&#xD;
      of balance disorders in standing position are better understood. Indeed, in addition to&#xD;
      sensory and motor deficits, spatial cognitive disorders also contribute to these postural&#xD;
      disturbances, particularly in right brain damage stroke. Many authors agree on a localization&#xD;
      of spatial cognition and in particular the mental elaboration of the representation of the&#xD;
      body in space according to the different types of spatial frame at the level of the right&#xD;
      cerebral hemisphere. This would be the reason why patients with right brain damage have a&#xD;
      more precarious and time-consuming balance to rehabilitate than patients with lesions located&#xD;
      in the left hemisphere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postural disturbances can also result in a disturbance of balance in the sitting position.&#xD;
      The persistence of these disorders in a sitting position is a poor prognosis for the&#xD;
      acquisition of transfers, standing and walking. To date, the mechanisms of these postural&#xD;
      disturbances in the seated position in stroke patients have not been fully described. Indeed,&#xD;
      many discrepancies are found in the literature. Although it appears that for a majority of&#xD;
      authors, stroke patients have greater sitting asymmetry than healthy subjects, not all of&#xD;
      them are unanimous. Moreover, among these authors highlighting this asymmetry in the sitting&#xD;
      position, some note a more pronounced lateral plane while others find a more pronounced&#xD;
      imbalance in the antero-posterior plane. Apart from the motor and sensory deficit, the&#xD;
      postural asymmetry found in the sitting position could also be due to a spatial cognitive&#xD;
      disorder. The authors Au-Yeung et al showed a more pronounced deviation in patients with a&#xD;
      localized stroke in the right hemisphere. This result in relation to the relationship between&#xD;
      posturography data from the sitting position and the postural vertical suggests the&#xD;
      involvement of spatial cognition in balance disorders in the sitting position. However, since&#xD;
      the authors Van Nes et al did not find this result in their study, this hypothesis remains to&#xD;
      be confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike standing posture disorders, which are commonly assessed by force platforms in&#xD;
      rehabilitation, sitting posture disorders benefit from few instrumental measurement tools&#xD;
      outside clinical measurement scales. In addition, in the literature, a very wide variety of&#xD;
      evaluation methods by instrumental measures are proposed and not validated. In some cases,&#xD;
      the patient was placed directly on the force platform, others chose to sit the patient on a&#xD;
      chair positioned on the platform. Initially, sensor pad are usually used to adapt the bases&#xD;
      of patients with pressure ulcers but they may be useful for quantifying the postural base.&#xD;
      However, the involvement of the head and trunk in the sitting posture is well documented in&#xD;
      the literature and the addition of an assessment of the trunk and head therefore seems&#xD;
      essential. To our knowledge, no author has studied sitting balance disorders in a quantified&#xD;
      way by taking into account both the posture of the trunk associated with the head and a&#xD;
      measurement of postural asymmetry.&#xD;

The subject will be in a sitting position on the pressure sheet with his legs hanging and his upper limbs relaxed on his knees. The value selected will be the average of 2 tests performed with the eyes open and 2 tests performed with the eyes closed, for 30 seconds. This all test will be repeated twice.</description>

    <description>Trunk and head movements will be analyzed by inertial measurement units (IMU) (XsensÂ®) by estimating the variations in orientation between conditions. The IMUs estimate the orientation of the sensor in a land reference frame. The anatomical orientation of the segments is calculated after correction of the sensor orientation. This correction is quantified by a quick calibration procedure. The value selected will be the average of 2 tests performed with the eyes open and 2 tests performed with the eyes closed, for 30 seconds. This all test will be repeated twice.</description>

    <description>After a time of installation of the OptitrackÂ® device's and two accelerometers (one placed on the subject's trunk facing the sternum fixed with a headband and the second at the level of the head also held with a headband), the subject will perform an evaluation of the balance sitting on the sensor pad; the movements of the head and trunk will be analyzed by the OptitrackÂ® device and by the two accelerometers.&#xD;
The subject will perform 4 30-second tests, two with eyes open and two with eyes closed. A rest period may be taken between each assessment depending on the subject.&#xD;
During these evaluations, a physiotherapist will be present to avoid the risk of falling.&#xD;
After a rest period of 30 minutes, a new assessment of the sitting posture will be carried out to assess the reproducibility of the tools (sensor pad, accelerometers, OptitrackÂ®).</description>
