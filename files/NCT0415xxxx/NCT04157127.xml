  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, first in man, dose escalation study for safety and feasibility for&#xD;
      administration of 3 doses of DC vaccine for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this phase 1, first in man trial is to determine the safety,&#xD;
      toxicity, and feasibility of delivering autologous dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with&#xD;
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma lysate plus mRNA to pancreatic cancer patients as adjuvant therapy&#xD;
      following completion of standard chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will first complete standard treatment for pancreatic adenocarcinoma which is&#xD;
      surgically resectable or potentially resectable and then within 3 months of finishing&#xD;
      standard treatment, they will have three doses of the dendritic cell vaccine by perinodal&#xD;
      injection using ultrasound (US) or computed-tomography (CT) guidance.&#xD;

    <description>Vaccine made from autologous dendritic cells loaded with tumor cell lysate and RNA. Subject will get 3 doses of DC vaccine (one every 14 days) and be monitored (vital signs every 30 minutes) for 2 hours after each dose. During treatment, subjects get weekly peg-interferon a-2a at 180 mcg/week on the first day of vaccination up through 14 days after last vaccination.&#xD;
DC Vaccine dose evaluated in Cohort 1:&#xD;
st vaccine - 0.5 million cells&#xD;

At each dose level, the 1st subject should get all 3 vaccinations before the 2nd and 3rd subjects at that level receive their 1st vaccination. The 3rd subject can begin vaccination regardless of the time since the 2nd subject began vaccinations. All 3 subjects in cohort should get all 3 vaccinations before any subjects are treated in the next higher cohort. Because of this, the study may not progress to every dose level before MTD is found.</description>
