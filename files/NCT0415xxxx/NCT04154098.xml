  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder instability due to muscle weakness is a common problem in disorders of the upper&#xD;
      extremities. During arm motion, the scapula acts as a dynamic base for the humeral head. To&#xD;
      safely move the shoulder with an exoskeleton for the upper extremities a textile orthosis was&#xD;
      developed that stabilizes the scapula against the thorax. The support level of the orthosis&#xD;
      is continuously manually adjustable. To test the feasibility of our design and to improve the&#xD;
      functionality of the textile orthosis, it needs to be investigated how the orthosis acts on&#xD;
      people affected by shoulder instability. The investigators seek to explore how people with&#xD;
      shoulder instability respond to the orthosis, and how they may benefit from the orthosis&#xD;
      function. Therefore, the range of motion of arm elevation will be compared in different&#xD;
      conditions: (i) without any support, (ii) with the support of a trained therapist, and (iii)&#xD;
      when the device is engaged at the individual's optimal support level. Additionally, pilot&#xD;
      tests will be performed to fix different parameters in our study protocol, such as the the&#xD;
      optimal orthosis stiffness level and the ideal number of movement repetitions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, participants suffering from muscular weakness in the upper extremities,&#xD;
      particularly the shoulder joint, will be recruited. A clear indicator for muscular weakness&#xD;
      in the shoulder joint is a scapula alata (winging scapula). Hence, participants recruited for&#xD;
      this study should present with a scapula alata and a limited RoM of at least one of their&#xD;
      upper extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as a cross-over trial. Each participant will take part in an&#xD;
      experimental session that will last approximately 2 hours. At the beginning of the&#xD;
      experiment, the participant will be informed about the measurement and sign the informed&#xD;
      consent sheet. Additional demographic data and level of ability will be collected in a&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the measurements, participants will be fitted a textile scapula orthosis. The orthosis&#xD;
      will be instrumented to quantify the amount of support the orthosis provides to the user.&#xD;
      Therefore, an array of force sensors is mounted between the orthosis and the skin to measure&#xD;
      the qualitative force distribution and its rate of change. To measure the absolute force&#xD;
      applied to the plate, a load cell will be mounted on the orthosis fastening mechanism. All&#xD;
      force data will be collected synchronously through a Micro-Controller board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be equipped with reflective adhesive markers to define the reference&#xD;
      points for the range of motion measurements, which will be done with a goniometer and&#xD;
      photographic opto-electronic motion tracking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nine blocks of measurements will be conducted, lasting 5 minutes each. The remaining time in&#xD;
      the study accounts for rest periods, the mounting and demounting of the orthosis,&#xD;
      instructions and questionnaires. The first eight blocks will present the following treatment&#xD;
      conditions in randomized order:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No support (NO): the scapula is not assisted during arm elevation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Manual scapular assistance (SA): a trained person assists the scapula during arm&#xD;
           elevation manually.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Orthosis support (OS): the scapula is assisted by the textile orthosis set to&#xD;
           meaningfully different force levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motor control task (MT): The participant reaches for a target placed at the maximum&#xD;
           elevation height in the NO condition, once without and once with the orthosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While one block each is performed in the NO, SA and MT conditions, six blocks are performed&#xD;
      in the OS condition with the orthosis set to meaningfully different force levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each measurement set, participants will elevate their arms in one of two planes of&#xD;
      horizontal rotation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30° (R30) as measured from the coronal body plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  80° (R80) as measured from the coronal body plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During arm elevation, the arm is fully extended, i.e. the elbow and wrist are fully&#xD;
      stretched. In this position, the center of mass has the largest lever arm and therefore the&#xD;
      maximum torque due to gravity occurs in the shoulder. One measurement set will be done in&#xD;
      each elevation plane. During the OS condition, the orthosis will be opened between&#xD;
      measurement sets to allow for comfort and unhindered breathing and to guarantee independence&#xD;
      of measurement data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the experiment, the perceived exertion and orthosis comfort will be assessed using the&#xD;
      Borg Scale and the Nordic Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the study, several study parameters will be determined in pilot studies with variable&#xD;
      duration, not exceeding 2 hours. The participants in the pilot studies and the final study&#xD;
      might be identical. During the pilot tests, participants will wear an orthosis similar to the&#xD;
      one used in the study. Hence, effort and strain for participants will be equal or less to the&#xD;
      final study. The pilot tests include&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Definition of optimal pressure and protocol to consistently find this pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Definition of optimal orthosis configuration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Definition of repeatability when orthosis is unmounted and mounted again.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Definition of meaningful difference between pressure levels.&#xD;
