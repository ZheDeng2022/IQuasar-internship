  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diagnosing and documenting the presence of abnormal change in cognitive functions (such as&#xD;
      reasoning abilities) in children over time is of upmost importance when it comes to&#xD;
      evaluating the impact of neurological injury, disease, and interventions designed to help&#xD;
      improve wellbeing. Unfortunately however, current methods for detecting cognitive impairment&#xD;
      and monitoring for abnormal cognitive change in children over time are seriously flawed. By&#xD;
      assessing typically developing children's cognitive functioning at two different time points,&#xD;
      this study intends to generate new normative data that will significantly improve measurement&#xD;
      accuracy when it comes to evaluating the impact of neurological injury and disease on a&#xD;
      child's cognitive abilities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurological injury and disease can substantially affect how children's brains work. This can&#xD;
      severely impair cognitive abilities and general development. On a day-to-day level,&#xD;
      completing everyday tasks, socialising successfully with peers, and getting on with school&#xD;
      work can become much more difficult than it was before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Helpfully, supports and treatments are available that can reduce the negative effects of&#xD;
      neurological impairment on a child's cognitive functioning in order to maximise developmental&#xD;
      outcomes. However, to deliver appropriate interventions, we must correctly estimate the&#xD;
      impact of injury or illness on cognitive abilities and accurately measure how successful&#xD;
      treatments are at improving outcomes. Unfortunately, reliable ways of doing this simply do&#xD;
      not exist at this time. Consequently, accurate disease (effects) monitoring is seriously&#xD;
      undermined; potentially compromising a child's medical management and, thereby, future&#xD;
      developmental outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study intends to addresses this grave shortcoming by developing reliable ways of&#xD;
      measuring the cognitive effects of neurological disease or injury at diagnosis and beyond. Of&#xD;
      note, by providing a mechanism to better inform clinical/medical management decisions,&#xD;
      completion of this study will help contribute to health and social care aims of enabling&#xD;
      children to realise their developmental potential.&#xD;
