  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) is a novel metric developed to quantify the amount of&#xD;
      routine physical activity (PA) needed to improve health and reduce cardiovascular (CV)&#xD;
      mortality. The PAI metric can be integrated in PA monitors to promote and track PA. The&#xD;
      present pilot study is a 12-week randomized controlled trial designed to test the efficacy of&#xD;
      PAI in the treatment of high blood pressure. The primary aim is to investigate how routine PA&#xD;
      (expressed as PAI level) affect ambulatory blood pressure by comparing the effect of the&#xD;
      intervention (≥100 PAI per week) with a control recommended to follow national PA guidelines.&#xD;
      The secondary aims are to investigate the effect on a comprehensive CV risk profile, and to&#xD;
      model the effect of PAI level on multiple CV parameters. The CV risk profile includes office&#xD;
      BP, arterial stiffness, stroke volume, heart rate, cardiac output, systemic vascular&#xD;
      resistance, cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition, blood lipid profile and serum&#xD;
      markers of glucose metabolism, kidney failure and systemic inflammation.&#xD;

    <description>The control group is recommended to follow national PA guidelines, meaning 150 minutes of moderate-intensity PA or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity PA, or a combination there of. The control group is provided with a PAI monitor (wristband) without any user interface and are thus blinded to track their own PAI level.</description>
