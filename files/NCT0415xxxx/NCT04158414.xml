  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is a global health issue. According to the World Health Organization, Cancer is the&#xD;
      second leading cause of death globally, and is responsible for an estimated 9.6 million&#xD;
      deaths in 2018. In Israel, more than 30,000 new cases of cancer were diagnosed, and more than&#xD;
      11,000 deaths were cancer-related during 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging plays a pivotal role in cancer management, and multiple techniques are used in all&#xD;
      phases of cancer management. The overall morphological, structural, metabolic and functional&#xD;
      information obtained in imaging is used for improved individualized therapy planning.&#xD;
      Different imaging modalities are available during different time points in the natural&#xD;
      history of different malignancies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early detection of cancer through screening based on imaging is probably a major contributor&#xD;
      to a reduction in mortality for certain cancers .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a diagnosis is made, determining the clinical stage of cancer, meaning the extent of the&#xD;
      disease before any treatment is given, is a critical element in determining appropriate&#xD;
      treatment based on the experience and outcomes of groups of previous patients with similar&#xD;
      stage . Precise clinical staging of cancer is crucial. Not only that this clear non-ambiguous&#xD;
      description is a key factor that defines prognosis, it is also a chief component of&#xD;
      inclusion, exclusion, and stratification criteria for clinical trials. Several cancer staging&#xD;
      systems are used worldwide. The most clinically useful staging system is the tumor, node, and&#xD;
      metastasis (TNM) staging system developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) in&#xD;
      collaboration with the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC). The AJCC TNM system&#xD;
      classifies cancers by the size and extent of the primary tumor (T), involvement of regional&#xD;
      lymph nodes (N), and the presence or absence of distant metastases (M). There is a TNM&#xD;
      staging algorithm for cancers of virtually every anatomic site and histology, with the&#xD;
      primary exception of pediatric cancers. The clinical TNM (cTNM) classification should be used&#xD;
      to determine correctly the clinical stage of cancer and to help guide primary therapy&#xD;
      planning.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Stage may be defined at several time points during the monitoring period of cancer patients.&#xD;
      When using imaging obtained during the relevant time frame, one may use one of the other TNM&#xD;
      categories to stage correctly the cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For example, imaging is of high value in assessing therapy response during and after systemic&#xD;
      and/or radiation therapy is given . Using imaging data and the clinical posttherapy TNM&#xD;
      classification (ycTNM) is helpful in determining the patient's response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case a patient is given the systemic therapy as a neoadjuvant therapy before a planned&#xD;
      curative surgery, imaging may categorize the patient as a responder vs non-responder. If&#xD;
      categorized as an early non-responder, another therapy or an upfront surgery may be advised,&#xD;
      while eliminating therapy toxicity. If imaging, however, supports major response to&#xD;
      treatment, more conservative treatment and avoidance of surgical intervention may be&#xD;
      considered and change patients quality of life dramatically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients given a systemic therapy as a curative or a palliative therapy, assessing the&#xD;
      response via imaging is crucial as well - if imaging studies support a progressive disease,&#xD;
      changing therapy protocol is advised. In a disease controlled by the therapy, imaging may aid&#xD;
      in guiding follow-up schedule, lifestyle and medical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of therapy response assessment, imaging is also important in assessing side&#xD;
      effects of the therapy. Imaging may identify radiation-induced injuries, and may recognize&#xD;
      pathologies associated with chemotherapy, biologic and immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging is also critical when recurrence of malignant disease is suspected. In such cases,&#xD;
      when signs or symptoms suggest local recurrence, or when raised level of a tumor marker is&#xD;
      documented, different imaging techniques can dramatically guide restaging of the disease&#xD;
      using the recurrence-TNM classification (rTNM). In such cases imaging may localize the&#xD;
      recurrent disease and may guide surgical/radiation/systemic therapy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different imaging modalities allow assessment of virtually every cancer site and in every&#xD;
      time frame during the continuum of the disease. Imaging aids in assessing tumor's size,&#xD;
      location, and relationship to normal anatomic structures, as well as the existence of nodal&#xD;
      and/or distant metastatic disease. Among the most commonly used imaging modalities are&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, positron emission tomography (PET)&#xD;
      and ultrasound. In addition to providing key information for assigning the T, N, and M&#xD;
      categories, imaging is invaluable for guiding biopsies and surgical resections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET imaging has revolutionized the imaging evaluation of cancer . By exploiting biochemical&#xD;
      and physiologic differences between tumor cells and normal tissues , PET imaging has become&#xD;
