    <textblock>
      Infertility is of increasing significance affecting almost 48.5 million couples around the&#xD;
      world. Anovulation is a major cause of infertility in women with polycystic ovary syndrome&#xD;
      (PCOS) accounting for about 80% of women with anovulatory infertility. Ultrasound&#xD;
      morphological features of PCOS include the presence of 16 or more follicles measuring 2-9 mm&#xD;
      in diameter, and/or an overall large ovarian volume of &gt;10mm3. Women with PCOS ultrasound&#xD;
      features exhibit an exaggerated response to controlled ovarian stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation is an established prerequisite to assisted reproductive&#xD;
      techniques with the aim of obtaining a higher yield of oocytes and ultimately increasing&#xD;
      success rates. According to the ESHRE/ASRM consensus on infertility treatment related to&#xD;
      polycystic ovary syndrome, IVF seems to represent a reasonable treatment option as the risks&#xD;
      of multiple pregnancies and ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome may be kept to a minimum. The&#xD;
      optimal stimulation protocol however is still debatable. Recently, patient-friendly&#xD;
      stimulation protocols for assisted reproductive technology were introduced aiming at&#xD;
      minimizing overall treatment costs and health hazards to the patient. Mild stimulation&#xD;
      protocols are considered relatively novel protocols. They consist of combining oral&#xD;
      stimulation agents (clomiphene citrate or letrozole) with low-dose gonadotropins as effective&#xD;
      alternatives to conventional gonadotropin-only stimulation protocols. Mild stimulation&#xD;
      protocol has been associated with better tolerance, ease of use, and comparable livebirth&#xD;
      outcomes. The investigators aim to test the hypothesis that mild stimulation protocols could&#xD;
      produce a similar proportion of term livebirths to conventional treatment, while reducing&#xD;
      treatment costs and health hazards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective non-randomized controlled trial comparing a mild ovarian stimulation&#xD;
      protocol to conventional treatment for assisted reproductive technology at the Division of&#xD;
      Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility - Haifa Idriss Fertility Center - American&#xD;
      University of Beirut Medical Center.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Infertility is a medical condition of increasing significance with an estimated 48.5 million&#xD;
      affected couples around the world . Anovulation is a major cause of infertility in women with&#xD;
      polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) accounting for about 80% of women with anovulatory&#xD;
      infertility. The prevalence of PCOS varies widely among different ethnic populations and is&#xD;
      highest in the Middle East. One way to diagnose PCOS is on the basis of the Rotterdam&#xD;
      criteria, according to which women should satisfy 2 of 3 criteria including anovulation,&#xD;
      polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound and hyperandrogenism (either clinical or&#xD;
      biochemical). Trans-vaginal ultrasound evaluation is an important tool to assess ovarian&#xD;
      features and determine the risk for ovarian hyper-response to follicle stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound morphological features of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) include the presence of&#xD;
      16 or more follicles measuring 2-9mm in diameter, and/or an overall large ovarian volume of&#xD;
      &gt;10mm3. Women with PCOS ultrasound features exhibit an exaggerated response to controlled&#xD;
      ovarian stimulation . It was demonstrated that the number of baseline follicles seen on&#xD;
      ultrasound strongly correlates with the number of recovered oocytes, and that was especially&#xD;
      documented in women with a baseline number of pre-antral follicles exceeding 15 who were&#xD;
      found to be at increased risk for ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation is an established prerequisite to assisted reproductive&#xD;
      techniques with the aim of obtaining a higher yield of oocytes and ultimately increasing&#xD;
      success rates. According to the ESHRE/ASRM consensus on infertility treatment related to&#xD;
      polycystic ovary syndrome (2008), IVF seems to represent a reasonable treatment option as the&#xD;
      risks of multiple pregnancies and ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome may be kept to a&#xD;
      minimum. The optimal stimulation protocol however is still debatable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to conduct a prospective non-randomized controlled trial comparing a&#xD;
      mild ovarian stimulation protocol to conventional treatment for assisted reproductive&#xD;
      technology at the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility - Haifa Idriss&#xD;
      Fertility Center - American University of Beirut Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interest in embryo cryopreservation will be discussed with candidates before the start of IVF&#xD;
      treatment. Women meeting the inclusion criteria who show no interest in embryo&#xD;
      cryopreservation and in obtaining supernumerary embryos will be allocated to the mild&#xD;
      stimulation (group A) protocol. Alternatively, women interested in obtaining a high number of&#xD;
      embryos for the purpose of cryopreservation will be allocated to the conventional stimulation&#xD;
      (group B) protocol.&#xD;

    <description>Group A (mild stimulation protocol) will receive oral Clomiphene Citrate (Clomid®) 150 mg/day for 5 days (starting on the 2nd of menses), followed by FSH/HMG (human menopausal gonadotropins) at a daily dose of 150-225 IU starting from the 6th day of the menstrual cycle. GnRH antagonist (Cetrotide®, Merck-Serono, Switzerland) 0.25 mg subcutaneously daily will be started once a dominant follicle becomes ≥14 mm until the day of final follicle maturation. Once 3 leading follicles reach 18mm in diameter, final follicle maturation will be triggered using HCG (Choriomon® 10,000 IU) in the presence of 14 or less pre-ovulatory follicles or GnRH agonist (Triptorelin-Gonapeptyl® 0.3mg single dose) in the presence of 15 or more follicles. The choice of the starting FSH/HMG daily dose will be tailored to BMI: 150 IU/d for BMI less than 25 and 225IU/d for BMI 25 and above.</description>
