  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. People living with type 2 diabetes are told that they have a significantly higher risk of&#xD;
      developing a disease related to the heart or blood vessels. These diseases can play a major&#xD;
      role for the overall health of the patient and can even cause death due to a blood clot in&#xD;
      the heart, brain or other parts of the body. Understandibly, this information can cause a&#xD;
      great deal of stress and anxiety for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of today a doctor can not determine which patient has a higher risk of disease in the&#xD;
      Heart and blood vessels. Therefore, we see a great need for further exploration of the&#xD;
      mechanisms that could help identify diabetic patients with a particularly high risk of&#xD;
      developing these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this PhD project we aim at identifying diabetic patients with a specific pattern in the&#xD;
      amount of proteins in the blood, tissue and genetic material who are at high risk of death or&#xD;
      disease related to the heart and blood vessels. We explore this problem from two angles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first part of the PhD study, we identify and measure proteins, which are related to&#xD;
      high risk of disease in the heart and blood vessels. These proteins come from the blood&#xD;
      vessels (a specific part called the basement membrane) and are believed to be present in a&#xD;
      higher concentration, when people have diabetes. At the same time, we measure the same&#xD;
      proteins in a blood sample from the patients, and we also examine their genetic properties&#xD;
      with a focus on specific genetic areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the tissue and blood samples have already been collected from patients, who have&#xD;
      undergone a by-pass operation in the Heart at Odense University Hospital since 2008. All of&#xD;
      the material is stored in a biobank (Odense Artery Biobank).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also collect data from Statictics Denmark about each individual. These data are used to&#xD;
      categorize people into risk categories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We then hope to see a pattern in the measurements from the laboratory that match the risk&#xD;
      profile of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second part of the study we use a different approach. Data from a large study done on&#xD;
      the population of Malmö, Sweden, can be used to examine the Development of blood vessels in&#xD;
      diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study healthy people from Malmö have undergone a number of examinations in the early&#xD;
      1990'ies and again 15 years later. One of the tests was an ultrasound of the large blood&#xD;
      vessel on the neck, the carotid artery. With this ultrasound we are able to measure the&#xD;
      thickness of the wall of the blood vessel and the diameter in which the blood can pass&#xD;
      through.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We think that there is a connection between diabetes and the diameter of the blood vessel and&#xD;
      that, over time, diabetes can cause the blood vessel to become narrower. This idea links the&#xD;
      two studies because the same proteins that can be found in the first study are important in&#xD;
      determining the risk of having a narrow blood Vessel when the patient has diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project can contribute with a deeper knowledge about the linking mechanisms between&#xD;
      diabetes and disease in the heart and blood vessels: which proteins are present in higher&#xD;
      concentration? How does this relate to a higher risk? How do diabetic blood vessels change&#xD;
      over time? We will aim at answering these questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regards to clinical practice, we see several perspectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  deeper knowledge and understanding of the mechanisms behind the diasease in the heart&#xD;
           and blood vessels that follows diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  development of a new blood test. Over time, the proteins measured in this study could be&#xD;
           developed to a new blood test that gives information about a patients risk of developing&#xD;
           a diasease in the heart or blood vessels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  better treatment for patients with diabetes because aptient with high risk can be&#xD;
           treated more intensely&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve the goals of this project there are several overall tasks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  select patients form the biobank, that are suitable for the project (the correct type of&#xD;
           tissue and blood sample available)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  do work in the laboratory. This includes cutting and preparing tissue, analyzing the&#xD;
           tissue and blood samples, implementing new methods for analysis etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  collect clinical data form Statistics Denmark. This process can be quite detailed and&#xD;
           time consuming.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  obtain data from 'The Diet and Cancer Study' in Sweden, Malmö&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  analyze data from study 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  analyze data from study 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  write articles&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  collect all parts of the projects in the final thesis&#xD;

&#xD;
      Project description Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) occur frequently among individuals with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and the mortality after cardiac interventions and&#xD;
      cardiovascular events is significantly increased in T2DM. We have recently identified a&#xD;
      series of distinct molecular alterations in non-atherosclerotic parts of the arterial tree in&#xD;
      diabetes, which represent elements of the generalized diabetic vascular pathology. Whether&#xD;
      these generalized diabetic alterations are related to the development of clinical&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall hypothesis Our overall hypothesis is that specific arterial protein alterations,&#xD;
      particularly related to basement membrane molecules as seen in T2DM, are followed by&#xD;
      dysfunctional vessel remodeling (inward instead of outward). Such changes may provide the&#xD;
      background for lumen reduction in relation to atherosclerosis build-up in diabetes and&#xD;
      explain the high incidence of CVDs among these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and study designs&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this ph.d.-project, we will test two aspects of this hypothesis with the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. We will determine if the presence of a diabetic arterial protein pattern predicts future&#xD;
           incidence of cardiovascular events and occurrence of lumen reduction and ultimately&#xD;
           occlusion in the repair vessel (left internal mammary artery (LIMA)) after by-pass&#xD;
           operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We will quantitate specific arterial basement membrane proteins by targeted proteome&#xD;
           analysis in non-atherosclerotic human arterial tissue (the repair artery from coronary&#xD;
           by-pass operations) and in plasma by immunoassays from a large group of coronary by-pass&#xD;
           patients with or without T2DM. We will determine if the concentration of these&#xD;
           components in a follow-up study predicts occlusion (clinical proxy for lumen reduction)&#xD;
           of the repair vessel itself, the incidence of cardiovascular events and/or the&#xD;
           development of diabetic small- and large vessel disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. We will determine if dysfunctional arterial remodeling occurs in T2DM or subjects with&#xD;
           impaired fasting glucose in relation to plaque build-up in the carotid artery We will&#xD;
           therefore identify the influence of T2DM on the relationship between the amounts of&#xD;
           atherosclerosis, remodeling (luminal size and wall thickness) and blood pressure in&#xD;
           previously scanned individuals from the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspective The results will provide important information about whether arterial matrix&#xD;
      changes in diabetes are involved in the development of cardiovascular symptoms and, moreover,&#xD;
      determine if dysfunctional remodeling occurs in diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such pathophysiological insight is a prerequisite for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  better biomarkers for diagnosing and stratifying T2DM patients with risk of arterial&#xD;
           disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  development of new targets for treatment of large-vessel complications in diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background T2DM is a severe illness that results in affection of various organ systems,&#xD;
      including the cardiovascular system (1). Diabetes is a global threat that affects every part&#xD;
      of the world. The number of people suffering from T2DM is increasing and is expected to rise&#xD;
      to more than 350 million people worldwide in the year 2030 (2). Patients with T2DM have&#xD;
      increased risk of morbidity and mortality of CVDs such as stroke and acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (AMI) and have a shorter life expectancy (3, 4). Diabetes also increases the risk&#xD;
      of microvascular complications such as diabetic retinopathy (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial tissue is affected by diabetes. The arterial pathology includes changes in the&#xD;
      extracellular matrix, increased arterial stiffness, dysfunctional remodeling (6) ,&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction and accelerated atherosclerosis. It is hypothesized that arterial&#xD;
      stiffness in diabetic patients with hypertension correlates to endothelial dysfunction (7).&#xD;
      Patients with T2DM that undergo coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) have an increased&#xD;
      risk of death compared to non-diabetic patients, as shown in the Swedish SWEDEHEART study&#xD;
      (8). Diabetes affects long-term survival after CABG, and if the patient has diabetic kidney&#xD;
      disease or other diabetic vascular complications the difference is even more profound (9).&#xD;
      The exact mechanisms that link T2DM to CVDs are not fully understood. During recent years, we&#xD;
      have identified molecular changes in the arterial wall in humans with T2DM. Using microarray&#xD;
      techniques for RNA-analysis, we found that specific molecular pathways were altered in&#xD;
      arterial tissue in diabetes. These dysregulated pathways included insulin signaling and&#xD;
      matrix biosynthesis (10). We also observed that a basement membrane and elastin-related&#xD;
      molecule called fibulin-1 is present in increased amounts in diabetes (11-13). Afterwards, we&#xD;
      have been able to show that increased amounts of fibulin-1 in plasma correlates to&#xD;
      cardiovascular morbidities and predict mortality (11, 13, 14). Recently, we have used&#xD;
      proteome analysis of human arteries to find arterial proteins with different concentrations&#xD;
      in diabetic arteries (15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We observed that most basement membrane proteins, and certain proteins related to smooth&#xD;
      muscle phenotypic states, in combination with other peptides are present in altered&#xD;
      concentrations in diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As previously mentioned, we only understand some of the processes that link diabetes to the&#xD;
      development of CVDs. We have yet to determine whether the above mentioned findings are indeed&#xD;
      involved in the development of clinical CVDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall hypothesis of this PhD-project is depicted in the above figure 1: Metabolic and&#xD;
      hormonal factors lead to arterial basement membrane changes diffusely in the arterial tree.&#xD;
      This leads to altered ability of the arterial wall to adapt by outward remodeling as the&#xD;
      normal consequence to atherosclerosis. On the contrary, inward shrinkage, leading to lumen&#xD;
      obstructions, occurs. Thus, generalized diabetic arterial matrix changes may ultimately lead&#xD;
      to arterial lumen obstructions and clinical symptoms coupling molecular changes to&#xD;
      development of CVDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with T2DM have elevated serum levels of fibulin-1, elevated expression of elements&#xD;
      from lamina basalis in the left internal mammary artery, and increased glycation of collagen&#xD;
      in the arterial wall due to hyperglycemia (13). This may all contribute to the increased&#xD;
      central arterial stiffness observed in T2DM, which can be assessed by carotid femoral pulse&#xD;
      wave velocity (cfPWV). Normal aging as well as hypertension is, in the carotid arteries,&#xD;
      associated with hypertrophic remodeling with increase of both lumen diameter and wall&#xD;
      thickness, assessed by intima-media thickness (IMT). We have recently demonstrated that&#xD;
      progression of IMT is associated with the sum of cardiovascular risk factors but with&#xD;
      different contributions of the individual risk factors in the common carotid artery (CCA) and&#xD;
      the bifurcation, respectively. However, IMT alone might not fully reflect the remodeling of&#xD;
      the carotid artery, because lumen may change differently compared to IMT in response to&#xD;
      certain cardiovascular risk factors. IMT progression is positively associated with most of&#xD;
      the cardiovascular risk factors, whereas increased lumen is primarily associated with aging&#xD;
      and hypertension (16). Furthermore, coronary atherosclerosis has been demonstrated to lead to&#xD;
      inward instead of outward remodeling in T2DM, which might be secondary to the stiffer&#xD;
      arteries and explain the reverse outcome after percutane coronary intervention (PCI) in T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PhD-study will consist of two independent substudies, as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis We hypothesize that the amount of basement membrane proteins in arterial tissue&#xD;
      and plasma from patients with T2DM can predict long-term clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods From most coronary by-pass operations done at OUH for the last 8 years,&#xD;
      we have secured immediate handling and storing of the repair artery (internal mammary&#xD;
      artery). The mid-portion of each artery is freed from surrounding tissue, cut, short-time&#xD;
      formalin fixed and embedded in paraffin. The rest of the tissue is frozen. The tissue is&#xD;
      stored in &quot;Odense Artery Biobank&quot; where tissue and blood samples from patients undergoing&#xD;
      CABG have been collected continuously since 2008. We will include all patients with available&#xD;
      tissue in our biobank, which will be approximately 180 patients with T2DM and 420 patients&#xD;
      without diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations All participants gave written informed consent, and the study was&#xD;
      approved by the local ethics committees (S-20100044). The clinical studies will be approved&#xD;
      by the Regional Scientific Ethical Committee for Southern Denmark and all projects will be&#xD;
      reported to the Danish Data Protection Agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeted proteome analysis on arterial tissue Quantitative targeted proteome analysis based&#xD;
      on mass spectrometry will be performed on small amounts of arterial tissue using&#xD;
      modifications of our recently developed protocols. Four sections of paraffin-embedded tissue&#xD;
      from each patient will be used and targeted proteome analysis will be performed based on the&#xD;
      methods based both on proteome analysis of the arterial wall (15, 17, 18) and multiplex,&#xD;
      targeted LC-MS analysis of different proteins in other studies (19, 20).Our proteome analysis&#xD;
      is based on material from slices of the same formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue&#xD;
      as used for histology. We will quantitate peptides derived from abundant proteins, where we&#xD;
      previously found changes in diabetes, i.e. type IV collagen alpha 1 and alpha 2 chain,&#xD;
      nidogen, biglycan, laminin, and desmin and will furthermore use the amount of alpha-smooth&#xD;
      muscle actin and vimentin as controls, since no alterations were previously observed in&#xD;
      patients with T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From these results we will calculate a composite &quot;Basement membrane risk score&quot;. This score&#xD;
      is based on that each basement membrane proteins couints for 0, if the concentration is below&#xD;
      the median and 1 if the concentration is above. The combined basement membrane score is&#xD;
      calculated as the sum of each of the five proteins, i.e. it can have values between 0 and 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative histomorphometric calculations We will quantitate the tissue volume of fibrosis,&#xD;
      elastin content, smooth cell content and number as previously described Preil et al (15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma measurements of basement membrane proteins We plan to measure the amounts of&#xD;
      circulating fragments of several of the same proteins as mentioned above, i.e. type IV&#xD;
      collagen (C4M3a, C4M), biglycan (BGN) and laminin as well as fibulin-1. These assays have&#xD;
      been developed by Nordic Biosciences. Pilot data on a small group of our combined diabetic&#xD;
      and non-diabetic patients (n=36) show that the plasma level of these components correlate&#xD;
      well to HbA1c (C4M3a: r=0.39, p&lt;0.05, C4M2: r=0.36, p&lt;0.05, BGN: r=0.45, p&lt;0.01, Signe Holm&#xD;
      Nielsen et al, Nordic Bioscience, unpublished).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will investigate possible associations between plasma and tissue concentrations of the&#xD;
      specific proteins and several clinical parameters as registered in a 2-8 year follow up&#xD;
      period after the harvest of arterial tissue. Follow-up parameters will include the following&#xD;
      three types:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Parameters related to the repair vessel, i.e. LIMA lumen size in the latest coronary&#xD;
           arteriography performed after the operation compared to LIMA lumen size at the operation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Parameters related to the heart, i.e. MI, angina, re-CAD, heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Parameters related to occurrence of generalized cardiovascular events and diabetic&#xD;
           complications in the diabetic group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have available a subfraction of the operated patients with renewed coronary arteriography&#xD;
      (approximately 35 %). We are aware that this subgroup is biased due to clinical indications&#xD;
      for renewed arteriography giving competing reasons for a smaller LIMA lumen at the renewed&#xD;
      arteriography. We will measure lumen size of this internal mammary artery from the coronary&#xD;
      arteriography and compare it to the size of the vessel at the time of harvest at the&#xD;
      operation, where it can be measured by histology. Although the two methods may not be equally&#xD;
      calibrated, we assume that the bias is approximately the same in all patients. In this&#xD;
      subgroup we will measure correlations between lumen diameter change (or occlusion) and plasma&#xD;
      and arterial measures of the selected proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following clinical follow-up parameters are registered: all-cause mortality, non-fatal&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, cardiac arrest with resuscitation,&#xD;
      hospitalization for heart failure or unstable angina pectoris, non-fatal stroke, progression&#xD;
      of nephropathy or retinopathy. Progression of nephropathy is defined as renal failure&#xD;
      (defined by the need for chronic dialysis), development of macroalbuminuria or doubling of&#xD;
      s-creatinine (only above 200uM). Development of retinopathy is defined as proliferative&#xD;
      retinopathy or macular edema that requires laser therapy, vitrectomy or diabetes related&#xD;
      blindness (Snellen visual acuity below 0.1). Death is obtained from the Civil Registration&#xD;
      System. The individual diagnoses, operations and procedure codes are obtained from The Danish&#xD;
      National Patient Register. P-creatinine and U-albumin-creatinine-ratio is obtained through&#xD;
      laboratory result database. Our primary end point is defined as a composite of cardiac events&#xD;
      (MI, coronary revascularization, sudden death, hospitalization for heart failure or angina&#xD;
      pectors). Event rate are expected to be 2 % yearly (ref), i.e. approximately 60 events out of&#xD;
      all our 600 patients after the average follow-up time of 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, we will investigate the associations between plasma and arterial tissue levels of&#xD;
      the measured components. We will also judge if specific proteins are related to the&#xD;
      prevalence and incidence of diabetic microvascular disease as defined above (i.e.&#xD;
      albuminuria, renal insufficiency, retinopathy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data concerning diabetes debut, medication, biochemical data from time of operation&#xD;
      and co-morbidities is stored in our database at the time of the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test whether the &quot;Basement Membrane Protein Risk Score&quot; is negatively associated with&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Lumen size from the coronary arteriography performed in relation to the operation&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The ratio between lumen size from the renewed coronary arteriography and the one&#xD;
                performed in relation to the operation using univariate and multivariate regression&#xD;
                analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test whether the &quot;Basement Membrane Proteins Risk Score&quot; predicts the composite cardiac&#xD;
           endpoint (MI, coronary revascularization, sudden death, hospitalization for heart&#xD;
           failure or angina pectors) using univariate and multivariate Cox-regression analyses&#xD;
           (primary end point).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Test whether the &quot;Basement Membrane Proteins Risk Score&quot; predicts the broad composite&#xD;
           endpoint of all-cause mortality, major cardiovascular events, progression of nephropathy&#xD;
           or retinopathy using univariate and multivariate Cox-regression analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis, bioinformatics, estimation of power and sample size considerations Data&#xD;
      will be analysed using both simple correlation analysis, but also proportional hazard models&#xD;
      with adjustments for follow-up time and relevant clinical parameters. Fisher's Exact test and&#xD;
      Chi-square tests will be used to evaluate event rates in groups of patients with high or low&#xD;
      amounts of specific proteins. The Benjamini-Hochberg method will be used to correct for&#xD;
      multiple testing, where suitable. Analyses will be done primarily in the total group of&#xD;
      individuals (n=600) testing for interactions by presence of T2DM, but subgroup analysis in&#xD;
      diabetic and non-diabetic patients will also be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation for the primary end point (composite of cardiac events) is calculated&#xD;
      as follows: We assume that the number and proportion of events will be: BM-score 0: n=50,&#xD;
      events: 2 %, BM-score 1: n=100, events: 6 %, BM-score 2: n=150, events: 8 %, BM-score 3:&#xD;
      n=150, events: 10 %, BM-score : n=100, events: 15 %, BM-score 5: n=50, events: 22 %.&#xD;
      Calculation of the necessary number of individuals needs to find a statistical difference&#xD;
      between the score 0 group and the score 5 group is 50 in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility and project organization The project is done at the Center for Individualized&#xD;
      Medicine in Arterial Diseases (CIMA), Center for Clinical Proteomics, and the Department of&#xD;
      Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology at Odense University Hospital. All instruments and&#xD;
      expertise are available. Methods for proteome analysis of arterial tissue have been&#xD;
      developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated impact of results and perspective Less than ten previous papers, worldwide, have&#xD;
      reported on the use of proteome analysis on human arterial tissue, most of them with the use&#xD;
      of material from less than 10 individuals. Previous studies have shown that histological&#xD;
      signs of dysfunctional remodeling (hypertrophy) in small vessels predict cardiovascular&#xD;
      events very well (21). However, nothing is known about structural and molecular aspects in&#xD;
      larger arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from the proposed study may point out whether the amounts of arterial proteins, known&#xD;
      to be altered in T2DM, are associated with the development of cardiovascular events.&#xD;
      Therefore, we will generate new knowledge concerning important molecular pathways, which may&#xD;
      be causally involved in the development of arterial diseases. The identification of such&#xD;
      proteins is important for finding new treatment modalities and biomarkers for the development&#xD;
      of cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect to be able to show that quantitative alterations of specific proteins and groups of&#xD;
      proteins in the vasculature and in plasma predict the development of different CVD-outcomes.&#xD;
      Such findings will strongly support the overall hypothesis that general arterial alterations&#xD;
      in diabetes are important for the development of cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis We hypothesize that patients with T2DM have dysfunctional carotid remodeling with&#xD;
      more inward remodeling and decrease of lumen diameter. The overall aim is to investigate the&#xD;
      relative importance of different cardiovascular risk factors for carotid artery remodeling&#xD;
      assessed by carotid lumen, IMT and cross-sectional area (CA) in CCA and the bifurcation,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The bifurcation vs. CCA will present more inward remodeling as it is more prone to&#xD;
           atherosclerosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Glucose intolerance and to a higher degree T2DM are associated with a higher degree of&#xD;
           inward remodeling&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. This higher degree of inward remodeling is associated with increased arterial stiffness&#xD;
           assessed by cfPWV and changes in lamina basalis assessed by selected markers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods This study is a substudy to the large Malmö Diet and Cancer Study in&#xD;
      which carotid artery ultrasound was performed in 3426 middle-aged Swedish men and women in&#xD;
      1991-94 (baseline) and again in 2007-12 (re-examination).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis, bioinformatics, estimation of power and sample size considerations In&#xD;
      multiple regression analyses we will test the association between&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CV risk factors and IMT, lumen, CA and distensibility in CCA and the bifurcation at&#xD;
           baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CV risk factors and IMT, lumen, CA and distensibility in CCA and the bifurcation at&#xD;
           re-examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Changes in CV risk factors and changes in IMT, lumen, CA and distensibility in CCA and&#xD;
           the bifurcation between baseline and re-examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Serum levels of selected markers of changes in lamina basalis and CV risk factors, cfPWV&#xD;
           as well as IMT, lumen, CA and distensibility in CCA and the bifurcation at&#xD;
           re-examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Test for gender, fasting glucose, T2DM, CCA distensibility, cfPWV and selected markers&#xD;
           of changes in lamina basalis interaction on the above associations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility and project organization This project will be performed at the Center for&#xD;
      Individualized Medicine in Arterial Diseases (CIMA), Center for Clinical Proteomics, and the&#xD;
      Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology at Odense University Hospital, Odense,&#xD;
      Denmark. All instruments are available and expertise is accessible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated impact of results and perspective The results from study 2 may generate new&#xD;
      knowledge and a deeper understanding of how T2DM affects the carotid artery, the degree of&#xD;
      inward remodeling and lumen reduction. This could change the way we treat diabetic patients&#xD;
      with carotid atherosclerosis, as these patients are at high risk of developing total stenosis&#xD;
      of the carotid artery. Knowledge of the pathogenesis behind is the key to earlier&#xD;
      intervention and reduction of risk for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding both studies 1 and 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practical performance of study 1 and 2 The applicant will take part in proteome analysis and&#xD;
      histomorphometric analysis of the tissue. All expertise and equipment are available at the&#xD;
      Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Odense University Hospital. Data&#xD;
      analysis will be performed by the applicant and publications will primarily be written by the&#xD;
      applicant as first author. The applicant will measure lumen of the common carotid arteries&#xD;
      and of the carotid bulb using stored cine-loop recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected publications in study 1 and 2&#xD;
