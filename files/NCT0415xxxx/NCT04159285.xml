    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate effectiveness and feasability of a 15-week group&#xD;
      psychotherapeutic intervention as continuation treatment after electroconvulsive therapy in&#xD;
      severely depressed patients. Feasibility and acceptance of the half-open manualized CBT&#xD;
      intervention are assessed. Depressive symptoms, quality of life and emotion regulation skills&#xD;
      will be assessed before ECT treatment, before and after the 15-week group CBT intervention&#xD;
      and at a 6 months follow-up after treatment end and compared to depressed patients treated&#xD;
      with ECT who did not partake in group CBT. Moreover, patients will attend two indidivual&#xD;
      pre-group sessions with one of the group therapist and one individual post-group session&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a highly effective anti-depressant treatment, a&#xD;
      relevant number of patients experience recurrence of depressive episodes within 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One previous study suggested that ECT treatment effects can be effectively sustained by group&#xD;
      CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Brakemeier et a. 2014). This previous implementation used&#xD;
      a closed CBT-group set-up that implicated a longer waiting period for patients after&#xD;
      finishing the acute ECT and did not investigate whether patients who did not respond to ECT&#xD;
      could sufficiently profit from group CBT. In order to suit the complex needs of patients in a&#xD;
      natural clinical setting, the present study aims to investigate the feasibility and&#xD;
      effectiveness of a half-open continuous group CBT (named EffECtive 2.0) as continuation&#xD;
      treatment for all ECT patients regardless of remission status after ECT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study will recruit a total of 30 patients who concluded treatment with&#xD;
      right-unilateral ultra-brief ECT for depression. Patients self-allocate to the group that is&#xD;
      offered in addition to continuation treatment as usual (TAU, e.g. pharmacological treatment,&#xD;
      continuation ECT, individual psychotherapy). ECT completers who choose not to partake in the&#xD;
      group for practical concerns or lack of interest and receive treatment as usual are recruited&#xD;
      as a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is the change depression severity, measured with the&#xD;
      Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Secondary outcomes are quality of life&#xD;
      assessed with the short-version of the WHO quality of life questionnaire (WHOQOL-Bref) and&#xD;
      emotion regulation as assessed with cognitive emotion regulation questionnaire (CERQ). These&#xD;
      measures will be assessed before, during, immediately after acute ECT and six and 12 months&#xD;
      into continuation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that a group CBT as add-on treatment to TAU will lead to more favorable&#xD;
      outcomes concerning depression severity, quality of life and emotion regulation.&#xD;
