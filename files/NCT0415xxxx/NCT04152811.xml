  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our primary objective is to improve glycemic control (Hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c]) over 3 months&#xD;
      in individuals with diabetes by teaching practical application of diabetes education through&#xD;
      &quot;Cooking Matters&quot; compared to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our secondary objective is to improve health related quality of life, adherence to diabetes&#xD;
      self-management behaviors (physical activity, diet, glucose monitoring, and medication&#xD;
      adherence) over 3-months compared to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that participants in the cooking matters intervention will have significant&#xD;
      improvement in glycemic control (HbA1c), HRQOL, and adherence to diabetes self- management&#xD;
      compared to usual care. Our study is significant as it examines a novel approach to improving&#xD;
      diabetes care and addressing glycemic control in diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will enroll 60 participants with diabetes and HbA1c ≥ 7% in a Cooking Matters (CM) program&#xD;
      using a waitlist control design with 30 participants in the intervention group and 30&#xD;
      participants in the waitlist control group, separated into two arms.Participants will be&#xD;
      stratified by sex and randomized using a random number generator program to either the&#xD;
      intervention or wait list control group. Each CM course is made up of 6, 2-hour, weekly&#xD;
      classes with 15 participants. The curricula is based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans,&#xD;
      MyPlate (the current nutrition guide published by the USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and&#xD;
      Promotion, a food circle depicting a place setting with a plate and glass divided into five&#xD;
      food groups), the American Diabetes Association Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes 2017&#xD;
      and Medical Nutrition Therapy Evidence Based Guide for Practice/Nutrition Protocol as the&#xD;
      foundation for basic nutrition guidelines, then builds upon these ideas using the collective&#xD;
      groups' needs and interest to provide interactive lessons to teach cooking, food safety and&#xD;
      food resource management with emphasis placed on blood sugar management. Five of the 6&#xD;
      classes will include hands-on cooking instruction and nutrition instruction; one of the 6&#xD;
      classes will be a grocery store tour held in a grocery store of the groups' choosing. This&#xD;
      class will provide nutrition instruction with the focus on meal planning for optimal glucose&#xD;
      control under the constraints of a budget. Each class will be interactive and provides&#xD;
      participants opportunities to demonstrate their understanding of the lesson. Participants are&#xD;
      encouraged to ask questions, offer solutions and share their experiences. At the end of each&#xD;
      class, when food preparation is highlighted, the class and instructors will gather to sample&#xD;
      all recipes and have open discussion. Each participant will take home a bag of groceries with&#xD;
      the ingredients to replicate the recipes made in class. At the beginning of each class,&#xD;
      participants are encouraged to share with the group how they used of the previous week's&#xD;
      groceries and reflect on cooking at home. We will administer validated surveys measuring&#xD;
      health-related quality of life, diabetes self-management behaviors, and dietary patterns and&#xD;
      perform point of care HbA1c assessment of both groups (intervention and waitlist control)&#xD;
      when intervention 1 begins the program in week 1. We will then proceed with the CM&#xD;
      intervention with intervention 1 in weeks 1 thru 6 and the post test will be administered to&#xD;
      the intervention group at the end of the intervention, 3, 6 and 12 months post intervention.&#xD;
      In week 18-23, we will administer CM to the original waitlist control group and they will&#xD;
      follow the same protocol as intervention 1. The second arm of the study will follow the same&#xD;
      design, beginning in week 12 of the study.&#xD;
