    <textblock>
      The purpose of this global study is to demonstrate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of&#xD;
      an intravenous (i.v.) regimen of secukinumab compared to placebo in subjects with active&#xD;
      axSpA at Week 16 despite current or previous NSAID, DMARD and/or anti Tumor Necrosis Factor&#xD;
      (TNF) therapy. In addition, to further support efficacy and safety of an i.v. regimen, data&#xD;
      will be collected for up to 52 weeks of treatment. Efficacy and safety data may be used to&#xD;
      support the registration of i.v. secukinumab in the US and other countries for treatment of&#xD;
      subjects with active axSpA.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This multicenter study uses a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group&#xD;
      design to study the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of treatment with intravenous&#xD;
      secukinumab (initial dose of 6 mg/kg followed thereafter with 3 mg/kg administered every four&#xD;
      weeks starting at Week 4) in subjects with active axSpA. The study population consists of&#xD;
      approximately 400 subjects with active AS and approximately 100 subjects with active&#xD;
      nr-axSpA, despite current or previous NSAID, conventional DMARD and / or TNF inhibitor&#xD;
      therapy, or intolerance to these therapies. A screening (SCR) period of up to 10 weeks will&#xD;
      be used to assess eligibility, followed by randomization to 52 weeks of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, subjects with active AS and nr-axSpA will be randomized to one of the two&#xD;
      treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: approximately 200 AS subjects and approximately 50 nr-axSpA subjects; These&#xD;
           subjects will receive secukinumab 6 mg/kg i.v. at randomization (Baseline (BSL) visit),&#xD;
           followed by the administration of secukinumab 3 mg/kg i.v. every four weeks starting at&#xD;
           Week 4 through Week 48 (exposure through Week 52).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: approximately 200 AS subjects and approximately 50 nr-axSpA subjects; These&#xD;
           subjects will receive i.v. placebo at randomization (BSL visit), Weeks 4, 8, and 12 ,&#xD;
           followed by the administration of secukinumab 3 mg/kg i.v. at Week 16 and every four&#xD;
           weeks through Week 48 (exposure through Week 52).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of 4 periods totaling up to 70 weeks: the screening period (up to 10&#xD;
      weeks), the treatment period 1 (total duration of 16 weeks) and the treatment period 2 (total&#xD;
      duration of 36 weeks) followed by the safety follow up period of 8 weeks after the end of&#xD;
      treatment visit (i.e., Week 52).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be stratified at randomization according to disease condition (i.e., AS or&#xD;
      nr-axSpA). No more than 20% TNF Inhibitor Incomplete Responders (TNF-IR) subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. Starting at Week 16, all subjects will switch to open-label&#xD;
      intravenous secukinumab, including all placebo subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No subject will be on placebo treatment after Week 16. Although study treatment is open label&#xD;
      secukinumab i.v. starting at Week 16, all subjects and investigators/site staff will remain&#xD;
      blinded to original treatment assignment, so as to ensure unbiased efficacy and safety&#xD;
      assessments for the remainder of the study. Study treatment will continue up to Week 52. An&#xD;
      end of treatment visit (i.e., Week 52) is to be done 4 weeks after last study treatment&#xD;
      administration and a post treatment follow-up visit (i.e., Week 60) is to be done 8 weeks&#xD;
      after the end of treatment visit for all subjects (regardless of whether they complete the&#xD;
      entire study as planned or discontinue prematurely). All i.v. infusions will be performed at&#xD;
      the study site and site personnel will administer the infusions to subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue medication is not allowed until Week 16. However, subjects who are deemed by the&#xD;
      investigator not to be benefiting from the study treatment based on safety and efficacy&#xD;
      assessments or for any reason of their own accord will be free to discontinue participation&#xD;
      in the study at any time. The study will have a primary endpoint analysis at Week 16.&#xD;
      Therefore, the primary analysis will be performed with Week-16 data once the last subject has&#xD;
      completed the Treatment Period 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical management of axSpA by pharmacotherapy includes the use of NSAIDs and conventional&#xD;
      DMARDs, and if insufficient response, biologic agents (i.e., TNF-inhibitor therapy or&#xD;
      anti-IL17 agents).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study intends to enroll patients with active disease despite current or previous NSAIDs,&#xD;
      conventional DMARDs and/or TNF inhibitor therapy or intolerance to these therapies. A&#xD;
      background of NSAID therapy and/or concomitant therapy with methotrexate (≤25 mg/week) or&#xD;
      sulfasalazine (≤ 3 g/day) will be acceptable, if dose and route of administration have been&#xD;
      stable for at least two weeks with NSAIDs and/or four weeks with MTX or sulfasalazine, prior&#xD;
      to the randomization visit. Inclusion of patients with active axSpA who are TNF-IR (up to 20%&#xD;
      in each group) in the study also makes the background patient population more representative&#xD;
      of the real world clinical scenario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A placebo arm up to the primary endpoint at Week 16 is included in this study. Due to the&#xD;
      nature of the disease and the outcome measures used (ASAS criteria), a placebo arm is&#xD;
      necessary to reliably evaluate the efficacy and safety of the active drug. The treatment&#xD;
      duration of the placebo group is relatively short and the placebo group will be re-assigned&#xD;
      to active treatment at Week 16. The regular assessment of disease activity ensures that&#xD;
      subjects who are experiencing worsening of disease in any of the treatment groups can exit&#xD;
      the study at any time upon their own accord or based on the advice of the investigator.&#xD;

         16. Screening total WBC count &lt;3,000/μl, or platelets &lt;100,000/μl or neutrophils &lt;1,500/μl&#xD;
             or hemoglobin &lt;8.5 g/dl (85 g/L)&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. History of clinically significant liver disease or liver injury indicated by abnormal&#xD;
             liver function tests, such as SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), alkaline phosphatase and serum&#xD;
             bilirubin. The investigator should be guided by the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any single parameter may not exceed 2 x the upper limit of normal (ULN). A single&#xD;
                  parameter elevated up to and including 2 x ULN should be re-checked once more as&#xD;
                  soon as possible, and in all cases, at least prior to randomization, to rule-out&#xD;
                  laboratory error.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If the total bilirubin concentration is increased above 2 x ULN, total bilirubin&#xD;
                  should be differentiated into the direct and indirect reacting bilirubin. In any&#xD;
                  case, serum bilirubin should not exceed the value of 1.6 mg/dL (27 µmol/L)&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Significant medical problems or diseases, including but not limited to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             uncontrolled hypertension (≥160/95 mmHg), congestive heart failure (New York Heart&#xD;
             Association status of class III or IV), uncontrolled diabetes, or very poor functional&#xD;
             status precluding ability to perform self-care&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Plans for administration of live vaccines during the study period or within 6 weeks&#xD;
             prior to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of&#xD;
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using effective methods of contraception during the&#xD;
             entire study or longer if required by locally approved prescribing information (e.g.,&#xD;
             20 weeks in EU). Effective contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.&#xD;
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has&#xD;
                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female subjects on&#xD;
                  the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that&#xD;
                  subject&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
                  cervical/vault caps). For UK: with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal&#xD;
                  suppository&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other&#xD;
                  forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%),&#xD;
                  for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system In case of use of oral&#xD;
                  contraception women should have been stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3&#xD;
                  months before taking study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have&#xD;
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile&#xD;
             (e.g., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks prior&#xD;
             to randomization. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status&#xD;
             of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she&#xD;
             considered not of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Active ongoing inflammatory diseases other than axSpA that might confound the&#xD;
             evaluation of the benefits of secukinumab therapy, including inflammatory bowel&#xD;
             disease or uveitis&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Current severe progressive or uncontrolled disease which in the judgment of the&#xD;
             clinical investigator renders the subject unsuitable for the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Use of other investigational drugs at the time of enrollment, or within 5 half- lives&#xD;
             of enrollment, or within 4 weeks until the expected pharmacodynamic effect has&#xD;
             returned to baseline, whichever is longer; or longer if required by local regulations&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. History of hypersensitivity to any of the study drug constituents&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Previous exposure to secukinumab (AIN457) or any other biologic drug directly&#xD;
             targeting IL-17 or the IL-17 receptor&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. Previous treatment with any cell-depleting therapies including but not limited to&#xD;
             anti-CD20 or investigational agents (e.g., CAMPATH, anti-CD4, anti-CD5, anti-CD3,&#xD;
             anti-CD19)&#xD;
