    <textblock>
      This study has 2 phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aims of Phase 1b are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to check for side effects from modakafusp alfa in adults with locally advanced or&#xD;
           metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to learn how much modakafusp alfa adults can receive without getting any major side&#xD;
           effects from it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aims of Phase 2 are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to check for side effects from modakafusp alfa when given together with pembrolizumab in&#xD;
           adults with metastatic cutaneous melanoma which cannot be completely removed by surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to learn how these medicines improve their symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive modakafusp alfa for up to 1 year (Phase 1b) or modakafusp alfa&#xD;
      given together with pembrolizumab for up to 2 years (Phase 2). Those whose symptoms improve&#xD;
      might continue treatment for longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both phases of the study, participants will revisit the study clinic within 30 days after&#xD;
      their last dose or before they start other cancer treatment, whichever happens first.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called modakafusp alfa (TAK-573). Modakafusp alfa is&#xD;
      being tested to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics,&#xD;
      and antitumor activity as single agent or in combination with pembrolizumab in participants&#xD;
      with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The study will consist of 2 phases: Phase&#xD;
      1b dose escalation and a Phase 2 dose expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 114 participants (approximately 30 participants in Phase&#xD;
      1b dose escalation phase; 3-9 participants in safety-lead in and 25 participants for each&#xD;
      expansion cohort (3 cohorts) of Phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose escalation phase will enroll participants with solid tumors. The dose escalation&#xD;
      phase is to evaluate SA RP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose expansion phase in combination with pembrolizumab will be initiated with a safety&#xD;
      lead-in phase once the SA RP2D is determined for modakafusp alfa . The dose expansion will&#xD;
      include participants with one of following 3 disease indications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Unresectable/metastatic cutaneous melanoma with primary resistance to no more than 2 prior&#xD;
      lines of anti-PD1 containing treatments in the metastatic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Unresectable/metastatic cutaneous melanoma with acquired resistance to no more than 2&#xD;
      prior lines of anti-PD1 containing treatments in the metastatic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Unresectable/metastatic cutaneous melanoma na√Øve to prior anti-PD1 containing treatments&#xD;
      in the metastatic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. Participants with&#xD;
      demonstrated clinical benefit may continue treatment beyond 1 year for Phase 1b and 2 years&#xD;
      for Phase 2 if approved by the sponsor. The overall time to participate in this study is 55&#xD;
      months. All participants will make an end of treatment (EOT) visit 30 days after receiving&#xD;
      their last dose of study drug or before the start of subsequent systemic anticancer therapy,&#xD;
      whichever occurs first for a safety follow up assessment.&#xD;

             symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias of Grade &gt;2, pulmonary embolism, or symptomatic&#xD;
             cerebrovascular events, or any other serious cardiac condition (example, symptomatic&#xD;
             pericardial effusion or restrictive cardiomyopathy). Chronic, stable atrial&#xD;
             fibrillation on stable anticoagulant therapy, including low molecular-weight heparin,&#xD;
             is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Known hepatitis B (HBV) surface antigen seropositive or detectable hepatitis C&#xD;
             infection viral load. Note: Participants with a positive HBV core antibody can be&#xD;
             enrolled but must have an undetectable hepatitis B viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppressive therapy. Participants with&#xD;
             immune mediated endocrine deficiency from previous therapy with stable hormone&#xD;
