  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The uncertainty regarding the management of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms (UIAs) has not&#xD;
      progressed in the last 30 years. The fundamental ethical basis for this study is that&#xD;
      physicians should only offer a risky preventive treatment when it has been shown to be&#xD;
      beneficial. Before that, such treatment should be offered as an RCT. The CAM trial offers a&#xD;
      comprehensive framework, so that all patients confronted with the clinical dilemma can be&#xD;
      offered participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prinicpal questions to be addressed are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. do patients with UIAs, considered for curative treatments, have a better long-term&#xD;
           clinical outcome with active treatment or conservative management?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. when patients are considered ineligible for conservative management, and surgical and&#xD;
           endovascular management are both judged reasonable, do patients with UIAs have a better&#xD;
           long-term clinical outcome with surgical or endovascular management? The primary&#xD;
           hypothesis for patients allocated to at least 2 options, one of which is conservative&#xD;
           management is: the 10 year combined neurological morbidity and mortality (mRS&gt;2) will be&#xD;
           reduced from 24% to 16% (beta 80%; alpha 0.048; sample size 961 patients (836 plus 15%&#xD;
           losses to FU and cross-overs) with active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as a pragmatic, comprehensive way to address the unruptured aneurysm&#xD;
      clinical dilemma, combining large simple RCTs whenever patients are judged eligible for more&#xD;
      than one management option, or otherwise a registry of each option. All patients with one or&#xD;
      more UIAs will be eligible for participation in either a registry or one of the trials.&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for 10 years according to a standard of car follow-up schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is survival without neurological dependency (mRS&lt;3) at 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the incidence of SAH during follow-up and related morbidity and mortality;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the morbidity and mortality related to endovascular or surgical treatment of the UIA at&#xD;
           one year;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. overall mortality at 1, 5 and 10 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. overall morbidity (mRS&gt;2) at 1, 5 and 10 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. length of hospitalization;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. discharge to location other than home&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The best management of patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms is currently&#xD;
      uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time-honored approach to treating UIAs is with microsurgical clipping, Surgical clipping&#xD;
      is widely considered to be a safe, durable means to treat UIAs. In recent years, endovascular&#xD;
      treatment (EVT) has increasingly replaced surgical clipping. The efficacy of EVT in the&#xD;
      prevention of SAH remains unknown. EVT is reputed to be potentially less effective than&#xD;
      surgery because of long term angiographic recurrences. Neither surgery nor EVT have been&#xD;
      shown superior to conservative management. Yet, both endovascular and surgical treatment are&#xD;
      used every day in a large number of patients, without evidence they are doing more good than&#xD;
      harm, and without evidence that one is better than the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no scientific evidence to support treatment of UIAs and there are no&#xD;
      well-accepted guidelines. The overall annual rupture risk for conservatively managed lesions&#xD;
      remains ~1-2% over a follow-up of 6-9 years, likely an underestimate. There is currently no&#xD;
      all-inclusive care trial framework for UIA patients. There are also no randomized trials&#xD;
      currently comparing active and conservative management for UIAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The uncertainty regarding the management of UIAs has not progressed in the last 30 years.&#xD;
      Avoiding iatrogenia and the consequences of over-diagnosis is an increasingly important&#xD;
      public health goal. In the spirit of care trials, this CAM trial offers a comprehensive&#xD;
      framework, so that all patients confronted with the clinical dilemma can be offered&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To provide a care research framework to manage all patients with UIAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For patients for whom conservative management is contemplated, to validate previous&#xD;
           observational studies claiming rupture risks are very low. This registry could be used&#xD;
           in the future to recruit patients in trials assessing the potential value of imaging&#xD;
           follow-up studies or trials assessing pharmacological prevention of ruptures (such as&#xD;
           ASA or statins).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. For each patient for whom curative treatment is contemplated, to provide a 50% chance of&#xD;
           being spared a potentially useless or harmful treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. For each patient for whom surgical clipping is contemplated, to provide a 50% chance of&#xD;
           being offered a less invasive alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal questions to be addressed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Can a care trial context assist clinicians and patients manage the UIA dilemma?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. When conservative management is contemplated, is the risk of rupture as low as&#xD;
           unvalidated observational studies currently suggest?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Do patients with UIAs, considered for curative treatments, have a better long-term&#xD;
           clinical outcome with active treatment or conservative management? More specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1 When active endovascular treatment is contemplated, do patients with UIAs have a&#xD;
           better long-term clinical outcome with endovascular or conservative management? 3.2 When&#xD;
           active surgical treatment is contemplated, do patients with UIAs have a better long-term&#xD;
           clinical outcome with surgical or conservative management? 3.3 When active treatment is&#xD;
           contemplated, and surgical and endovascular management are both judged reasonable, do&#xD;
           patients with UIAs have a better long-term clinical outcome with (surgical/endovascular)&#xD;
           or conservative management?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. When patients are considered ineligible for conservative management, and surgical and&#xD;
           endovascular management are both judged reasonable, do patients with UIAs have a better&#xD;
           long-term clinical outcome with surgical or endovascular management?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This study is designed as a pragmatic, comprehensive way to address the&#xD;
      unruptured aneurysm clinical dilemma, combining large simple clinical care trials whenever&#xD;
      patients are judged eligible for more than one management option, or otherwise a registry of&#xD;
      each option. All patients with one or more UIAs will be eligible for participation in either&#xD;
      a registry or one of the trials. A non-invasive (MRA or CTA) or catheter angiogram and a&#xD;
      baseline CT-scan or MRI of the brain are required to enter the study. These studies should&#xD;
      demonstrate the unequivocal presence of a saccular aneurysm, not recently ruptured (&gt; 4 weeks&#xD;
      since the last SAH). If they accept, all subjects will be registered, and when eligible,&#xD;
      included in a specific randomized trial using the algorithm below which includes a&#xD;
      combination of clinical judgment and randomized allocation. Conventional randomization will&#xD;
      be performed whenever and wherever possible. A double consent pre-randomization design is&#xD;
      possible wherever the method is accepted by the local IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned algorithm for managing patients The algorithmic process combining clinical judgment&#xD;
      and randomized allocation will proceed by asking the following questions to the treating&#xD;
      physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Q1: Is the patient being considered for treatment? Possible answers: YES or NO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the clinician selects NO, the patient will be included in the observational registry. If&#xD;
      YES, the following question will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Q2: What treatment option is being considered for this patient? Clinicians will use clinical&#xD;
      judgment to select one of three options: endovascular, surgical, or they will select that&#xD;
      either treatment is reasonable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then comes the most important question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Q3: Is conservative management a reasonable alternative given the lack of evidence that&#xD;
      treatments are beneficial? Potential answers are YES or NO. If NO, they will be included in&#xD;
      the CURES trial or in of the 2 treatment registries (surgical or endovascular). If YES, they&#xD;
      will be included in the appropriate randomized trial (according to the answer to question 2)&#xD;
      that compares endovascular to conservative management (TEAM, or trial on endovascular&#xD;
      aneurysm management), surgical to conservative management (TSAM, or Trial on Surgical&#xD;
      Aneurysm Management), or they will be included in the TOES arm (Trial on Observational,&#xD;
      Endovascular or Surgical management), with potential for a second randomization, comparing&#xD;
      surgical to endovascular treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis for patients allocated to at least 2 options, one of which is&#xD;
      conservative management is: The 10 year combined neurological morbidity and mortality (mRS&#xD;
      &gt;2) will be reduced from 24% to 16% (beta 80%; alpha 0.048; sample size 961 patients (836&#xD;
      plus 15% losses to FU and cross-overs) with active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes The primary outcome is survival without neurological dependency (mRS&lt;3) at 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures are needed to monitor patient outcomes during the duration of the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be: 1/ The incidence of SAH during follow-up and related morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality; 2/ The morbidity and mortality related to EVT or surgical treatment of the UIA&#xD;
      at one year; 3/ Overall mortality at 1, 5 and 10 years; 4/ Overall morbidity (mRS&gt;2) at 1, 5&#xD;
      and 10 years; 5/ Length of hospitalization; 6/ Discharge to location other than home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pragmatic care trial has been designed to potentially include all patients with UIAs.&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria are as broad as possible and exclusions as few as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequency and duration of follow-up All the investigations proposed in the UIA care trial&#xD;
      constitute part of routine, standard care in the treatment of unruptured intracranial&#xD;
      aneurysms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who undergo treatment will be seen in clinic at approximately 6-12 weeks after&#xD;
      treatment as part of routine follow-up care. Patients will be followed with another routine&#xD;
      clinic visit at one year, and at 5 and 10 years thereafter. All treated patients will have&#xD;
      non-invasive imaging (CTA or MRA) at 12 ± 2 months post-treatment to determine the presence&#xD;
      of a major, saccular aneurysm recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients To assess whether the 10 year combined neurological morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality (mRS &gt;2) will be reduced from 24% to 16% with active treatment (beta 80%; alpha&#xD;
      0.048) will require at least 961 patients (836 plus 15% losses to FU and cross-overs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Statistical Analyses The 4 stratified trial arms (TSAM, TEAM II, TOES, and CURES) and&#xD;
      the registries will be analyzed separately. Combined exploratory analyses will also be&#xD;
      performed, looking for differences in group characteristics and in treatment outcomes between&#xD;
      RCTs and registries, attempting to better understand the scope and limits of trial results.&#xD;
      As with any trials of surgery, early risks may be followed by later benefit. Therefore the&#xD;
      hazard ratio will be unfavorable during the recruitment years, while interventions are being&#xD;
      performed. Initially, the DSMC will assure that treatment-related complications and&#xD;
      hemorrhagic events are within confidence intervals compatible with a safe and meaningful&#xD;
      trial. In order to describe how and when hemorrhagic events occur, analyses will include&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meyer life-table methods to assess the 1, 5-, and 10-year survival, and survival&#xD;
      without hemorrhage, among all those allocated immediate treatment (including the few who did&#xD;
      not undergo it) and all those allocated deferral of any intervention (including the few who&#xD;
      will eventually be treated). The 'survival' functions will be compared graphically and using&#xD;
      a log-rank statistic. The main statistical tests will involve comparisons between the&#xD;
      probabilities of mortality and morbidity-mortality 1/ from hemorrhage, excluding&#xD;
      peri-operative complications, 2/ from hemorrhage or from complications of treatment, or 3/&#xD;
      comparisons of the 1, 5 and 10-year probabilities of combined disease/treatment-related&#xD;
      mortality/morbidity, in the absence of other causes of death or disability. Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics will be done on demographic variables and potential risk factors to compare the&#xD;
      groups at baseline. Means, standard deviations and range will be presented for quantitative&#xD;
      variables such as size of aneurysms and frequency tables for categorical variables (such as&#xD;
      number of patients with a previous history of SAH, or multiple aneurysms). Statistics will be&#xD;
      broken down by center and by treatment arm. Comparability of the groups will be assessed&#xD;
      through independent ANOVAs (quantitative data) or Mantel-Haentzel and X2 tests (categorical&#xD;
      data). Assuming comparability of groups across centers, the primary outcome, disease or&#xD;
      treatment-related combined morbidity/mortality (for both intent-to-treat and per-protocol&#xD;
      populations) will be compared between groups through a Fisher's Exact Test for independent&#xD;
      proportions at 1, 5, and 10 years. Similar analyses will be done for disease or&#xD;
      treatment-related mortality combined mortality-morbidity. Secondary outcomes and overall&#xD;
      morbidity will be compared between groups through independent t-tests (quantitative&#xD;
      variables) or X2 statistics (categorical data). The analyses of neurological data at&#xD;
      follow-up will control for baseline data using logistic regression, ANOVA or Cox regression&#xD;
      multivariate models. All tests will be interpreted with adjustment for multiplicity to have&#xD;
      the 0.05 level of confidence at 10 years only. Finally, a logistic regression will be used to&#xD;
      find baseline variables capable of predicting hemorrhages or complications in both groups.&#xD;
      The method planned is a stepwise forward on a likelihood ratio with a probability of 0.05 to&#xD;
      enter a predictor (PIN in) and a probability of 0.10 to exclude a predictor (PIN out).&#xD;
      Possible predictors include the size of the aneurysm, location, patient age, status of the&#xD;
      aneurysm and previous history of SAH versus unruptured only) as well as other baseline&#xD;
      characteristics. All analyses of the primary endpoint will be performed taking into account&#xD;
      the multiplicity of tests and any interim analyses. Secondary analyses will be performed&#xD;
      using an alpha of 5%.&#xD;
