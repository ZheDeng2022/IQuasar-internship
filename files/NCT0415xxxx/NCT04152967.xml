      Valved conduits used for the reconstruction of right-ventricular outflow tract are applied in&#xD;
      the surgical repair of complex congenital heart disease(CHD) such as pulmonary atresia(PA),&#xD;
      truncus arteriosus, severe tetralogy of Fallot(TOF) for their significant roles in reducing&#xD;
      pulmonary valve regurgitation and preserving right ventricle function. With a rising cases of&#xD;
      complex CHD and patients with pulmonary valve regurgitation in TOF repair, a further demand&#xD;
      is underway for valved conduits. Meanwhile, common biological valved conduits applied in&#xD;
      foreign countries are not approved in China yet, with high failure and reintervention,&#xD;
      reducing the long-term survival. Our team manufactured a novel valved conduit with 0.1mm&#xD;
      expanded polytetrafluoroethylene and gore-tex conduit. This ePTFE valved conduit played a&#xD;
      satisfying role in anti-regurgitation and failure rate through in vitro fluid test and animal&#xD;
      experiments. Besides, our team manufactured templates for the conduit and also simplified the&#xD;
      suturing process so that the repeatability of suturing valved had been risen. Until now, over&#xD;
      70 cases have been implanted with this ePTFE valved conduit with positive early and mid-term&#xD;
      follow-up results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the progress which have been made, there still remain some problems to solve. First,&#xD;
      systematic prospective randomized comparative study will be performed. Second, this is just a&#xD;
      single-center study. Third, these patients should have longer follow-up time to evaluate the&#xD;
      ePTFE conduit long-term effect. Finally, imaging data are blank for evaluating the function&#xD;
      of the conduit and right ventricle. In this prospective comparative research, the new&#xD;
      designed ePTFE valved conduit and bovine jugular vein valved conduits are conducted as a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trail. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is used to precisely evaluate&#xD;
      the anti-regurgitation effect of the valved conduit and the right ventricle function.&#xD;
      Investigators can further access the application of this newly designed ePTFE valved conduit.&#xD;
      Investigators aim to provide a self-manufactured, low failure rate valved conduit.&#xD;

      Valved conduits used for the reconstruction of right-ventricular outflow tract are applied in&#xD;
      the surgical repair of complex congenital heart disease(CHD) such as pulmonary atresia(PA),&#xD;
      truncus arteriosus, severe tetralogy of Fallot(TOF) for their significant roles in reducing&#xD;
      pulmonary valve regurgitation and preserving right ventricle function. With a rising cases of&#xD;
      complex CHD and patients after surgical repair of TOF with pulmonary valve regurgitation, a&#xD;
      progressive need is underway for valved conduits. Meanwhile, biological valved conduits used&#xD;
      in foreign countries are lacked in China, with the disadvantage that a high failure rate of&#xD;
      biological conduits increasing the chances of reoperation which greatly reduce the long-term&#xD;
      survival rate. Thus, a new, low failure rate valved conduit with effective performance is&#xD;
      urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our team manufactured a new valved conduit with 0.1mm expanded polytetrafluoroethylene and&#xD;
      blood vessels. This valved conduit exhibited a fine anti-regurgitation effect and a&#xD;
      relatively low failure rate through in vitro fluid test and animal model. Besides, our team&#xD;
      manufactured templates for the conduit and also simplified the suturing process so that the&#xD;
      repeatability of suturing valved had been risen. Our team have already applied a patent for&#xD;
      inventing and a utility model patent for this technique. Several papers have also been&#xD;
      published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Till now, over 70 cases have been involved with this valved conduit with positive early and&#xD;
      mid-term follow-up results. Our team have promoted this technique to several heart center&#xD;
      such as Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Fudan University, Shanghai Children's Medical Center&#xD;
      and Nanjing Children's Hospital and all department have achieved satisfactory effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the progress which have been made, there are still problems remained to be solved to&#xD;
      prove the superiority of valved conduits. First, systematic prospective comparative study is&#xD;
      required. Second, 70 cases are not enough and currently this is just a single-center study.&#xD;
      Third, follow-up time is too short to evaluate the long-term effect. Last but not least,&#xD;
      imaging data are blank for evaluating the function of the conduit and right ventricle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective comparative research, the new designed PTFE valved conduit and bovine&#xD;
      jugular vein valved conduits are conducted as a randomized controlled trail. Cardiac magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging is used to precisely evaluate the anti-regurgitation effect of the valved&#xD;
      conduit and the right ventricle function. Investigators can further access the application of&#xD;
      this newly designed PTFE valved conduit. Investigators aim to provide a self-manufactured,&#xD;
      low failure rate valved conduit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients involved in this research should meet the requirement that they need valved&#xD;
           conduits to reconstruct right ventricular outflow tract, first time operation and&#xD;
           reoperation to change the fail conduit included. Our team expect 200 patients to meet&#xD;
           the requirement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In this prospective comparative research, all patients will be divided into two groups&#xD;
           randomly with 100 patients in each group. One group will use the new-designed PTFE&#xD;
           valved conduits and another one will implant the bovine jugular vein valved conduits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All patients will receive standard cardiopulmonary bypass through a mid-sternum incision&#xD;
           and new-designed PTFE valved conduits or bovine jugular vein valved conduits will be&#xD;
           implanted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pre-operation, operation and post-operation materials will be collected. Besides, every&#xD;
           one month, three months, six months, twelve months and twenty-for months after surgery,&#xD;
           echocardiography and electrocardiogram will be conducted on each patient. 12 months and&#xD;
           24 months after the surgery, our team will arrange MRI test with the patient on&#xD;
           telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Echocardiography: regurgitation of the valve in the conduits, the position of the&#xD;
      regurgitation, the length of matched valve margin, volume of right ventricle, velocity of&#xD;
      blood flow through pulmonary valve and pressure gradient will be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Electrocardiography: arrhythmia and the width of 'QRS' wave. iii. MRI: regurgitation&#xD;
      index of valved conduit, RVEDVI, RVESVI, McGoon index, NAKATA index, d survival rate, free&#xD;
      from stenosis rate, free from reintervention rate, free from endocarditis rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      f) MRI test: Using a Siemens Avanto 1.5T MRI spectrometer with a retrospective gated rate&#xD;
      coding sequence to conduct the examination. Scanning parameters are set at view 400 mm, TR27&#xD;
      ms, TE 3.2 ms, matrix 240 x 256, layer thickness 5 mm, flip angle 30 degrees. Patients will&#xD;
      breath calmly and apply the iPAT (parallel acquisition) technology to reduce imaging time and&#xD;
      artifacts. The average examination time will be 20 to 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Measurements of valve regurgitation of the conduit: Take the sagittal long axis section of&#xD;
      the right ventricular outflow tract and locate it at the level of the valve, and set the flow&#xD;
      rate at 200 cm/s to produce a phase contrast sequence diagram. The valve section is circled&#xD;
      where white represents the forward blood flow signal and black represents the reflux blood&#xD;
      flow signal. The pulmonary flow velocity-time curve is generated by Argus software and&#xD;
      calculate the pulmonary artery forward blood flow (FFV) and reverse blood flow (BFV). 2&#xD;
      measurements were taken and averaged. The regurgitation index will be calculated according to&#xD;
      the formula BFV/FFV × 100%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Measurements of right ventricle function: Using a Siemens Avanto 1.5T MRI spectrometer&#xD;
      with the Truefisp or flash flair. Scanning parameters are set at view 400 mm, TR2.2 ms, TE&#xD;
      1.5 ms, matrix 128 x 256, layer thickness 5 mm, flip angle 45 degrees. Patients will breath&#xD;
      calmly and apply the iPAT (parallel acquisition) technology to reduce imaging time and&#xD;
      artifacts. In the short-axis view of the ventricle, the contours of each layer's endocardium&#xD;
      at the end of diastolic and end-systolic phases of the right ventricle will be traced, and&#xD;
      RVEDV, RVESV, and RVEF will be generated by Argus software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      g) Echocardiography examination: Images will be collected and stored using the PhiliPsIE33&#xD;
      color ultrasound system. The parameters including RVEDV, RVESV, and RVEF will be measured on&#xD;
      the machine using QLAB 4.0 software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manufacture the new designed conduit: First, turn the inner surface of the conduit to the&#xD;
      outside of the conduit and then use template A to draw the stitching positions(three &quot;T&quot;&#xD;
      lines and three midpoints). After that, apply template B to draw on 0.1mm PTFE patch and cut&#xD;
      into three connected &quot;U&quot; shapes, surrounding the conduit. Suture the patch to the conduit&#xD;
      before restoring the conduit to normal. The valve is formed at the boundary. (0.1mm PTFE&#xD;
      patch and conduits have been used clinically, provided by Gore)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reconstruction of the right ventricle outflow tract:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be divided randomly into two groups. One will implant the new-designed PTFE&#xD;
      valved conduits and another one will implant the bovine jugular vein valved conduits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mid-sternum incision will be applied for each patient and standard cardiopulmonary bypass&#xD;
      will be constructed. Cardiac malformation will be repaired under cardiac arrest. The&#xD;
      new-designed PTFE conduit or bovine jugular conduit will be used to connect the right&#xD;
      ventricle and pulmonary artery. The distal end of the valved conduit is cut into a bevel&#xD;
      surface, and the end of the conduit is merged with the pulmonary artery for end-to-end&#xD;
      anastomosis, so that the valve can get closer to the pulmonary artery which will reduce the&#xD;
      possibility of valve regurgitation due to blood flow filling pulmonary artery. After the&#xD;
      anastomosis, the aorta clutch will be removed, and the heartbeat will recover. The next step&#xD;
      is to start the anastomosis of the proximal end and right ventricular. The posterior wall of&#xD;
      the anastomosis is sutured directly, and the anterior wall is expanded with autologous&#xD;
      pericardium to avoid the narrowing of the proximal anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative anticoagulation: Heparin will be administered intravenously 5~15u/kg/h 4 to 6&#xD;
      hours after surgery if without active hemorrhage. After that, oral anticoagulation with&#xD;
      warfarin will be used for 6 months, and the INR should be maintained at 1.5~2.5. 6 months&#xD;
      later aspirin will replace warfarin with 3 ~ 5mg / kg / time, once a day, until 2 years after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
