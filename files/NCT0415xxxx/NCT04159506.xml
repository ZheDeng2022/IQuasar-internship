  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The VA Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation's Whole Health initiative&#xD;
      promotes the use of complementary and integrative health (CIH) approaches with traditional&#xD;
      medical care to help Veterans achieve meaningful life goals and improved functioning.&#xD;
      Equine-facilitated therapy (EFT), an animal-assisted form of CIH, is increasingly available&#xD;
      to Veterans within the VA. Horses have extreme sensitivity to the emotional states,&#xD;
      behaviors, and intentions of their herds and other animals, including humans, and mirror body&#xD;
      language and respond to subtle nonverbal cues. As such, horses have the capacity to provide&#xD;
      immediate feedback about a people's emotional and behavioral states. This capacity affords&#xD;
      people opportunities to become more emotionally self-aware and, with guidance from EFT&#xD;
      facilitators, learn how to regulate emotions and become calmer and more patient, attentive,&#xD;
      and confident to gain the horses' cooperation. Participants in EFT are encouraged to apply&#xD;
      what they have learned from their equine experiences to their relationships with people.&#xD;
      Since high quality social functioning depends on effective regulation of one's emotions, EFT&#xD;
      offers a novel way in which to improve the social functioning of Veterans with mental health&#xD;
      concerns. VAs are increasingly embracing EFT as a CIH. However, carefully conducted,&#xD;
      scientifically valid research about EFT has not been conducted. Existing peer-reviewed&#xD;
      research about EFT for mental health is very limited, of poor methodological quality, and not&#xD;
      focused on adults. None of it targets social functioning as a main outcome. This small&#xD;
      randomized controlled pilot study proposes to examine an innovative EFT called The Equus&#xD;
      Effect (TEE) as a complement to Veterans' existing VA mental health services to improve&#xD;
      social functioning. TEE aims to improve Veterans' social functioning by developing their&#xD;
      emotion regulation and interpersonal skills through therapeutic interactions with horses.&#xD;
      This study will evaluate 1) the feasibility of study procedures, assessments, and outcomes,&#xD;
      2) the fidelity of experimental and control interventions, and 3) the acceptability of the&#xD;
      interventions to Veterans and their mental health clinicians using mixed&#xD;
      quantitative-qualitative methods. The study has the potential to lend initial credibility to&#xD;
      the therapeutic claims of this increasingly popular CIH.&#xD;

      **Please note that as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, and after consultation with the&#xD;
      appropriate research oversight, regulatory and monitoring entities, screening and enrollment&#xD;
      has been placed on temporary administrative hold as of 04/30/2020. Temporary suspension due&#xD;
      to COVID-19 pandemic. Intervention must be done in person and in group which is prohibited at&#xD;
      this time**&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VA Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation launched the Whole Health&#xD;
      initiative to transform the Veterans Health Administration into a healthcare system in which&#xD;
      providers and Veterans develop holistic, personalized, proactive, patient-driven healthcare&#xD;
      plans that center on realizing meaningful life goals and improved functioning. Whole Health&#xD;
      promotes the use of complementary and integrative health (CIH) approaches with traditional&#xD;
      medical care to achieve these aims - consistent with psychosocial rehabilitation's emphasis&#xD;
      on recovery-oriented, community-based functional outcomes. Equine-facilitated therapy (EFT),&#xD;
      an animal-assisted form of CIH, is increasingly available to Veterans within the VA. Horses&#xD;
      are prey animals with extreme sensitivity to the emotional states, behaviors, and intentions&#xD;
      of their herds and other animals, including humans, and mirror body language and respond to&#xD;
      subtle nonverbal cues. As such, horses have the capacity to provide immediate feedback about&#xD;
      a person's emotional and behavioral states (e.g., pinning ears back when someone is angry or&#xD;
      relaxing them forward when a person is calm). As a person interacts with horses, this&#xD;
      capacity affords him or her an opportunity to become more emotionally self-aware and, with&#xD;
      guidance from EFT facilitators, learn how to regulate emotions and become calmer and more&#xD;
      patient, attentive, and confident to gain the horses' cooperation. With EFT, emotion&#xD;
      regulation is the key mechanism for social interaction with horses, and participants in EFT&#xD;
      are encouraged to apply what they have learned from their equine experiences to their&#xD;
      relationships with people. Since high quality social functioning depends on effective&#xD;
      regulation of one's emotions, EFT offers a novel way in which to improve the social&#xD;
      functioning of Veterans with mental health concerns. In fact, in the VA, EFT has been used to&#xD;
      address a variety of diagnostic issues commonly experience by Veterans, including PTSD,&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, substance use and eating disorders. However, peer-reviewed published&#xD;
      quantitative and qualitative research on EFT as a CIH for mental health is very limited, of&#xD;
      poor methodological quality, and focused on school-age children and adolescents, not adults.&#xD;
      None of it targets social functioning as a main outcome. Given VAs increasing embrace of EFT&#xD;
      as a CIH, carefully conducted research that aims to systematically develop and study EFT for&#xD;
      Veterans is sorely needed to ensure that EFT is feasible to study, acceptable to Veterans and&#xD;
      clinicians, and clinically promising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to pilot test an innovative EFT called The Equus Effect (TEE) as a&#xD;
      complement to Veterans' existing VA mental health services to improve social functioning. TEE&#xD;
      aims to improve Veterans' social functioning by developing their emotion regulation and&#xD;
      interpersonal skills through therapeutic interactions with horses. In line with&#xD;
      recommendations for pilot investigations, the investigators will conduct a randomized pilot&#xD;
      study to 1) evaluate the feasibility of study procedures, assessments, and outcomes, 2)&#xD;
      demonstrate experimental and control interventions can be delivered with fidelity, and 3)&#xD;
      examine the acceptability of the interventions. To accomplish these goals, the investigators&#xD;
      will enroll a transdiagnostic cohort of 40 Veterans involved in VA mental health services&#xD;
      with social dysfunction and emotion dysregulation. Participants will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      either 1) TEE or 2) attention control (AC), both group interventions. Each week, the&#xD;
      4-session TEE will include 1) mindfulness activities, 2) emotion regulation and interpersonal&#xD;
      skills education, 3) experiential activities with horses incorporating opportunities to&#xD;
      develop emotion regulation and interpersonal skills, and 4) between-session application of&#xD;
      lessons learned from the equine activities. AC will have similar elements without equine&#xD;
      features. Intervention outcomes will be measured at 4- and 16-weeks post randomization.&#xD;
      Specifically, using mixed quantitative-qualitative methods, the investigators aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Determine the feasibility of recruitment, randomization, retention, assessment&#xD;
      procedures, and implementation of TEE and AC. Hypothesis: Rates of recruitment will be at&#xD;
      least 8 participants per month, and Veterans randomized to TEE will attend intervention&#xD;
      sessions, remain in the study, and experience clinically significant changes in social&#xD;
      functioning and emotion dysregulation at rates equal to or superior to AC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Demonstrate TEE and AC can be delivered with fidelity. Hypothesis: Facilitators will&#xD;
      deliver each intervention consistently and as intended across sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Establish acceptability of TEE and AC by assessing intervention credibility and&#xD;
      satisfaction and the usefulness of TEE as a complementary mental health intervention using&#xD;
      mixed quantitative-qualitative methods. Hypothesis: Veterans will find TEE and AC credible&#xD;
      and satisfying and Veterans and their mental health clinicians will qualitatively report the&#xD;
      therapeutic benefits of TEE as a CIH for mental health treatment.&#xD;
