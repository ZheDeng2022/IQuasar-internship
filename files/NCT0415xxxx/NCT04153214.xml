  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recent literature has highlighting the importance of the time of inactivity and the level&#xD;
      of physical activity (PA) as predictors of metabolic cardio risks. Now, sedentary lifestyles&#xD;
      are well recognized as one of the causes of mortality. As with physical activity, a&#xD;
      dose-response relationship appears to exist: mortality would increase with time spent in&#xD;
      sedentary behaviors. However, this relationship would not be linear: the more the daily&#xD;
      sitting time increases, the more the consequences on mortality are important. It is now well&#xD;
      demonstrated that time spent in sedentary adult behaviour finds primarily its origin in the&#xD;
      work, characterized by prolonged and uninterrupted periods of sitting. Many strategies have&#xD;
      been settled to break the prolonged sitting time. The most promising one seem to be the use&#xD;
      of active workstations (treadmill, cycling, stepping) because they reduce sedentary time at&#xD;
      work and increase physical activity with positive effects on the global health. If active&#xD;
      workstations have demonstrated their effectiveness with overweight or obese people by&#xD;
      increasing daily energy expenditure, their interest in prevention in normal weight people is&#xD;
      less known. In addition, the long-term effectiveness of a program of reactivation by active&#xD;
      workstation on biological parameters, quantitative and qualitative time of sedentary&#xD;
      behaviour (duration, number of breaks) and physical fitness was not assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this project is to study the effects of the use of a cycling&#xD;
      workstation for 60 minutes per day (30 minutes twice a day) for 3 months among professionals&#xD;
      with an office-sitting desk on overall quantity of physical activity time (work and non-work)&#xD;
      and sedentary time.&#xD;

      Subject will have a pre-inclusion visit during a medical consultation where the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria to participate to this study will be checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the inclusion of subject and their agreements to participate to the study, they will&#xD;
      know in which group they are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group who performs 30minutes twice a working day from day 1 to day 180 (interventional)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group who performs 30minutes twice a working day from day 90 to day 180 (control)&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will have evaluation at three different times : T0 (Day 1), T1 (Day 90), T2 (Day 180).&#xD;
      The evaluation will evaluate :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  overall quantity and quality of physical activity time (work and non-work) and sedentary&#xD;
           time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body composition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biological parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical fitness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychological parameters At the end of the protocol, there will be an assessment of the&#xD;
           obstacles or motivations to this program.&#xD;
