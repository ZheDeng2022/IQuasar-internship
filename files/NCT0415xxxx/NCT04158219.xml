  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 350,000 Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) patients experience significant&#xD;
      depression symptoms each year in the US. Post-ACS depressed mood interferes with patients&#xD;
      making necessary changes to behavioral risk factors (e.g., smoking cessation) and predicts&#xD;
      poor medical outcomes. The proposed study will develop an integrated depression and&#xD;
      behavioral risk factor reduction intervention for secondary prevention post-ACS through an&#xD;
      open trial of 20 patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression predicts high rates of morbidity/mortality among acute coronary syndrome (ACS)&#xD;
      patients. Part of this relationship is explained by a poor profile of behavioral risk factors&#xD;
      (i.e., smoking,physical activity, medication adherence, diet). An integrated treatment&#xD;
      targeting both depressed mood and multiple behavioral risk factors could be highly effective&#xD;
      in reducing post-ACS mortality. Behavioral Activation for depression may be an ideal&#xD;
      counseling treatment for this since it has recently shown promise for facilitating behavioral&#xD;
      risk factor changes in ACS patients with depression (K23HL107391). The current study adapts&#xD;
      this manual targeting post-ACS depressed mood and smoking cessation to target depression and&#xD;
      multiple behavioral risk factors post-ACS. This study will be an open trial (N=20) to test&#xD;
      the feasibility and acceptability of our procedures and obtain initial indications of&#xD;
      efficacy. This study hypothesizes that 1) the BA-HD manual and study procedures will be&#xD;
      feasible and acceptable to post-ACS patients with depressed mood as measured by self-report,&#xD;
      recruitment/retention rate, and post- treatment qualitative interviews and 2) that&#xD;
      participants will experience clinically significant improvements in depressed mood and&#xD;
      behavioral risk factor profile. The long-term goal of this research is to improve long-term&#xD;
      survival rates following ACS.&#xD;

    <description>Consistent with successful BA manuals, we plan to conduct up to 10 sessions of treatment over 12 weeks (the recommendation will be at least 8 sessions; scheduling of sessions will be flexible and conform to patient preference). The initial two sessions will be about 50 minutes long and later sessions will be 20-30 minutes long. Sessions can be done on site or over the phone; home visits will be offered for sessions 1-2 if a participant cannot travel. Treatment sessions will use behavioral activation techniques to assess participant values and link these values to behavior change. Goal-setting will focus on sequential, idiographic behavior change (tobacco use, medication adherence, physical activity, and diet) and be accompanied by educational materials and commercially available tools (e.g. activity trackers, pillboxes).</description>
