  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the high burden of respiratory symptoms in the HIV+ population, causes of chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in individuals with HIV are poorly understood. Microbial&#xD;
      communities present in the lungs or gut could play an important role in COPD via their&#xD;
      ability to stimulate inflammation and oxidative stress and by the interactions of microbial&#xD;
      and host gene transcription. By exploring the impact of the structure and function of&#xD;
      microbial communities on the host in HIV-associated COPD, this project could lead to&#xD;
      discovery of novel therapeutics to treat and prevent COPD. Subjects will be 20 HIV+&#xD;
      individuals with COPD (FEV1/FVC &lt;0.70 and FEV1 and DLco&lt;80% predicted) and 20 HIV+&#xD;
      individuals with normal lung function (controls) and 10 HIV negative individuals recruited&#xD;
      from our ongoing cohorts. Controls will be matched to the individuals with COPD based on age,&#xD;
      gender, pack-years of smoking, ART use, HIV viral suppression, and history of illicit drug&#xD;
      use. Bronchoscopy will be performed on all subjects. The investigator will uncover mechanisms&#xD;
      that contribute to COPD in HIV+ individuals, which will lead to interventional therapies. For&#xD;
      example, the investigators evaluate the impact of bacteria on lung epithelial cell gene&#xD;
      expression and inflammation and test ability of anti-inflammatories to alter responses.&#xD;
      Identification of other key pathways or microbes could also lead to testing of pro-biotics,&#xD;
      post-biotics (bacterial metabolites), or therapy with bacteria genetically modified for&#xD;
      desired function or metabolites.&#xD;

      Day one:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea scale (MMRC) and the St. George's&#xD;
      Questionnaire(SGQT) will be administered. These are paper and pencil questionnaires that&#xD;
      inquire about respiratory symptoms, quality of life, and other lung related issues. This will&#xD;
      take approximately 20 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Sample collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will be asked to provide a blood sample by venipuncture of approximately 110mls&#xD;
      (7.4 tablespoon) at this study visit. The purpose of this collection is to have blood&#xD;
      processed for serum, plasma, and PBMCS, and a portion stored for RNA to be used for future&#xD;
      use. A hemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin will be done in order to calculate the DLCO only if&#xD;
      the participant requires repeat spirometry and DLCO testing. In addition, part of this blood&#xD;
      will be used to perform routine clinical blood tests to assure that it is safe to proceed&#xD;
      with the bronchoscopy test. (CBC/DIFF/PLT, LYTS, BUN, Creatinine, Glucose, PT/PTT) The&#xD;
      de-identified research samples will be processed and stored at -80C. Personal information&#xD;
      will not be provided to individual research subjects as Dr. Morris's laboratory is not CLIA&#xD;
      certified .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral Sample collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A one time collection of saliva and tongue scraping will be done at the first visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva sample will consist of between 1-5 mL of saliva spit into a sterile collection vessel.&#xD;
      Tongue scraping will consist of gentle scraping of the dorsal tongue (not hard enough to&#xD;
      cause abrasion) using a blunt, sterile device designed for this purpose that will then be&#xD;
      collected in a sterile collection vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool collection: The investigator will ask participants to provide a stool sample. They will&#xD;
      be instructed on how to collect a stool specimen at home. The investigator will give them&#xD;
      instructions and a kit that will provide all the supplies needed to collect the stool and&#xD;
      return with it on day 2 of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung function testing: (performed if there is not a PFT available from the past 3 months) The&#xD;
      routine lung function endpoints of FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, and FEF25-75% will be measured with&#xD;
      the flow-volume loop recorder on a NDD Easy One Pro testing system before and after&#xD;
      bronchodilator administration. The system is calibrated for body temperature and pressure of&#xD;
      saturated gas and volumes, per American Thoracic Society (ATS) standards . DLco will be&#xD;
      measured using the automated single-breath procedure of the integrated testing system, which&#xD;
      conforms with ATS standards. All testing will be reviewed by (PI). If any concerns or&#xD;
      abnormal results are discovered during this testing, a member of the research team will&#xD;
      notify the subject or the subject's primary care physician, who will assess the need to&#xD;
      provide additional evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy Test: A urine pregnancy test will be performed on all women of child bearing&#xD;
      potential. Men and women who are post menopausal for at least 1 year or have been surgically&#xD;
      made sterile will not be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2: (not necessarily consecutive days but within one week of day 1) Bronchoscopy: Fiber&#xD;
      optic bronchoscopy will be performed using the ATS recommendation and institutional protocols&#xD;
      for conscious sedation. The testing will be performed by a physician certified in pulmonary&#xD;
      medicine and proficient in the procedure and certified by UPMC. Fluoroscopy will not be used.&#xD;
      Subjects will be instructed to fast overnight and withhold aspirin and anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      analgesics for 48 hours prior to the procedure. Subjects will have undergone a pre-&#xD;
      bronchoscopy spirometry within the past 3 months and only clinically stable subjects&#xD;
      (FEV1&gt;30% predicted after albuterol) will undergo the procedure. Subjects will also receive&#xD;
      Proventil HFA Inhaler 2 puffs, after 5 minutes will receive a second dose of Proventil 2&#xD;
      puffs prior to sending patient to the Bronchoscopy suite. Subjects may receive a drug to dry&#xD;
      secretions ( Atropine 0.6mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a local anesthetic to the upper and lower airways and an intravenous&#xD;
      sedative and/or analgesic (midazolam; fentanyl). The midazolam dose will not exceed 10mg&#xD;
      and/or the fentanyl dose will not exceed 200 micrograms. Lidocaine will not exceed a dose of&#xD;
      9 mg/kg (0.9 cc of 1%/kg) or a maximum dose of 600 mg (60 cc 1%) during the procedure.&#xD;
      Subject monitoring will follow the local protocol for conscious/deep sedation. If needed,&#xD;
      subjects will receive additional short acting beta agonist. After transoral insertion of the&#xD;
      bronchoscope bronchoalveolar lavage will be performed. Blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen&#xD;
      saturation will be monitored throughout the procedure. The physician may stop the procedure&#xD;
      at any time for clinical safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchoalveolar lavage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      BAL will be performed with room temperature normal saline. After wedging the bronchoscope in&#xD;
      a (sub)segmental bronchus, approximately 50cc of saline will be instilled with each washing&#xD;
      and withdrawn by syringe aspiration. This will be repeated up to 4 times per segment as&#xD;
      needed. Amount of wash and selection of segments will be at the discretion of the physician.&#xD;
      Many clinical bronchoscopies are within this range of volume, and research bronchoscopies&#xD;
      have been found to be safe with volumes ranging from 100 to 300 cc even in subjects with&#xD;
      severe asthma (Wenzel S et al. Bronchoscopic evaluation of severe asthma. American Journal of&#xD;
      Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine 1997;156:737-43; Summary and recommendations of a&#xD;
      workshop on the investigative use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage in&#xD;
      asthmatic patients. Chest 1985;88:136-38). The investigator will stop the lavage at any point&#xD;
      where the investigators do not feel that it would be clinically tolerated by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volume collected after each withdrawal will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchial brushing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytology bronchial brushing involves positioning the bronchoscope at the right middle or&#xD;
      lower lobe, passing a cytology brush through the bronchoscope and gently brushing the lining&#xD;
      of the airways. This may be repeated at least eight more times per segment to ensure an&#xD;
      adequate sample collection. If any sample collected is not acceptable or adequate for&#xD;
      analysis, another sample may be collected so long as the physician performing the&#xD;
      bronchoscopy procedure decides that no significant risk is present with the additional&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participant will be monitored at UPMC Montefiore until the sedation has worn off. After&#xD;
           the bronchoscopy is completed, the subject will wait in the bronchoscopy recovery area&#xD;
           or the clinical research CTRC to make sure thier breathing has not been affected by the&#xD;
           procedure and to be sure that the anesthesia has worn off. Pulse oximetry monitoring&#xD;
           will continue throughout recovery period. If the subject is not able to breathe as well&#xD;
           as they could before the bronchoscopy, the investigator will give additional albuterol&#xD;
           and check the breathing again.Participant will not be allowed to leave the recovery area&#xD;
           until their breathing is back to their normal level. If a participants breathing does&#xD;
           not return to baseline they will be required to be admitted overnight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participant will not be allowed to drive themselves home after the bronchoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchoscopy pre and post sedation care will be conducted in the MUH CTRC. Staff are trained&#xD;
      research registered nurses and familiar with post bronchoscopy monitoring. Pulse oximetry&#xD;
      will be closely monitored and the subject will not be discharged until anesthesia has worn&#xD;
      off and the subject's breathing is back to normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bronchoscopy procedure will take about 45 minutes, the participant will not be discharged&#xD;
      until anesthesia has worn off and their breathing is back to normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All bronchoscopies will be done in the pulmonary division bronchoscopy suite. Resuscitative&#xD;
      equipment and personnel are present in the room to minimize risk.&#xD;
