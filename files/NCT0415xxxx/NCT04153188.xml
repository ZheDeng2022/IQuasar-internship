      This study will compare treatment outcome with pulsed dye laser, when used used as an&#xD;
      adjunctive treatment to oxymetazoline HCl 1% cream, compared to oxymetazoline HCL 1% cream&#xD;
      alone, for patients with moderate or severe erythematotelangiectatic rosacea.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, two-arm randomized, baseline-controlled, pilot study to evaluate&#xD;
      treatment outcome of 3 Vbeam® Prima PDL treatments in subjects applying once-daily RHOFADE®&#xD;
      topical oxymetazoline HCL 1.0% cream for improvement in erythematotelangiectatic rosacea.&#xD;
      Treatment outcome will be compared to oxymetazoline HCL 1% cream alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with moderate or severe (Grade 3 or 4) erythematotelangiectatic rosacea on the&#xD;
      validated Clinical Erythema Assessment (CEA) Scale and Subject Self-Assessment (SSA) Scale&#xD;
      will be enrolled and randomized to one of two study arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1- 3 monthly treatments with Vbeam® PDL with daily RHOFADE® topical oxymetazoline HCL&#xD;
      1.0% cream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2 -Treatment with daily RHOFADE® topical oxymetazoline HCL 1.0% cream only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will apply RHOFADE® cream daily during the 6-month study. After 1-month of&#xD;
      RHOFADE® cream, subjects in the combined treatment Arm 1 will receive the first of three&#xD;
      monthly Vbeam® PDL treatments (at 4-week intervals) with a 3-day washout of cream before each&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will assess erythema severity, global aesthetic improvement and vessel size&#xD;
      improvement with treatment at 1, 2, 3 and 6-months' post-baseline. Subject satisfaction will&#xD;
      be assessed. Safety assessments will be conducted at each study visit, and subjects in Arm 1&#xD;
      will also be assessed for treatment-associated discomfort and post-treatment response&#xD;
      following PDL treatments.&#xD;
