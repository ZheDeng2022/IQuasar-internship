      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the PK, safety and tolerability of phenylacetate and&#xD;
      benzoate after intravenous administration of TAK-123 in Japanese healthy adult male&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-123. TAK-123 is being tested in Japanese&#xD;
      healthy adult men. This study will look at the PK, safety and tolerability of phenylacetate&#xD;
      and benzoates of people who administered TAK-123.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 10 participants. All participants will be administered&#xD;
      TAK-123 intravenously at the dose level of 3.75 g/m^2 of sodium phenylacetate and 3.75 g/m^2&#xD;
      of sodium benzoate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - TAK-123 as 3.75 g/m^2 of sodium phenylacetate and 3.75 g/m^2 of sodium benzoate&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this&#xD;
      study is approximately 8 days. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic and be&#xD;
      hospitalized for four days.&#xD;
