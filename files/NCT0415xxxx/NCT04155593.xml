  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the rates of elevated post void residual (PVR)&#xD;
      (defined as &gt;200mL) in Cincinnati Urogynecology Associates patients following Botox&#xD;
      injection, as well as to document how many patients required treatment with clean&#xD;
      intermittent self-catheterization (CISC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 16% of all women have symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB), whereas 30% of the&#xD;
      elderly population are affected. Patients who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, first&#xD;
      and second line therapy with behavioral modifications and pharmacotherapy are offered&#xD;
      additional treatment options. Third line therapy involves injection of onabotulinumtoxinA&#xD;
      (BotoxÂ©, Allergen) into the bladder detrusor muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Botox was approved for use for the diagnosis of OAB in 2013. Cincinnati Urogynecology&#xD;
      Associates (CUA), TriHealth Inc. has incorporated intravesical Botox injections into the&#xD;
      management algorithm for refractory OAB, since 2014. Currently, patients who fail to improve&#xD;
      after a trial of first and second line therapy are offered treatment with Botox.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard practice is to request patients return to the office for a routine PVR&#xD;
      measurement using straight catheterization within approximately two-four weeks following&#xD;
      their Botox injection. This is done regardless if patients are exhibiting symptoms of urinary&#xD;
      retention. Patients with an elevated PVR are treated with CISC if they are symptomatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, many studies suggest that patients are accurately able to self-identify&#xD;
      symptoms of urinary retention, and treating asymptomatic urinary retention may not be&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to describe how many patients with PVR &gt;200mL had symptoms following&#xD;
      intravesical injection of Botox for OAB.&#xD;

        All patients who underwent onabotulinumtoxinA injections for overactive bladder by one of&#xD;
        four fellowship trained female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgeons at TriHealth&#xD;
        between October 1, 2015 and October 1, 2019. These patients will be identified by CPT codes&#xD;
        recorded in the EPIC electronic medical record.&#xD;
