  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of a pool of cells latently infected by HIV-1 in patients taking HAART and with&#xD;
      a viral load below 50 copies/mL is the main limitation to eradication of the virus from the&#xD;
      body. This viral reservoir prevents antiretroviral therapy from being interrupted; therefore,&#xD;
      patients are obliged to continue with treatment for a period calculated to be greater than 60&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the important advances in knowledge of the biology of this reservoir, we still have&#xD;
      no real knowledge about its dynamics. The opportunity to carry out a clinical trial for the&#xD;
      first time with an integrase inhibitor is exceptional, since the results could provide&#xD;
      important information on the nature of this reservoir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If maintenance of the reservoir is a dynamic process, inclusion of an integrase inhibitor is&#xD;
      expected to lead to a reduction in the size of this reservoir. This effect could be critical&#xD;
      when including IAT (viral reactivation), since, in theory, it would be necessary to act on a&#xD;
      smaller reservoir. Current consensus is that it would be necessary to act on almost 100% of&#xD;
      the viral reservoir (approximately 1,000,000 cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has also been designed to enable us to understand the biochemical and molecular&#xD;
      mechanisms by which certain drugs can induce viral reactivation in vitro as a previous step&#xD;
      to a clinical trial aimed at reactivating viral latency and eradicating HIV-1 from the body.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  After receiving information on the design and objectives of the study, the possible&#xD;
             risks involved, and the fact that they can refuse to collaborate at any time, patients&#xD;
             will give their informed consent to participate in the study and agree to provide&#xD;
             material for the cellular and molecular studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aged over 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic HIV infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Antiretroviral therapy with at least 3 drugs for at least 2 years and with no&#xD;
             modifications expected during the study. Antiretroviral drugs can be switched due to&#xD;
             intolerance as long as plasma viremia remains controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Undetectable viral load determined by ultrasensitive techniques (&lt;50 copies HIV&#xD;
             RNA/mL) for at least 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CD4+ T lymphocyte count above 350 cells/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Understand the objective of the study and be available to make frequent visits to the&#xD;
             hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous failure of antiretroviral therapy, understood as a rebound in viral load that&#xD;
             can be detected after having reached undetectable levels. Low-grade increases (&lt;200&#xD;
             copies of HIV RNA/mL) and transitory increases (blips) resolved without modifying&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Proven resistance against the antiretroviral drugs under study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planned interruption of antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Taking immunosuppressive or immunostimulating medication of any type, including&#xD;
             valproic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Taking a fusion inhibitor (enfuvirtide).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or intention to become pregnant during the study.&#xD;
