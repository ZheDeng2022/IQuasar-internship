      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoglycemia is a common presentation to the Emergency Department. Management has&#xD;
      traditionally involved rapid administration of IV 50% dextrose and dextrose containing IV&#xD;
      fluids in addition to oral carbohydrates. Hypoglycemic patients taking only insulin can often&#xD;
      times be treated as outlined above and safely discharged to home after a period of short&#xD;
      observation in the Emergency Department. This procedure is also followed in the pre-hospital&#xD;
      care arena, where insulin-dependent hypoglycemic patients are often treated and released.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to diet-control and insulin, patients with diabetes maintain outpatient&#xD;
      euglycemia with a class of drugs called sulfonylurea agents. This are believed to stimulate&#xD;
      insulin release from pancreatic beta cells via a complex mechanism culminating in calcium&#xD;
      influx and release of stored insulin from secretory granules within the pancreas. Whereas&#xD;
      insulin-dependent diabetic patients are usually discharged home after establishing normal&#xD;
      blood glucose levels, hospital admission is generally recommended in hypoglycemic patients&#xD;
      taking oral sulfonylureas due to the long duration of effect and delayed clearance of the&#xD;
      drugs and their metabolites and subsequent high likelihood of recurrent hypoglycemic&#xD;
      episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Octreotide is a somatostatin analog that is known to suppress numerous hormones including&#xD;
      insulin. Dextrose itself induces insulin secretion thus theoretically contributing to rebound&#xD;
      hypoglycemia when used to treat hypoglycemia. Octreotide is thought to block the elevated&#xD;
      insulin levels that are a result of both the sulfonlyureas and dextrose. Recent case reports&#xD;
      and one prospective study in healthy volunteers have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      octreotide administration for the treatment of sulfonylurea induced hypoglycemia. Based&#xD;
      largely on the results of these studies some experts in field of toxicology have argued that&#xD;
      administration of octreotide be standard therapy for all patients with recurrent hypoglycemic&#xD;
      episodes who are known to be taking sulfonylureas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measure the difference in serum glucose and the incidence of hypoglycemia between two groups&#xD;
      of sulfonylurea-dependent patients; a control group that receives standard therapy and an&#xD;
      experimental group that receives standard therapy plus octreotide.&#xD;

      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adult (&gt;18 years old) non-pregnant patients presenting to the Emergency Department with&#xD;
      hypoglycemia (serum glucose &lt; 60 mg/dl) will be identified and screened for inclusion by the&#xD;
      ED physicians and research staff. Hypoglycemic patients whose glucose-control medications&#xD;
      involve only insulin will be excluded. All patients whose medications involve oral&#xD;
      sulfonlyureas or a combination of insulin and sulfonylureas will be asked to participate in&#xD;
      this study. Patients will be required to read and sign an informed consent outlining the&#xD;
      objectives and risks/ benefits of the proposed protocol. In addition to reading the consent,&#xD;
      details of the study will be explained verbally by a trained emergency medicine research&#xD;
      assistant and patients will be given the opportunity to have all their questions answered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study patients will be randomized to one of two treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard treatment and placebo One ampule (50 mL) of IV 50% dextrose, oral carbohydrates&#xD;
           and placebo (1cc of 0.9 % Normal Saline subcutaneuously) or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Standard treatment plus 75 micrograms octreotide subcutaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will not receive additional maintenance IV glucose fluids unless they&#xD;
      become hypoglycemic (serum glucose &lt; 60 mg/dL), in which case they will receive bolus doses&#xD;
      of IV 50% dextrose and re-evaluated. All enrolled patients will be admitted to the hospital&#xD;
      and monitored for recurrent hypoglycemic episodes. Bedside glucose determinations will be&#xD;
      collected hourly for 4 hours followed by repeated calculations every 2 hours. Data points to&#xD;
      be collected will include the mean serum glucose, number of hypoglycemic episodes (&lt;60mg/dl)&#xD;
      and total quantity of dextrose required to maintain euglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the likely event that the hypoglycemia was diagnosed in the pre-hospital setting and the&#xD;
      patient received IV 50% dextrose prior to arrival to the Emergency Department, a rapid&#xD;
      bedside glucose determination will be obtained and if &lt;60 mg/dl a second bolus of IV 50%&#xD;
      dextrose given and the patient screened and approached about participation. If the emergency&#xD;
      department serum glucose is &gt;60mg/dl the patient will be screened and approached about&#xD;
      participation without a second bolus of IV 50% dextrose.&#xD;
