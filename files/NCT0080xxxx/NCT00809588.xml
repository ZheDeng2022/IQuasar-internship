  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the proposed therapy will delay or stop the&#xD;
      progression of the participants skin cancer. This study is being done because there are&#xD;
      currently no treatments which have been shown convincing to treat disease which has&#xD;
      progressed. This research study is designed to evaluate the immunologic effects and clinical&#xD;
      side effects of giving vaccines to patients that are made from their own skin cancer cells.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      -  The vaccines created from the participants melanoma cells are scheduled to be given to&#xD;
           the participants on days 1, 8, 15, 29 and every two weeks after until the supply of&#xD;
           vaccine has run out. The amount of vaccine is dependent on the total amount of cells&#xD;
           yielded when the tumor is processed and treated. It is hoped that participants will&#xD;
           receive at least six vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The vaccines will be administered in two injections that will be placed underneath the&#xD;
           participants skin. The two injections will be given at the same place on the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If tumor sample yields enough cells, participants will also receive an injection of&#xD;
           non-transduced irradiated melanoma cells. The purpose of this is to measure the amount&#xD;
           of reaction of the participants immune system occuring created by the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If either the vaccine site or DTH placement site has shown a reaction, a punch-biopsy&#xD;
           will be taken. This will consist of a small piece of skin tissue removed under local&#xD;
           anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  With vaccine #5, participants will receive a second DTH injection. Two days after the&#xD;
           vaccine and DTH injection, punch biopsies will be taken of both sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At week 10 of treatment (or earlier if necessary), participants will undergo a chest,&#xD;
           abdomen and pelvic CT scan. The physician may also have participants undergo a brain MRI&#xD;
           if indicated at this time.&#xD;
