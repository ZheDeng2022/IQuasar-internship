    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop, standardize and provide a preliminary test of a&#xD;
      novel intervention for preadolescent maltreated youth in out-of-home care. It is hypothesized&#xD;
      that the preventive intervention, which is known as Fostering Healthy Futures (FHF) and which&#xD;
      consists of therapeutic skills groups and mentoring, will improve mental health, social,&#xD;
      academic and behavioral functioning and reduce youths' initiation of, and participation in,&#xD;
      problem behaviors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This R21 application for a 3-year exploratory/development grant for intervention research is&#xD;
      designed to develop, standardize and provide a preliminary test of a novel intervention for&#xD;
      children, ages 9-11, placed in out-of-home care. Children and adolescents with a history of&#xD;
      maltreatment and subsequent placement in foster care are at risk for substantial mental&#xD;
      health and behavioral problems of great public health significance. In the prior longitudinal&#xD;
      work with children in foster care, the investigators have described the population, examined&#xD;
      child welfare system impact, and identified modifiable psychosocial risk and protective&#xD;
      factors. These pre-intervention activities, supported by the principal investigator's K01&#xD;
      award, have enabled the investigator to address important methodological issues that have&#xD;
      hampered the development of intervention efforts targeting this high-risk population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this pre-intervention research, feedback from focus group participants, and a review&#xD;
      of other efficacious programs for high-risk youth, the investigators propose to design an&#xD;
      intervention for preadolescent youth in foster care consisting of three primary components:&#xD;
      assessment and advocacy, mentoring, and therapeutic skills groups. The proposed R21&#xD;
      activities include developing the assessment battery and intervention protocol, manualizing&#xD;
      the treatment, estimating recruitment and attrition rates, and conducting a small-scale&#xD;
      randomized-controlled pilot study of the intervention. The goals of the intervention will be&#xD;
      to improve mental health, social, academic and behavioral functioning and to reduce youths'&#xD;
      initiation of, and participation in, problem behaviors. The investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      preliminary examination of whether these proximal outcomes are moderated by baseline&#xD;
      characteristics and/or mediated by the process variables targeted by the intervention.&#xD;
      Estimates of effect size will be used to determine the sample size needed for adequate power&#xD;
      to conduct a full-scale randomized controlled trial. The pilot study will also focus on&#xD;
      issues of feasibility, program uptake, and replicability, and the investigators will modify&#xD;
      the assessment battery, protocol, and manuals following the pilot phase and prior to the&#xD;
      application for an R01 to conduct a large-scale efficacy trial.&#xD;
