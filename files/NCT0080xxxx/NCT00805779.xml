  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the initial safety and clinical feasibility of neuromodulation therapy in treating&#xD;
      patients with documented overactive bladder. The specific aim is improved urinary frequency&#xD;
      and urgency after 12 weeks of treatment&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty to Forty patients with documented overactive bladder will receive 30 minutes of&#xD;
      treatment one day a week for 12 weeks. Treatment will consist of stimulating the posterior&#xD;
      tibial nerve in the area of the ankle with a pulsed electromagnetic field. Study treatments&#xD;
      will be administered by a commercially available MagPro R30, with a cooled figure eight coil,&#xD;
      and a surface electrode placed over the afferent pathway of the sacral nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aim is improved urinary frequency and urgency after 12 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the extent to which the device will decrease the number of episodes of&#xD;
           involuntary urine loss due to frequency/urgency in comparison to historical controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the potential of the device for improving patient quality of life as&#xD;
           measured by a clinically validated scale, such as the Incontinence Quality of Life&#xD;
           Instrument (I-QOL) or equivalent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To periodically employ a micturition diary to record variables such as day/night&#xD;
           urgency/frequency episodes, number of voids per day, severity of leaks, number of&#xD;
           absorbent products used per day, etc.&#xD;

    <description>Study treatments will be administered by a commercially available MagPro R30, with a cooled figure eight coil. The figure eight coil is placed directly over the posterior tibial nerve and the MagPro R30 will be activated. The coil will stimulate the posterior tibial nerve at 20 pulses per second for a 30 minute session.</description>

             methodology, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is free of mechanical urethral obstruction as documented by cystoscopy or&#xD;
             pressure flow criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient demonstrates an understanding of neuromodulation therapy, its benefits,&#xD;
             and its potential risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is willing and able to keep accurate records of their voiding on the&#xD;
             provided voiding diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is willing and able to comply with the Study Protocol.&#xD;
