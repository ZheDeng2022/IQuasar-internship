  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the&#xD;
      propionyl-L-carnitine hydrochloride tablets among Chinese population in comparison with the&#xD;
      placebo, for treatment of the peripheral arterial diseases (intermittent claudication) with&#xD;
      oral supplementation of 2g daily for a 4 months continuous administration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multi-centre, double-blind and placebo controlled clinical study.&#xD;
      Propionyl-L-Carnitine (PLC) is a kind of natural derivative of L-Carnitine (LC) and is&#xD;
      produced in the body and concentrated by 90% in the skeletal muscle and myocardium via an&#xD;
      enzyme-mediated reaction involving propionyl-CoA and LC. For oral adminsitration, PLC shows&#xD;
      that the decrease of the leg muscle carnitine of the PAD patient appears to correlate with&#xD;
      poor exercise performance. It has recently been shown that the severity of the impairment in&#xD;
      walking distance is correlated with the impairment in carntine metabolism at the muscle&#xD;
      level. 2g daily of PLC supplementation can significantly improve the walking ability in&#xD;
      patients with IC with a maximum walking capacity between 50 and 250 meters on the treadmill.&#xD;
