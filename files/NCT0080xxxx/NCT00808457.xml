  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study of a large number of patients (at least 200 patients) from several European centres&#xD;
      aims to investigate the value of chest ultrasound in diagnosing and checking the course of&#xD;
      pneumonia as compared to a chest X-ray film in two planes and - in case of a controversial&#xD;
      X-ray finding- as compared to low-dose CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An X-ray finding is regarded controversial, if infiltrates cannot be reliably excluded or not&#xD;
      reliably represented and if a definite diagnosis is, thus, not possible. A low-dose CT is&#xD;
      indicated even in case of a positive chest ultrasound and negative X-ray finding. Sonographic&#xD;
      recording and characterization of pneumonic infiltrates is performed both at the time of&#xD;
      diagnosing and in the further course under therapy.&#xD;

      The primary target criterion is&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Assessing the sensitivity of chest ultrasound in diagnosing pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary target criteria comprise&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessing specificity, negative and positive predictive value of chest ultrasound at the&#xD;
           time of diagnosing,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterizing pneumonic infiltrates at the time of diagnosing and further course,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describing the association between clinical, X-ray and sonographic findings in the&#xD;
           course of pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tertiary target criterion includes&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Characterizing the range of pathogens detected by microbiological examination.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with clinically suspected CAP who received no antibiotic treatment yet&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients in whom a chest X-ray in 2 planes was already performed, can be included in&#xD;
             the study, if chest ultrasound is performed within 24 hours after X-ray and if the&#xD;
             X-ray finding is neither available to nor known to the examiner doing the ultrasound&#xD;
             examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient's declaration of consent is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with HAP&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &lt;18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients in whom the time difference between chest ultrasound and chest X-ray in 2&#xD;
             planes is more than 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose X-ray findings are with the examiner doing the ultrasound or are known&#xD;
             to him&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy and lactation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Missing declaration of consent by the patient.&#xD;
