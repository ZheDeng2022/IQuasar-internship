  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial to be conducted at multiple Parkinson Study Group (PSG) sites in the&#xD;
      USA. Patients with early Parkinson disease will be randomly allocated to one of 4 arms in the&#xD;
      study. The 4 arms include 3 arms with different doses of aplindore MR tablets and 1 placebo&#xD;
      arm. The study drug will be taken twice a day (BID). The study is blinded and neither&#xD;
      subjects, nor the investigators, will know what treatment the subject is receiving.&#xD;
      Investigational study drug will be adjusted to the assigned dosage and then maintained at&#xD;
      that dosage for the balance of the 12 week follow-up period. The entire study will take about&#xD;
      13 weeks. The study will assess the safety and tolerability of aplindore and measure how&#xD;
      effective aplindore is in improving movement and other effects of Parkinson disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      One hundred and sixty eight patients will be randomly assigned to one of four investigational&#xD;
      treatment regimens in this outpatient study. For active treatment arms, study drug will be&#xD;
      titrated to the assigned dosage and then maintained for up to a 12 week follow-up period&#xD;
      before receiving tapered doses in advance of study completion. Dosing will take place over a&#xD;
      total of about 13 weeks.&#xD;
