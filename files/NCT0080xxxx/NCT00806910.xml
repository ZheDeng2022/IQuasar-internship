  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart Failure is a growing and challenging public health concern in the United States. Heart&#xD;
      failure commonly manifests as a syndrome of salt and water retention. Arginine vasopressin is&#xD;
      a peptide hormone that is intimately involved in salt and water homeostasis. AVP is released&#xD;
      into the circulation in response low blood volume and hypernatraemia. Despite fluid overload,&#xD;
      vasopressin levels are often inappropriately elevated in patients with heart failure and LV&#xD;
      dysfunction. Data suggest that vasopressin may also contribute to the deleterious circulatory&#xD;
      response in patients with heart failure and play a role in the development and progression of&#xD;
      the disease process. In their study, Udelson et al. showed that vasopressin receptor&#xD;
      antagonism with Conivaptan resulted in significant diuresis with stable hemodynamics in&#xD;
      advanced heart failure patients. Currently Intravenous diuretics and vasodilators are the&#xD;
      standard of care in treating patients with acute decompensated heart failure. We will be&#xD;
      studying the renal and diuretic effects of add on therapy with intravenous Conivaptan in&#xD;
      patients receiving intravenous Nesiritide and intravenous diuretics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure effects 5 to 6 million Americans and is increasing in prevalence. There are&#xD;
      about 550, 000 new cases of heart failure every year and about 3 million admissions for acute&#xD;
      decompensated heart failure every year. The total cost of heat failure on the health systems&#xD;
      is upwards of 35 billion dollars per year. Despite advances in medical care, the hospital&#xD;
      readmission rate is 20% at one month and 50% at six months. This prevailing situation&#xD;
      mandates further exploration of novel therapeutic targets to treat this complex disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vasopressin levels are often elevated in patients with heart failure and LV dysfunction which&#xD;
      is paradoxical and inappropriate. It has been hypothesized that high levels of circulating&#xD;
      vasopressin may play an important role not only in the pathophysiology of the heart failure&#xD;
      syndrome but also contribute to its disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that Conivaptan, a Vasopressin antagonist results in favorable changes in&#xD;
      hemodynamics and urine output without affecting blood pressure or heart rate. No consensus&#xD;
      has been reached for Conivaptan to be used as a sole agent in Acute Decompensated Heart&#xD;
      Failure (ADHF) patients and IV loop diuretics and/or vasodilators such as Nesiritide are used&#xD;
      as the prime treatment for vascular congestion. This prevailing situation brings the&#xD;
      questions whether, Conivaptan can be used as an adjunct to IV Furosemide and/or Nesiritide&#xD;
      presenting with ADHF.We intend to investigate this question in a cohort of heart failure&#xD;
      patients with hyponatremia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll 60 patients ( who meets all the inclusion criteria and none of the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria), admitted to the Albert Einstein Medical Center with the diagnosis of&#xD;
      Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (New York Heart Association class 3 and 4). The study&#xD;
      population will be divided into 2 groups; a treatment group and a placebo group as described&#xD;
      below. Each group will be comprised of 30 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment group will be treated with Nesiritide infusion, intravenous Furosemide (either&#xD;
      continuous infusion or bolus injection- total dose of Furosemide received at the end of the&#xD;
      study will be calculated) and IV Vaprisol. The placebo group will be given Nesiritide&#xD;
      infusion and intravenous Furosemide(either continuous infusion or bolus injection) and&#xD;
      placebo. Treatment will be continued in both groups for 24-36 hours.&#xD;
