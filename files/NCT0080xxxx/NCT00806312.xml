    <textblock>
      It is not always known what causes PAH or what the best treatment is. The doctors doing this&#xD;
      study would like to understand more about why some people develop PAH and other do not. They&#xD;
      also would like to learn more about which treatments might help PAH and which people might&#xD;
      respond better to treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doctors think that testing certain substances found in blood cells might help answer these&#xD;
      questions. These substances are normally released by our bodies to protect us from infection&#xD;
      and to tell the difference between normal and foreign substances in our body. Finally, a new&#xD;
      test will study very small molecules called microRNA that control how our genes are&#xD;
      expressed. This study is being done to see if blood samples can be tested to determine who&#xD;
      might develop PAH, how well drugs will work to treat PAH and to learn more about the&#xD;
      development of PAH.&#xD;

      You will be asked to donate blood when you have your right heart catheterization and also at&#xD;
      the 3-4 month follow-up visit. The amount of blood collected during your heart&#xD;
      catheterization is about 20cc (about 4 teaspoons). This blood is discarded as part of the&#xD;
      clinical catheterization procedure, but we are asking that we use it for this research study.&#xD;
      Then, at the follow-up right heart catheterization, you will be asked to donate 20 cc (which&#xD;
      is about 4 teaspoons) of blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the second right heart is not required for clinical purposes then you will be asked to&#xD;
      give a blood sample during your 3-4 month follow up clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you require an additional right heart catheterization, within one year, we will ask that&#xD;
      you donate additional samples at the subsequent RHC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other data collected as part of your clinical care, such as medical history, chest x-ray&#xD;
      (picture of your lungs), echocardiogram (picture of your heart), ventilation perfusion scan&#xD;
      (determines how much blood goes to your lungs), chest CT (thin pictures of my lungs as&#xD;
      slices), pulmonary function tests (breathing tests), and lab blood tests, will be used as&#xD;
      part of this research.&#xD;
