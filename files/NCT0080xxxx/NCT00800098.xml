  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arthritis Relief Plus (ARP) Cream is a natural, herbal cream that has been shown to provide&#xD;
      pain relief and decreased stiffness. Anecdotal reports suggest that pain may continue to be&#xD;
      reduced months after cream use is stopped, indicating that there could be some&#xD;
      disease-modifying effects of the cream. The purpose of this study is to test the claim that&#xD;
      the ARP cream can provide long-term pain relief to osteoarthritis patients after only a short&#xD;
      period of use. The study will also try to determine whether the pain relief is accompanied&#xD;
      with any measurable indications that the progression of osteoarthritis has slowed or halted&#xD;

      General Procedure: Subjects will be screened for: a history of knee pain and surgery by&#xD;
      questionnaire; kidney disease as determined by blood creatinine levels; knee diameter less&#xD;
      than 17cm and body diameter less than 60 cm due to the physical constraints of the MRI. Prior&#xD;
      X-rays or MRIs will be examined to evaluate the subject's level of OA. X-rays and MRIs that&#xD;
      are older than 2 years, cannot be used and these potential subjects will receive one set of 2&#xD;
      knee x-rays prior to enrollment. If they qualify and wish to enroll, they will be matched on&#xD;
      age, sex and degree of OA and assigned by a 3rd party investigator to either a placebo group&#xD;
      or active treatment group. Subjects will be asked to complete baseline questionnaires,&#xD;
      functional tests, and have blood draws and MRI screenings before starting their treatment.&#xD;
      Enrolled subjects will apply 2.5 grams of active or placebo cream 3 times per day to the skin&#xD;
      over the affected knee for 12 weeks. Further measurements will be taken periodically&#xD;
      throughout the course of the study, as detailed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI: Subjects will receive MRI scans of the affected knee 3 times: at enrollment, 12 weeks,&#xD;
      and 15 months. The MRI scan sessions will take place at the Lucas Center for MRI at Stanford&#xD;
      University. In preparation for the MRI scan, subjects will be required to fill out a standard&#xD;
      MRI screening form to ensure that there are no conditions that could interfere with the MRI&#xD;
      imaging or that could make scanning in any way hazardous. During the sessions, subjects will&#xD;
      lie on the scanner table on their backs with their legs straight. We will scan one knee. The&#xD;
      time for this scan will be approximately 1 hour. This entire session will take approximately&#xD;
      1 and 1/2 hours, including setup time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may be asked to receive a small dose of intravenous gadolinium contrast agent,&#xD;
      administered by Dr. Gold. This is to improve the evaluation of the articular cartilage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires: Subjects will receive physical activity, pain and function questionnaires at&#xD;
      enrollment, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 14 weeks, 16 weeks, 20 weeks, 6 months, 9 months, 12&#xD;
      months, and 15 months. They will also keep a log of use of other pain medicine, such as&#xD;
      aspirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood/Urine Samples: A small amount of blood (2 tablespoons or 30 ml) will be drawn and urine&#xD;
      collected up to 11 times throughout the investigation to study blood markers of cartilage&#xD;
      breakdown (COMP, CTX2, Glc-Gal-PYD) and synthesis (PIIANP) as well as inflammation (HA, CRP)&#xD;
      and joint vascularity (TNF-alpha, IL-6, osteocalcin). Blood creatinine levels will be tested&#xD;
      at baseline only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional Testing: Subjects will also participate in functional testing that will include&#xD;
      walking tests, rising from a chair, and climbing stairs up to 11 times throughout the&#xD;
      15-month study. The &quot;6-minute Walk&quot; test is a good indicator of cardiovascular capacity. We&#xD;
      will ask subjects to cover as much ground as possible in 6 minutes at a maintainable pace,&#xD;
      and will record the distance traveled. The &quot;Get up and Go&quot; test will measure the time it&#xD;
      takes a subject to rise from a standard chair, walk three meters, turn around, return, and&#xD;
      sit down again. Subjects will perform 3 trials, and their fastest time will be recorded. The&#xD;
      &quot;Timed Stair Climb&quot; test will measure the time it takes subjects to climb up and down five&#xD;
      standardized steps. Subjects will be instructed to ascend and descent as fast as possible&#xD;
      using the handrails provided. They will perform 3 trials and the fastest time will be&#xD;
      selected. Walking speed tests offers an indirect way to measure the functional impact of&#xD;
      pain. We will ask subjects to walk 10 meters at a maximal or a self-selected pace and will&#xD;
      calculate their walking speeds. They will perform between 3 to 6 trials of each test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All tests will be performed in accordance with ACSM guidelines for exercise testing.&#xD;
