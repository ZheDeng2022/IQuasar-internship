  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that Simvastatin administration would result in selective killing of the basal&#xD;
      subtype of breast cancer, in particular, CD44+/CD24- breast cancer cells in primary tumor. We&#xD;
      further hypothesize that tumor genomic changes would correlate with tumor response to&#xD;
      Simvastatin. We are also looking to correlate Simvastatin biological effects with the&#xD;
      expression pattern of initial status of primary tumor. In addition, we hypothesize that&#xD;
      Simvastatin-induced tumor gene expression changes may correlate with tumor and plasma&#xD;
      proteomics, peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression changes, and pharmacogenetics,&#xD;
      and that these analyses may further refine the selection of patients most likely to benefit&#xD;
      from Simvastatin.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Evaluate the biological response (proliferation and apoptosis) of Simvastatin in primary&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Evaluate the cell type specificity of Simvastatin effect on basal subtype breast cancer,&#xD;
      especially cells with CD44+/CD24- immunophenotype in the primary tumor. Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study cellular response to Simvastatin in transriptome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To obtain gene expression signature that predict Simvastatin biological effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To identify genetic polymorphisms that may influence Simvastatin pharmacokinetics and/or&#xD;
           biological effects on breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To correlate tumor and plasma proteomics with tumor gene expression changes, and to&#xD;
           identify tumor and/or serum protein markers that predict Simvastatin biological effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To correlate peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression changes with tumor gene&#xD;
           expression changes, and to identify blood gene markers that may predict Simvastatin&#xD;
           biological effects. VI. Abstract of Research Proposal In no more than 300 words,&#xD;
           describe concisely the specific aims, hypotheses, methodology and approach of the&#xD;
           application, indicating where appropriate the application's importance to science or&#xD;
           medicine. The abstract must be self-contained so that it can serve as a succinct and&#xD;
           accurate description of the application when separated from it. Please use lay terms. If&#xD;
           this not possible, the technical and medical terms should be explained in simple&#xD;
           language. We hypothesize that Simvastatin administration would result in selective&#xD;
           killing of the basal subtype of breast cancer, in particular, CD44+/CD24- breast cancer&#xD;
           cells in primary tumor. We further hypothesize that tumor genomic changes would&#xD;
           correlate with tumor response to Simvastatin. We are also looking to correlate&#xD;
           Simvastatin biological effects with the expression pattern of initial status of primary&#xD;
           tumor. In addition, we hypothesize that Simvastatin-induced tumor gene expression&#xD;
           changes may correlate with tumor and plasma proteomics, peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
           cell gene expression changes, and pharmacogenetics, and that these analyses may further&#xD;
           refine the selection of patients most likely to benefit from Simvastatin. This is a&#xD;
           single-centre, open-label, phase II study of Simvastatin in resectable primary breast&#xD;
           cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 100 patients with measurable, resectable, primary breast tumor will be enrolled to&#xD;
      receive 10-21 days of Simvastatin at a dose of 20 mg daily before definitive breast cancer&#xD;
      surgery. Pre-treatment tumor biopsy will be obtained from each subject before starting&#xD;
      Simvastatin. Subjects will take Simvastatin at a dose of 20 mg daily for 10-21 days, prior to&#xD;
      definitive breast cancer surgery. The post-treatment tumor biopsy will be obtained at&#xD;
      surgery. At each tumor biopsy, 3-4 tumor samples will be obtained through the same needle&#xD;
      track. One tumor core at each time point will be fixed in formalin for histological&#xD;
      examination and immunohistochemical studies. The remaining tumor cores will be stored in&#xD;
      liquid nitrogen for subsequent RNA and protein extraction for gene expression and proteomics&#xD;
      studies. Blood samples will be obtained before and after 10-21 days of Simvastatin treatment&#xD;
      for Simvastatin pharmacokinetic analysis, plasma proteomics and peripheral mononuclear cell&#xD;
      gene expression analysis. 10 ml blood will be taken from each participant for genotyping&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
