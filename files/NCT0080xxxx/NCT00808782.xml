    <textblock>
      Theory of mind (ToM) refers to the ability to infer others mental states. It includes a&#xD;
      recognition that other individuals experience thoughts, feelings, intentions, and desires&#xD;
      that may be different to our own. ToM is often impaired among individuals with an autism&#xD;
      spectrum disorder (such as autism and Asperger's disorder), and may underlie aspects of&#xD;
      social dysfunction in this population. Indeed, it has been suggested that impaired ToM is the&#xD;
      core deficit of autism and Asperger's disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging studies suggest that the bilateral medial prefrontal cortex, the most important brain&#xD;
      region in ToM processing, is underactive in autism. The current study examines whether&#xD;
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the bilateral medial prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      can modulate ToM ability among healthy adults, and improve ToM ability among adults with&#xD;
      autism or Asperger's disorder. With the prevalence of autism increasing, there is a clear&#xD;
      need to develop appropriate therapeutic interventions to improve social functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves a double-blind study using high-frequency rTMS in an attempt to improve&#xD;
      ToM among adults with either autism or Asperger's disorder. Theory of mind will be measured&#xD;
      using behavioural tasks that require the participant to infer what someone is thinking or&#xD;
      feeling by observing their behaviour. These tasks will administered both before and after&#xD;
      rTMS to determine whether any change in theory of mind has occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty adults with either autism (n = 15) or Asperger's disorder (n = 15) will initially&#xD;
      undergo functional and structural MRI to determine the site on the scalp that lies over the&#xD;
      medial prefrontal cortex (to which rTMS will be administered). They will then attend our lab&#xD;
      each consecutive weekday for a two-week period, during which they will 15 minutes&#xD;
      high-frequency (5 Hz) rTMS (either active or sham) to the medial prefrontal cortex. ToM and&#xD;
      clinical measures will be collected before the first session, soon after the last session,&#xD;
      and one month after the last session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on prior imaging data, it is expected that high-frequency rTMS (compared with sham&#xD;
      rTMS) to the medial prefrontal cortex will improve ToM ability and reduce social dysfunction&#xD;
      among adults with autism or Asperger's disorder. Should these hypotheses be supported, it&#xD;
      will indicate the suitability of rTMS as a neurobiological intervention designed to improve&#xD;
      ToM and social function among individuals with autism and related disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism and Asperger's disorder are life-long neurodevelopmental disorders that involve&#xD;
      significant social, communicative, and behavioural abnormalities. Social impairments are&#xD;
      arguably the most debilitating aspect of these disorders, and persist into adulthood,&#xD;
      creating difficulties in various domains including employment, education, and interpersonal&#xD;
      relationships. This impairment is also frequently associated with additional mental health&#xD;
      concerns, including depression and anxiety, with the former affecting as many as 40% of&#xD;
      individuals with autism (Stewart, Barnard, Pearson, Hasan, &amp; O'Brien, 2006). It has been&#xD;
      suggested that the core deficit underlying social dysfunction in autism and Asperger's&#xD;
      disorder is impairment in &quot;theory of mind&quot; (ToM) (Baron- Cohen et al., 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important aspect of social cognition, ToM refers to the ability to use environmental cues&#xD;
      to infer others' mental states. It includes the recognition that other individuals experience&#xD;
      thoughts, feelings, intentions, and desires that may be different to our own. ToM is crucial&#xD;
      to social functioning, allowing us to predict others behaviour and gain an appreciation of&#xD;
      their perspective, thereby facilitating effective social interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ToM has been assessed using an array of behavioural tasks. Such tasks typically illustrate a&#xD;
      social scenario, and the aim of the task is to identify various aspects of a character's&#xD;
      mental state. Increasingly, researchers distinguish between cognitive ToM, which encompasses&#xD;
      inferences of another individual's beliefs, knowledge or memory, and affective ToM, which is&#xD;
      concerned with predicting others' emotional states (Shamay-Tsoory &amp; Aharon-Peretz, 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive ToM measures include false-belief tasks, successful completion of which requires an&#xD;
      understanding that another individual can hold a mistaken belief (first-order false-belief),&#xD;
      and that are therefore different to their own belief, or that another individual can hold a&#xD;
      mistaken belief about the mental state of a third person (second-order false-belief;&#xD;
      Harrington, Siegert, &amp; McClure, 2005). Another cognitive ToM task involves inferring&#xD;
      intention from a series of short animations that demonstrate interactions between non-human&#xD;
      objects (e.g., geometric shapes; Castelli, Frith, Happe, &amp; Frith, 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      By contrast, affective ToM measures include the &quot;eyes task&quot; (Baron- Cohen, Wheelwright, Hill,&#xD;
      Raste, &amp; Plumb, 2001), which requires the inference of another individual's emotional&#xD;
      experience through the presentation of their eyes only. The eyes task is considered a ToM&#xD;
      measure in that it involves the inference of another individual's mental state from&#xD;
      environmental stimuli, but unlike false-belief tasks there is a central affective component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional ToM test that is thought to involve both cognitive and affective aspects of ToM&#xD;
      is the faux pas test (Stone, Baron- Cohen, &amp; Knight, 1998), which assesses the ability to&#xD;
      recognize a faux pas within the context of a series of vignettes describing social&#xD;
      interaction. This ability requires an understanding of the mental state of two people: the&#xD;
      individual who unwittingly committed the faux pas (cognitive ToM), and the individual who&#xD;
      might be offended or insulted by the faux pas (affective ToM). Thus, ToM tasks are all&#xD;
      concerned with the inference of others mental states, but whereas cognitive ToM tasks require&#xD;
      inferences concerning others beliefs, affective ToM tasks require inferences concerning&#xD;
      others emotions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The brain basis of ToM is increasingly well established; recent fMRI studies utilizing&#xD;
      cognitive ToM tasks indicate widespread frontotemporal activity. This includes the temporal&#xD;
      poles bilaterally and the right superior temporal sulcus (STS), which seem to reflect the&#xD;
      role of memory and visual perception respectively (Gallagher &amp; Frith, 2003; Schultz &amp; Robins,&#xD;
      2005). It is the activation within the bilateral medial prefrontal cortex, however, that is&#xD;
      thought to reflect a unique contribution to ToM. Gallagher and Frith (Gallagher &amp; Frith,&#xD;
      2003) suggest that a distinct area within the medial prefrontal cortex, the bilateral&#xD;
      anterior paracingulate cortex (x = 8, y = 54, z = 1), is the crucial region for ToM ability.&#xD;
      While the medial prefrontal cortex is strongly implicated in cognitive ToM, neural networks&#xD;
      recruited during affective ToM are somewhat different (despite substantial overlap), and&#xD;
      involve the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, and ventromedial frontal lobes in addition to&#xD;
      temporal regions. A recent lesion study of ToM supports this neuroanatomical dissociation&#xD;
      between cognitive and affective ToM (Shamay-Tsoory &amp; Aharon-Peretz, 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is substantial evidence for impaired ToM in autism and Asperger's disorder. Individuals&#xD;
      with these disorders consistently demonstrate delayed or impaired performance on both&#xD;
      cognitive and affective ToM tasks (Baron-Cohen, Jolliffe, Mortimore, &amp; Roberstson, 1997;&#xD;
      Baron-Cohen, Leslie, &amp; Frith, 1985; Kaland, Smith, &amp; Mortensen, 2007; Rogers, Dziobek,&#xD;
      Hassenstab, Wolf, &amp; Convit, 2007). Indeed, it has been suggested that ToM impairment is the&#xD;
      core deficit of autism, and that it underlies the characteristic social and communicative&#xD;
      symptoms (Baron-Cohen et al., 1985; Tager-Flusberg, 2001). Imaging studies among individuals&#xD;
      with autism demonstrate reduced activity with the medial prefrontal cortex, particularly&#xD;
      during cognitive ToM tasks (e.g., Castelli et al., 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification for project&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social dysfunction, including impaired ToM, is arguably the most debilitating aspect of&#xD;
      autism and associated disorders. There are currently few treatment options for targeting&#xD;
      these social deficits in autism and Asperger's disorder. An increasing prevalence of autism&#xD;
      spectrum disorders (Chakrabarti &amp; Fombonne, 2005) ensures that the next decade will see an&#xD;
      unprecedented number of adult cases; it is therefore imperative that we now develop effective&#xD;
      therapeutic techniques to reduce the impact of core autistic symptoms. Functional imaging&#xD;
      data reviewed above suggests that the bilateral medial prefrontal cortex is a promising site&#xD;
      for neurobiological intervention in these groups to improve ToM (particularly cognitive ToM)&#xD;
      and broader social functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We suggest that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may be an effective&#xD;
      therapeutic technique to enhance medial prefrontal cortex activity and improve ToM in&#xD;
      individuals with autism, with anticipated benefits to social aspects of this disorder. rTMS&#xD;
      is a safe and non-invasive technique that involves the repeated administration of localized&#xD;
      magnetic pulses to a distinct cortical region. When applied at high-frequencies, rTMS&#xD;
      enhances cortical activity at the site of stimulation. This is particularly useful in a&#xD;
      clinical setting, where rTMS is administered to a cortical region that functional imaging&#xD;
      suggests is underactive in a particular psychiatric disorder (e.g., left dorsolateral&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex [DLPFC] in depression), an approach that is effective in alleviating core&#xD;
      symptoms of the disorder. Conversely, low-frequency rTMS decreases cortical activity at the&#xD;
      site of stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis/research questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that two weeks of high-frequency rTMS to the medial prefrontal cortex,&#xD;
      which is expected to increase cortical activity within this region, will significantly&#xD;
      improve ToM performance (particularly cognitive ToM) among individuals with autism or&#xD;
      Asperger's disorder. Improvements in social function are expected to be seen one month after&#xD;
      the last treatment session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology including project design and sequence of procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will involve the administration of rTMS via a &quot;deep TMS'&quot; H-system coil&#xD;
      (Brainsway Inc., Jerusalem, Israel). This is administered by a modified TMS coil, but uses&#xD;
      our existing stimulator equipment (Magstim), which has been used in our previous rTMS&#xD;
      studies. This H-system coil will allow deeper penetration of the TMS pulse, which will ensure&#xD;
      that we accurately stimulate the part of the medial prefrontal cortex that is most relevant&#xD;
      to ToM. Safety and efficacy studies of deep TMS indicate equivalence with the conventional&#xD;
      TMS (figure-of-eight) coil (Levkovitz et al., in press; Zangen, Roth, Voller, &amp; Hallett,&#xD;
      2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an rTMS trial to improve ToM and social function among adults with autism or&#xD;
      Asperger's disorder. Adults diagnosed with either autism or Asperger's disorder will be&#xD;
      randomized (via a computer generated number sequence) to either active rTMS or a sham&#xD;
      condition, under strict double-blind conditions. Based on prior imaging data, rTMS will be&#xD;
      administered to the bilateral medial prefrontal cortex. This study will involve deep TMS via&#xD;
      the use of the H-system coil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the rTMS sessions participants will undergo high-resolution (3T) structural and&#xD;
      functional MRI. The fMRI component will again include cognitive and affective ToM measures.&#xD;
      Using reliable neuronavigational methods, each individual's brain scan will be used to&#xD;
      determine the site on the scalp that lies above the cortical region of interest (bilateral&#xD;
      medial prefrontal cortex), and which will therefore be targeted for rTMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the first rTMS session, the participant will complete a battery of neurobehavioural&#xD;
      tests that assess theory of mind (e.g., false-belief task, eyes test, faux pas test). In&#xD;
      order to gauge whether there is any impact on the broader realm of social functioning in&#xD;
      autism, participants will also be administered the &quot;Autism Spectrum Quotient&quot; (AQ;&#xD;
      Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Skinner, Martin, &amp; Clubley, 2001), a fifty item self-report&#xD;
      measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the first rTMS session, we will determine resting motor threshold (RMT)&#xD;
      by administering TMS to the left motor cortex, and recording (via EMG) the response from the&#xD;
      right thumb muscle. RMT is again defined as the lowest intensity at which 3 out of 5&#xD;
      consecutive TMS pulses results in an EMG response greater than 50 µV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the deep TMS coil, participants will receive 15 minutes of either active or sham rTMS&#xD;
      (5 Hz) each consecutive weekday for a two-week period. During each session, there will be 10&#xD;
      seconds of 5Hz rTMS, followed by a 20 second rest. Thus, for each session there will be 30&#xD;
      10s trains of 5Hz rTMS administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the final rTMS treatment, the three ToM measures and the AQ will be readministered.&#xD;
      These measures will then be administered one-month after the final rTMS treatment. The&#xD;
      researcher administering these measures will be blind to the participant's treatment (i.e.,&#xD;
      active or shame).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of the one-month follow-up, participants will be unblinded to their&#xD;
      study condition. Those who were allocated to the sham condition will be given the opportunity&#xD;
      to complete two weeks of active rTMS treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses and sample size calculations&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the effect of rTMS on ToM has not been investigated, it is somewhat difficult to conduct a&#xD;
      power analysis. However, based on the sample size of previous rTMS studies that involves&#xD;
      modulation of a cognitive ability (e.g., Giovannelli et al., 2006; Kwan et al., 2007; Tunik,&#xD;
      Frey, &amp; Grafton, 2005) or treatment for psychiatric disorders (e.g., Fitzgerald et al., 2006;&#xD;
      Horacek et al., 2007), we are confident that our sample size will be sufficient to detect a&#xD;
      significant result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANOVA will be used to investigate the effect of rTMS to the medial prefrontal cortex on ToM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome variables will not only include ToM measures, but also an autism-relevant rating&#xD;
      scale to determine social functioning and associated aspects. Thus, we will conduct repeated&#xD;
      measures ANOVA for each measure (pre, post, and one-month post rTMS), with group (active vs.&#xD;
      sham) included as the between-subjects variable.&#xD;
