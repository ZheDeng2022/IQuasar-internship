    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the drug product sNN0029,&#xD;
      containing the growth factor VEGF165, when administered directly into one of the fluid filled&#xD;
      cavities in the brain using an implanted catheter and an implanted SynchroMed® II pump.&#xD;
      Patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis will be enrolled.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an endogenous human protein fundamental to the&#xD;
      development of the vascular and nervous systems in the body. A role for VEGF in ALS has been&#xD;
      suggested from observations in animal models of the disease as well as observations of a&#xD;
      dysregulation of VEGF production in patients with ALS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NeuroNova intends to investigate whether intracerebroventricular administration of VEGF165 in&#xD;
      the form of the drug product sNN029 can improve motor function and prolong survival in&#xD;
      patients with ALS, and in this first study the safety and tolerability of treatment for 3&#xD;
      months will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiograms, vital signs and clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events and withdrawals related to adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Possible pathological changes in the brain, spinal cord or retina identified through&#xD;
           magnetic resonance imaging and funduscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Possible signs of intracranial bleeding or loss of blood-brain-barrier integrity through&#xD;
           measurements of bilirubin and albumin levels in cerebrospinal fluid collected through&#xD;
           lumbar and cervical puncture&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Device performance as characterized by catheter tip placement (determined by imaging)&#xD;
           and infusion accuracy (pump residual volume)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the effect of ICV administration of sNN0029 on the time course of Amyotrophic&#xD;
           Lateral Sclerosis related parameters including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Disease activity as measured by Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating&#xD;
                Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quality of life as measured by the EQ-5D rating scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the levels of VEGF165 in cerebrospinal fluid collected through lumbar and&#xD;
           cervical puncture.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Clinical diagnosis of ALS classified as definite, or probable with or without&#xD;
             additional laboratory evidence, according to the revised WFN El Escorial criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age 18 to 75 years inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. If patients are being treated with riluzole, they must have been on a stable dose for&#xD;
             at least 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Ophthalmological examination at screening with normal findings regarding vascular&#xD;
             structure and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. MRI/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) examination of the brain and cervical spinal&#xD;
             cord at screening with no findings of tumors or potential sources of pathological&#xD;
             bleedings, or abnormality that may interfere with the assessments of safety or&#xD;
             efficacy or that would, in the judgement of the investigator, represent a surgical&#xD;
             risk to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Values of coagulation parameters including platelet count, normalized prothrombin&#xD;
             complex (PK-INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) within normal ranges.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient is medically able to undergo the surgery required for stereotactic&#xD;
             implantation of the catheter and infusion pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient has been given written and verbal information, has had the opportunity to ask&#xD;
             questions about the study, and understands the time and procedural commitments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient has given signed consent (written) to participate in the study. In the event&#xD;
             that a patient who gives oral informed consent is not physically able to sign the&#xD;
             informed consent form (ICF) due to disease progression, a witness may sign the ICF on&#xD;
             the patient's behalf.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Impaired respiratory function judged to pose a risk to the patient during anaesthesia&#xD;
             for the device implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Hypertension defined as blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg systolic or &gt;90 mmHg diastolic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Proliferative retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Non-proliferative retinopathy of moderate severity or higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Concurrent clinically significant dementia as determined by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Concurrent clinically significant depression as determined by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of structural brain disease other than ALS, including tumours and hyperplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Any disorder that precludes a surgical procedure (e.g., signs of sepsis or&#xD;
             inadequately treated infection), alters wound healing (e.g., including bleeding&#xD;
             disorders), or renders chronic ICV delivery or device implants medically unsuitable.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Presence of risk for increased or uncontrolled bleeding and/or risk of bleeding that&#xD;
             is not managed optimally. Physicians should specifically investigate anatomical&#xD;
             factors at or near the implant site (e.g., vascular abnormalities, neoplasms, or other&#xD;
             abnormalities), underlying disorders of the coagulation cascade, platelet function, or&#xD;
             platelet count (e.g., haemophilia, Von Willebrand's disease, liver disease, or other&#xD;
             medical conditions), and the administration of any antiplatelet or anticoagulant&#xD;
             medication (e.g., aspirin, Plavix, NSAIDs) in the pre- or perioperative period. Any of&#xD;
             those conditions or drugs could place a patient at an increased risk for&#xD;
             intraoperative or postoperative bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Presence of an implanted shunt for the drainage of CSF or an implanted CNS catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Presence of cardiac pacemakers, spinal cord stimulators, implantable programmable&#xD;
             intraspinal drug pumps, or any other device that may interfere or interact with the&#xD;
             programmer, without prior approval by Medtronic.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Clinically significant abnormalities in hematology or clinical chemistry parameters as&#xD;
             assessed by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Ongoing medical condition that according to the investigator would interfere with the&#xD;
             conduct and assessments in the study. Examples are medical disability (e.g., severe&#xD;
             degenerative arthritis, compromised nutritional state, peripheral neuropathy) that&#xD;
             would interfere with the assessment of safety and efficacy of investigational product&#xD;
             or device performance, or would compromise the ability of the subject to undergo study&#xD;
             procedures (e.g., MRI), or to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Participation in another clinical trial with an investigational drug or device within&#xD;
             3 months prior to Screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. For female subjects, ongoing pregnancy or planned pregnancy during the period of&#xD;
             treatment with study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Breast feeding during the period of treatment with study drug.&#xD;
