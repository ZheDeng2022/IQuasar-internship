      RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy, such as 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy,&#xD;
      that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and&#xD;
      cause less damage to normal tissue. Internal radiation uses radioactive material placed&#xD;
      directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. Giving these treatments after surgery may&#xD;
      kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. It is not yet known whether 3-dimensional&#xD;
      conformal radiation therapy is more effective than internal radiation therapy when given&#xD;
      after surgery in treating early-stage breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy&#xD;
      to see how well it works compared with internal radiation therapy when given after&#xD;
      breast-conserving surgery in treating women with stage I or stage II breast cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the rate of successfully delivered accelerated partial breast irradiation&#xD;
           (APBI) using 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy vs multi-catheter interstitial&#xD;
           brachytherapy in women with stage I or II invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish potential patient participation in ongoing phase III clinical trials (e.g.,&#xD;
           NSABP-B-39, GEC-ESTRO, RAPID, MPORT, and IRMA) that compare APBI to standard&#xD;
           whole-breast irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess acute radiation-induced toxicity in these patients as assessed by NCI CTCAE&#xD;
           version 3.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess long-term radiation-induced toxicity in these patients as assessed by&#xD;
           RTOG-EORTC scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the incidence and type of adverse events in the breast of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the incidence and type of procedure-related complications in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine local control and pattern of recurrence in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine disease-free survival (distant and recurrence-free survival) of these&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine overall survival of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess cosmesis in these patients as assessed by the Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome&#xD;
           and RTOG scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess treatment-related symptoms in these patients as assessed by the Breast Cancer&#xD;
           Treatment Outcome scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Patients with a lumpectomy&#xD;
      cavity/whole breast ratio 25-30% are assigned to treatment in arm II.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients undergo accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) using&#xD;
           3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy twice daily over 5-10 days (total of 10&#xD;
           fractions) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients undergo APBI using multi-catheter interstitial brachytherapy twice&#xD;
           daily over 5-10 days (total of 10 fractions) in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
           unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaires at baseline, on the last day of treatment,&#xD;
      at 4 and 24 weeks after completion of treatment, and then annually for 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 5 years.&#xD;
