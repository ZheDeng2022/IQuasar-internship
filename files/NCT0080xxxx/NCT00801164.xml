    <textblock>
      The goals of this exploratory study are to 1)examine an investigational oral rinse as an&#xD;
      adjunctive agent to scaling and root planing in treating chronic periodontitis in a&#xD;
      periodontitis-susceptible diabetes population, and 2) evaluate its effect on glycemic control&#xD;
      and biomarkers of systemic inflammation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This double-blind prospective pilot study will evaluate the effects of an investigational&#xD;
      oral rinse as an adjunctive agent to non-surgical periodontal intervention for patients with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus. Approximately thirty (30) adult (35 years or older) patients with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus with untreated chronic periodontitis of moderate or worse severity&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the 6-month study to provide 24 evaluable subjects (12 per group). All&#xD;
      subjects enrolled in the trial will receive standard periodontal therapy including scaling&#xD;
      and root planing (SRP). Half will be randomized to receive the investigational oral rinse&#xD;
      adjunctively twice daily; the other half will receive placebo rinse twice daily. Study&#xD;
      participants will be treated with either Iocide or placebo rinse for the first 90 days of the&#xD;
      study only. Follow up examinations will be performed at six months. Evaluation of biological&#xD;
      markers associated with systemic inflammation and diabetes will be performed at baseline,&#xD;
      three months, and six months. The primary study outcome is clinical measurement of chronic&#xD;
      periodontitis (gingival index, bleeding on probing, probing depth, clinical attachment&#xD;
      level). Secondary outcomes are change in HbA1c and markers of systemic inflammation measured&#xD;
      by serum C-reactive protein, plasma TNF-a, and IL-6.&#xD;

          5. Have at least 16 natural teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have moderate to severe chronic periodontitis, defined by loss of clinical attachment&#xD;
             of &gt;5 mm on two seperate teeth, and no treatment within six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Able and willing to comply with study requirements including following instructions on&#xD;
