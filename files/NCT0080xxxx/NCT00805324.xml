    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness and safety of desloratadine (Aerius)&#xD;
      syrup in children with hayfever with or without asthma. Patients took desloratadine syrup&#xD;
      once a day for 28 days. Once a week, the doctor measured the patient's hayfever symptoms. The&#xD;
      doctor also rated how much relief the patient got from treatment and recorded any side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;

             participate in the study and comply with its procedures by signing an informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children must be free of any clinically significant disease (other than SAR) that&#xD;
             would interfere with study evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children's parent(s) or legal representative(s) must understand and be able to adhere&#xD;
             to dosing and visit schedules, agree to report concomitant medications and adverse&#xD;
             events to the Investigator or designee&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The diagnosis of seasonal allergic rhinitis with or without intermittent asthma will&#xD;
             be assessed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clinical history of sneezing, rhinorrhea (nasal discharge/running nose or&#xD;
                  post-nasal drip), nasal stuffiness/congestion and nasal itching and non-nasal&#xD;
                  symptoms (eye symptoms) as itching, burning, tearing and redness, during the&#xD;
                  previous pollen season&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ascertained skin prick positivity (or RAST positivity) to one of the following:&#xD;
                  grasses, parietaria, birch, hazelnut (the skin test has to be performed within&#xD;
                  the last year)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children must be clinically symptomatic with SAR at Visit 1 (day 1): the total (nasal&#xD;
             + non nasal) symptoms score must be &gt;= 8 with a nasal congestion score of &gt;= 2, and&#xD;
             the non-nasal symptoms severity score must be &gt;= 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Asthma symptoms (wheezing, cough, difficulty breathing, chest tightness) will be&#xD;
             evaluated at visit 1 (day 1) and graded only for child with concomitant asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children who have not observed the designated washout periods for any of the&#xD;
             prohibited medications&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Children who have nasal structural abnormalities, including nasal polyps and marked&#xD;
             septal deviation, that significantly interfere with nasal airflow&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are dependent upon nasal, oral or&#xD;
             ocular decongestants, nasal topical antihistamines, or nasal steroids&#xD;

             hepatic, renal, immunologic, neurologic, hematologic, gastrointestinal,&#xD;
             cerebrovascular or respiratory disease, or any other disorder which, in the judgment&#xD;
             of the Investigator, may interfere with the study evaluations or affect subject safety&#xD;
