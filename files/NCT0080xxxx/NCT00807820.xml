      This is a phase I study to evaluate the feasibility and safety of using MRI/MRS to identify&#xD;
      the dominant intraprostatic lesion (DIL) and to selectively boost the lesion using inverse&#xD;
      planned high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to exploit the ability of MRI/MRS to identify cancer regions within the&#xD;
      prostate or the dominant intraprostatic lesions (DIL). The imaging data will be combined with&#xD;
      the treatment planning CT images to define a treatment plan that will boost the dose&#xD;
      delivered to the DIL up to 150% of the prescribed dose. Dose to the whole prostate and the&#xD;
      dose delivered to adjacent organs will not change. This is accomplished by using inverse&#xD;
      treatment planning software that can focus normally occurring high dose regions within the&#xD;
      target volume to coincide with the DIL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment, each patient will have a MRI/MRS before starting treatment. Hormonal&#xD;
      therapy and external beam radiotherapy will be given based on current standard of practice.&#xD;
      During HDR brachytherapy, information about the location of tumor within the prostate will be&#xD;
      used to design the brachytherapy treatment plan. We will try to increase dose to DIL by&#xD;
      coincide existing high dose region on DIL using inverse planning software. Dose to prostate,&#xD;
      and adjacent structure will remain the same as the current treatment practice. Timing and the&#xD;
      delivery of brachytherapy will not change from our current practice. After the treatment,&#xD;
      each patient will remain on study and follow for 12 months and treatment toxicity will be&#xD;
      evaluated. A two-stage study design will be applied with a stopping rule for safety. Once a&#xD;
      patient comes off study he will be routinely followed for disease outcome and any late&#xD;
      toxicities.&#xD;

      1.1 The goal of radiotherapy is to deliver a high dose of radiation to the target volume&#xD;
      while minimizing the dose to the surrounding normal tissue. Using CT based three-dimensional&#xD;
      treatment planning system and multiple field technique, the three dimensional conformal&#xD;
      radiotherapy (CRT) has become the standard of care for external beam radiotherapy for&#xD;
      prostate cancer. Multiple institutional studies and prospective randomized trials have been&#xD;
      done documenting the safety and efficacy of this modality. Brachytherapy is an alternative&#xD;
      method of delivering conformal radiotherapy for treatment of prostate cancer. The technique&#xD;
      of HDR prostate brachytherapy has been in clinical practice since the 1980's [1-13]. Kovacs&#xD;
      et al reported one of the earliest experiences using HDR brachytherapy boost at University of&#xD;
      Kiel.[10, 11, 13] Patients treated were mostly T2b-T3, G3. They used a combination of split&#xD;
      course external beam radiotherapy and two 15 Gy HDR treatments. They reported 18% positive&#xD;
      biopsy rate 18 months post treatment. The result was updated at 10 years and 78 percent of&#xD;
      171 patients remained free of disease at median follow-up of 55 months. Mate et al at Swedish&#xD;
      Medical Center reported their experience with HDR brachytherapy [9]. They used a more&#xD;
      moderated hypofractionated schema with four treatments of 3-4 Gy fractions of HDR treatments&#xD;
      combined with 45-50 Gy of external beam radiotherapy. They recommended routine cystoscopy at&#xD;
      the end of the implant procedure to ensure the catheters are placed at the proper depth and&#xD;
      to avoid injuring the urethra. Pretreatment patient characteristics were stage T1b to T3c,&#xD;
      mean initial PSA was 12.9 and Gleason grade ranges 3 to 9. They reported 84% 5-year&#xD;
      biochemical disease free survival. Martinez et al at the William Beaumont Hospital reported&#xD;
      the only on-going prospective dose escalation trial using HDR brachytherapy as a boost. There&#xD;
      have been multiple updates of their results.[5-7, 12] They have continued to dose escalate&#xD;
      using increasingly larger fractions of HDR treatment range from 5.5-6.5 Gy x 3 to 8.25-11.5&#xD;
      Gy x 2 combined with 46 Gy of external beam radiotherapy. As of their most recent update,&#xD;
      they have shown acceptable toxicity level using 9.5 Gy x 2 treatments. Patients with PSA ≥&#xD;
      10, T ≥ T2b, and Gleason score ≥ 7 were selected for the trial. Despite a high frequency of&#xD;
      poor prognostic factors, the actuarial biochemical control rate was 89% at 2 years and 63% at&#xD;
      5 years. The 5-year actuarial rates of local failure and distant metastasis were 16% and 14%,&#xD;
      respectively. Borghede et al. at Goteborg University in Sweden reported their experience&#xD;
      using 50 Gy of external beam radiotherapy combined with 2 fractions of 10 Gy HDR boost.[1, 2]&#xD;
      They used ultrasound to target tumor nodules within the prostate and gave an additional 5 Gy&#xD;
      boost during each HDR treatment. Patients included in the study were T1-3, and grade 1-3.&#xD;
      They report a 4% positive biopsy rate at 18-months post treatment. This is a remarkably low&#xD;
      positive biopsy rate considering no hormonal therapy was used in the study. The results from&#xD;
      these clinical trials and others have shown the technique of HDR brachytherapy for prostate&#xD;
      cancer is feasible with minimal morbidity. Other institutional trials have suggested HDR&#xD;
      boost may be more efficacious compared to external beam radiotherapy alone or external beam&#xD;
      radiotherapy with short term hormonal therapy. Results of these studies need to be confirmed&#xD;
      in large multi-institutional trials.&#xD;
