      The purpose of this study is to determine the transcriptional signature of Notch Inhibition&#xD;
      by testing hair and blood samples on healthy male volunteers who have received MK0752 vs&#xD;
      placebo for possible future biomarkers in the treatment of cancer or Alzheimers Disease&#xD;
