  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial is a multicentre study conducted at 4 community-based&#xD;
      pharmacies within the Brazilian public health service, which freely distributes standardized&#xD;
      medicines. The group coordinator is located at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,&#xD;
      a public university at Porto Alegre.&#xD;

      Inclusion and exclusion criteria: Potential hypertensive subjects aged above 18 years and and&#xD;
      continuously receiving their medicines from the pharmacy are going to be identified through&#xD;
      administrative data sources. They must take at least hydrochlorothiazide, and have no&#xD;
      modifications on their hypertensive drug prescription on the last 2 months. Patients who have&#xD;
      a serious psychiatric disorder or a severe cognitive impairment, blindness, pregnancy or&#xD;
      secondary hypertension will be excluded. To be considered eligible, the patients should have&#xD;
      a mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure above 140 mmHg and 90 mmHg at the screening&#xD;
      visit if there were no COM morbidities associated, and above 130 mmHg and 80 mmHg for&#xD;
      high-risk patients, using the validated Omron Hern-705-CP upper arm automated monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategy/process by which participants/centres will be selected and recruited to the trial:&#xD;
      Research assistants will invite the potential subjects when they attend the pharmacy to take&#xD;
      their medicines or via telephone calls. By this moment, they will confirm eligibility and&#xD;
      proceed the BP measures. If eligible for the study, the participant will receive all the&#xD;
      trial explanations and the written informed consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: The random allocation will be stratified by gender through a&#xD;
      computer-generated sequence, individually for each centre. To maintain cancel allocation&#xD;
      status, opaque, numbered and sealed envelopes will be adopted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Three different kinds of pharmacist services will be adopted, with growing&#xD;
      complexity levels: drug dispensing, counseling and patient follow-up for 8 months. These&#xD;
      methods are part of the Brazilian pharmaceutical care agreement, developed on the year of&#xD;
      2002, and will be compared with the pharmacy usual care. Seven pharmacists and 12 students&#xD;
      were in charge of the pharmaceutical care program. All of them were trained in a 20&#xD;
      hour-course. Procedures details are written in a manual of operations, willing to standardize&#xD;
      the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: The primary outcomes are the BP differences between the one measured at 8-month&#xD;
      follow-up and the baseline BP and the adherence, determined by 2 ways: a) measurement of&#xD;
      plasma levels of hydrochlorothiazide, measured at the beginning and at the end of the study;&#xD;
      b) drugs refill along the 8-months prior the randomization and during the 8-months of the&#xD;
      trial. The occurrence of drug-related problems will be evaluated as a secondary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blindness: Open-label study. Sample size: The study was design to enroll 304 patients equally&#xD;
      distributed within the 4 centers, to provide 80% of statistical power to reject the null&#xD;
      hypothesis and an error of 5% (two-tailed). Sampling size was calculated on the basis of a&#xD;
      standard deviation of 10 mmHg, powered to detect clinically meaningful differences in mean&#xD;
      changes of 5 mmHg between usual care and the intervention arms at 8-months follow-up,&#xD;
      considering a 20% of drop-outs. Analyses will be conducted on intention-to-treat basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Statistics: To assess for any differences among the intervention groups, the baseline&#xD;
      characteristics will be compared performing Pearson χ2 test for categorical variables and F&#xD;
      tests for continuous variables, and Fisher Exact test or Kruskal-Wallis if necessary. For the&#xD;
      primary outcomes, the same tests will be applied. Analysis of covariance will be used when&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
