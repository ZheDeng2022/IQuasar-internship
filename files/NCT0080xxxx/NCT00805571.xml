  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if measuring the level of a protein called Kidney&#xD;
      Injury Molecule-1 (KIM-1) in the urine will help healthcare providers detect any problems&#xD;
      with the transplanted kidney before the laboratory investigations that are used on a routine&#xD;
      basis do. This approach may allow the doctor to intervene at an earlier point of a rejection&#xD;
      episode and may thereby prolong survival of the transplant kidney.&#xD;

      SPECIFIC AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the role of urinary Kim-1 excretion as a marker of delayed graft&#xD;
           function, acute kidney allograft rejection and/or virus-induced allograft nephropathy&#xD;
           and/or calcineurin-inhibitor nephrotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the role of urinary Kim-1 excretion in predicting long term outcome after&#xD;
           kidney transplantation compared to standard diagnostic tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the role of reduction in urinary Kim-1 excretion after a rejection episode&#xD;
           and/or viral infection as a marker of repair of renal tubules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of urinary KIM-1 in kidney transplant recipients will facilitate the detection of&#xD;
      delayed graft function, acute allograft rejection or infectious causes of proximal tubular&#xD;
      injury, allowing earlier intervention with better long-term graft survival. Detection of&#xD;
      urinary KIM-1 will precede increases in serum creatinine to detect acute graft injury and&#xD;
      urinary KIM-1 will decrease faster than serum creatinine and will predict responsiveness (or&#xD;
      lack thereof) to intervention more accurately.&#xD;

        Adult and pediatric patients with chronic renal failure who are listed at Mount Sinai&#xD;
        Hospital for a deceased donor kidney transplant and/or who are in the process of having a&#xD;
        living donor evaluation are eligible to participate. One urine sample will be sent for&#xD;
        KIM-1 measurement before transplantation, once the patient or the caregiver of the patient&#xD;
        consents to participation in the study. The next specimen of urine will only be collected&#xD;
        status post kidney transplant in the immediate post-operative phase and on routine visits&#xD;
        thereafter. The study does not require obtaining any extra blood or urine specimens, but&#xD;
        uses urine that would otherwise be discarded.&#xD;
