    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient is a candidate for repair of a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient has one or more of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Descending thoracic aneurysm, 5 cm in diameter or greater with proximal and&#xD;
                  distal neck suitable for stent graft placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aneurysm is 4-5 cm in diameter but has increased in size by 0.5 cm in last 6&#xD;
                  months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Maximum diameter of aneurysm exceeds one and one-half times the transverse&#xD;
                  dimension of an adjacent normal aortic segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Post-traumatic pseudoaneurysm&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Post-surgical pseudoaneurysm&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Saccular aneurysm&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Contained rupture&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Penetrating ulcer&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient's vascular dimensions must be in the range that can be safely treated with the&#xD;
             stent graft and extensions available to the physician at the time of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient has patent iliac or femoral arteries or acceptable retroperitoneal access via&#xD;
             the abdominal aorta that allow endovascular access to the aneurysmal site with a 23F&#xD;
             delivery catheter, typically used with a 25F introducer sheath&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has a non-aneurysmal proximal and distal aortic neck diameter between 25 and&#xD;
             36 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient is American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) grade 1 through 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient has a stage of disease or condition where there is no comparable or&#xD;
             satisfactory alternative device or therapy available for treatment; or the patient has&#xD;
             an immediately life-threatening disease in which there is a reasonable likelihood that&#xD;
             death will occur within a matter of months or in which premature death is likely&#xD;
             without early treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient is able and willing to comply with 1 month, 6 month, and 1 year follow-up, and&#xD;
             willing to comply with annual post-treatment follow-up requirements thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient or patient's legal representative understands and has signed an Informed&#xD;
             Consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The stent graft would have to be positioned such that there would be no flow to an&#xD;
             artery, major branch artery or major branch arteries which supply the spinal cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient has congenital abnormalities in which the placement of the stent graft&#xD;
             will cause occlusion of major arterial flow. Such abnormalities should be evaluated&#xD;
             prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient is pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient is morbidly obese or has other clinical conditions that severely inhibit X-ray&#xD;
             visualization of the aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has connective tissue disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient has a hypercoagulability disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient is in acute renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient has active systemic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient is less than 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patient has less than a one-year life expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patient is participating in another research study involving an investigational agent&#xD;
             for the treatment of Descending Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patient has other medical, social or psychological issues that in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator preclude them from receiving this treatment, and the procedures and&#xD;
             evaluations pre- and post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patient is unwilling or unable to return for or comply with follow-up visit schedules.&#xD;
