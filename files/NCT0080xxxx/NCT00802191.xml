      Purpose of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the Wii remote game control device for use in the&#xD;
      study of Movement Disorders. The term &quot;Movement Disorders&quot; refers to a group of abnormal&#xD;
      medical conditions characterized by involuntary body movements. Current treatment of these&#xD;
      disorders is primarily geared to improve symptoms. Rating scales are usually used to grade&#xD;
      response to treatment. These rating scales require special training, take a lot of time, and&#xD;
      often present with great variability. Thus, the development of a simple device to perform&#xD;
      efficacy measurements offers a great advantage over current methods and is less costly.&#xD;

      The expected length of taking part in this study will depend on whether or not subjects are&#xD;
      chosen for a group to look at the reproducibility of the data collected from the Wii remote.&#xD;
      If subjects agree to take part in the study, basic data including age, gender, ethnicity, and&#xD;
      medications will be collected. If subjects have been diagnosed with a movement disorder, that&#xD;
      diagnosis will also be recorded. This data will be secured in a HIPAA compliant computer&#xD;
      system and recorded data will be given a unique random code. During the Wii remote portion of&#xD;
      the study, subjects will be asked to hold the Wii remote controller in several different&#xD;
      positions and perform various movements with the controller.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Holding the controller still with the elbow straight and then the elbow bent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Tapping the control button as fast as you can.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rotation of your wrist as fast as you can.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Bending at the wrist and at the elbow as fast as you can.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Walking 30 feet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Attaching the controller to your arm with a Velcro strap and repeating the motions&#xD;
           performed while holding the controller.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These maneuvers will be done first with the right and then the left hand. We expect that this&#xD;
      series will take about 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If subjects have Parkinson's disease they will also be asked to undergo Part III (Motor&#xD;
      Sub-Scale) of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. This scale measures various&#xD;
      aspects such as finger tapping, hand opening and closing and walking on a scale of 0 - 4. We&#xD;
      expect that this portion of the examination will take about 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If subjects carry the diagnosis of Essential Tremor, they will be asked to undergo Standard&#xD;
      Measure of EssentialTremor that includes drawing of spirals and pouring of water from one&#xD;
      glass to another. Again, we estimate that this scale will take about 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If subjects carry the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease or Essential Tremor and have deep&#xD;
      brain stimulation surgery, results of using the Wiiâ„¢ Remote game controller (handheld or&#xD;
      attached using a Velcro strap) will be done during a clinical programming appointment. The&#xD;
      information obtained will not be used for any clinical use and will not interfere with the&#xD;
      normal standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sub-set of patients will be asked to repeat these measures at various times to see if there&#xD;
      is either a learning curve, or if the measures are repeatable over time. Subjects may decline&#xD;
      this at any point in time.&#xD;

          1. Men and women, aged 18 or older, with abnormal movements (including tremor, chorea,&#xD;
             dystonia, myoclonus, and tic) and normal controls (subjects without abnormal&#xD;
             movements).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects must be willing and able to comply with study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
