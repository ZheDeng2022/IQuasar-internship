  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Avodart (dutasteride) reduces the male hormone (DHT) that leads to prostate growth and&#xD;
      stimulates cancerous growth. Avodart is currently approved by the FDA to treat men with&#xD;
      symptoms of an enlarged prostate. Avodart works by reducing DHT and prostate size; therefore,&#xD;
      the drug may be useful in improving lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) such as frequency,&#xD;
      urgency, weak stream, and urination difficulty (dysuria), among others, in men with prostate&#xD;
      cancer. Avodart may be effective in men with prostate cancer who are being treated with&#xD;
      hormonal therapy with one injection of Zolodex (goserelin) followed one month later with a&#xD;
      trans-urethral incision of the prostate (TUIP), and three months after that, seed&#xD;
      implantation (SI) of the prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test whether Avodart (dutasteride) is effective on LUTS and&#xD;
      dysuria in men with localized prostate cancer being treated with single-dose goserelin, TUIP,&#xD;
      and interval SI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dutasteride is an inhibitor of the 5 alpha reductase type I and type II enzymes that convert&#xD;
      testosterone to DHT, the male hormone that leads to benign prostate growth and drives&#xD;
      malignant growth. Dutasteride has been shown to significantly decrease intraprostatic DHT in&#xD;
      men with localized prostate cancer, and additionally cause apoptosis and regression of some&#xD;
      prostate cancers [Andriole, 2004a; Andriole, 2004b]. Furthermore, reduction in tumor volume&#xD;
      has also been demonstrated in human prostate tissue [Iczkowski, 2004]. Dutasteride is&#xD;
      currently indicated to treat symptomatic BPH in men with enlarged prostates, but is also&#xD;
      being studied to reduce the risk of prostate cancer in men at risk (elevated PSA and previous&#xD;
      negative biopsy). Dutasteride is clinically useful at improving lower urinary tract symptoms&#xD;
      (LUTS) in men with clinically-localized prostate cancer and voiding difficulty being treated&#xD;
      with single-dose goserelin, TUIP, and interval SI. [Mitcheson, personal observation].&#xD;
