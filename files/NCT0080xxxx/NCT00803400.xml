  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of aerobic physical&#xD;
      exercise and alprazolam in patients with panic disorder has a better therapeutic response&#xD;
      than the treatment with alprazolam alone.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We have observed in our clinical practice that patients who practiced aerobic physical&#xD;
      exercise had faster remissions and better improvement in their treatments that those who did&#xD;
      not. There are also some scientific studies that included physical exercise in the treatment&#xD;
      for panic disorder and compared them to other single pharmacological treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So our objective will be to compare the efficacy of a pharmacological monotherapy&#xD;
      (alprazolam), that is one of the options for the pharmacological treatment of panic disorder,&#xD;
      with other treatment such as the combination of aerobic physical exercise and alprazolam, and&#xD;
      to determine if this combination results in a better therapeutic response.&#xD;

    <measure>Participants´Endpoint Change From Baseline in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale is a test that consists of 14 items measuring the severity of anxiety symptoms. Each item is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale, ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (severe).&#xD;
Each of the 14 items measure both psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical complaints related to anxiety)with a total score range of 0-56, where 17 indicates mild severity, 18-24 mild to moderate severity, and 25-30 moderate to severe.</description>

    <description>The Clinical Global Impression Severity scale is a 7 point ordinal scale that rates the severity of the patient's illness, assessing on the severity of a patient's mental illness. It ranges from 1 to 7 (1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline mentally ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 5, markedly ill; 6, severely ill; 7, extremely ill).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale is a 7 point ordinal scale that assesses how much the patient's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state before the intervention. Rated as: 1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse.</description>

Then, at the same visit, all the patients are indicated 4 mg of alprazolam. The dose is gradually increased from 1 to 4 mg along the first week of treatment. The test is repeated during weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12.</description>

    <description>The patients assigned to exercise have to pass an ergometric test to determine their functional capacity expressed in METs for future exercise indication.&#xD;
Two weeks after the first interview they have their first baseline psychiatric control and at the same time they are indicated a 4 mg dose of alprazolam, gradually increased from 1 to 4 mg along the first week of treatment. The test is repeated during weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12.&#xD;
Then they follow a protocolized aerobic exercise plan for this study during 12 weeks.&#xD;
The type of selected exercise consists of a rapid walk for 30 minutes divided in stages.&#xD;
After each stage the patient has to control his own heart frequency that has to be between 50 and 75% of their maximum to assure an aerobic condition (American Cardiological Association).</description>

        <title>Participants´Endpoint Change From Baseline in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale</title>
        <description>The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale is a test that consists of 14 items measuring the severity of anxiety symptoms. Each item is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale, ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (severe).&#xD;
Each of the 14 items measure both psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical complaints related to anxiety)with a total score range of 0-56, where 17 indicates mild severity, 18-24 mild to moderate severity, and 25-30 moderate to severe.</description>

          <title>Participants´Endpoint Change From Baseline in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale</title>
          <description>The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale is a test that consists of 14 items measuring the severity of anxiety symptoms. Each item is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale, ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (severe).&#xD;
Each of the 14 items measure both psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical complaints related to anxiety)with a total score range of 0-56, where 17 indicates mild severity, 18-24 mild to moderate severity, and 25-30 moderate to severe.</description>
