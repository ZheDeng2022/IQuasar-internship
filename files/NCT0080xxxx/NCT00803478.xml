  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Corneal sensation is known to play a role in tear secretion. Decreased sensation leads to&#xD;
      decreased tear production; and when bilateral, leads to a decreased blink rate as well. Dry&#xD;
      eyes are a common side effect of LASIK. Incidence rates vary widely, but have been reported&#xD;
      in as many as 59% of patients. And almost all patients have some transient dry eye symptoms&#xD;
      immediately following LASIK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have looked at the effect of hinge position (superior vs. nasal) and hinge&#xD;
      width on corneal sensation and dry eye after LASIK performed with a mechanical microkeratome.&#xD;
      Corneal sensation was decreased and dry eye signs and symptoms increased immediately&#xD;
      following LASIK in all eyes. These parameters then improved at all time periods between 1&#xD;
      week and 6 months post-operative. Loss of corneal sensation and dry eye signs and symptoms&#xD;
      were greater in eyes with superior-hinge flap than nasal-hinge flap, and in eyes with&#xD;
      narrower hinge flap rather than wider hinge flap IntraLase LASIK, using the IntraLase&#xD;
      femtosecond laser rather than a mechanical microkeratome to cut the corneal flap, has become&#xD;
      an increasingly popular procedure. It provides several advantages over mechanical&#xD;
      microkeratomes, including reduced surgical complications, more predictable flap thickness,&#xD;
      better astigmatic neutrality, decreased epithelial injury, and an ability to operate on a&#xD;
      wider range of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose this study to evaluate the effect of flap hinge size and flap&#xD;
      thickness in corneal flaps created with the IntraLase laser. The investigators would like to&#xD;
      determine if there is a difference from the previously discussed results found when using the&#xD;
      mechanical microkeratome. Also, with the increased ease of programming alternate hinge width&#xD;
      or flap thickness with IntraLase, if the investigators find a significant difference with an&#xD;
      alternate flap configuration, it might translate to a feasible change in clinical practice.&#xD;

      Corneal innervation/sensation is supplied by the long ciliary nerves which branch from the&#xD;
      trigeminal nerve. The nerves enter the cornea in the mid-stroma at the nasal and temporal&#xD;
      limbus. They then branch and turn anterior to form a dense plexus sub-Bowman's layer. The&#xD;
      nerves finally terminate in the wing cell layer from where they enervate the epithelium.&#xD;
      Corneal sensation has been shown to be decreased after all corneal surgeries, including&#xD;
      LASIK.&#xD;

      We propose this study to evaluate the effect of flap hinge position and size in corneal flaps&#xD;
      created with the IntraLase laser. We would like to determine if there is a difference from&#xD;

      Specific Aims: To evaluate the effect of hinge position (superior vs. temporal) , hinge width&#xD;
      (45 vs. 90 degrees), and flap thickness on corneal sensation and dry eye after IntraLase&#xD;
      LASIK.&#xD;
