      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cervical cancer is caused by persistent infection of the lining of the cervix with some&#xD;
           kinds of human papillomaviruses (HPV). These HPV infections are distantly related to the&#xD;
           viruses that cause warts on the skin. Like common wart viruses, most women who have&#xD;
           cervical infections with HPV resolve the infections within 2 years without any need for&#xD;
           treatment. Cervical infections that do not go away may cause disease that can turn into&#xD;
           cancer after many years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Only one study has been done in Nigeria to learn how many women have HPV infection. The&#xD;
           results of the study differed from most other studies in the world because older women&#xD;
           were much more likely to be infected. This study with learn whether the results found in&#xD;
           the previous study are true in Irun also, the site of the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the age distribution of HPV infection and relationship to cancer of the&#xD;
           cervix among Nigerian women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To understand how different screening methods, including HPV testing, could best reduce&#xD;
           the risk of cervical cancer in Nigerian women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Women residing in Irun, Nigeria, who are 15 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants complete a brief questionnaire related to demographics, household and&#xD;
           living conditions and a longer survey with questions related to reproductive history,&#xD;
           family history, illnesses, stressful life events and sexual history (U. of Michigan&#xD;
           collaboration).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants have a cervical examination, HPV test, Pap test and blood test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women whose tests show they are infected with HPV or have cervical disease will do the&#xD;
           following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  see a doctor and have cervical biopsies of all white abnormal areas (removal of a small&#xD;
           tissue sample from the cervix)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have photographs of the cervix taken&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have a cervical scraping for a new kind of HPV test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some women with normal test results are also asked to see a doctor to check the validity&#xD;
           of the testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women with cervical disease receive treatment by a specialist and remain in the program&#xD;
           until treatment is successfully completed or a final diagnosis is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may be contacted for followup up to 5 years after the final diagnosis is&#xD;
           made.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer, caused by persistent infection with approximately 15-20&#xD;
      genotypes of carcinogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, is the second leading cause&#xD;
      of female cancer. Cytology (Pap smears) and the new HPV vaccines are not widely available in&#xD;
      poor regions. Immediate treatment of HPV-infected older women by cryotherapy might have&#xD;
      greater impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the same HPV types cause cervical cancer everywhere, and the same stages (infection,&#xD;
      persistence vs. clearance, progression to precancer, and invasion) typify cervical&#xD;
      carcinogenesis, the patterns of age-specific prevalence of HPV vary widely. These patterns&#xD;
      are important for secondary prevention strategies relying on HPV DNA testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In many regions, including the US, HPV infections appear as classical sexually-transmitted&#xD;
      agents, with peak cervical DNA prevalence at young ages (approximately 20) and low prevalence&#xD;
      at older ages. However, in Nigeria, HPV prevalence is high (greater than or equal to 15%) at&#xD;
      all ages according to the one study performed in urban Ibadan by Franceschi s group at IARC&#xD;
      (n=932 women). This pattern is very uncommon. High prevalence at all ages would preclude use&#xD;
      of HPV testing in low-cost strategies, due to poor positive predictive value. One possibly&#xD;
      relevant element is the marital structure in Nigeria; a man often has multiple wives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: The major objectives are: 1) To estimate age-specific HPV prevalences in Irun,&#xD;
      Nigeria; 2) To investigate epidemiologic risk factors for HPV and cervical intraepithelial&#xD;
      neoplasia in this population; 3) To examine the performance of screening options; 4) To&#xD;
      assess the correlation of HPV among co-wives, comparing households with multiple wives with&#xD;
      those with single wives; and 5) To validate the performance of rapid HPV, an inexpensive HPV&#xD;
      test designed for public-sector use in settings like Irun.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY: All non-pregnant women aged 15+, without hysterectomy, will be eligible if they&#xD;
      can provide written informed consent. Unmarried women less than 21 will be enrolled only with&#xD;
      parental consent. Sexually active women will be examined and asked for cervical specimens;&#xD;
      self-reported virginal women will be asked for a 10-ml blood sample only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional screening study of 1500 women in Irun, a Nigerian village.&#xD;
      Unlike the IARC study, we will incorporate cytology, visual inspection, and colposcopic&#xD;
      biopsy of women that test positive by any of the three screening tests. We will determine&#xD;
      whether HPV infection at various ages is related to risk of cervical abnormalities. The&#xD;
      analyses will include descriptive trend data, multivariable modeling of HPV determinants, and&#xD;
      clinical epidemiologic analysis of relative screening test performance in detecting cervical&#xD;
      neoplasia.&#xD;
