  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, two-arm, 2-stage, Phase 2 study of NKTR-102 in patients&#xD;
      with metastatic or locally advanced platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 70 patients will be randomized 1:1 into one of two treatment arms. NKTR-102&#xD;
      will be administered at a dose level of 145 mg/m^2 in both arms. In Arm A, NKTR-102 will be&#xD;
      given on a q14d schedule. In Arm B, NKTR-102 will be given on a q21d schedule. After the&#xD;
      initial 70 patients have been enrolled, Arm B will enroll approximately 110 additional&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

    <measure>Primary: Objective Response Rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST): Primary Efficacy Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 6 weeks (± 5 days) from Cycle 1, Day 1 until documented disease progression, start of new therapy for cancer, death, or end of study (approximately 3 years and 11 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.0 based upon the best response as assessed by the Investigator. CR was defined by RECIST 1.1 as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have had reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR was defined by RECIST 1.1 as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters (SOD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SOD. The analysis was performed for patients in the Primary Efficacy Population.</description>

    <description>Best overall response was defined as the proportion of patients with a CR or a PR as assessed per GCIG criteria. The GCIG proposed the following definition for the date of progression which used both the RECIST and cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) criteria. &quot;A response according to CA-125 has occurred if there is ≥ 50% reduction in CA-125 levels from a pretreatment sample. The response had to be confirmed and maintained for at least 28 days. Patients can be evaluated according to CA-125 only if they had a pretreatment sample that was at least twice the upper limit of normal (ULN) and within 2 weeks prior to starting treatment.&quot; Analysis was performed in MITT Population.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>The study began with an initial Simon two-stage design in which patients were randomized 1:1 into one of two treatment schedules (145 mg/m2 q14d or q21d). During Stage 1, 20 patients were to be enrolled and treated in each schedule (q14d or q21d). If at least 1 response was observed in 20 evaluable patients within a treatment schedule, the treatment schedule would progress to Stage 2, where an additional 15 patients were to be enrolled for a total of 35 patients in the treatment schedule.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Primary: Objective Response Rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST): Primary Efficacy Population</title>
        <description>The ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.0 based upon the best response as assessed by the Investigator. CR was defined by RECIST 1.1 as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have had reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR was defined by RECIST 1.1 as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters (SOD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SOD. The analysis was performed for patients in the Primary Efficacy Population.</description>

The dose was reduced based on safety results from ongoing NKTR-102 Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies and the reduction was initiated with a waiver for study sites.</description>

          <description>Best overall response was defined as the proportion of patients with a CR or a PR per assessed per GCIG criteria. The GCIG proposed the following definition for the date of progression which used both the RECIST and CA-125 criteria. &quot;A response according to CA-125 has occurred if there is ≥ 50% reduction in CA-125 levels from a pretreatment sample. The response had to be confirmed and maintained for at least 28 days. Patients can be evaluated according to CA-125 only if they had a pretreatment sample that was at least twice the ULN and within 2 weeks prior to starting treatment.&quot; Analysis was performed in Prior PLD Therapy Population.</description>

          <description>CA-125 response was determined by having achieved a ≥50% reduction in serum levels of CA-125 from a pre-treatment level of at least twice the ULN within 2 weeks of starting treatment according to the GCIG criteria.

        <description>Duration of OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. Patients were followed until their date of death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent for further follow-up for survival, or final database closure.

Patients who did not have any follow-up since the date of randomization were censored at the date of randomization. Analysis was performed in Platinum-Refractory Population.</description>

            <description>NKTR-102 was administered as an IV infusion over 90 ± 10 minutes, on Day 1 of each 3-week [± 2 days] cycle at a dose of 170 mg/m^2 for the first 6 patients enrolled and at a dose of 145 mg/m^2 for the remainder of the patients.&#xD;
Note: NKTR-102 was administered at a dose level of 170 mg/m2 (10 patients enrolled and received this dose for 1 to 3 cycles) until the dose was reduced to 145 mg/m2 for all ongoing patients in the q14d and q21d treatment schedules and this became the starting dose for all newly enrolled patients. The dose was reduced based on safety results from ongoing NKTR-102 Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies and the reduction was initiated with a waiver for study sites and shortly thereafter included in Protocol Amendment 1.0 dated 26 Mar 2009.</description>
