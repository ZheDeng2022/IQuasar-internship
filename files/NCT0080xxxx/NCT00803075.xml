      The purpose of this study is to determine if it is safe and effective to use the TALENT AAA&#xD;
      Stent Graft System as a treatment for AAAs in patients who are also candidates for&#xD;
      conventional surgical aneurysm repair.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:1. Patient has one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aneurysm &gt;4 cm in diameter, or an aneurysm that has increased in size by 0.5 cm in the&#xD;
             last 6-months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aneurysm is 1.5 times larger than the diameter of the normal infrarenal aorta or&#xD;
             symptomatic&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aneurysm is saccular&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Penetrating ulcer 2. Patient's vascular dimensions must be in the range that can be&#xD;
             safely treated with the stent graft available to the physician at the time of the&#xD;
             procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Patient has endovascular access to the aneurysmal site with the Introducer Sheath&#xD;
             or Delivery Catheter of the appropriate ize device chosen for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Patient has anatomic characteristics suitable for endovascular repair. 5. Patient&#xD;
             has an immediate life-threatening disease of the abdominal aorta in which there is a&#xD;
             reasonable likelihood that death will occur within a matter of months or in which&#xD;
             premature death is likely without early treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Patient is American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) grade 1 through 4. 7. Patient&#xD;
             is able and willing to comply with 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and every year thereafter&#xD;
             post treatment follow-up requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Patient or patient's legal representative understands and has signed an Informed&#xD;
             Consent.&amp;#xA; Exclusion Criteria:1. Patient is pregnant or nursing. 2. Patient is&#xD;
             morbidly obese or has other clinical conditions that severely inhibit X-ray&#xD;
             visualization of the aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Patient has connective disease. 4. Patient is hypercoagulable. 5. Patient has&#xD;
             active systemic infection. 6. Patient is less than 18 years old. 7. Patient has less&#xD;
             than a one-year life expectancy. 8. Patient is unwilling or unable to return for&#xD;
             follow-up visits.&#xD;
