      In this between-subject randomized controlled trial the investigators will test the impact of&#xD;
      three novel structured financial incentives: atomistic, altruistic and team-based. These&#xD;
      incentive schemes will be used to motivate one month of daily use of software designed to&#xD;
      improve cognitive function (including memory, reaction times, attention and executive&#xD;
      function) among the elderly. The 400 participants will be members of retirement communities&#xD;
      in Pennsylvania. Three outcomes will be monitored and analyzed: activities completed using&#xD;
      the software (primary), performance on the activities, and changes in cognitive functioning.&#xD;
      This study is designed to be a pilot study. The investigators will have 90% power to find a&#xD;
      mean daily difference of 4 activities completed in the control group versus 7 activities&#xD;
      completed in the incentive groups assuming a standard deviation of 3.5 and an alpha of 0.017&#xD;
      (the bonferroni corrected significance level to account for multiple comparisons). In&#xD;
      addition during a three month &quot;follow-up period&quot; all participants will have continued access&#xD;
      to the software, however, no incentives will be provided for use. This period will be used to&#xD;
      assess the impact of the initial incentives on long run use after financial incentives have&#xD;
      ceased.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study, a 4-arm randomized control trial, tests three novel incentive systems&#xD;
      intended to promote the daily use of computer programs designed to improve memory and mental&#xD;
      acuity among residents of retirement communities. Three outcome measures will be used to&#xD;
      assess the effectiveness of the incentive programs: number of activities completed using the&#xD;
      software (primary outcome of interest), performance on the activities, and differences&#xD;
      between pre and post measures of mental acuity (using a standardized test of mental&#xD;
      functions). Incentives to use the software will be offered to individuals in the experimental&#xD;
      conditions for the first month of the 4 month study. After the initial month of incentives,&#xD;
      all individuals will have continued access to the software, however, no incentives will be&#xD;
      provided for use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incentives: Three incentive structures will be tested against one control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control: Access to software programs, but no rewards for use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Atomistic: Each individual is rewarded for his or her individual participation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Altruistic: Participants will be paired with an individual at a different retirement&#xD;
           community and will be rewarded according to the other individual's participation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Combination cooperative/competitive: Individuals will be paired in teams which will&#xD;
           compete against each other. Each team will be rewarded according to relative&#xD;
           participation, but members within a team will receive the same amount.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pairs will be matched on gender, age, and education, and then pairs will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to the different incentive conditions. Rewards in all incentive conditions will range to a&#xD;
      maximum of $5 per day, and will be awarded differently depending on the incentive condition.&#xD;
      Although participants will be informed of their winnings each day (to give frequent positive&#xD;
      reinforcement), they will be paid cumulated amounts once a month (to reduce transactions&#xD;
      costs and to ensure that actual payments are substantial). The number of activities completed&#xD;
      using the software (up to 10 daily, or approximately 30 minutes of use) will be the basis for&#xD;
      daily incentive payments to reward effort and avoid discouraging those who are not highly&#xD;
      skilled. Cognitive testing will be done with the NueroTrax Mindstreams cognitive testing&#xD;
      software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Roughly 400 participants will be recruited from local retirement communities which&#xD;
      offer computing services to their residents. Subjects will be between the ages of 55 and 85&#xD;
      and will be required to sign informed consent forms before they are admitted to the study.&#xD;
      Due to our focus on a population facing cognitive declines, extra care will be taken to&#xD;
      ensure that all participants understand the information provided in the informed consent&#xD;
      document. We will not enroll potential participants who are not able to verbalize&#xD;
      understanding of the contents of the consent form. Participants will be trained in basic&#xD;
      computer use and operation of the software using the Carnegie Mellon University mobile&#xD;
      research van (see http://www.cmu.edu/news/archive/2007/June/june20_datatruck.shtml).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will serve as the basis for a larger-scale study of financial incentives for&#xD;
      elderly individuals to engage in mentally challenging tasks that help them improve cognitive&#xD;
      function. In addition, this research will help us determine the relative effectiveness of&#xD;
      different types of incentive designs that could be used in further studies of the use of&#xD;
      financial incentives to encourage the elderly to engage in a variety of other healthy&#xD;
      behaviors.&#xD;
