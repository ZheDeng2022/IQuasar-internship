      The specific aim of this project is to determine the impact of this group therapy&#xD;
      intervention on improving adherence, coping, and functioning among children and adolescents&#xD;
      with disease processes requiring injections who experience injection-related&#xD;
      anxiety.Hypotheses include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. General psychosocial (quality of life) improvements from beginning to post-treatment as&#xD;
           well as maintenance of these improvements 2-4 weeks following the termination of&#xD;
           treatment for both youth and parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reduced injection-related anxiety from baseline to post-treatment as well as maintenance&#xD;
           of this improvement 2-4 weeks following the end of treatment for both youth and parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Reduced anxiety immediately following exposure to feared injection- related stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. For participants experiencing poor adherence to medical treatment, improvement in&#xD;
           adherence as reported by both parents and youth from baseline to post-treatment as well&#xD;
           as maintenance of these improvements 2-4 weeks following the end of treatment.&#xD;

      The proposed intervention protocol is a modification of an existing empirically developed&#xD;
      treatment (Self-Injection Anxiety Counseling) for adults with injection related anxiety who&#xD;
      rely on self-injection for illness management (Mohr, Cox, &amp; Boudewyn, 2003). Self-Injection&#xD;
      Anxiety Counseling (SIAC) was developed to assist psychologists and medical staff in working&#xD;
      with patients individually to develop strategies to reduce anxiety and increase an&#xD;
      individual's ability to self-inject. This treatment protocol has been found to result in&#xD;
      increased self injection in patients who experienced injection anxiety prior to undergoing&#xD;
      this treatment (Mohr, Cox, &amp; Merluzzi, 2005). Permission has been obtained from Dr. Mohr to&#xD;
      modify this treatment manual to be applied to youth in group setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This modified group protocol consists of five group sessions. The goals of the first session&#xD;
      include development of a group identity, psychoeducation, and physiological treatment of&#xD;
      anxiety though the instruction and practice of relaxation techniques. The second session&#xD;
      introduces a cognitive component to anxiety reduction and focuses on unhelpful thoughts and&#xD;
      strategies youth and caregivers can use to counteract these thoughts. The third session&#xD;
      implements the previously learned physiological and cognitive treatments through in vivo&#xD;
      injection practice. A registered nurse skilled in working with youth and caregivers on&#xD;
      self-injection will be present and active throughout this session and all infection control&#xD;
      procedures will be followed. Problem solving strategies are implemented in the fourth session&#xD;
      to reduce any difficulties encountered by participants as they practiced their injection goal&#xD;
      throughout the week. The fifth session will occur two weeks after the fourth session. This&#xD;
      extra week between sessions allows for additional practice and problem solving related to&#xD;
      injection goals. The last session reviews problem solving strategies and celebrates the&#xD;
      success of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevant outcomes for hypotheses testing will be measured before treatment, after completion&#xD;
      of treatment, and at follow-up; one measure of injection-related anxiety will be utilized&#xD;
      more frequently throughout the treatment.&#xD;
