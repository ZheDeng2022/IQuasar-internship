  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn what effects, good and/or bad, Everolimus has on&#xD;
      advanced urothelial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the study drug Everolimus can shrink&#xD;
      or slow the growth of urothelial cancer. The safety of this drug will also be studied. The&#xD;
      patients physical state, changes in the size of the tumor, and laboratory findings taken&#xD;
      while on-study will help us decide if Everolimus is safe and effective.&#xD;

    <description>Everolimus (RAD001) is a novel oral derivative of rapamycin. Everolimus will be administered orally as a once-daily dose of 10 mg (two 5 mg tablets) continuously from study day 1 until progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity. Patients will be instructed to take Everolimus in the morning, at the same time each day. Everolimus should be taken by the patient in a fasting state or with no more than a light fat-free meal.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, urethra,&#xD;
             ureter, or renal pelvis, with histological confirmation at MSKCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have progressive metastatic disease. Progressive disease will be defined&#xD;
             as new or progressive lesions on cross-sectional imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have at least one measurable site of disease (according to RECIST&#xD;
             criteria) that has not been previously irradiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have been previously treated, as defined by the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Treatment with at least one prior cytotoxic agent but not more than four prior cytotoxic&#xD;
        agents. Up to four prior chemotherapy agents are allowed, since conventional chemotherapy&#xD;
        ranges from just one drug (e.g., gemcitabine) to regimens that contain four agents (e.g.,&#xD;
        M-VAC is a four-drug regimen containing methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and&#xD;
        cisplatin).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The prior therapy must have included at least one of the following: cisplatin,&#xD;
             carboplatin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, or gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The prior cytotoxic agents may have been administered in the perioperative or&#xD;
             metastatic setting and may have been administered sequentially (e.g., first-line&#xD;
             treatment followed by second-line treatment at time of progression) or as part of a&#xD;
             single regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have pre-treatment tumor tissue available for analysis of m-TOR pathway&#xD;
             markers. One paraffin block or 10 freshly-prepared unstained slides (on positively&#xD;
             charged slides for immunohistochemistry) from the most representative single&#xD;
             paraffin-embedded tumor tissue block. Slides from the primary tumor are preferred. If&#xD;
             both the primary and metastatic tumor blocks are available, 10 slides from each of the&#xD;
             sites should be submitted. If tissue from the primary tumor is not available, a&#xD;
             paraffin block or unstained slides from a metastatic site are acceptable. Fine needle&#xD;
             aspirates (FNAs) have insufficient tumor tissue and are not permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 60%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate bone marrow function as shown by: ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L, Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L,&#xD;
             Hb &gt;9 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate liver function as shown by:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  INR &lt; 1.3 (or &lt; 3 on anticoagulants)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ALT and AST ≤ 2.5x ULN (≤ 5x ULN in patients with liver metastases)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate renal function: serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fasting serum cholesterol ≤300 mg/dL OR ≤7.75 mmol/L AND fasting triglycerides ≤ 2.5 x&#xD;
             ULN. NOTE: If a patient's lipid values exceed either one of these criteria upon&#xD;
             screening, the patient can only become eligible after successful initiation of&#xD;
             appropriate lipid-lowering medication. After lipid-lowering therapy, patients must&#xD;
             meet the same criteria - i.e. a fasting serum cholesterol ≤300 mg/dL OR ≤7.75 mmol/L&#xD;
             AND fasting triglycerides ≤ 2.5 x ULN - to be eligible for study treatment&#xD;
