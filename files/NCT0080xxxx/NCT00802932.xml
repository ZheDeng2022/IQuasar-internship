  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test metallic markers in the breast tissue after breast&#xD;
      conserving surgery and to observe the metallic markers' stability in the breast for use as&#xD;
      tumor bed markers and positioning devices for radiation treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to validate metallic marker placement and stability, patients will have the internal&#xD;
      metallic markers placed at the time of their last breast surgery (either lumpectomy or&#xD;
      re-excision for margins) by the surgeon and are permanent. They will undergo routine 3D&#xD;
      CT-based treatment planning and will receive routine radiation treatment to the whole breast&#xD;
      or partial breast as determined by the treating physician. Daily images of the breast will be&#xD;
      obtained throughout treatment using the online portal imaging system. These images will be&#xD;
      analyzed for the daily position of the metallic markers and compared across the entire course&#xD;
      of treatment to determine the stability of metallic markers placement and to assess their&#xD;
      efficacy as positioning devices for image guided radiation therapy.&#xD;

    <description>To validate that intraparenchymal metallic markers placed in the breast tissue can be used as stable markers throughout a course of radiation treatment for daily image guided localization. Image Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT) will be deemed feasible if the average shift in marker position results in deviations of up to 7 mm from the initial position.</description>
