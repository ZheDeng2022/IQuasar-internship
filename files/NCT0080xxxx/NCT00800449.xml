  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Haptoglobin (Hp) gene locus at chromosome 16q22 is polymorphic with two alleles denoted 1&#xD;
      and 2 .The gene product exists in three phenotypes: 1-1, 2-1, and 2-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Haptoglobin 2 allele is found only in man and is believed to have arisen from the&#xD;
      Haptoglobin 1 allele by a partial intragenic duplication. Haptoglobin 2 allele frequency is&#xD;
      higher than the Haptoglobin 1 allele. It has been hypothesized that the Haptoglobin 2 allele&#xD;
      was spread in man due to its selective advantage against life-threatening infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vitro, only the Haptoglobin 2 allele protein, binds to the streptococcus T antigen,&#xD;
      resulting in its aggregation and slowing its growth .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals homozygous for the Haptoglobin 1 allele (1-1 genotype) are more prone to the&#xD;
      streptococcal infection than individuals with the Haptoglobin 2 allele(2-1 or 2-2 genotype).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to explore the linkage between Hp phenotype and sepsis in pre-term&#xD;
      neonates, considering that in this early stage in life, genetic properties which provide a&#xD;
      defense against infectious agents will be of heightened importance.&#xD;

      The Haptoglobin (Hp) gene locus at chromosome 16q22 is polymorphic with two alleles denoted 1&#xD;
      and 2 .The gene product exists in three phenotypes: 1-1, 2-1, and 2-2. Hp 2 allele DM&#xD;
      individuals have larger myocardial infarctions than homozygous Hp 1 DM individuals. This may&#xD;
      be due to differences in the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of these&#xD;
      proteins.The same phenomenon was demonstrated in a murine coronary ischemia-reperfusion&#xD;
      model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Haptoglobin is an acute phase protein with anti-oxidant, bacteriostatic and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Haptoglobin 2 allele is found only in man and is believed to have arisen from the&#xD;
      Haptoglobin 1 allele by a partial intragenic duplication. Haptoglobin 2 allele frequency is&#xD;
      higher than the Haptoglobin 1 allele. It has been hypothesized that the Haptoglobin 2 allele&#xD;
      was spread in man due to its selective advantage against life-threatening infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vitro, only the Haptoglobin 2 allele protein, binds to the streptococcus T antigen,&#xD;
      resulting in its aggregation and slowing its growth .&#xD;
&#xD;
      We proposed that in individuals homozygous for the Haptoglobin 1 allele (1-1 genotype), the&#xD;
      streptococcal infection would be more severe than in individuals with the Haptoglobin 2&#xD;
      allele (2-1 or 2-2 genotype).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a severe outbreak of impetigo in two infantry units in the Israeli Defense Forces,&#xD;
      over 60% (57/91) of the soldiers developed impetigo caused by a single pathogen-group A&#xD;
      streptococcus. 33% of them developed serious life-threatening complications requiring&#xD;
      hospitalization. The risk of Haptoglobin 1-1 genotype individuals developing severe infection&#xD;
      was significantly higher than individuals with Haptoglobin 2 genotype (45.5% (5/11) vs. 17.5%&#xD;
      (14/80), risk ratio 2.6 (95% confidence interval 1.2-5.8), p=0.05). This supports the notion&#xD;
      that the Haptoglobin genotype determines the susceptibility to streptococcus infection, an&#xD;
      important pathogen early in human evolution, and explains the spread of Haptoglobin 2 allele&#xD;
      in human.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another study demonstrated that Diabetic dialysis patients at the age of 60 and above&#xD;
      carrying the Hp1-1 phenotype had a lower mortality rate compared to the patients who are&#xD;
      Hp2-2. However, younger population has shown the opposite. This can be explained by the&#xD;
      survivorship pattern of Hp1-1 diabetic patients who have lower risk for diabetic&#xD;
      complications. They will also survive dialysis in older age by suffering less from vascular&#xD;
      complications compared to Hp2-2. However, in Hp2-2 younger patients, the infectious parameter&#xD;
      is more significant and mortality will be lower.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We wish to explore the linkage between Hp phenotype and sepsis in pre-term neonates,&#xD;
      considering that in this early stage in life, genetic properties which provide a defense&#xD;
      against infectious agents will be of heightened importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study period of one year, all preterm neonates (a total of 150 preterm babies, 35&#xD;
      weeks or younger) admitted to the preterm unit at Carmel hospital will be typed for Hp&#xD;
      phenotype by a blood test. Hp phenotyping needs only about 500 microliters of blood which&#xD;
      will be taken during routine blood drawn. All blood samples will be identified with the&#xD;
      patient's I.D. number and name in addition to the study consecutive serial number. The blood&#xD;
      samples will be sent to the laboratory of vascular medicine in the faculty of medicine at the&#xD;
      Technion. If the number of participating infants during one year will be insufficient (less&#xD;
      than 150), we will ask for additional permission of the ethical committee to continue the&#xD;
      study for the second year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Septic neonates will be recognized by clinical deterioration (abnormal body temperature&#xD;
      and/or disturbed skin perfusion and/or apathy and/or increase in apnea/bradycardia episodes&#xD;
      and/or abnormal CBC, leukocytosis or leucopenia or left shift or thrombocytopenia) and&#xD;
      concomitant positive blood cultures, without another explanation of non infectious etiology.&#xD;
      Details of the bacteria including antibiotic resistance profile will be documented.&#xD;
      Demographic data will be collected for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition data regarding known pre-maturity complications such as Retinopathy of&#xD;
      Pre-maturity (ROP), Necrotizing Entero-Colitis (NEC), Broncho-Pulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) will&#xD;
      be assessed and documented according to the admission summary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood transport, Hp typing and data collection will be done by a MD student as part of her MD&#xD;
      thesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the informed consent, we will ask the permission for a possible follow up one year&#xD;
      after discharge from the hospital which will be done by a phone questionnaire and acquiring&#xD;
      the patients medical file data with the help of his family&#xD;
