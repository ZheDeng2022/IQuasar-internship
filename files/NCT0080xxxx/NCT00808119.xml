    <textblock>
      This is the first study to be conducted in humans for RTI-336, a new chemical entity, with&#xD;
      evaluations focusing on the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of RTI-336 following&#xD;
      administration of single, oral doses. RTI-336 is a novel dopamine transporter inhibitor of&#xD;
      the 3-phenyltropane class, and is currently being developed by RTI International as a&#xD;
      potential pharmacotherapy to treat cocaine dependence. Data from this study will be used to&#xD;
      plan and define dose ranges for subsequent studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cocaine abuse has been an epidemic in the United States since the mid- to late-1970s. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that a medication to treat cocaine addiction should have some, but not all, of&#xD;
      the behavioral pharmacological properties of cocaine. Substantial evidence links the euphoric&#xD;
      highs and addictive properties of cocaine to the inhibition of the dopamine transporter (DAT)&#xD;
      in the brain. Cocaine binds quickly and potently to this transporter and blocks the&#xD;
      presynaptic uptake of dopamine, resulting in subjective highs and reinforcing effects in both&#xD;
      preclinical studies and humans. Compounds that mimic the DAT-binding properties of cocaine&#xD;
      that are less stimulating and act with a slower receptor onset and offset may prove useful as&#xD;
      treatment for cocaine dependence. The 3-phenyltropane analog, RTI-336, is a potent and&#xD;
      selective DAT inhibitor that has demonstrated desirable pharmacological properties in&#xD;
      preclinical species and is an appropriate compound to test for its potential as a medication&#xD;
      to treat cocaine dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first study to be conducted in humans for RTI-336, a new chemical entity, with&#xD;
      evaluations focusing on the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of RTI-336 following&#xD;
      administration of single, oral doses, with the possibility of identifying the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose in humans. Data from this study will be used to plan for and define dose&#xD;
      ranges for subsequent studies.&#xD;
