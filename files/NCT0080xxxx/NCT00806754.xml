      -  The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the concomitant&#xD;
           administration of ciclesonide nasal spray and azelastine nasal spray versus ciclesonide&#xD;
           nasal spray alone in patients (18 years or older) with perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR)&#xD;
           not adequately controlled on an intranasal corticosteroid or antihistamine monotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The secondary objective is to investigate the safety of the concomitant administration&#xD;
           of ciclesonide nasal spray and azelastine nasal spray&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female, 18 years of age or older at the B0 Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. General good health, and free of any concomitant conditions or treatment that in the&#xD;
             investigator's judgment could interfere with study conduct, influence the&#xD;
             interpretation of study observations/results, or put the patient at increased risk&#xD;
             during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A history of PAR for a minimum of two years immediately preceding the Screening Visit&#xD;
             (B0). The PAR must have been of sufficient severity to require treatment(continuous or&#xD;
             intermittent) in the past with intranasal corticosteroids and/or antihistamines and,&#xD;
             in the investigator's judgment, experienced less than complete symptom alleviation on&#xD;
             this prior therapy. In addition, the patient is again expected to require treatment&#xD;
             throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A demonstrated sensitivity to at least one allergen known to induce PAR through a&#xD;
             standard prick test within one year of study start. A positive test is defined as a&#xD;
             wheal diameter at least 3 mm larger than the control (saline) wheal for the prick&#xD;
             test. Documentation of a positive result within 12 months prior to the Screening Visit&#xD;
             (B0) is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Females of childbearing potential currently using contraception must continue to use a&#xD;
             medically reliable method of contraception for the entire study duration(e.g. oral,&#xD;
             injectable, trans-cutaneous or implantable contraceptives or intrauterine devices or&#xD;
             double-barrier protection).Females who are not sexually active must agree to use&#xD;
             double-barrier protection should they become active during the course of the study.&#xD;
             Women of childbearing potential, or less than 1 year postmenopausal, will require a&#xD;
             negative plasma pregnancy test at the Screening Visit (B0). Females will be considered&#xD;
             to be of non-child-bearing potential and will not require a urine pregnancy test if at&#xD;
             least one of the following apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  More than one year post-menopausal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Had a hysterectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Had bilateral ovariectomy or salpingectomy or tubal ligation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has congenital sterility&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients on intranasal corticosteroids and antihistamines should be on a stable dose&#xD;
             for at least 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must complete a 24-hour reflective total nasal symptom assessment at the&#xD;
             Screening Visit (B0) and score a total of 6 or greater (out of 12).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnancy, nursing, or plans to become pregnant or donate gametes (ova or sperm) for&#xD;
             in vitro fertilization during the study period or for 30 days following the study&#xD;
             period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of physical findings of nasal pathology, including nasal polyps (within the&#xD;
             last 60 days) or other clinically significant respiratory tract malformations, recent&#xD;
             nasal biopsy (within the last 60 days), nasal trauma, or surgery and atrophic rhinitis&#xD;
             or rhinitis medicamentosa (within the last 60 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participation in any investigational drug trial within the 30 days preceding the&#xD;
             Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A known hypersensitivity to any intranasal corticosteroid, antihistamine or any of the&#xD;
             excipients in the formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of a respiratory infection or disorder [including, but not limited to&#xD;
             bronchitis, pneumonia, the common cold, acute or chronic sinusitis, flu, severe acute&#xD;
             respiratory syndrome (SARS)] within the 14 days preceding the Screening Visit, or&#xD;
             development of a respiratory infection during the Screening Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of alcohol or drug abuse within the preceding two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of a positive test for HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Active asthma requiring treatment with inhaled or systemic corticosteroids and/or&#xD;
             routine use of b-agonists; intermittent use of b-agonists is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Use of any prohibited concomitant medications within the prescribed (per protocol)&#xD;
             time since last dose period prior to the Screening Visit (B0) and during entire&#xD;
             treatment duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Use of antibiotic therapy for acute conditions within 14 days prior to the Screening&#xD;
             Visit (B0). Low doses of antibiotics taken for prophylaxis are permitted if the&#xD;
             therapy was started prior to the Screening Visit AND is expected to continue&#xD;
             throughout the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Initiation of immunotherapy during the study period or dose escalation during the&#xD;
             study period. However, initiation of immunotherapy 90 days or more prior to the&#xD;
             Screening Visit AND use of a stable (maintenance) dose (30 days or more) may be&#xD;
             considered for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Non-vaccinated exposure to or active infection with, chickenpox or measles within the&#xD;
             21 days preceding the Screening Visit (B0).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Exposure to systemic corticosteroids for any indication, chronic or intermittent&#xD;
             (e.g.: contact dermatitis), during the past 2 months, or presence of an underlying&#xD;
             condition that can reasonably be expected to require treatment with corticosteroids&#xD;
             during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Use of topical corticosteroids in concentrations in excess of 1% hydrocortisone for&#xD;
             dermatological conditions during the past 1 month, or presence of an underlying&#xD;
             condition that can reasonably be expected to require treatment with such preparations&#xD;
             during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. History of epilepsy or seizures (excluding febrile seizures).&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. History of coronary artery disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or other clinically&#xD;
             significant cardiovascular disease.&#xD;

             corticosteroid and antihistamine).&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Have any of the following conditions that are judged by the investigator to be&#xD;
             clinically significant and/or affect the subject's ability to participate in the&#xD;

             implementation of the protocol or interpretation of the study results difficult:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Impaired hepatic function including alcohol-related liver disease or cirrhosis;&#xD;
