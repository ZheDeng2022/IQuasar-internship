  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At Tata Memorial Hospital 50% of the patients present in the locally advanced stage which is&#xD;
      technically unresectable, or that is beyond the realm of a potentially curative surgical&#xD;
      resection. The evaluation of treatment approaches for these tumors is hampered by the absence&#xD;
      of any substantial randomized studies and the heterogeneous nature of the tumors at&#xD;
      presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of these tumors has changed over the years, there is emphasis on neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemoradiation therapy, trying to convert a tumor that is initially unresectable to one that&#xD;
      is potentially curable by surgery. But only 70-80% of the patients are able to complete this&#xD;
      treatment without any significant treatment breaks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalated treatment with radiotherapy in locally advanced and unresectable rectal&#xD;
      cancers have been tried in many small series with good results and lesser toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison outcome between the two arms will indicate the relative efficacy and toxicity of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiation vs boosted radiotherapy alone in downstaging of&#xD;
      advanced cancers.&#xD;

      Aims/ Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the resectability rate when patients are treated when conventional&#xD;
           chemoradiation to patients treated with radiation alone with an additional boost to the&#xD;
           primary tumor in case of unresectable rectal cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study the treatment toxicity and local control rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study methodology This is a phase II Randomised controlled study. Ninety cases of advanced&#xD;
      rectal cancer (Stage II - Stage III) will be divided in two equal groups (Arm I &amp; II)&#xD;
      Arm-1(standard arm) - Patients will receive standard external radiation therapy to pelvis +&#xD;
      concurrent chemotherapy with Tab Capecitabine. This will be followed by surgery at 6-8 weeks&#xD;
      if deemed resectable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm-2 (research arm) Patients in this group will not receive any neo-adjuvant chemotherapy,&#xD;
      instead they will receive radiotherapy alone additional dose of localized radiotherapy boost.&#xD;
      This will be followed by surgery at 6-8 weeks if deemed resectable.&#xD;

    <description>Radiation dose to pelvis will be delivered at 1.8 Gy per day, five days per week, to give a total of 25 fractions over a period of five weeks for a total of 45 Gy.&#xD;
Boost Field - Will be given to all the patients in the radiotherapy alone followed by surgery arm.&#xD;
The boost will be given with by 3dimensional conformal radiotherapy to a dose of 15-20 Gy. After 45Gy the boost will be planned on the original tumor volume.</description>

Chemotherapy will begin on the first day of radiotherapy and continue until the completion of radiotherapy. Capecitabine will be administered orally daily 2000 mg/m2 in two divided doses (approximately 12 hours apart) for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period given as 3 week cycles.</description>
