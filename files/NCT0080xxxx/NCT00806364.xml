      This protocol is designed to provide blood, buccal mucosa and bone marrow aspirate samples&#xD;
      from approximately 250, healthy volunteer donors for use in in vitro studies of mast cells,&#xD;
      mastocytosis, and allergic diseases. Non-atopic donors will be recruited to donate blood,&#xD;
      bone marrow, and/or buccal mucosa samples using conventional techniques. The investigational&#xD;
      nature of the studies in which their blood, bone marrow and buccal mucosa samples will be&#xD;
      used, as well as the risks and benefits of the donation process will be explained to all&#xD;
      donors, and a signed informed consent document will be obtained. Donors will be compensated&#xD;
      according to an established schedule based on the duration and discomfort of the donations.&#xD;
      Samples provided through this protocol will be used solely for in vitro research. Blood, bone&#xD;
      marrow, and buccal mucosa samples will be assigned a unique product number and the study&#xD;
      investigators listed on this protocol will serve as the custodians of the code that links the&#xD;
      product with a donor s identity. The nature of the in vitro studies in which the blood&#xD;
      collected in this study will be used is not the subject of this protocol and will be&#xD;
      described in general terms only. The samples will be used in several Institutional Review&#xD;
      Board (IRB)-approved Laboratory of Allergic Diseases (LAD) protocols. This protocol is&#xD;
      designed to assure adequate and complete informed consent, counseling, and protection of the&#xD;
      study subjects according to IRB, Office of Human Subjects Research (OHSR), Office for Human&#xD;
      Research Protections (OHRP) and other applicable Federal regulatory standards.&#xD;

      This protocol is designed to provide blood, skin, stool/rectal swabs, buccal mucosa and bone&#xD;
      marrow aspirate samples from approximately 250 healthy volunteer donors for use in in vitro&#xD;
      studies such as studies of cells of the immune system, mastocytosis, and allergic diseases.&#xD;
      Participants will donate samples using conventional techniques. The investigational nature of&#xD;
      the studies in which samples will be used, as well as the risks and benefits of the donation&#xD;
      process, will be explained to all donors, and a signed informed consent document will be&#xD;

        -  PARTICIPANT INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ability to sign informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy male or female between 18-65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Willing to have samples stored for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        PARTICIPANT EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of an immune deficiency, such as HIV infection or cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of chronic hepatitis B and/or C infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of chronic anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A known clotting disorder or taking medications that interfere with blood clotting, such&#xD;
        as: aspirin, heparin, or Coumadin*&#xD;
&#xD;
        Current pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have taken an investigational drug in the last 6 months that may affect the normal process&#xD;
        of blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any condition that in the view of the principal investigator (PI) would make the subject&#xD;
        unsuitable for enrollment in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        * Coumadin and/or heparin treatment will not be stopped so that a subject can participate&#xD;
        in this protocol. If Coumadin or heparin was recently discontinued, a subject can be&#xD;
        enrolled, but no bone marrow procedures will be performed until the PT and the PTT are&#xD;
        within normal range. For other agents that interfere with blood clotting without prolonging&#xD;
        the PT, a 7-day washout period will be required before bone marrow sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        BONE MARROW PROCEDURE EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        hemoglobin less than the NIH Clinical Center Clinical Research Information System (CRIS)&#xD;
        normal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Platelets less than 100,000/mm(3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        PT or PTT greater than the NIH Clinical Center CRIS normal range&#xD;
&#xD;
        Positive b-HCG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EKG changes suggestive of cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        unable or unwilling to have bone marrow biopsy performed without use of conscious sedation,&#xD;
        and use of only local anesthetic during procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any other lab value which may put the subject at risk during the procedure.&#xD;
