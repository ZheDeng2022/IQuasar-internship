    <textblock>
      This study is investigating how commonly exercise-induced asthma happens in athletes and the&#xD;
      best way to diagnose exercise-induced asthma. Exercise-induced asthma describes narrowing of&#xD;
      the airways in the lungs that occurs in certain people when they exercise. This can cause&#xD;
      shortness of breath, cough, and fatigue during exercise and can impair athletic performance.&#xD;
      Exercise-induced asthma can be difficult to diagnose. This is a research study, because the&#xD;
      investigators are examining the best way to document a diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma.&#xD;
      The investigators are also interested in examining why exercise-induced asthma may occur.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      prospective, cohort study of the prevalence of asthma in select athletic teams at a large,&#xD;
      collegiate athletic program as documented by self-report versus lung function testing.&#xD;
      Athletes from men's and women's ice hockey, soccer, and lacrosse will be studied. Each&#xD;
      athlete will indicate via self-report on questionnaires whether they have asthma, and then&#xD;
      subsequently will be tested utilizing specialized lung function testing. These teams were&#xD;
      chosen, because it will allow for gender-matching across teams and they had subjectively&#xD;
      reported asthma prevalence rates based on prior pilot data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Varsity athlete on athletic team of interest here at The Ohio State University&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. No short-acting bronchodilator use for 6 hours prior to testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. No long-acting bronchodilator use for 36 hours prior to testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. No inhaled corticosteroids or leukotriene modifiers for 72 hours prior to testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Non-smoker for 6 months or longer&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Less than 10 pack year (number of packs per day (x) years of smoking=pack years) smoking&#xD;
           history, as smoking causes chronic changes in the profile of inflammatory cells of lungs&#xD;
           and also makes airways more likely to spasm. This is true even for non-smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. recent upper respiratory tract infection (within 2 weeks of study enrollment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Objective evidence of severe lung impairment on pulmonary testing performed at the&#xD;
           beginning of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Participation in another interventional research trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Unable to provide consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Asthma exacerbation within the last 4 weeks&#xD;
