  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Indo-Asian developing countries are facing an epidemic of chronic diseases including&#xD;
      hypertension, diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Diagnosis of early CKD is essential&#xD;
      for institution of effective and timely prevention of its complications; costly late stage&#xD;
      treatment for end stage renal disease is currently an unfeasible option in these populations.&#xD;
      GFR estimates of kidney function provide a common reference standard for all people and are&#xD;
      therefore readily applicable by physicians and understood by patients. However, the existing&#xD;
      GFR equations yield widely discrepant results in the Indo Asian population, and none of the&#xD;
      currently available estimating equations have been validated in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to develop a tool which can be used for screening subjects at high risk&#xD;
      for developing CKD (with hypertension and diabetes) as well as the general population.&#xD;

      The proposed study is being conducted at the Aga Khan University in collaboration with&#xD;
      Tufts-New England Medical Center and Imperial College, UK. It is a population based&#xD;
      cross-sectional study using a 2-stage cluster design. The study would be performed on 650&#xD;
      adult subjects from the general population in Karachi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new GFR equation specific to a Pakistani population would be developed and validated using&#xD;
      the gold standard of measured Insulin GFR. The performance of the new equation will be&#xD;
      compared to the existing ones developed in other populations with respect to bias, precision,&#xD;
      and accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is likely to contribute significantly to moving the field to kidney disease&#xD;
      forward, and its results are likely to have far reaching implications for understanding of&#xD;
      CKD and, ultimately, its prevention in Indo-Pakistani populations worldwide.&#xD;

        All individuals aged aged 40 years and above in a representative sample of Karachi&#xD;
        Demographic Survey constituted the sampling frame. Individuals were screened for&#xD;
        hypertension and diabetes and the final sample of about 650 subjects will be randomly&#xD;
