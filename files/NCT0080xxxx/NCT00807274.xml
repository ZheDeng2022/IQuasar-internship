      Impaired kidney function is associated with a poor outcome in patients with heart failure but&#xD;
      it is not known of this is the case for patients who have been born with their heart&#xD;
      condition (congenital heart disease). This study aims to investigate how frequently patients&#xD;
      with congenital heart disease have kidney disease and whither this does have an impact on&#xD;
      their outcome. The hypothesis is that kidney dysfunction will be common in these patients and&#xD;
      may have an impact on long-term health and life-expectancy.&#xD;

      Renal dysfunction is a recognised independent prognosticator in patients with chronic heart&#xD;
      failure. Indeed it has been suggested that the clinical impact of renal dysfunction may be&#xD;
      greater than that of left ventricular ejection fraction per se.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of renal function has also been investigated in small sub-groups of patients with&#xD;
      adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) for example peri-operatively. It is not however known&#xD;
      if renal dysfunction has the same prevalence and significance as when present to patient with&#xD;
      acquired heart failure. The hypothesis of the study is that renal dysfunction, both overt and&#xD;
      sub-clinical, will be commonly detected in patients with congenital heart disease. The study&#xD;
      proposes that renal dysfunction will be associated with hospitalisation for heart failure and&#xD;
      fluid overload and will also identify patients at an increased risk of worsening clinical&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons: Baseline renal function (creatinine, glomerular filtration rate by equation and&#xD;
      clearance testing), quantification of urinalysis, baseline neurohormones. Follow-up data&#xD;
      regarding clinical endpoints including new arrhythmia, functional deterioration, and&#xD;
      hospitalisation.&#xD;
