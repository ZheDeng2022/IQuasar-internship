      A critical first step to address the &quot;pharmacodynamic information gap&quot; in pediatrics resides&#xD;
      with the development of methods capable of accurately measuring the time dependent effects of&#xD;
      xenobiotic exposure in a manner sufficient to enable an integrative analysis of drug action&#xD;
      which incorporates both pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic determinants. The proposed study&#xD;
      will evaluate laser Doppler flowimetry, a necessary initial step in developing an &quot;ideal&quot;&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic surrogate endpoint that ultimately could be used in infants, children and&#xD;
      adolescents to fully characterize the impact of development on the pharmacokinetic (PK) /&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic (PD) / pharmacogenetic (PG) determinants of drug effect for agents capable of&#xD;
      modulating the cellular response to histamine.&#xD;

      The overall goal of this research is to develop and validate non-invasive approaches suitable&#xD;
      for use in pediatrics that are sufficient to directly evaluate genotype-phenotype&#xD;
      associations as determinants of the concentration-effect profile of drugs capable of altering&#xD;
      microvascular function. The specific goal of this project will be to assess whether&#xD;
      microvascular blood flow determined by a previously validated laser Doppler technique can be&#xD;
      used as a reliable surrogate endpoint capable of functionally discriminating the effects of&#xD;
      polymorphisms in the genes which are quantitatively important for histamine&#xD;
      biotransformation. The investigators hypothesize that microvascular blood flow velocity can&#xD;
      be used as a valid surrogate marker to discriminate the functional consequences of allelic&#xD;
      variants in the enzymes primarily responsible for the biotransformation of histamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project includes two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Validation of histamine iontophoresis (with measurement of microvascular blood flow by&#xD;
           laser Doppler flowimetry) in a pediatric cohort as a pharmacologic provocation test&#xD;
           capable of reliably characterizing the normal physiologic response of the cutaneous&#xD;
           microvasculature to this xenobiotic addressed by a study in 50 children with a diagnosis&#xD;
           of allergic disease or other &quot;allergic&quot; conditions where treatment with antihistamines&#xD;
           represents the medical &quot;standard of care&quot;. Subjects will concomitantly (on contralateral&#xD;
           extremities) receive histamine challenges by the &quot;gold standard&quot; cutaneous prick test&#xD;
           (time dependent response assessed by serial assessment of wheal and flare reactions) and&#xD;
           by a previously described iontophoresis technique (time dependent response by serial&#xD;
           assessment of microvascular blood flow using a validated laser Doppler&#xD;
           technique).Additionally, DNA will be isolated from these subjects for genotyping as&#xD;
           described in part 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assessment of microvascular response to histamine challenge as a surrogate marker&#xD;
           capable of functionally discriminating genotype-phenotype associations for&#xD;
           polymorphically expressed genes that are quantitatively important in regulating the&#xD;
           biotransformation and pharmacologic inactivation of histamine addressed first by&#xD;
           genotyping 150 additional subjects who have an established diagnosis of allergic disease&#xD;
           where treatment with antihistamines represents the medical &quot;standard of care&quot;. Genotype&#xD;
           data for candidate genes of primary interest, histamine-N-methyltransferase (HNMT) and&#xD;
           diamine oxidase (DAO), will thus be available from a total of 200 subjects. Based upon&#xD;
           known genotype-phenotype associations for HNMT (the enzyme primarily responsible for&#xD;
           histamine biotransformation), two cohorts of subjects will be selected from those&#xD;
           studied using an extreme discordant phenotype approach: subjects predicted, based upon&#xD;
           genotype, to have reduced HMNT activity (i.e., those with 1 or 0 functional alleles) and&#xD;
           subjects predicted to have normal enzyme activity (i.e., those with two functional&#xD;
           alleles). These study participants will then receive a transcutaneous histamine&#xD;
           challenge delivered by iontophoresis, followed by repeated assessment of microvascular&#xD;
           reactivity reflected by time-averaged measurement of blood flow velocity using an&#xD;
           established laser Doppler technique. Statistical analysis of blood flow velocity and&#xD;
           other parameters from the laser Doppler assessment will be used as the primary outcome&#xD;
           measurement for comparison of the two study cohorts with respect to expression of HNMT&#xD;
           and DAO and the functional consequences thereof, using histamine response as the&#xD;
           surrogate assessment of phenotype.&#xD;
