    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety of giving the experimental drug, resiniferatoxin (RTX), to&#xD;
      treat severe pain in patients with advanced cancer. RTX is a chemical extracted from a&#xD;
      cactus-like plant. It is similar to capsaicin, the active ingredient in hot pepper. RTX has&#xD;
      relieved pain and reduced the need for pain medication in several animal experiments. It&#xD;
      works by destroying nerves that transmit pain information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People at least 18 years of age with severe pain from advanced cancer at or below the level&#xD;
      of the chest that cannot be controlled with standard treatments may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pretreatment Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before beginning treatment with RTX, patients give a medical history and undergo a physical&#xD;
      examination that includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram (EKG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urinalysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurological examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urology assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test, when appropriate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires to collect information on health, personality, mood, pain levels and&#xD;
           symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2-Day Hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are hospitalized for 2 days for RTX injection and monitoring, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RTX injection: RTX is injected in the operating room under general anesthesia. It is&#xD;
           given through a catheter placed in the patient s spine. The catheter is also used to&#xD;
           obtain samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) the clear fluid that bathes the spinal cord.&#xD;
           The fluid is examined to assess drug effects and side effects, chemical changes in the&#xD;
           content of the CSF associated with RTX, and how RTX is handled by the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-injection monitoring, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surveys about symptoms such as pain or weakness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurological examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and CSF sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EKG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AEs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatient followup&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vitals&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw, Urinalysis, neurological and sensory testing, EKG on days 7, 14 and 30 after&#xD;
           the injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI scans of the head and back, Urology assessment and PEFR on day 15 after the&#xD;
           injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up phone calls monthly for 6 months&#xD;

      Pain continues to be a major problem in patients with advanced cancer. Resiniferatoxin (RTX),&#xD;
      a potent member of the family of drugs that includes capsaicin, selectively and irreversibly&#xD;
      destroys the neurons (or their axons) transmitting chronic pain sensation. Intrathecal&#xD;
      injection of RTX in several animal species has demonstrated a high level of safety,&#xD;
      specificity, and efficacy in treating severe pain. This first-in-human, dose-escalation study&#xD;
      will investigate the intrathecal administration of RTX in cancer patients with severe pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the safety and efficacy of RTX administered intrathecally in subjects with&#xD;
      severe refractory pain associated with advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 45 subjects will be accrued. Eligible subjects will be greater than or equal to 18&#xD;
      years of age, have a clinical and histological diagnosis of advanced malignancy, and have&#xD;
      severe pain due to malignancy that is at or below the level of the chest and not adequately&#xD;
      relieved by other pain control therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single site, non-randomized, open-label, dose-escalation study using a modified&#xD;
      Fibonacci scheme. The starting dose of RTX was 13 micrograms given as a 2 mL injection via an&#xD;
      intra-spinal catheter over approximately 30 seconds followed by a 1 mL flush. Six subjects&#xD;
      were dosed at this level and 3 were dosed at the 26 g dose level at the same volume of&#xD;
      injectate, flush and injection time. Pursuant to the study design, RTX doses were to be&#xD;
      increased in progressively smaller percentage increments with each dose escalation to occur&#xD;
      in sequential groups of 3 subjects until 1 escalation above the effective dose in 100% of&#xD;
      subjects (ED100), completion of the 100 g dose level, or establishment of the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD), whichever occurs first. The total duration of study participation for&#xD;
      any subject will received a dose of 26 micrograms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amended RTX injection technique reduced the injection volume and increased the injection&#xD;
      time to reduce spread of RTX to above the T6 (sixth thoracic) vertebral level. The present&#xD;
      rechnique is a 1 mL injection over 60 seconds (0.25 mL/15 seconds) given via infusion pump,&#xD;
      followed by flushing of the IT catheter with the minimum volume of sterile, preservative-free&#xD;
      saline necessary to clear the internal volume of the catheter used for the injection. Three&#xD;
      patients were treated at the new starting dose of 13 micrograms with the new injection&#xD;
      technique. The next 3-patient cohort at this dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study outcome is the ED100, the MTD, or the maximum dose administered, whichever&#xD;
      is achieved first during dose escalation. The primary pain variable for determining the ED100&#xD;
      is the daily worst pain score averaged over a 7-day period during the 3 weeks before RTX&#xD;
      dosing and during Days 8 through 14 after dosing. The numerical rating scale (NRS),&#xD;
      administered verbally during a daily telephone interview, will be the primary pain assessment&#xD;
      instrument. For a given subject, the treatment will be considered effective if the subject&#xD;
      experiences a greater than or equal to 50% reduction in the mean daily worst pain score&#xD;
      assessed by NRS (evaluated at Study Day 15). We may also consider RTX treatment to be&#xD;
      successful if there is greater than or equal to 50% reduction in opiate intake, measured by&#xD;
      morphine milligram equivalents (MME) per day, even if pain levels are unchanged after RTX&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures will be other surveys of pain, including an assessment of worst&#xD;
      daily pain by the visual analog scale, and assessments of function and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments will include hematology; serum clinical chemistry tests; cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid examinations; physical, neurological, and eye examinations; reporting of adverse&#xD;
      events; electrocardiograms; and findings of magnetic resonance imaging of the spine and&#xD;
      brain.&#xD;

             tolerated, and/or refused by the subject, as determined by the Pain and Palliative&#xD;

             30-day follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Medical clearance from referring physician consisting of a statement indicating an&#xD;
             adequate recovery period from other previous trials/medication.&#xD;

             inclusion in&#xD;
&#xD;
        the study by 3 separate persons:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Principal Investigator (PI) or an Associate Investigator (AI)&#xD;

             thromboplastin time (PTT) less than or equal to the upper limit of the reference&#xD;
             range. The INR and PTT may be corrected (e.g., by administration of blood products,&#xD;
             vitamin K, etc.), provided a repeat blood draw confirms that the values meet this&#xD;

             prior to dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             11. Ability to stop any anticoagulant (e.g., Coumadin) and antiplatelet therapies&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  hormonal contraception (birth control pills, injected hormones, or vaginal ring),&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  intrauterine device,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  barrier methods (condom or diaphragm) combined with spermicide, or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, tubal ligation, or vasectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
             15. Availability of a responsible adult to provide assistance with activities of daily&#xD;
