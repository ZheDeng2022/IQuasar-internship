  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Diabetic neuropathy is one of the most common complications of Diabetes Mellitis&#xD;
      (DM). Pain is a common symptom of diabetic neuropathy, affecting 11-34% of patients suffering&#xD;
      form DM. The current available medication often provides insufficient pain relief and/or has&#xD;
      unacceptable side effects. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been used for over 30 years to&#xD;
      treat neuropathic pain. Various small clinical studies have shown a beneficial effect of SCS&#xD;
      on pain in PDP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This study is a preparation to a RCT to investigate whether SCS is a good&#xD;
      indication in patients which suffer from pain with moderate-to-severe PDP in the lower limbs.&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is whether SCS leads to sufficient pain relief and to obtain&#xD;
      insight into the working mechanism of SCS. The hypothesis is that the effect SCS is most&#xD;
      effective in patients without major sensory deficits. Furthermore, practical feasibility of&#xD;
      the test procedures described in the study protocol will be examined, including the&#xD;
      questionnaires to be filled out by the patient. Also, technical feasibility of SCS will be&#xD;
      investigated. Besides the feasibility, the possibility of predicting successful pain relief&#xD;
      by SCS by classifying patients according to the Michigan Diabetic Neuropathy Score will be&#xD;
      assessed. Furthermore, possible other predictors for successful pain relief by SCS will be&#xD;
      defined. Study design: the study is a pilot study in preparation to a RCT to investigate the&#xD;
      effect of spinal cord stimulation on pain in moderate-to-severe PDP patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: patients suffering from moderate-to-severe PDP in the lower limbs as&#xD;
      diagnosed by clinical symptoms and supported by the Michigan Diabetic Neuropathy Score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: patients will receive 2 weeks of trial stimulation and best (drug) treatment as&#xD;
      usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Main study parameter is the pain score as measured by a&#xD;
      numeric rating scale (NRS) according to Jensen and a Patient Global Impression of Change for&#xD;
      pain measured on a 7-point Likert scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: SCS related risks include: lead migration (14%), lead breakage (7%), implanted&#xD;
      pulse generator migration (1%), loss of therapeutic effect, lost or unpleasant paresthesias&#xD;
      (12%), infection or wound breakdown (10%), Pain at IPG incision site (12%), IPG pocket fluid&#xD;
      collection (5%).&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Previous treatment has been unsuccessful (insufficient pain relief and/or&#xD;
                  unacceptable side-effects) with drugs from the following drug categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Amitriptyline or an other tricyclic antidepressant and/or&#xD;
