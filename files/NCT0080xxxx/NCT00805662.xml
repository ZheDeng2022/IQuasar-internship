      Placebo-controlled study. Application of nasal oxytocin (8 IU) during intrauterine&#xD;
      insemination in 86 patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between 2004 and 2007, 86 patients with primary or secondary infertility were enrolled in&#xD;
      this prospective, randomized, double-blinded study in our tertiary-care infertility center. A&#xD;
      total of 132 homologous intrauterine insemination (IUI) cycles (mean: 1.5 cycles) was&#xD;
      performed. All patients gave informed consent. The study was approved by the Human Ethics&#xD;
      Committee of the Medical Faculty of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University (LMU) Munich and the&#xD;
      German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Products (BfArM) (Bundesinstitut für&#xD;
      Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte) consented to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for couples were idiopathic infertility, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)&#xD;
      and / or male subfertility (table 1). Maximum female age was 42 years. Infertility workup&#xD;
      included a standard gynecological examination with a transvaginal sonography using a 7.5 MHz&#xD;
      probe. Patients displaying signs or symptoms of anomalies such as uterine fusion defects,&#xD;
      submucosal fibroids, active endometriosis or acute inflammation were excluded from the study.&#xD;
      Further prerequisites were endocrine serum parameters (FSH, LH, estradiol, testosterone,&#xD;
      SHBG, DHEA-S, Prolaktin, TSH) from cycle day 2-5 within the normogonadotropic range with no&#xD;
      evidence of hyperandrogenemia, thyroid dysfunction or hyperprolactinemia. 15 patients were&#xD;
      diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) according to the Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM&#xD;
      Consensus Workshop Group (26). In all patients fallopian tubes were documented to be patent&#xD;
      by sonographic contrast hysterosalpingography (Echovist® 200, Bayer Vital GmbH, Leverkusen,&#xD;
      Germany) or by chromo-laparoscopy. Infections with Hepatitis B and C and HIV were excluded in&#xD;
      all couples by negative serological tests. In all patients protective titers against rubella&#xD;
      virus were confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IUI was performed in natural (n=31, 23%) or stimulated cycles (n=101, 77%). Stimulation was&#xD;
      done with daily s.c. 37 IU or 50 IU of recombinant FSH (Puregon, Organon GmbH,&#xD;
      Oberschleißheim, Germany) starting on day 3 to day 5 of the menstrual cycle. Cycles were&#xD;
      monitored by repeated transvaginal sonography and determination of serum estradiol and LH.&#xD;
      Ovulation induction (OI) was done by 5.000 IU hCG (Predalon, Organon GmbH, Oberschleißheim,&#xD;
      Germany) s.c. or 250 μg recombinant hCG (Ovitrelle, Serono GmbH, Unterschleißheim, Germany)&#xD;
      s.c. as soon as one of maximum three follicles reached a mean diameter of 20 mm or LH&#xD;
      exceeded 10 mIU/mL in combination with a follicle mean diameter of at least 16 mm. IUI was&#xD;
      done 24h-36h after OI. Data on uterine, ovarian and endocrine parameters at the time of&#xD;
      ovulation induction (OI) are summarized in table 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Homologous semen samples were gained by masturbation after an abstinence time of 3-5 days.&#xD;
      After liquification for 30 min analysis of semen parameters were carried out according to the&#xD;
      World Health Organization guidelines (27). Details on results are summarized in table 2.&#xD;
      Sperm morphology was analysed according to WHO guidelines in at least one semen analysis&#xD;
      preceding this study not more than 3 months. The sperm preparation was conducted utilizing&#xD;
      density gradient separation as described in the WHO manual (27). Sil Select (FertiPro N.V.,&#xD;
      Beernem, Belgium) was used instead of Percoll as recommended in the WHO manual (27). The&#xD;
      density gradient (90%/45%) achieved separation of sperm after centrifugation at 500 g for 20&#xD;
      minutes. The pellet was washed in 5.0 mL Universal IVF Medium (Medi Cult, Jyllinge, Denmark),&#xD;
      centrifuged for 5 minutes at 500 g and resuspended in a total volume of 0.3 mL. After&#xD;
      processing, semen was evaluated for sperm concentration and motility. Only couples with a&#xD;
      total progressive motile sperm count (TPMC) of at least 1 million in the processed sperm&#xD;
      suspension were included in the study. Data are summarized in table 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxytocin and placebo, filled in identical nasal spray applicators labelled with &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot;,&#xD;
      were delivered by the pharmacy department of LMU-Klinikum, Campus Grosshadern. Probes were&#xD;
      blinded to the clinical staff and the patients. The verum consisted of Synthocinon®-Spray&#xD;
      (Novartis Pharma GmbH, Nürnberg, Germany). According to the manufacturer one nasal spray pump&#xD;
      consists of 4 IU of oxytocin. In addition the verum contained chlorobutanol,&#xD;
      methyl-4-hydroxybenzoat and propyl-4-hydroxybenzoat for preservation. Placebo consisted of&#xD;
      isotonic NaCl solution with 0.01 % benzalkoniumchloride und 0.1% Na-EDTA for preservation.&#xD;
      The nasal sprays were kept at 4°C and replaced monthly. Patients were randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either group A or group B (double-blinded) by using a computer generated randomization list.&#xD;
      Codes for A and B were broken after the last study patient had completed the pregnancy test.&#xD;
      Data on patient variables in both groups are summarized in table 2. All patients were asked&#xD;
      to squeeze the spray into the air for control of the pump mechanism and then to apply two&#xD;
      snuffs (=8 IU oxytocin) of nasal spray labelled with A and B respectively into one nostril&#xD;
      directly after IUI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten minutes after completion of the IUI patients were asked to fill out a form documenting&#xD;
      possible side effects. Each of the following complaints was asked to be quantified in a scale&#xD;
      from level 1 (=no side effect) to level 10 (=maximum side effect): lower abdominal pain,&#xD;
      nasal mucosal irritation, nausea, headache and vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study was evidence of a chorionic sac in transvaginal sonography&#xD;
      21-23 days after IUI with a positive serum hCG test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 16.0. Binary logistic regression was applied&#xD;
      for calculation of Odds ratio and likelihood ratio test. For all comparisons, p &lt; 0.05 was&#xD;
      considered significant.&#xD;
