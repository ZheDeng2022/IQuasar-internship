  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Air pollution is a major cause of cardiorespiratory morbidity and mortality. The exact&#xD;
      components of air pollution that underlie the cardiovascular effects are not yet known, but&#xD;
      combustion-derived particulate matter is suspected to be the major cause. Epidemiological&#xD;
      studies have shown that exposure to air pollution causes exacerbation of existing&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory conditions leading to increased hospital admissions and death. The&#xD;
      investigators have recently conducted a series of controlled exposure studies to urban&#xD;
      particulate matter and diesel exhaust in healthy volunteers and patients with coronary heart&#xD;
      disease. The investigators found that controlled exposure to dilute diesel exhaust in&#xD;
      patients with prior myocardial infarction induced asymptomatic myocardial ischaemia with an&#xD;
      increase in electrocardiographic measures of myocardial ischaemia. Whilst important, further&#xD;
      questions remain: (i) does air pollution exposure exacerbate ischaemia and reduce exercise&#xD;
      tolerance in patients with symptomatic angina pectoris, (ii) do &quot;real world&quot; exposures as&#xD;
      encountered in the urban environment of major cities have similar effects, and (iii) can a&#xD;
      simple face mask intervention to reduce exposure to particulate air pollution improve health&#xD;
      outcomes in patients with coronary heart disease?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      100 patients with stable angina pectoris will be recruited from the HPS-THRIVE cohort or from&#xD;
      the cardiology outpatient department at the Fuwai Hospital in Beijing. Patients will attend&#xD;
      the department first thing in the morning on two occasions, separated by at least 1 week. All&#xD;
      subjects will be fitted with a 12-lead Holter monitor and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure&#xD;
      monitor. They will be issued with a diary to record their activities and symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised to wear a simple facemask for one of their visits (3M Dust&#xD;
      Respirator 8812). When randomised to wear a mask, subjects will be asked to wear the mask as&#xD;
      much as possible in the 24 hours prior to the study day and for the 24 hours of the study day&#xD;
      (48 hours in total). Subjects will be instructed to wear the mask at all times when outdoors,&#xD;
      and as much as possible when indoors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On both visits, patients will be asked to walk along a prespecified route for 2 hours in a&#xD;
      city centre location in Beijing. During this period patients will walk at their own pace for&#xD;
      15 mins and rest for 5 mins for a total of 120 mins (6 cycles). After the walk, subjects will&#xD;
      return to the department and the pollution equipment switched off. A formal BRUCE protocol&#xD;
      exercise stress test will be performed as soon as possible after finishing the 2-hour walk,&#xD;
      and blood tests will be taken just prior to the exercise stress test (10-20mls in total).&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to wear the ambulatory blood pressure monitor and the Holter ECG&#xD;
      monitor for a total of 24 hours, returning the following day to have this removed. Personal&#xD;
      exposure to air pollution will be determined during the 2 hour walk with a series of monitors&#xD;
      contained within a small backpack.&#xD;
