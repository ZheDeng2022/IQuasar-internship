    <textblock>
      Acute leukemia is a life threatening illness that strikes people of all ages. In addition to&#xD;
      surviving the direct effects of the disease, the treatment of leukemia generally requires&#xD;
      chemotherapy which has its own burden. Infection is one of the most common secondary problems&#xD;
      faced by these patients. Simple infections are common and easily treated with aggressive&#xD;
      antibiotics. However, treated progressive infection leads to loss of vital organ function and&#xD;
      is termed severe sepsis. Severe sepsis is associated with increased risk of death and the&#xD;
      need for specialized care in the intensive care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the appropriate use of antibiotics, little is known about what clinical and patient&#xD;
      factors are associated with the development of severe sepsis. Recent evidence has suggested&#xD;
      that certain practices like frequent transfusion of blood products and control of glucose&#xD;
      levels effects outcome in critically ill patients. In addition, there have been advances in&#xD;
      our knowledge of certain genes that may predispose people to severe infections. It is&#xD;
      possible that these factors are important in people who are not yet critically ill, but are&#xD;
      at risk for the development of severe sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study will look at genetic, clinical and therapeutic factors that are&#xD;
      associated with the development of severe sepsis. This will help doctors understand what&#xD;
      treatments may be helpful in preventing this serious complication.&#xD;

      Primary hypothesis: Hyperglycemia during inpatient therapy of AML is associated with&#xD;
      increased mortality (fewer hospital free days to Day 60, see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H1a: Hyperglycemia will result in an increased risk of developing clinical signs of&#xD;
           infection (fever).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H1b: Hyperglycemia will be associated with an increased risk of developing severe sepsis&#xD;
           after the onset of clinical signs of infection (fever).&#xD;
&#xD;
           o H1b1: Hyperglycemia will be associated with the development of acute lung injury after&#xD;
           the onset of signs of infection (fever).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H1c: Hyperglycemia will be associated with an increased risk of ICU admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
           o H1c1: Hyperglycemia will be associated with an increased risk of ICU admission for&#xD;
           severe sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H1d: Hyperglycemia will be associated with an increased risk of death in those subjects&#xD;
           with severe sepsis (fewer hospital free days to Day 60, see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim: To investigate whether TSP-1 is important in modulating the course of&#xD;
      sepsis-induced acute lung injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypothesis: In patients with sepsis, increased levels of functional TSP-1 will be&#xD;
      associated with a lower incidence of and a less severe course of lung injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H2a: In human sepsis, increased TSP-1 levels will be associated with a lower incidence&#xD;
           of lung-injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H2b: In human sepsis, increased TSP-1 levels will be associated with a less severe&#xD;
           course of lung-injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H2c: In human sepsis, patients with the Asn682Ser polymorphism in the TSP-1 gene will be&#xD;
           associated with a higher incidence of lung-injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H2d In human sepsis, patients with the Asn682Ser polymorphism in the TSP-1 gene will be&#xD;
           associated with a more severe course of lung-injury.&#xD;
