      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn whether different ways of viewing&#xD;
      echocardiogram pictures along with blood tests can help to see heart-related side effects of&#xD;
      chemotherapy and trastuzumab earlier than the usual tests.&#xD;

      Echocardiogram:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the heart-related side effects of chemotherapy and trastuzumab, your regular&#xD;
      doctor will monitor your heart's function as part of your routine care. You will have&#xD;
      echocardiograms performed before you begin treatment, and then every 3 months. An&#xD;
      echocardiogram uses sound waves to check your heart's health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you decide to take part in this study, researchers will take several additional pictures&#xD;
      of your heart during each of your regularly scheduled echocardiograms. The additional&#xD;
      pictures will make the procedure take about 5-10 minutes longer than the regular&#xD;
      echocardiogram. These pictures will be viewed in a different way than the standard&#xD;
      echocardiogram pictures. Researchers hope viewing the pictures this way can help researchers&#xD;
      to find heart problems earlier than the usual tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (about 4 teaspoon each time) will be drawn during the routine blood draw that occurs&#xD;
      closest to the regularly scheduled echocardiograms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The heart produces hormones called BNP and NT-proBNP. These hormones can be measured in the&#xD;
      blood. BNP and NT-proBNP levels can be higher when the heart is not working as well.&#xD;
      Researchers will measure these hormones at the time of each echocardiogram. Researchers hope&#xD;
      to learn whether measuring these hormones can help identify the heart-related side effects of&#xD;
      chemotherapy and trastuzumab earlier than the usual tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will also measure metabolic proteins (such as sugars and acids) in the blood.&#xD;
      Researchers hope to learn whether measuring these metabolic proteins can help identify the&#xD;
      heart-related side effects of chemotherapy and trastuzumab earlier than the usual tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because protein, sugar or acid levels may be temporarily changed after you eat, you will be&#xD;
      asked not to eat overnight before having your blood drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have 6 study visits around the time that you have an echocardiogram. These visits&#xD;
      will occur before you take Herceptin, when you begin Herceptin, and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months&#xD;
      later. These study visits will be scheduled on days when you are already making a visit to&#xD;
      your regular doctor. You will not have to make any special visits to the hospital for this&#xD;
      research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each study visit, you will be asked about any symptoms you may be experiencing, and&#xD;
      any medications you may be taking. Your blood pressure and heart rate will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also take a quality of life questionnaire at each study visit. This questionnaire&#xD;
      asks you how the cancer may have interfered with your daily life. It should take about 15&#xD;
      minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be considered off-study once you complete the 6 study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 100 patients will take part in this multicenter&#xD;
      study. Up to 20 patients will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
