      In the advanced stages of Parkinson Disease deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus&#xD;
      (STN DBS) is the next therapeutic option. Despite the beneficial motor effects there are&#xD;
      important negative side-effects of STN DBS. Our hypothesis is that changes in cognition and&#xD;
      behavior during STN DBS are related to stimulation of the non-motor parts of the STN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to avoid cognitive and affective side effects by selective&#xD;
      stimulation of the STN motor part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this feasibility study is to measure the patients burden and to test&#xD;
      the technical feasibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is an expansion of the classical STN DBS procedure. The targeting using the&#xD;
      multichannel registration system by stimulation of the motor cortex and registration of the&#xD;
      subthalamic nucleus will be added to the procedure. For this procedure, it is necessary to&#xD;
      place a subdural strip under the skull.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by motor&#xD;
      symptoms. Patients are initially treated successfully with drugs (e.g. levodopa),&#xD;
      unfortunately use is limited due to severe side effects. In the advanced stages of PD&#xD;
      neurosurgical treatment is the next therapeutic option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of dopamine depletion in PD the subthalamic nucleus (STN) displays a&#xD;
      characteristic burst activity. This burst activity results in dysregulation of the electrical&#xD;
      activity of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuitry and is expressed by&#xD;
      Parkinsonian symptoms. That is why the STN is a main target for deep brain stimulation (DBS)&#xD;
      in PD. Long-term follow-up (since 1993) shows long lasting beneficial effects on the motor&#xD;
      function of PD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the beneficial motor effects there are important negative side-effects of STN DBS.&#xD;
      These include both cognitive and affective changes during stimulation, 40% has one of these&#xD;
      side effects. 10% experience difficulties during their daily functioning due to altered&#xD;
      cognition or personality changes. Presently, the underlying mechanism of these stimulation&#xD;
      induced behavioral changes is not fully understood and therefore adequate treatment is&#xD;
      lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The STN can be divided in three functionally and anatomically segregated parts: a motor part,&#xD;
      a cognitive part and a limbic part. Our hypothesis is that changes in cognition and behavior&#xD;
      during STN DBS are related to stimulation of the non-motor parts of the STN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, good candidates are excluded from STN DBS because of the high risk of behavioral&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to avoid cognitive and affective side effects and maintain the&#xD;
      beneficial motor effects by selective stimulation of the STN motor part. With the Select Stim&#xD;
      project we want to improve the classical operation procedure, in such way that the behavioral&#xD;
      side effects will be less present and the motor symptoms of the disease will be treated. In a&#xD;
      later stage, we want to compare the classical treatment in comparison to this new method. The&#xD;
      outcome we are interested in are the Parkinson symptoms, but also the side effects of the&#xD;
      stimulation on cognitive functioning, mood and behavior. The main objective of this&#xD;
      feasibility study is to measure the patients burden and to test the technical feasibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility study will answer the following: is targeting of the subthalamic nucleus,&#xD;
      using stimulation of the motor cortex and registration in the subthalcami nucleus technically&#xD;
      achievable? The primary goal is to determine the technical feasibility and the patient&#xD;
      tolerance. If the method is technical achievable and well tolerated by the patients, we want&#xD;
      to give answer to the main question with a randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first stage consists of a feasibility study. Five patients will be enrolled and&#xD;
      evaluated. Blinding and randomization is not necessary. Depending on the results of this&#xD;
      minor feasibility study, we will proceed with the second stage, which is the randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study the population consists of PD patients who are candidates for STN DBS:&#xD;
      clinical findings consistent with idiopathic PD and suffering from severe response&#xD;
      fluctuations and/or dyskinesia, despite optimal drug treatment. Further, there are no&#xD;
      restrictions in terms of gender or ethnicity. Age limits are 40 and 75 years.Those PD&#xD;
      patients suffering from severe psychiatric co-morbidities and cognitive decline are excluded.&#xD;
      Other exclusion criteria are the same as for the classical STN DBS operation. For the&#xD;
      feasibility study three patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is an expansion of the classical STN DBS procedure. The targeting using the&#xD;
      multichannel registration system by stimulation of the motor cortex and registration of the&#xD;
      subthalamic nucleus will be added to the procedure. For this procedure, it is necessary to&#xD;
      place a subdural strip under the skull.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study parameters/outcome of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two main endpoints to measure the feasibility. First, the patients burden and&#xD;
      outcome. We will interview the patient and ask him to fill in a standardized questionnaire.&#xD;
      Only if the burden is acceptable, we will start with the main study (average marks for each&#xD;
      testing must be above 5 to continue with a RCT). Thereby the motor symptoms must be&#xD;
      significantly less pronounced with stimulation than pre-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, the technical feasibility depends on the possibility to register the potentials,&#xD;
      evoked by motor cortex stimulation in the STN (so-called evoked potentials). These potentials&#xD;
      have to be clearly identifiable in order to recognize the motor part of the STN. This is&#xD;
      necessary as in the final study we want to compare the results of selective stimulation of&#xD;
      the motor part of the STN with results of the classical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secundary study parameters/outcome of the study (if applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognition, and in particular impulsivity, and affect, will be assessed by neuropsychological&#xD;
      testing and a self-report questionnaire, the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (Watson et al&#xD;
      1988). Neuropsychological testing covers the main cognitive domains but the study parameters&#xD;
      are related to the performance on tasks in the relevant domain of executive functioning,&#xD;
      including word fluency, the Stroop (Lezak, 2004), a finger precuing task (Adam et al, 2002)&#xD;
      and the Iowa Gambling Task (Bechera et al., 1994). (These are not endpoints of the&#xD;
      feasibility trial.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advantage of fMRI above TMS or double contrast MRI in the planning of the OR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness (if applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The burden for the patients rests within lengthened operation time and the pre-operative&#xD;
      preparation. The preparation for this study will contain a functional MRI. The patient needs&#xD;
      to lie in the scanner for a prolonged time (max. 30 min.). And an TMS will be performed to&#xD;
      localise the hand area on the motor cortex, which will take about 60 minutes. This test is&#xD;
      not painful. The operation will be lengthened with one hour per side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events related to the implantation of the subdural strip electrodes for the motor&#xD;
      cortex stimulation are described in epilepsy research where these strips are also used. The&#xD;
      most important complications involve bleeding, infection, transient neurological deficit,&#xD;
      intracranial hypertension, seizures. A large retrospective study (185 patients with epilepsy&#xD;
      who had an implantation of a subdural strip) shows that strip electrode implantation is&#xD;
      rarely associated with complications, e.g. epidural hematoma 1.6%, subdural hematoma 1.1%,&#xD;
      brain edema 1.1%, postoperative infection 1.1%, transient aphasia 1.1%, occurrence of&#xD;
      non-habitual seizures 2.7%. Most of these published complications are in context of prolonged&#xD;
      (e.g. several days) monitoring in epilepsy treatment. We expect the risk of seizures to be&#xD;
      lower in Parkinson disease patients. Moreover, in this study the subdural strips are only&#xD;
      used for just an hour for recording and stimulation of the motor cortex. So, the risk of the&#xD;
      various complications mentioned above will probably be even lower.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The strips will be implanted through the same burr hole through which the five depth&#xD;
      electrodes are implanted like in the classical procedure. Only if this appears to be&#xD;
      impossible during the procedure, a second burr hole will be made. The risk of this (bleeding&#xD;
      and infection) is very low (less than 0.25%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of seizures is very small with the administration of diphantoin. The most important&#xD;
      side effects of diphantoin are nausea, vomiting, obstipation and anorexia, also dizziness&#xD;
      ataxia, nystagmus, speech disturbances, tremor, apathy, visual disturbances, nervosity,&#xD;
      hallucinations and neuropathy. The adverse effects are mainly reported after long term&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After intravenous administration hypotension can occur and cardiotoxic reactions, collaps&#xD;
      and/ or central depression; incidentally dyskinesias. The injection site can hurt, show&#xD;
      inflammation and necrosis of the skin. The diphantoin will be loaded in a safe time spam&#xD;
      (90min) through a safe intravenous line by the anesthetist in the srugery room.&#xD;
