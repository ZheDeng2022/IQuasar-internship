    <textblock>
      Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common cause of cancer mortality in men and&#xD;
      women in Singapore.Chemotherapy and biologically targeted agents can extend survival only&#xD;
      modestly for these patients; therefore, discovery of novel ways to prolong the disease course&#xD;
      is a top research priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway plays a central role in the&#xD;
      neoplastic transformation of NSCLC and promotes cancer cell survival, metastasis, and&#xD;
      angiogenesis. The predominance of EGFR signaling in NSCLC makes the pathway an attractive&#xD;
      candidate for the development of targeted therapeutics. Over the last three years, the FDA&#xD;
      has approved two drugs for salvage treatment of NSCLC, gefitinib (Iressa 速, formerly known as&#xD;
      ZD1839) and erlotinib (Tarceva 速, formerly known as OSI-774). Both are small molecule&#xD;
      orally-bioavailable tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) of the EGFR TK domain, and have been&#xD;
      shown to improve survival compared to placebo in asian patients when administered after&#xD;
      failure of first or second line chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC.&#xD;

      Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common cause of cancer mortality in men and&#xD;
      women in Singapore.Chemotherapy and biologically targeted agents can extend survival only&#xD;
      modestly for these patients; therefore, discovery of novel ways to prolong the disease course&#xD;
      is a top research priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway plays a central role in the&#xD;
      neoplastic transformation of NSCLC and promotes cancer cell survival, metastasis, and&#xD;
      angiogenesis. The predominance of EGFR signaling in NSCLC makes the pathway an attractive&#xD;
      candidate for the development of targeted therapeutics. Over the last three years, the FDA&#xD;
      has approved two drugs for salvage treatment of NSCLC, gefitinib (Iressa 速, formerly known as&#xD;
      ZD1839) and erlotinib (Tarceva 速, formerly known as OSI-774). Both are small molecule&#xD;
      orally-bioavailable tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) of the EGFR TK domain, and have been&#xD;
      shown to improve survival compared to placebo in asian patients when administered after&#xD;
      failure of first or second line chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, it was found that somatic mutations in the EGFR gene sensitize NSCLC tumors to&#xD;
      TKIs. These mutations are present in approximately 50 % of asian patients with NSCLC.&#xD;
      Retrospective studies suggest that patients harboring a mutation may derive greater clinical&#xD;
      benefit from treatment with TKIs than patients without a mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, all patients that benefit from TKI treatment ultimately develop resistance to&#xD;
      therapy manifesting as progression of their cancer, after which there remains few, if any&#xD;
      treatment options. Hence, there would be vast clinical utility in understanding the&#xD;
      mechanisms of TKI resistance and developing strategies to reverse or prevent it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have preliminary data which shows that the combination of hydroxychloroquine and gefitinib&#xD;
      results in delayed acquired resistance to gefitinib in cell lines that harbour the EGFR&#xD;
      mutation. In addition, the addition of hydroxychloroquine to gefitinib can result in reversal&#xD;
      of acquired resistance to gefitinib. Much parallel has been observed in resistance mechanisms&#xD;
      between NSCLC cell lines and molecular changes observed in patients thus far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long term aim therefore is to examine the efficacy of this combination in delaying&#xD;
      acquired resistance to gefitinib in NSCLC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, however, the MTD and DLT of each drug when used in combination therapy will be&#xD;
      examined in this study. The other aim is to examine the pharmacokinetic effect and&#xD;
      interactions of hydroxychloroquine on gefitinib, and vice versa. Gefitinib is usually well&#xD;
      tolerated, with main toxicities of rash and diarrhoea. Hydroxychloroquine is also FDA&#xD;
      approved and widely used and generally well-tolerated for rheumatological conditions.&#xD;

             of disqualifying baseline conditions include macular degeneration and other retinal&#xD;
             disease, see exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Willingness to comply with protocol procedures including the blood-sampling schedule&#xD;
             for PK analyses and periodic eye examinations.&#xD;

&#xD;
        For the phase II study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria as above, except that:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. NSCLC patients must be non-smokers and have adenocarcinomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who had been on gefitinib should have a wash out period of two weeks prior to&#xD;
             commencement of treatment drugs for this study. They must have responded to Gefitinib&#xD;
             previously (either CR, PR or SD) for more than twelve weeks to be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        For both lead in phase I and phase II study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Current use of hydroxychloroquine for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Known hypersensitivity to chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, or any closely related&#xD;
             drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Known hypersensitivity to erlotinib, gefitinib, or any closely related drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, as HCQ may cause hemolytic anemia&#xD;
             in patients with G6PD deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Cataracts that would interfere with required funduscopic examinations, or severe&#xD;
             baseline visual impairment including macular degeneration, retinopathy or visual field&#xD;
             changes, or having only one functional eye. All patients must undergo a screening eye&#xD;
             exam prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pregnant or breastfeeding. HCQ crosses the placenta and use is not recommended during&#xD;
             pregnancy except for life-threatening malaria. The effects of gefitinib on a fetus are&#xD;
             unknown. For these reasons, female subjects of childbearing age must practice&#xD;
             acceptable methods of birth control to avoid pregnancy. Male subjects must also&#xD;
             practice acceptable methods of birth control to prevent pregnancy of a partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Symptomatic CNS metastases or newly diagnosed CNS metastases that have not yet been&#xD;
             definitively treated with radiation and/or surgery. Note that patients with a history&#xD;
             of CNS metastases or cord compression are allowable if they have been definitively&#xD;
             treated and are clinically stable. Maintenance steroids are allowed but maintenance&#xD;
             seizure medication is not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Prior radiation therapy inclusive of all identified target lesions. Note that prior&#xD;
             palliative radiation to bony disease, CNS disease, or a limited thoracic area is&#xD;
             allowed, provided that there is measurable disease outside the field and radiation is&#xD;
             completed at least two weeks prior to starting treatment and the patient has fully&#xD;
             recovered from all side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Any evidence of clinically active interstitial lung disease. Note that patients with&#xD;
             chronic, stable radiographic changes who are asymptomatic need not be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Malignancies within the past 3 years except for adequately treated carcinoma of the&#xD;
             cervix or basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Although not an absolute exclusion criteria, caution should be exercised in patients&#xD;
             with a diagnosis of prophyria or non-light-sensitive psoriasis, as HCQ can&#xD;
             significantly exacerbate both of these conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Evidence of any other significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding that makes&#xD;
             it undesirable for the patient to participate in the study, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Use of any non-FDA approved or investigational agent within 2 weeks of enrolling onto&#xD;
             the trial, or failure to recover from the side effects of any of these agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Penicillamine use for Wilson's disease or any other indication, as concomitant use&#xD;
             with HCQ can increase toxicity to penicillamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Concommitant use of anti-convulsants is not allowed.&#xD;
