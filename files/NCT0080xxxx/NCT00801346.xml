      RATIONALE: Gathering information about metabolic syndrome from young patients with acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia may help doctors learn more about the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the metabolic syndrome in young patients with acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia in remission.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the incidence and prevalence of the components of metabolic syndrome (e.g.,&#xD;
           obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance) in pediatric patients with&#xD;
           acute lymphoblastic leukemia in remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the trajectory of the onset of these components over a 1-year period in&#xD;
           patients undergoing maintenance therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify potential associations between components of metabolic syndrome and fatigue,&#xD;
           health-related quality of life, family history, nutrition, and physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify potential biomarkers that are associated with clinical features of metabolic&#xD;
           syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate whether patients will show a decrease in IGF-1 levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a two-part study. Patients are enrolled in either part 1 or part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 1: Patients undergo physical exam measurements (e.g., body mass index, waist&#xD;
           circumference, and blood pressure) at baseline (during maintenance course 1) and at 12&#xD;
           months (during maintenance course 5). Patients also undergo blood sample collection at&#xD;
           baseline and at 12 months to measure laboratory markers (e.g., fasting lipid profile,&#xD;
           fasting insulin and glucose, IGF-1, leptin, and adiponectin levels). Patients or their&#xD;
           parents complete a family history questionnaire at baseline and questionnaires to assess&#xD;
           physical activity, quality of life, nutritional intake, and fatigue at baseline and at 6&#xD;
           and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 2: Patients or their parents complete a family history questionnaire at baseline.&#xD;
