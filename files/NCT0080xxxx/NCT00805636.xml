  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential of [18F]-ML-10 to serve as an imaging&#xD;
      tool for the early detection of response of brain metastases to radiation therapy. Such early&#xD;
      detection may help early identification of responsive and non-responsive lesions. The&#xD;
      experimental design of the present study aims to evaluate the potential of PET imaging with&#xD;
      [18F]-ML-10 to address the currently unmet clinical need for very early (within one&#xD;
      day)assessment of response to therapy. Currently, response assessment is available only after&#xD;
      several weeks or months after completion of therapy, when tumor shrinkage can be detected by&#xD;
      anatomical imaging (by MRI). Early detection of tumor response to treatment is now&#xD;
      widely-recognized as a highly-desirable goal in oncology, and is respectively the target of&#xD;
      intense research worldwide. In the future, the option to know early upon treatment&#xD;
      administration, that the treated tumor is a non-responsive, may improve clinical management&#xD;
      of patients with brain metastases of solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early assessment of the efficacy of anti-cancer therapy is highly desirable and an unmet need&#xD;
      in clinical oncology. Currently, treatment efficacy is mostly measured by following tumor&#xD;
      size by anatomical imaging (CT scan or MRI). However, changes in tumor size may be observed&#xD;
      only after several weeks to several months after completion of treatment. Meanwhile, in cases&#xD;
      where there is no response, the patient is unnecessarily exposed to treatment's side effects,&#xD;
      and precious time may be lost before the initiation of an alternative, potentially more&#xD;
      beneficial line of therapy. Therefore, there is an urgent and serious need for better tools&#xD;
      for monitoring of tumor response to anti-cancer treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this need, [18F]-ML-10, a novel small molecular-weight probe (MW 205) was&#xD;
      developed for clinical detection of apoptosis in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET).&#xD;
      [18F]-ML-10 is a member of the Aposense family of compounds, a novel class of molecular&#xD;
      probes for molecular imaging of cell death. The proposed indication for which [18F]-ML-10 is&#xD;
      being developed is for early assessment of response of solid tumors to radiation and&#xD;
      chemoradiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous preclinical and clinical studies have substantiated the safety of [18F]-ML-10, its&#xD;
      very high stability in vivo, its favorable biodistribution profile, and its efficacy in&#xD;
      clinical detection of cell death. In preclinical studies, the selective retention of&#xD;
      [18F]-ML-10 in the focus of the neurovascular cell death in cerebral ischemia was&#xD;
      demonstrated in respective animal models. [18F]-ML-10 has been examined in two clinical&#xD;
      trials in Uppsala Imanet, Sweden, and has been found safe in administration to healthy&#xD;
      subjects and to elderly subjects with acute ischemic cerebral stroke. In these clinical&#xD;
      trials, [18F]-ML-10 was also found efficacious in the clinical imaging of apoptosis, being&#xD;
      either physiological apoptosis as observed in the testes in young healthy males, and&#xD;
      pathological cell death, as observed in the brains of patients with acute ischemic cerebral&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Phase 2 study demonstrated the suitability and safety of 18F-ML-10, designed to&#xD;
      serve as a PET radiotracer for early detection of cellular apoptosis of brain metastases in&#xD;
      response to WBRT. The relationship between the early change in 18F-ML-10 uptake by the tumor,&#xD;
      observed during or upon completion of treatment, and subsequent tumor shrinkage as observed&#xD;
      by MRI eight weeks after the completion of WBRT, was demonstrated.18F-ML-10 demonstrated a&#xD;
      good safety profile with no drug-related AEs or any effect on safety parameters.&#xD;
