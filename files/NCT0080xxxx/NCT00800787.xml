      This is a phase 3 prospective, single arm open label study to be conducted t approximately 4&#xD;
      study sited located in th e USA. Approximately 25 HBV DNA negative patients who underwent&#xD;
      liver transplant at least one year prior, due to chronic hepatitis B infection will bwe&#xD;
      eligible for study participation. The study consist of a total of 16 study visit and the&#xD;
      duration of participation will be 20 weeks for each patients. Patients will be converted from&#xD;
      the intravenous standard HBIG to Nabi-HB subcutaneous administration according to the&#xD;
      individual scheduled dosing interval.&#xD;
