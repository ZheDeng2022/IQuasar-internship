    <textblock>
      Brain metastases occur in 20% to 40% of all patients with cancer , with an incidence 10 times&#xD;
      higher than that of primary malignant brain tumors. Patients with brain metastases have a&#xD;
      poor prognosis with a median survival of 1-2 months with corticosteroids and 5-7 months with&#xD;
      whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Local control achieved with WBRT in patients with otherwise&#xD;
      controlled systemic disease remains at issue. A single high dose of radiation delivered with&#xD;
      high precision to the target lesion (Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)), is considered standard&#xD;
      care in salvage of recurrent lesions after WBRT. SRS can destroy tumour with very little&#xD;
      damage to surrounding tissue. Research suggests that delivering radiotherapy in a number of&#xD;
      smaller doses is more beneficial than receiving all of the radiotherapy in a single dose.&#xD;
      Brain metastases are well suited for SRS as they are often small, radiographically&#xD;
      well-circumscribed, pseudospherical tumors that are noninfiltrative.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With increasing volume of tumor, the dose of radiosurgery that can be safely delivered to&#xD;
      recurrent oligo-metastases in the brain must be reduced. However, reducing the dose of&#xD;
      radiosurgery also compromises local control. There is mounting evidence of a local control&#xD;
      benefit to a hypofractionated approach in radiation delivery for brain metastases compared&#xD;
      with single fraction radiosurgery. Here we propose a novel therapeutic strategy that builds&#xD;
      on this concept whereby time between each delivered fraction will enable us to measure and&#xD;
      adapt to response, with the objective of reducing irradiated volumes and improving outcomes.&#xD;
      In general, the treatment of malignant tumors benefits from fractionation of the dose due to&#xD;
      a number of radiobiological properties (redistribution, reoxygenation, repair) that&#xD;
      distinguish, and select against, malignant lesions in the fractionation process.&#xD;
      Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT) is a method of delivering a highly&#xD;
      conformal dose distribution in a few treatment sessions using a relocatable stereotactic&#xD;
      frame. HSRT may be an attractive alternative to SRS because it may 1) improve patient comfort&#xD;
      by removing the invasive nature of SRS frames, 2) confer a radiobiologic advantage over&#xD;
      single fraction treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be initially administered 8 Gy RT (level). The dose at each level will be increase by 2 Gy up to level 4. If ≥ 2 of the patients in a dose cohort encounter a DLT, then that dose level will be declared the maximum administered dose. An additional 3 patients will then be entered at the previous dose level and provided no more than one patient experiences a DLT, that level will be declared the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Up to 6 more patients can be treated at the given dose level while awaiting the results of 6 months of follow-up.</description>
