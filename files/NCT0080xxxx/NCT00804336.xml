  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety of the combination of SOM230&#xD;
      and RAD001, as well as determine the highest dose of this combination that can be given to&#xD;
      people safely. SOM230 is an investigational drug that is similar to Sandostatin LAR.&#xD;
      Sandostatin is an approved drug for the use of treating symptoms of neuroendocrine tumors.&#xD;
      SOM230 has shown to be effective in patients who have become resistant to Sandostatin and may&#xD;
      also stop cancer cells from growing. RAD001 is an investigational drug that also may stop&#xD;
      cancer cells from growing.&#xD;

      -  Participants will be receiving two study medications, SOM230 and RAD001, during each&#xD;
           treatment cycle. Each treatment cycle lasts 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the first four weeks of treatment, the participant will self-administer the SOM230&#xD;
           twice a day by subcutaneous injection. If they tolerate the SOM230 after 4 weeks, they&#xD;
           will switched to the long-acting SOM230 which will be administered during scheduled&#xD;
           treatment visits once every 4 weeks. For the first two weeks after switching to the&#xD;
           long-acting SOM230, participants will continue to self-administer the short-acting&#xD;
           SOM230 twice a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RAD001 will be taken orally once every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 1 of every cycle, a physical exam and blood tests will be performed. Following&#xD;
           every 2 cycles of treatment an assessment of the tumor by CT scan wil be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacokinetic (pK) blood samples will be taken on days 1 and 15 of cycle one. The pK&#xD;
           samples will be taken right before the study drug is administered and then 1, 2, 3, and&#xD;
           5 hours later.&#xD;

    <description>RAD001 was administered orally as a once-daily dose. Pasireotide s.c. was self-administered s.c. twice daily for 4 weeks. If pasireotide s.c. was tolerated, patients received pasireotide LAR i.m. at the corresponding dose level. Pasireotide s.c. was continued for an additional 2 weeks after administration of pasireotide LAR until anticipated steady-state levels of pasireotide LAR were achieved. Pasireotide LAR was administered every 28 days. Cycles for everolimus and pasireotide LAR were repeated every 28 days.</description>
