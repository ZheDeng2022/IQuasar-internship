  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the application of autologous (your own blood)&#xD;
      blood products during mastectomy improves wound healing and decreases complications following&#xD;
      surgery compared to mastectomy without the use of autologous blood products.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A frequent complication of mastectomy is seroma formation with rates in the literature&#xD;
      reported at 3-50%. Although seroma formation can be considered more of a nuisance than a&#xD;
      serious complication, the presence of seroma can lead to wound infection, skin flap necrosis,&#xD;
      wound dehiscence, nerve injury, and lymphedema in mastectomy patients.Various approaches to&#xD;
      reduce seroma formation have included the use of external compression dressings, ultrasound&#xD;
      cutting devices, suction drainage systems, and bovine thrombin. Although some of these&#xD;
      interventions have demonstrated efficacy, none has gained widespread acceptance.&#xD;
      Investigation of alternative interventions during mastectomy procedures that could reduce the&#xD;
      rate of postoperative seroma formation, thereby reducing the likelihood of the onset of more&#xD;
      serious complications, still has value to the patient and surgeon. The use of autologous&#xD;
      blood products (ABP), in particular platelet rich plasma (PRP), has been advocated for&#xD;
      numerous indications. As a surgical tool, ABP are typically applied to the surgical site&#xD;
      during the latter stages of the procedure in combination with bovine thrombin. The aim of PRP&#xD;
      application is to accelerate the healing cascade via application of elevated cytokine&#xD;
      concentrations released during platelet degranulation. It is hypothesized that the elevated&#xD;
      cytokine levels will elucidate an accelerated healing response of the affected tissue.&#xD;
      Preliminary evidence suggests that this expedited healing response correlates with a&#xD;
      reduction in postoperative wound complications. Platelet poor plasma, a by-product of PRP&#xD;
      processing, has been advocated as providing additional hemostasis. The majority of the&#xD;
      literature discussing clinical applications of ABP to date, has been unblinded and&#xD;
      nonrandomized. Although useful as demonstrations of the safety of ABP, this current&#xD;
      literature does not truly investigate the efficacy of these applications. There is a need for&#xD;
      well-designed, well-controlled studies investigating the application of ABP as surgical&#xD;
      tools. It is hypothesized that a significant reduction in postoperative complications, in&#xD;
      particular seroma formation, will result due to the use of ABP during these procedures.&#xD;
