      To evaluate whether CAMPATH-1H given to patients with CLL after maximum response to&#xD;
      chemotherapy will: a) eliminate minimal residual disease (documented by flow cytometry) in&#xD;
      patients who have achieved a complete remission (CR) or b) convert partial remission to&#xD;
      complete remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the time-to-progression of patients according to pretreatment characteristics and&#xD;
      response status at study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate whether CAMPATH-1H given to patients with CLL after maximum response to&#xD;
      chemotherapy will eliminate minimal residual disease as determined by real-time quantitative&#xD;
      PCR.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 95% of cases involve the clonal proliferation of B cells. Paraproteins, often&#xD;
      of the IgM class, can be detected in the serum and/or urine of most patients with CLL. Unique&#xD;
      cell surface markers are increasingly being used to diagnose the disease, and in&#xD;
      approximately 40% of patients, cytogenetic abnormalities (for example, trisomy 12) can be&#xD;
      found. Patients commonly present with lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and&#xD;
      symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, and malaise. In more advanced cases anemia and&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia can also occur. The clinical course of CLL is unpredictable, with survival&#xD;
      from initial diagnosis varying from 1 to 20 years (2). In addition, there is a subset of&#xD;
      patients with indolent CLL whose absolute lymphocyte count is less than 30 x 109/L and who&#xD;
      rarely die from the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLL is commonly staged according to the 5-point system proposed by Rai (Appendix B) and&#xD;
      co-workers. While Rai staging is a relatively good predictor of overall survival, it cannot&#xD;
      predict the prognosis in individual patients.&#xD;

    <description>Campath is administered using escalating doses and alternating injection sites. The dose is escalated as tolerated using 3mg,10mg,and 30mg, administered subcutaneously (SC) (if tolerated). When escalation to 30 mg dose is tolerated, all subsequent doses are administered at 30 mg SC 3 times per week at alternating injection sites for up to 8 weeks</description>
