      The purpose of this study is to analyze whether calorimetry compared to conventional methods&#xD;
      (i.e.blood culture systems)is superior to diagnose peritoneal dialysis related peritonitis.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peritonitis is still considered the most important complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD)&#xD;
      associated with high mortality, therapy failure, and healthcare expenses. We have recently&#xD;
      demonstrated that peritonitis continuous to be the most common reason for technical failure&#xD;
      in PD contributing equally to early and late failure; 12 of 279 patients died as a&#xD;
      consequence of PD associated peritonitis. The diagnosis of peritonitis is typically based on&#xD;
      clinical symptoms, which reflects an already advanced state of inflammation and disease.&#xD;
      Since the implementation of the blood culture system for detection of bacterial growth in PD&#xD;
      effluent more than ten years ago, no considerable progress has been made to improve diagnosis&#xD;
      of PD associated peritonitis. In our own PD population 36 out of 219 (16%) infectious&#xD;
      peritonitis episodes were culture-negative. Usually, detection time of microorganisms&#xD;
      requires at least 12 hours and time to pathogen identification more than 48 hours. Rapidly&#xD;
      dividing cells such as bacteria produce heat, which can be measured by calorimetry. As&#xD;
      recently shown, by our research group, calorimetry allows rapid and accurate diagnosis of&#xD;
      bacterial growth in cases of meningitis and in contaminated platelets. In pilot experiments,&#xD;
      we could show the potential and the feasibility of calorimetry for early and accurate&#xD;
      detection of microorganisms in PD fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that calorimetry of PD effluent can significantly improve the diagnosis of PD&#xD;
      associated peritonitis by early and accurate detection of pathogens. As compared to&#xD;
      traditional culture methods, calorimetry may (i) have a shorter time to positivity and (ii) a&#xD;
      higher sensitivity without loss of specificity. Specific aims are to evaluate if calorimetry:&#xD;
      (i) is more rapid in detection of microorganisms compared to conventional blood cultures,&#xD;
      (ii) is superior, regarding sensitivity and specificity, in detection of PD associated&#xD;
      peritonitis compared to the standard blood culture system and (iii) is a valuable tool for&#xD;
      pathogen identification by specific heat signal &quot;signatures&quot; received by calorimetry. The&#xD;
      Primary endpoint is the time to positivity of bacterial growth by calorimetry and&#xD;
      conventional blood cultures. The secondary endpoints are the accuracy (i.e. sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity) of detection rates of microorganism in PD fluid and the rate of consistency of&#xD;
      pathogen identification between calorimetry curves and conventional microbiological method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent, we will prospectively include in this open-labeled&#xD;
      comparative study all patients aged 16 years or older, who are performing PD at the&#xD;
      University Hospital in the time period from January 2009 through December 2011. PD fluid will&#xD;
      be submitted for conventional screening examination (cell count and differential) and&#xD;
      calorimetry (sterile MonovetteR tube) during routine visit. If PD peritonitis is suspected,&#xD;
      PD fluid will be also inoculated in aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles at bedside under&#xD;
      sterile conditions, each bottle with 10 ml of PD fluid. For calorimetry, 1 ml PD fluid will&#xD;
      be cultivated at 37°C in the calorimeter tubes, containing 2 ml of trypticase soy broth&#xD;
      (TSB). Conventional culture bottles and calorimeter tubes are incubated for a total of 6&#xD;
      days, after which culture and/or calorimetry are regarded negative. Medical records will be&#xD;
      prospectively abstracted for demographic characteristics, clinical, radiographic, laboratory&#xD;
      and microbiological data using a standardized case report form. The sample size calculation&#xD;
      was performed separately for primary and secondary endpoints on the following settings: 0.05,&#xD;
      power 80%, two-sided test. To reach statistical significant differences for the primary&#xD;
      endpoint, 286 samples are required for the study. For the secondary endpoint with p0 = 80%&#xD;
      (sensitivity of conventional blood cultures), p1 = 95% (sensitivity of calorimetry cultures),&#xD;
      255 samples are required. With an expected drop-out rate of 5%, approximately 300 samples&#xD;
      will be needed. With expected 120-180 samples/year study duration of approximately 2.5 to 3&#xD;
      years is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate that calorimetry will significantly improve the diagnosis of PD-associated&#xD;
      peritonitis. First (primary endpoint), we predict an earlier pathogen detection by&#xD;
      calorimetry; second (secondary endpoint), we expect to increase the sensitivity by 15%&#xD;
      without loss of specificity (&gt;90%). Furthermore, we assume that the most important pathogens,&#xD;
      seen in our PD population (i.e. S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococci,&#xD;
      enterobacteriaceae) may be identified within 12 hours (compared to &gt; 48 hours by conventional&#xD;
      microbiological methods) with an accuracy of 80%. The ultra-sensitive calorimetry technique&#xD;
      may diagnose PD associated peritonitis in an early disease stage with high accuracy. This&#xD;
      would be the basis of a rapid and targeted antibiotic therapy, which may significantly&#xD;
      influence the outcome of these patients.&#xD;
