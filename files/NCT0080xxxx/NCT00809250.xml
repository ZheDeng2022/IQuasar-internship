  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if the GM-K562/leukemia cell vaccine can&#xD;
      be safely given soon after allogeneic marrow or blood stem cell transplant. The&#xD;
      GM-K562/leukemia cell vaccine is composed of a cultured cell line that has been genetically&#xD;
      modified to secrete GM-CSF, a naturally occuring substance in the body that stimulates the&#xD;
      immune system. The vaccine is a mixture of the GM-K562 cells (radiated to prevent them from&#xD;
      growing in the participants body) with the participant's previously frozen and killed&#xD;
      leukemia cells. By mixing the GM-K562 with the leukemia cells, we would like to study whether&#xD;
      this vaccine combination will stimulate the participant's new immune system to recognize and&#xD;
      fight against their MDS/AML cancer cells.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      -  Participants will be given the GM-K562/Leukemia call vaccine as in injection under the&#xD;
           skin a total of six times. The first 3 vaccines will be given weekly and vaccines 4&#xD;
           through 6 will be given every other week. Therefore, it is expected that the vaccines&#xD;
           will be completed over a period of 9 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the 9 week vaccination period, participants will have physical exams to monitor&#xD;
           for any side effects or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Bone marrow biopsies will be&#xD;
           performed a the time of enrollment for this study, 4 weeks after completion of 6&#xD;
           GM-K562/Leukemia cell vaccines, and 1 year after the participants transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As a way of testing whether the GM-K562/Leukemia cell vaccine is triggering any immune&#xD;
           response to the participants leukemia, we will be injecting a small amount of leukemia&#xD;
           cells (after they are killed with radiation) under the participants skin to see if the&#xD;
           body will generate a reaction to the leukemia cells. This test is called a leukemia cell&#xD;
           delayed hypersensitivity test (DTH). This test will be performed three times during the&#xD;
           study, on the weeks of the 1st vaccine, 5th vaccine and 4 weeks after the 6th vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are a total of 5 skin biopsies required as part of this study. Biopsies will be&#xD;
           taken from the vaccination sites 2-3 days after the first and fifth vaccine. Similar&#xD;
           biopsies will be taken from the DTH sites after the 1st vaccination, 5th vaccination and&#xD;
           4-6 weeks after the 6th vaccination.&#xD;
