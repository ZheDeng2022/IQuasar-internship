      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of mammaglobin-A DNA vaccine in&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I open-label study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a plasmid&#xD;
      mammaglobin-A DNA vaccine. The plasmid mammaglobin-A DNA vaccine will be formulated as a&#xD;
      naked plasmid DNA vaccine (WUSM-MGBA-01). The hypothesis of this study is that the&#xD;
      mammaglobin-A DNA vaccine will be safe for human administration and capable of generating&#xD;
      measurable CD8 T cell responses to mammaglobin-A. The primary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      demonstrate the safety of the mammaglobin-A DNA vaccine. The secondary objective is to&#xD;
      evaluate the immunogenicity of the mammaglobin-A DNA vaccine as measured by ELISPOT analysis,&#xD;
      a surrogate for CD8 T cell function.&#xD;

        A patient will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if ALL of the following&#xD;
        criteria apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of invasive breast cancer.&#xD;
             Paraffin-embedded tissue or tissue sections must be available for immunohistochemistry&#xD;
             analysis to confirm mammaglobin-A expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have metastatic breast cancer that has been stable for at least 30 days.&#xD;
             This may include patients with measurable or evaluable disease by RECIST criteria, and&#xD;

             30 days of initiating therapy on study, and have resolved all toxicities experienced&#xD;
             from these treatments. Patients receiving hormonal therapy and supportive therapy with&#xD;

          -  Patient must be able and willing to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        A patient will be ineligible for inclusion in this study if ANY of the following criteria&#xD;
        apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has evidence of progressive breast cancer within the last 30 days.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient with known allergy, or history of serious adverse reaction to vaccines such as&#xD;
             anaphylaxis, hives, or respiratory difficulty.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with prior or currently active autoimmune disease requiring management with&#xD;
             immunosuppression. This includes inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis,&#xD;
