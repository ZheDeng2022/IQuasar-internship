  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if vitamin E can help treat prostate cancer. Vitamin&#xD;
      E acts primarily as an anti-oxidant. By decreasing the oxidation in the cancer cell, the&#xD;
      tumor cells may die. Vitamin E is a commonly used vitamin that has not been approved by the&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration for use in this type of cancer or for any known cancer. This&#xD;
      study will test the hypothesis that vitamin E, in the setting of an oxidative stress such as&#xD;
      smoking, can reduce prostate cancer related biomarkers in patients with localized prostate&#xD;
      cancer in the neoadjuvant setting.&#xD;

      - Prostate Cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in American men. It was estimated that nearly&#xD;
      235,000 men in the United States would be diagnosed with prostate cancer and nearly 27,000&#xD;
      men would die. The treatment of localized prostate cancer includes surgery, radiation&#xD;
      therapy, or watchful waiting. The relative benefits of these approaches is unclear and&#xD;
      treatment choices are individualized and often patient driven. There is currently no proven&#xD;
      benefit to receiving preoperative hormonal therapy for patients undergoing radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy. As opposed to patients undergoing external beam radiation therapy, for&#xD;
      patients undergoing brachytherapy pre treatment hormonal therapy is used in approximately 40%&#xD;
      of patients. Thus, these patients offer a unique opportunity to test novel agents in the&#xD;
      neoadjuvant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Vitamin E&#xD;
&#xD;
      The term vitamin E was introduced by Evans and Bishop to describe a dietary factor important&#xD;
      for reproduction in rats. Natural vitamin E includes two groups of closely related&#xD;
      fat-soluble compounds, the tocopherols and tocotrienols. Eight analogous compounds are widely&#xD;
      distributed in nature. Rich, natural sources of vitamin E are edible plant oils. Distinct&#xD;
      biological effects of different forms of vitamin E can be distinguished at a molecular level.&#xD;
      Vitamin E is the major hydrophobic chain-breaking antioxidant that prevents the propagation&#xD;
      of free radical reactions in the lipid components of membranes, vacuoles and plasma&#xD;
      lipoproteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an antioxidant, vitamin E acts in cell membranes where it prevents the propagation of free&#xD;
      radical reactions. Non-radical oxidation products are formed by the reaction between&#xD;
      alpha-tocopheryl radical and other free radicals, which are conjugated to glucuronic acid and&#xD;
      excreted through the bile or urine. Vitamin E is transported in plasma lipoproteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most studies of the safety of vitamin E supplementation have lasted for several months or&#xD;
      less, so there is little evidence for the long-term safety of vitamin E supplementation. The&#xD;
      Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine has set an upper tolerable intake level&#xD;
      (UL) for vitamin E at 1,000 mg (1,500 IU) for any form of supplementary alpha-tocopherol per&#xD;
      day. Based for the most part on the result of animal studies, the Food and Nutrition Board&#xD;
      decided that because vitamin E can act as an anticoagulant and may increase the risk of&#xD;
      bleeding problems this is the highest dose unlikely to result in bleeding problems&#xD;
      (http://dietary-supplements.info.nih.gov/factsheets/vitamin.asp).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of vitamin E used in the Selenium and vitamin E prostate cancer prevention trial&#xD;
      (the SELECT trial) was 400 IU per day and thus this is the dose chosen for this study.&#xD;

        <title>Reduce Biomarkers of Prostate Cancer (PSA Blood Level)</title>
        <description>PSA levels will be measured as a sensitive marker of anti-androgenic activity that is a critical endpoint to be measured in this study. PSA blood levels will be determined at the initiation and completion of Vitamin E supplementation from blood obtained at these time points. A clinical reference laboratory will perform blood PSA analysis and will be compared with plasma cholesterol levels as a relative control.</description>

Patients will continue on this treatment from the time of randomization to the day before surgery or the brachytherapy procedure. This is expected to be between 4 to 6 weeks.
