      Patients with locally advanced (IIIB with effusion) or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC), EGFR FISH positive, candidate for a first-line platinum-based chemotherapy will be&#xD;
      considered eligible for the trial. After evaluation of inclusion and exclusion criteria, and&#xD;
      after signature of informed consent form, all eligible patients will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy (control arm) or gefitinib (250 mg daily dose-experimental arm).&#xD;
      Before, and in every case, no more than 4 weeks before study entry, all eligible patients&#xD;
      will receive a complete disease staging, including thoracic and abdominal CT-scan, and blood&#xD;
      sampling. Bronchoscopy will be done if not previously performed. Bone scan and brain CT-scan&#xD;
      will be performed only if clinically indicated. Disease assessment will be performed every 6&#xD;
      weeks (every 2 cycles) for the first 6 cycles, and thereafter every 3 months, with a&#xD;
      confirmatory evaluation in all patients with response or disease stabilization no less than 4&#xD;
      weeks after the response assessment, according to RECIST Criteria. A complete disease&#xD;
      staging, including the above mentioned procedures, will be performed in case of progressive&#xD;
      disease, and, in every cases, when patient withdrawals the trial. Following completion of&#xD;
      protocol therapy, patients will be followed every 3 months.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, EGFR FISH positive, candidate for&#xD;
             a first-line platinum-based chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of non-squamous NSCLC. Availability of tumor tissue&#xD;
             for EGFR FISH analysis is mandatory&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stage IIIB (with effusion) or stage IV or disease relapsed after surgery or&#xD;
             radiotherapy and in any case not suitable for radiotherapy or surgery with curative&#xD;
             intent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EGFR FISH positive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of at least one measurable/evaluable not previously irradiated lesion&#xD;
             according to RECIST criteria. Previously irradiated lesion(s) are allowed only if&#xD;
             progressing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance Status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
