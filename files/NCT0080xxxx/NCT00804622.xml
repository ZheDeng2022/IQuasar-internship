  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of 12&#xD;
      weeks of treatment with telbivudine 600 mg daily plus tenofovir DF 300 mg once daily (QD)&#xD;
      taken together versus tenofovir DF 300 mg once daily (QD) or versus telbivudine 600 mg&#xD;
      monotherapy daily (QD). This is an open-labeled, active controlled, viral kinetics study&#xD;
      which means the subjects and study doctor will know what study drug subjects have been&#xD;
      assigned. This study is open to male and female subjects, &lt;40 years of age, who have been&#xD;
      infected with HBV for at least 6 months and have not received oral treatment for HBV.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of therapy for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is suppression of viral&#xD;
      replication. Long-term suppression of serum HBV DNA is likely to reduce progression to&#xD;
      cirrhosis and hepatic decompensation and decrease the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
      Conventional treatment of chronic hepatitis B is limited by low rates of sustained hepatitis&#xD;
      B virus DNA suppression and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion, increasing rates of&#xD;
      drug resistance to the oral agents, and poor tolerability of interferon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, several nucleoside/nucleotide analogues are available for treatment of CHB.&#xD;
      Typically, treatment is continued indefinitely since discontinuation is usually associated&#xD;
      with relapse . However, the safety implications related to long term treatment are still&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously published studies using combinations (peginterferon alpha-2a + lamivudine)&#xD;
      (Marcellin 2004; Lau 2005; Janssen 2005) have shown combinations to be more potent in HBeAg&#xD;
      loss at the end of dosing, than either agent used as monotherapy; off-treatment differences,&#xD;
      however, did not persist. There are no treatment paradigms as yet of combination therapy with&#xD;
      two nucleoside analogues for use in treatment-naive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, there is an unmet need for improved anti-HBV therapy and there are still several&#xD;
      controversies such as treatment options, potential role of combination therapy versus&#xD;
      monotherapy and optimal duration of therapy, among others. Clinical trials are underway to&#xD;
      answer some of these questions. This study aims to assess whether or not combination therapy&#xD;
      with telbuvudine and tenofovir DF has superior antiviral efficacy when compared to tenofovir&#xD;
      DF or telbuvidine monotherapy. The study will also determine the safety of the combination of&#xD;
      telbivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Patients&#xD;
      in the immunotolerant phase of CHB will be include in the study. This phase is characterized&#xD;
      for high viremia and normal transaminases. Since these patients are not considered as&#xD;
      candidates for CHB therapy according to international guidelines (Lok et al 2007), treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation after 12 weeks does not raise any unethical implications.&#xD;

      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to characterize the reduction in HBV DNA level from&#xD;
      Baseline to week 12 of telbivudine plus tenofovir DF combination therapy versus telbivudine&#xD;
      or tenofovir DF monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of the study include describing the following for telbivudine plus&#xD;
      tenofovir DF combination therapy versus telbivudine or tenofovir DF monotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. reduction in HBV DNA level from Baseline to Weeks 2, 4, and 8&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. characterization of early viral kinetics through estimation of various parameters such&#xD;
           as efficiency of blocking new virus production, and half-lives of free virions and&#xD;
           infected heptocytes&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. % patients who are PCR negative at Week 12 (defined as &lt;25 copies/mL)&#xD;

&#xD;
        1. To explore HBeAg and HBsAg levels over the treatment period as an additional potential&#xD;
           predictor of efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore additional potential early serological and immunological markers for&#xD;
           prediction of efficacy or safety.&#xD;
