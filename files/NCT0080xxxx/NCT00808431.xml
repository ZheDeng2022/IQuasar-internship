      Preventing the onset of pediatric obesity and diabetes in Latino families&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial of a family-based community&#xD;
      centered intervention. One-hundred Latino families with children ages 3-5 will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated to either the intervention group (a 3-month skills building program to improve&#xD;
      nutrition and aerobic activity for child-parent dyads) or a control group (literacy&#xD;
      promotion). Through an active partnership with Nashville Metro Parks and Recreation and the&#xD;
      Division of General Pediatrics at the Vanderbilt Children's Hospital, the investigators will:&#xD;
      1) Implement an intervention for Latino families with young children that includes parent&#xD;
      training, behavior modification training, nutrition education, and physical activity&#xD;
      promotion; 2) Evaluate how this intervention affects growth trajectories in children; 3)&#xD;
      Evaluate how this intervention affects parenting practices for Latino families to improve&#xD;
      nutrition and physical activity; and 4) Evaluate the ability to link families into a&#xD;
      pediatric medical home if they have none identified. By developing innovative family-focused&#xD;
      interventions, finding solutions to health conditions such as obesity and diabetes could be&#xD;
      realized-con la familia.&#xD;

      Obesity is a well-known risk factor for the development of diabetes. Obesity rates have&#xD;
      rapidly increased over the past three decades for all Americans and have doubled for&#xD;
      children. Latino children experience obesity at disproportionate rates. The most promising&#xD;
      obesity interventions have focused on having children partner with a parent to set goals.&#xD;
      Latino cultural norms emphasizing family provide a unique opportunity to develop&#xD;
      family-centered interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit 100 families (child-parent dyad) via a multi-pronged strategy including:&#xD;
      provision of bilingual informational flyers; announcements on a Spanish radio program; and&#xD;
      additional strategies developed by key community leaders in the Nolensville corridor. This&#xD;
      recruitment approach has been successful for us in the past. Once recruited into the program,&#xD;
      parent-child dyads will be randomly allocated to either the intervention group or control&#xD;
      group (described below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty (50) families will be randomly allocated to receive the Salud Con La Familia skills&#xD;
      building curriculum at Coleman Community Center, which will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Twelve (12) weekly 60-minute sessions in the recreation center (Refer to Table 1). The&#xD;
           parent-child dyad will participate in 4 sessions from the En Sus Marcas curriculum,&#xD;
           which was just tested by this study team (Barkin, PI). These sessions emphasize skills&#xD;
           building around parenting, behavior modification, daily physical activity, and decreased&#xD;
           sedentary activity. To this we will add 8 sessions from the Salud, Salsa, y Sabor25&#xD;
           curriculum, a best-practice program to improve nutrition and energy balance for Latino&#xD;
           families, designed by the National Latino Children's Institute (NLCI) but not yet&#xD;
           utilized in Tennessee. The combination of these two promising curricula results in a&#xD;
           comprehensive program that includes all ADA-recommended elements of effective&#xD;
           interventions for pediatric overweight.23 All sessions will be led by the same bilingual&#xD;
           facilitators to ensure maximum fidelity and minimal difference between the information&#xD;
           provided to participants. While this program has been designed in active partnership&#xD;
           with Nashville Metro Parks and Recreation, we are also currently conducting a listening&#xD;
           tour with key informants from the Nolensville community to provide further input into&#xD;
           the content and implementation of the Salud Con La Familia approach. Throughout,&#xD;
           emphasis is placed on healthy lifestyles, not on weight loss or obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. At the end of each session, the study team will facilitate creating a parent-child&#xD;
           contract to develop concrete weekly goals around nutrition and physical activity. Such&#xD;
           contracts are integral to behavior modification.26&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The study team will assess if families have an identified pediatric medical home and use&#xD;
           this for preventive health visits. If no medical home is identified, the team will&#xD;
           assist with this health connection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group Fifty (50) families will be allocated to participate monthly with a literacy&#xD;
      promotion skills-building curriculum. They will receive flyers when family events are offered&#xD;
      at the community center. They will participate in data collection at the same time-points as&#xD;
      the intervention families. Refer to Table 2 for our project timeline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will include: growth trajectories, parenting practices, activity patterns, and link&#xD;
      to medical home.&#xD;
