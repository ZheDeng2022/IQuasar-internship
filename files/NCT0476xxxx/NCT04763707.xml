  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a global importance due to its high rate of progression&#xD;
      and high mortality rates. Significant risk factors for the development of HCC are metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome, obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM). Dysregulation of adipose tissue derived&#xD;
      hormones(adipocytokines/adipokines) might also be involved in obesity-related liver&#xD;
      carcinogenesis &amp; due to the wide spectrum of visfatin and vaspin activities ,we focus in this&#xD;
      study on their potential role in patients with HCV-related liver cirrhosis with and without&#xD;
      HCC on top.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite improvements in HCC therapy, the prognosis for HCC patients remains poor due to a&#xD;
      high incidence of recurrence. Early diagnosis can significantly improve the overall survival&#xD;
      of HCC patients. However, currently available diagnostic markers are still inadequate and&#xD;
      limited by their low sensitivity and specificity. For instance, the gold standard marker&#xD;
      alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) has a false negative rate up to 40% for early stage of HCC. It is&#xD;
      worthy to mention that the level of AFP was reported in a normal range of 25% of patients&#xD;
      with advanced HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, AFP has been excluded from being a marker for the diagnosis of HCC by Practice&#xD;
      Guidelines of the American Association for the study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and confirmed&#xD;
      by other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These discrepancies suggest the need of discovering new reliable diagnostic markers for&#xD;
      patients with HCC. An improved understanding of the pathogenesis of HCC development would&#xD;
      facilitate the development of more effective outcomes for the diagnosis and treatment of HCC&#xD;
      at earlier stages.&#xD;

        A total of 70 patients with HCV-related liver cirrhosis attending the outpatient clinic or&#xD;
        inpatient section of the department will be included in the study, patients will be&#xD;
        categorized into 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  40 HCV-related liver cirrhosis patients with HCC on top (Group 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  30 HCV-related liver cirrhosis patients(Group 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In addition, 20 healthy volunteers will be included as controls(Group 3).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The diagnosis of CHC will be based on positive HCV antibodies by enzyme-linked&#xD;
             immunosorbent assay(ELIZA)&amp; HCV RNA by Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) for more than&#xD;
             6 months. The diagnosis of liver cirrhosis will be based on clinical data and findings&#xD;
             on abdominal ultrasound. The diagnosis of HCC will be based on the typical features of&#xD;
             dynamic imaging by triphasic CT with or without elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)&#xD;
