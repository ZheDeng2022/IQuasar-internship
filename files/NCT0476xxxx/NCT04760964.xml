  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MUSIC study is a multi-centre, longitudinal study set in the real world IBD clinical&#xD;
      setting to investigate and develop a new biomarker approach that aims to inform both patients&#xD;
      and clinicians of the current state of the affected gut lining (how inflamed or whether the&#xD;
      bowel wall has completely healed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This new biomarker approach will study a panel of molecular signs in IBD patients' blood,&#xD;
      stools and biopsies that will be correlated to the current gold standard of direct gut visual&#xD;
      examination using ileo-colonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy tests (a fibre-optic&#xD;
      examination of the lower small bowel and large bowel). Here, the state and appearances of IBD&#xD;
      patients' gut lining will be assessed over one year in response to treatment given to them by&#xD;
      their NHS IBD consultant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This approach will focus on the role of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), also&#xD;
      known as 'danger signals'. DAMPs are found in our own cells and are released during tissue&#xD;
      stress or injury. Like signals from bacteria, they can trigger inflammation. In the MUSIC&#xD;
      study, blood, stool, saliva and gut samples obtained from participants during active IBD and&#xD;
      in clinical remission will be used in order to understand how DAMPs contribute to the&#xD;
      development of gut inflammation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that mitochondrial DAMPs are good mechanistic biomarkers for mucosal&#xD;
      inflammation and healing in IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete mucosal healing (total resolution and absence of ulcerations in the gut) is the most&#xD;
      sought-after treatment target with the best long-term implication in prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to now IBD clinicians rely on (1) clinical symptoms (how patients feel, their bowel habit,&#xD;
      presence of blood in stools), (2) clinical tests such as stool calprotectin (FC) and blood&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP) to inform both themselves and the patients, how well the drug&#xD;
      treatment is working and importantly, whether the ulcers and inflammation seen in the gut&#xD;
      lining have healed or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current evidence shows that these approaches are not fully informative. For example, 30% of&#xD;
      patients with significant subjective improvement in their symptoms following treatment of&#xD;
      active CD have evidence of active inflammation in their gut lining when further assessed with&#xD;
      an ileo-colonoscopy. Blood and stool tests to predict mucosal healing are only useful in&#xD;
      around 60-70% and very limited, in guiding the doctors in how severely inflamed the bowel&#xD;
      wall is during active IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct visualisation using ileo-colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy is the most accurate&#xD;
      approach to assess disease activity and mucosal healing in response to medical treatment. By&#xD;
      knowing precisely, how the gut wall inflammation is responding to treatment, the clinician&#xD;
      can accurately manage the IBD patient (by either changing the dose and type of treatment, and&#xD;
      whether to carry on with expensive, strong medications with potentially serious side&#xD;
      effects). However, in the real world, follow-up endoscopic tests are difficult to carry out&#xD;
      as they are expensive and we lack the capacity to undertake these examinations within NHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Goals&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal for the MUSIC study is to investigate the role of mitochondrial DAMPs in the&#xD;
      clinic as an indicator of gut inflammation and subsequent mucosal healing in response to&#xD;
      medical treatment in IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, further scientific studies will be carried out using blood, stool, saliva and gut&#xD;
      biopsy samples to investigate how mitochondrial DAMPs (and all known biomarkers and&#xD;
      biological data such as genetics) contribute to the abnormal development of gut inflammation&#xD;
      in IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do mitochondrial DAMPs predict the activity and severity of IBD-inflammation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does normalisation of mitochondrial DAMPs reflect complete endoscopic mucosal healing in&#xD;
           IBD?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How do mitochondrial DAMPs compare to current biomarkers (FC, CRP) and clinical symptoms&#xD;
           (HBI/Mayo Score) in assessing IBD inflammation and mucosal healing?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can a simple decision-making model be developed to predict mucosal healing based on&#xD;
           mitochondrial DAMPs, together with relevant biological data such as genetics, blood&#xD;
           transcriptomics, microbiome; and current clinical biomarkers such as calprotectin,&#xD;
           faecal haemoglobin and blood CRP?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How are mitochondrial DAMPs released from cells in the IBD gut?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What types of cells are important in mitochondrial DAMP release? There are many forms of&#xD;
           inflammatory cells in affected IBD gut (e.g. macrophage, epithelial, neutrophils). It is&#xD;
           possible that different cell types may contain more inflammatory DAMPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which type of mitochondrial DAMPs are important in causing inflammation? Can&#xD;
           mitochondrial DAMPs pinpoint a specific underlying genetic susceptibility (e.g.&#xD;
           autophagy) or inflammatory mechanism in IBD?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      The focus is to investigate mitochondrial DAMPs' utility in two clinically relevant&#xD;
      scenarios: (a) How severe or active is the disease? (b) How well are we treating IBD? - with&#xD;
      endoscopic endpoints of mucosal inflammation and healing respectively. The Simple Endoscopic&#xD;
      Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) and Endoscopic Mayo Score (eMS) will be used for CD and UC&#xD;
      respectively. Both have been validated and used widely in research and in clinical trials. By&#xD;
      using these objective endoscopic endpoints, mtDAMPs (and in combination with current&#xD;
      biomarkers FC and CRP) can be tested across a range of mucosal inflammation (full healing to&#xD;
      severe).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to this, it will be investigated if mitochondrial DAMPs can identify a&#xD;
      subclinical pathogenic mechanism (e.g. [a] defective autophagy to clear damaged mitochondria;&#xD;
      [b] de-regulated innate immune response to mitochondrial DAMPs.) These data will pave the way&#xD;
      for future use of mitochondrial DAMP biomarkers as part of a stratified approach for new&#xD;
      treatments targeted at mitochondrial DAMPs and their downstream inflammatory mechanisms in&#xD;
      IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presently within usual NHS care, all patients with active IBD, especially those to be&#xD;
      initiated on biologic or immunomodulator treatment, are followed up where they will have&#xD;
      documentation of disease activity (Harvey Bradshaw Index [HBI] or UC Mayo Score [MS], stool&#xD;
      calprotectin, C-reactive protein, albumin and blood count) to assess their well-being and&#xD;
      response to medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With MUSIC, patients will be followed up prospectively (aligning the usual NHS clinical care&#xD;
      above) and will receive additional endoscopic follow-up to assess mucosal healing in response&#xD;
      to medical treatment. Thus, the MUSIC study will incorporate a prospective endoscopic&#xD;
      evaluation of mucosal inflammation and mucosal healing into IBD clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment and subsequent clinical data and sample collection will take place at 0, 3,&#xD;
      6, 9 and 12 months.&#xD;

        However, suitable potential participants must have active IBD based on clinical evaluation&#xD;
        of referring clinician and any one of the below from investigations which have been carried&#xD;
        out within 6 weeks of screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. FC level of &gt;100ug/g&#xD;

             immunomodulator or biologics)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. IBD patients on established medical treatments (biologics or immunomodulators) that&#xD;
             require a change due to poor control of disease activity&#xD;
