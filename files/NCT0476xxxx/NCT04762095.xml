      Specific Quality of Life Scale (MYQOL). In the study, an 8-week Mindfulness Stress Reduction&#xD;
      Program was applied to the women in the experimental group. In the study, mid-test and&#xD;
      post-test (MAAS, MSAS, MYQOL) were applied 8 and 16 weeks after the pre-test. Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics, independent groups t test, chi-square test, ANOVA, Mauchly's test and Cronbach&#xD;
