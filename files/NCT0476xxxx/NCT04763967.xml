  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospectively-controlled clinical trial that will examine the rate of positive&#xD;
      UTI cases among pediatrics entered into the Emergency Department and whose urine is withdrawn&#xD;
      using the PedSCath Pediatric Sampling Catheter. The rate of postive UTI will be compared&#xD;
      against the control population, whose urine withdrawal would have been performed with&#xD;
      Standard of Care devices.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multi-center, retrospective-controlled, clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anonymized retrospective data from two clinical sites, NewYork-Presbyterian Queens and Weill&#xD;
      Cornell Medical College, from 2016 and 2018 will be used to define the control subject&#xD;
      population, who were assessed for urinary tract infection (UTI) based on a urine sample taken&#xD;
      according to Standard of Care (SoC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects entering the emergency department (ED) generally require that a urine specimen is&#xD;
      obtained and tested to determine whether there is an active infection in the bladder.&#xD;
      Emergency department personnel will confirm the possibility of UTI based on symptoms and&#xD;
      inform the parents/guardians of the potential for study participation using the PedSCath. The&#xD;
      physician will assess the subject based on Inclusion and Exclusion criteria, including&#xD;
      non-toilet training and an upper age limit of 3 years. If determined that the subject meets&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, the physician will inform the parents/guardians of the subject&#xD;
      about the study and request informed consent if the parents/guardians wish their child to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the granting of Informed Consent, subjects will be enrolled in the study within the&#xD;
      treatment arm and a urine sample of 2-3 ml will be taken via the PedSCath. All study&#xD;
      assessments, from enrollment through urine sample collection, will occur over a single visit&#xD;
      to the ED. Per standard of care, any treatment following the diagnosis will be performed by&#xD;
      hospital staff based on physician assessment. Up to 3 run-in subjects per PedSCath user will&#xD;
      be treated with PedSCath to allow PedSCath users to become familiar with PedSCath mechanism.&#xD;
