    <textblock>
      Speed is one of the most important physical capacities for many sports, especially those that&#xD;
      include speed and power as a major element, and plays a major role on performance. Running&#xD;
      speed improvement is one of the most basic components of a sprint and power athlete's&#xD;
      training program. One of the most commonly used strategies to improve the initial&#xD;
      acceleration phase, is resisted sprint training. Sprinting is performed through the&#xD;
      stretch-shortening cycle and highly includes the component of eccentric muscle contraction,&#xD;
      which can lead to exercise induced muscle damage (EIMD). This phenomenon includes symptoms&#xD;
      such as plasma CK elevation, delayed onset of muscle soreness, reduction in force production&#xD;
      and a reduction in agility and speed. However, despite the fact that sprint training can&#xD;
      cause EIMD symptoms and a performance reduction the following days, research evidence on the&#xD;
      recovery kinetics after sprint training are scarce. However, such information is critical for&#xD;
      coaches and athletes, in order to effectively design a training program and incorporate the&#xD;
      training components in the training microcycle, to avoid injuries and maximize performance.&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to examine the recovery kinetics of EIMD indices, muscle&#xD;
      performance and neuromuscular fatigue, after different sprint training protocols.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Speed is one of the most important physical capacities for many sports, especially those that&#xD;
      include speed and power as a major element, and plays a major role on performance. Thus,&#xD;
      running speed improvement consists one of the most basic aims of a sprinter's and a power&#xD;
      athlete's training program. One of the most commonly used strategies to improve the initial&#xD;
      acceleration phase, is resisted sprint training. Evidence suggests that resisted sprint&#xD;
      training is more effective in improving acceleration compared to sprint training without&#xD;
      additional load. Sprinting is performed through the stretch-shortening cycle, where the&#xD;
      pre-activated muscle is first stretched (eccentric action) and then followed by the&#xD;
      shortening (concentric) action. Thus, sprint training highly includes the component of&#xD;
      eccentric contraction. However, eccentric muscle action, especially when unaccustomed, can&#xD;
      lead to exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD). Although concentric and isometric exercise may&#xD;
      also lead to muscle injury, the amount of damage after eccentric muscle contractions is&#xD;
      greater. EIMD, amongst others, is accompanied by increased levels of creatine kinase (CK)&#xD;
      into the circulation, increased delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS), reduction of force&#xD;
      production, reduction of agility and speed. Nevertheless, despite the fact that sprint&#xD;
      training comprises eccentric muscle actions and consequently can lead to muscle injury and&#xD;
      muscle performance reduction during the following days, the recovery kinetics after acute&#xD;
      sprint training have not been adequately studied. However, such information is critical for&#xD;
      both coaches and athletes to effectively design the training microcycles and incorporate the&#xD;
      training components, as well as to reduce injury risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to examine the recovery kinetics of EIMD indices, muscle&#xD;
      performance and neuromuscular fatigue, after different sprint training protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a preliminary power analysis (a probability error of 0.05, and a statistical&#xD;
      power of 80%), a sample size of 8 - 10 subjects per group was considered appropriate in order&#xD;
      to detect statistically meaningful changes between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed in a randomized, cross over, repeated measures design. During the&#xD;
      first 1st and 2nd visit, all participants will sign an informed consent form after they will&#xD;
      be informed about all the benefits and risks of the study and they will fill in and sign a&#xD;
      medical history questionnaire. Fasting blood samples will be collected in order to estimate&#xD;
      muscle damage concentration markers. Participants will be instructed by a dietitian how to&#xD;
      record a 7-days diet recalls to ensure that they do not consume to greater extent nutrients&#xD;
      that may affect EIMD and fatigue (e.g. antioxidants, amino acids, etc.) and to ensure that&#xD;
      the energy intake during the trials will be the same. Assessment of body mass and body&#xD;
      height, body composition, and aerobic capacity (VO2max), will be performed. Running speed of&#xD;
      10 m, 20 m and 30 m sprint will be measured on a track and field stadium. Squat jump and&#xD;
      countermovement jump will be performed on a force platform to assess jump height, ground&#xD;
      reaction force, peak and mean power, vertical stiffness and peak rate of force development;&#xD;
      at the same time, peak and mean normalized EMG during the concentric phase of the squat jump,&#xD;
      and during eccentric and concentric phases of the counter movement jump, for the vastus&#xD;
      lateralis, biceps femoris, gastrocnemius, and gluteus maximum muscles will be assessed. The&#xD;
      peak concentric, eccentric and isometric isokinetic torque of the knee flexors and extensors,&#xD;
      in both limbs will be evaluated on an isokinetic dynamometer at 60°/sec. Maximal voluntary&#xD;
      isometric contraction (MVIC) of the knee extensors at 65o in both limbs, as well as the&#xD;
      fatigue rate during MVIC through the percent drop of peak torque between the first and the&#xD;
      last three seconds of a 10-sec MVIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 3rd visit, participants will be randomly assigned into, and perform one of the&#xD;
      four different conditions of the study design: a) unresisted sprint training, b) resisted&#xD;
      sprint training with a load of 10% of body weight (BW), c) resisted sprint training with a&#xD;
      load of 20% of BW d) control condition. Prior to each experimental protocol, assessment of&#xD;
      DOMS in the knee flexors (KF) and extensors (KE) of both limbs, as well as blood lactate&#xD;
      assessment will be performed. Additionally, DOMS of KF and KE, running speed at 10 m, 20 m&#xD;
      and 30 m sprint, peak concentric, eccentric and isometric isokinetic torque, squat and&#xD;
      countermovement jump height, as well as ground reaction force, peak and mean power, vertical&#xD;
      stiffness and peak rate of force development during squat and countermovement jump, alongside&#xD;
      with peak and mean normalized electromyography (EMG) during the concentric phase of the squat&#xD;
      jump, and during eccentric and concentric phases of the counter movement jump, for the vastus&#xD;
      lateralis, biceps femoris, gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior muscles will be assessed&#xD;
      immediately after, 24h, 48h and 72h after the end of the trial. MVIC of the knee extensors of&#xD;
      both limbs, as well as the fatigue rate during MVIC will also be assessed at 1h, 2h and 3h,&#xD;
      as well as 24h, 48h, and 72h after the end of the trial. Blood lactate will also be assessed&#xD;
      at 4 min, while creatine kinase at 24h, 48h, and 72h after the end of the trial. The exact&#xD;
      above procedures will be repeated by the participants during the remaining three experimental&#xD;
      trials (7th - 10th, 11th - 13th, and 14th - 16th visits).&#xD;
