    <textblock>
      It is necessary to generate more evidence on the outcome of contemporary protocols for&#xD;
      full-arch rehabilitations supported by implants in immediate function in areas with limited&#xD;
      quantity and density bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research project aims to investigate the outcome of fixed prosthetic restorations&#xD;
      supported by implants in immediate function for full-arch rehabilitation through the All-on-4&#xD;
      concept contemporary protocol, specifically: implant survival and success, prosthetic&#xD;
      survival, marginal bone level and marginal bone level changes, soft tissue health parameters&#xD;
      (Plaque index, Bleeding index, Pocket depth), incidence of biological and mechanical&#xD;
      complications. A prospective cohort study design will be used in the investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample of this study is estimated to consist in 43 patients rehabilitated with full-arch&#xD;
      fixed prosthetic rehabilitations supported by implants in immediate function (All-on-4&#xD;
      concept) with 144 dental implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cohort will be evaluated between baseline and 3 years of follow-up.&#xD;

      Problem The fixed prosthetic rehabilitation through implants in immediate function is&#xD;
      documented without prejudice of the outcome when compared to 2-stage surgery.1 One of the&#xD;
      protocols for full-arch fixed prosthetic rehabilitation supported by implants in immediate&#xD;
      function is the All-on-Four concept, which is documented with good long-term outcomes in both&#xD;
      jaws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the protocols suffered a constant evolution throughout the 20 years of&#xD;
      development of the All-on-4 concept. Evidence on the outcome full-arch rehabilitations&#xD;
      supported by implants in immediate function through the All-n-4 concept contemporary protocol&#xD;
      is needed. Therefore, the aim of this study was to document the rehabilitation of com¬pletely&#xD;
      edentulous jaws through the contemporary All-on-4 concept rehabilitation protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the medium-term outcome (3 years) of full arch rehabilitations supported by&#xD;
           implants in immediate function through the contemporary All-on-4 protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To report the results&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints Primary endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prosthetic and implant survival over a 3-year follow-up period Secondary endpoint To&#xD;
           evaluate Marginal Bone Level (MBL), Marginal Bone Level Changes 12, 24 and 36 months&#xD;
           after procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess Soft tissue health parameters (Plaque index, Bleeding index, Pocket Depth)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance This investigation is important due to the need of studies reporting the outcome&#xD;
      of full-arch rehabilitations supported by implants in immediate function through the All-on-4&#xD;
      concept contemporary protocol: Surgical Prosthetic and Maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The hypothesis to evaluate will be the distribution of survival, marginal bone&#xD;
      resorption, incidence of biological and mechanical complications among the full-arch&#xD;
      rehabilitations supported by implants in immediate function through the All-on-4 concept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods Methodology This study will be performed at Maló Clinic in Lisbon. It&#xD;
      is estimated to last for approximately 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design to be used will be a prospective single cohort study to evaluate the&#xD;
      medium-term outcome of full-arch rehabilitations supported by implants in immediate function&#xD;
      through the All-on-4 concept contemporary protocol (MALO CLINIC Protocol)2-4, composed of the&#xD;
      Surgical, Prosthodontic and Maintenance protocols using dental implants and remaining&#xD;
      prosthetic components from Nobel Biocare. A total of 36 subjects are planned to be included&#xD;
      in the study over a recruitment period of 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cohort will be evaluated between baseline and 3 years of function, regarding survival and&#xD;
      clinical parameters established in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no risk for the participants, has the information will be collected using the&#xD;
      standard of care during the implant maintenance appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population and Sample The population of this study consists in individuals eligible for&#xD;
      full-arch rehabilitations with dental implants in immediate function through the All-on-4&#xD;
      concept, of both genders, without age restrictions, in any arch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample of this study will consist in patients submitted to full-arch rehabilitations&#xD;
      through the All-on-4 concept contemporary protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with enough bone quantity to be rehabilitated through the contemporary All-on-4&#xD;
           protocol using standard implants (7 to 25 mm of length);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients that are interested in performing their follow-up and maintenance program at&#xD;
           Maló Clinic);&#xD;

      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the data will be treated by means of descriptive and inferential statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be treated using the SPSS software version 25.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implant and prosthetic survival will be computed through life tables. Marginal bone loss will&#xD;
      be evaluated using descriptive statistics: average values with 95% confidence intervals and&#xD;
      standard deviations will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of biological, mechanical and prosthetic complications will be evaluated using&#xD;
      descriptive statistics (frequencies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An adverse event is defined as any undesirable clinical occurrence in a subject whether it is&#xD;
      considered to be device related or not. If the adverse event is regarded as device related it&#xD;
      is stated as an adverse device effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An adverse event or adverse device effect may be serious\severe or non-serious\non-severe.&#xD;
      If, as result of an adverse event during a clinical investigation, a subject has to be&#xD;
      hospitalized, or their hospitalization is unduly prolonged due to potential disability or&#xD;
      danger to life due to an intervention has been required or the event is terminal, the adverse&#xD;
      event or adverse effect is regarded as serious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All serious adverse events must be reported to the Ethic Committee without any delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation will be carried out in accordance to the ethical principles and guidelines&#xD;
      stated in the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigation should be evaluated and approved by a Local Ethical Committee prior to&#xD;
      including the first subject in the investigation. The application to the Ethic Committee is&#xD;
      to be made by the responsible investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients' data will be registered in a computer database, using a code system. This means&#xD;
      that the identity of each subject will be unknown to the investigators. The patients' medical&#xD;
      records and radiographs will be used exclusively for data collection. No extra interventions&#xD;
      for study purposes will be performed to any patient. No recalls will be performed at any time&#xD;
      with the intention of specifically collecting information from the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also of great importance that each subject receives oral and written information about&#xD;
      the investigation, and that she/he must only participate if they truly want to do so. Also,&#xD;
      the subjects must be aware of the fact that they can withdraw from the investigation at any&#xD;
      time and for any reason without jeopardizing their future treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the subjects should be made aware of the fact that the data from his/her&#xD;
      treatment will be registered in a computer database, but that she/he will only be registered&#xD;
      through a code system. This means that the identity of each subject will be unknown to all&#xD;
      others than the doctor performing the treatment. Each subject is entitled to take part of the&#xD;
      information stored about her/his treatment. This information is to be handed out by the&#xD;
      treating doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For more information on subject information, consent and data, please see Appendix 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Database management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected from the forms will be introduced in a digital database (Microsoft Office&#xD;
      Excel 2003®). The database management will be the responsibility of the Malo Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring Monitoring will be carried out by the Ethical Committee. The investigator will&#xD;
      issue a final report that will be distributed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Archiving the documents The data will be archived by the Malo Clinic and will be kept for 8&#xD;
      years after the completion of the study. After this time, the digital database will be&#xD;
      erased.&#xD;
