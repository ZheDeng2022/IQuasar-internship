  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The severity of psoriasis can be influenced by a great variety of factors including extent of&#xD;
      the disease, lesions location and impact on quality of life. The current standard of care for&#xD;
      psoriasis is focusing on the reduction of the skin symptoms as defined by the PASI, somewhat&#xD;
      setting asides the patient's feelings in terms of which aspects of his/her life are affected&#xD;
      by the disease. Despite the fact that multiple patient reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaires&#xD;
      are available to evaluate the impact of the disease on patients' quality of life, only few&#xD;
      items address the subjective impact of skin disease. Among the available PROs the Dermatology&#xD;
      Life Quality Index (DLQI) is the most frequently used. It is a standardized tool designed to&#xD;
      cover a broad range of dermatologic afflictions but lacks specificity towards the effect of&#xD;
      psoriasis on quality of life. The DLQI is composed of ten questions grouped in 6 domains&#xD;
      &quot;symptoms and feelings&quot;, &quot;daily activities&quot;, &quot;leisure&quot;, &quot;work/school&quot;, &quot;personal&#xD;
      relationships&quot; and &quot;treatment&quot;. Each answer is graded from 0 to 3. The DLQI score is&#xD;
      calculated by adding the score of each question, resulting in a maximum score of 30 and a&#xD;
      minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. A score higher than&#xD;
      10 indicates that the patient's life is being severely affected by their skin disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of its limitations, some patients cannot seem to completely restore a normal quality&#xD;
      of life (e.g. DLQI 0-1) even though their reached a perfect PASI score (100). This phenomenon&#xD;
      may be explained by the fact that the patient's own perception can be different from the&#xD;
      physician's perspective and may have changed in time, between follow-ups. These are as many&#xD;
      reasons as why it is highly difficult to accurately fathom the therapeutic expectations of&#xD;
      the psoriasis patients. The standard tools currently in use are not able to assess the&#xD;
      perception of the disease by the patient its evolution over time. In addition, it is widely&#xD;
      recognized that alexithymia is more prevalent in the psoriasis patients than in the general&#xD;
      population and patients with alexithymia appear to suffer higher psoriasis burden as they&#xD;
      have more difficulties to express their expectations. Since patients struggle to recognize&#xD;
      and verbalize their emotions, it can be useful and informative to offer patients a variety of&#xD;
      verbatim in which they can identify. PSO-TARGET is an exploratory observational,&#xD;
      non-interventional study aiming to evaluate a novel approach of assessing psoriasis patients'&#xD;
      satisfaction towards their biologic treatment from a quality of life standpoint by using a&#xD;
      psoriasis-specific Quality of Life assessment grid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this exploratory study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the&#xD;
      PSO-TARGET QoL Component grid as part of a new approach for assessing the level of&#xD;
      achievement of the psoriasis patient's therapeutic goal, identified by himself, after a&#xD;
      treatment with Kyntheum®.&#xD;
