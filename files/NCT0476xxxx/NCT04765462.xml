  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and&#xD;
      feasibility of allogeneic γδ T cell therapy combining with/without chemotherapy in subjects&#xD;
      with advanced solid cancers. The study is an adaptive design that has 2 stages: Stage 1 -&#xD;
      dose escalation, Stage 2 - efficacy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-center, phase I/Ⅱstudy to evaluate the safety and feasibility&#xD;
      of allogeneic γδ T cell therapy and three target dose levels between 2x10^6 - 5x10^7/kg per&#xD;
      infusion will be tested. 4-6 doses will be given at an interval of 3-4 weeks into subjects&#xD;
      with advanced solid cancers.Whether chemotherapy should be combined or not depends on the&#xD;
      specific condition of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an adaptive design that has 2 stages: Stage 1 - dose escalation, Stage 2 -&#xD;
      efficacy.A typical 3+3 design will be used to determine the safe regimen based on the&#xD;
      incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in Stage 1. The identified safe regimen will be&#xD;
      used to further confirm safety and efficacy in Stage 2.&#xD;
