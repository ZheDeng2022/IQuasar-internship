  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years the survival of cancer patients has increased exponentially. But together&#xD;
      with that survival, and due to the different oncological treatments, side effects have also&#xD;
      increased significantly. Some of these may be tumor asthenia or dyspnea. The latter can&#xD;
      represent a serious health problem, with important limitations for individuals. To control&#xD;
      this, we consider that the measures used in conventional clinical practice can be&#xD;
      implemented, mainly developed through physical exercise. But we believe that not only this is&#xD;
      enough, but we also propose an intervention with a comprehensive perspective from the&#xD;
      rehabilitative approach, with the aim of integrating education and training of the&#xD;
      oncological patient with dyspnea. We propose to combine the intervention with physical&#xD;
      exercise with a re-education in the performance of activities of daily living, within a&#xD;
      &quot;Functional Oncological Re-education Program&quot;, to see if in this way better results are&#xD;
      achieved in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      That is why we propose to verify the effects produced by the implementation of a multimodal&#xD;
      physical exercise program with a specific autonomy recovery program in comparison with an&#xD;
      isolated intervention through physical exercise on the functionality and physical performance&#xD;
      in cancer patients with dyspnea . To do this, we proposed an experimental, prospective,&#xD;
      randomized study using a parallel scheme of fixed assignment with an experimental group and a&#xD;
      control group in patients from the Oncology Hospitalization Unit of the Salamanca University&#xD;
      Hospital Complex. 44 participants with dyspnea, who were admitted at the time of inclusion,&#xD;
      will be selected through a consecutive sampling. After the baseline evaluation, the&#xD;
      participants will be randomized into two groups. The subjects of the experimental group will&#xD;
      carry out a Rehabilitation Program in addition to the physical exercise carried out in all&#xD;
      the participants. The main variable will be the performance of basic activities of daily&#xD;
      living (Barthel scale) and the degree of dyspnea (mMRC scale). In addition, physical&#xD;
      performance (SPPB), blood oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry), fear / avoidance of movement /&#xD;
      TAMPA scale) and quality of life in cancer patients (ECOG) will be assessed. The results of&#xD;
      this study could be transferred to the clinic, incorporating them into care protocols for&#xD;
      cancer patients with dyspnea.&#xD;

    <description>ECOG scale: it is a practical way to measure the quality of life of an oncology patient, whose life expectancy changes over the course of months, weeks and even days. It was designed by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) in the United States and validated by the World Health Organization (WHO). The main function of this scale is to objectify the quality of life of the patient or &quot;performance status&quot;.</description>

    <description>It will consist of the following actions:&#xD;
Prescription of multimodal physical exercise: This therapeutic measure will be carried out both in the individuals of the experimental group and in those of the control group. It will be held daily in two short sessions of 15-20 minutes, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. The sessions were structured according to the recommendations of the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) 18, with an initial warm-up (2-3 minutes), a main part (8-12 minutes) and a final cool-down and relaxation (5 minutes).&#xD;
Retraining in activities of daily living: Gradation and simplification of activities and training in energy saving techniques (EAT).&#xD;
Finally, an exhaustive daily record of the activity carried out by the patient will be carried out, from which it will be modified, adapting it to the clinical situation of the patient.</description>

    <description>This therapeutic measure will be carried out both in the individuals of the experimental group and in those of the control group. It will be held daily in two short sessions of 15-20 minutes, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. The guideline will be to maintain a multimodal exercise to perform exercises of different characteristics, including aerobic exercises, balance exercises and low-load strength exercises for muscle groups, both in the upper quadrant and the lower quadrant. The sessions were structured according to the recommendations of the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) 18, with an initial warm-up (2-3 minutes), a main part (8-12 minutes) and a final cool-down and relaxation (5 minutes).</description>
