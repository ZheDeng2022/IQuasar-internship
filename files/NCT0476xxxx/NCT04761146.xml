    <textblock>
      An investigation to investigate the use of diffusing alpha-emitters radiation therapy (DaRT)&#xD;
      for the treatment of new and recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva is a rare cancer accounting for less than 1% of female&#xD;
      cancers. The disease predominantly affects women over the age of 65 although the incidence in&#xD;
      younger women is rising, a finding that has been attributed to the effect of increasing human&#xD;
      papillomavirus (HPV) infection .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard treatment for the primary tumour is surgical excision with the aim of achieving&#xD;
      a 1 cm clear margin on histopathology. This requires the surgeon to remove 1.5-2 cm of&#xD;
      surrounding normal tissue to allow for shrinkage after tissue fixation. Depending on the size&#xD;
      and location of the tumour, the surgical procedure could vary from a wide local excision to a&#xD;
      radical vulvectomy, including excision of adjacent structures such as the clitoris, lower&#xD;
      urethra or anus, and/or reconstructive surgery. Wound infection and breakdown are common&#xD;
      short-term complications of radical vulva surgery. Long term consequences include functional,&#xD;
      cosmetic, psychological and psychosexual sequelae, which can have a significant negative&#xD;
      impact on quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrence rates for vulva squamous cell carcinomas range from 15% to 33%. Local recurrence&#xD;
      in the vulva is the most common site of relapse (70%) with the groin nodes affected in 24%,&#xD;
      pelvic nodes in 16% and distant metastases in 19%. The treatment of choice for local&#xD;
      recurrence is surgical excision and 5-year survival rates of up to 45% have been reported.&#xD;
      However, patients can develop multiple recurrences over a period of time and the feasibility&#xD;
      of surgery becomes increasingly more limited as more and more tissue is removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brachytherapy is a form of radiotherapy where radiation sources are placed directly in&#xD;
      contact with or into (interstitial) cancerous tissue. The radiation emitted has a short range&#xD;
      in tissue and the brachytherapy dose distribution conforms tightly to the location of the&#xD;
      sources with minimal dose to the surrounding healthy tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alpha Tau Medical Ltd. proposes a novel treatment for malignant tumours using intra-tumoural&#xD;
      alpha radiation, which is delivered using the Alpha DaRT Device (Alpha DaRT applicator +&#xD;
      Alpha DaRT seeds). The technique, known as Diffusing Alpha-emitters Radiation Therapy (DaRT),&#xD;
      combines the advantages of conventional interstitial brachytherapy with the destructive power&#xD;
      of alpha particles.&#xD;
