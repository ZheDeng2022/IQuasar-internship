    <textblock>
      To compare the effect of combined thoracic manipulation (TM) and traditional physical therapy&#xD;
      treatment (TPT) versus TPT treatment alone on pain severity at rest and functional disability&#xD;
      in patients with type 1 complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS I) post-upper limb trauma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic state of pain that is frequently triggered&#xD;
      by an injury and is characterized by a variable combination of sensory, motor, vasomotor, and&#xD;
      sudomotor symptoms, in the affected limb..the frequency of CRPS after injury was 3.8-7.0 %&#xD;
      within four months of fracture. The highest prevalence occurs in the age group of 40 to 60&#xD;
      years. The pathophysiology of CRPS is still controversial, but a recent study has shown that&#xD;
      up to 70% of patients with CRPS have anti-autonomic immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies&#xD;
      associated with autonomic disorders in their serum CRPS, increasing the probability of these&#xD;
      antiautonomic antibodies contributing to the pathophysiology of CRPS. Under normal&#xD;
      conditions, sympathetic behavior does not affect the discharge of nociceptors; but&#xD;
      nociceptors tend to be under the control of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in the case&#xD;
      of CRPS. This is referred to as pain maintained sympathetically. Conservative treatments for&#xD;
      CRPS I have traditionally focused on pain reduction through pharmacology, desensitization&#xD;
      therapy, transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS), and thermal modalities and function&#xD;
      restoration through active, passive, and strengthening exercises of the arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with arm CRPSI also show postural deviations related to the arm's defensive role.&#xD;
      During all upright tasks, this posture reduces trunk motion and can have effects such as&#xD;
      reduced thoracic intervertebral mobility. Near to the thoracic costovertebral and&#xD;
      zygapophyseal joints are the sympathetic chain ganglia that innervate the upper limb. It may&#xD;
      be probable that the sympathetic chain ganglia affected by thoracic dysfunction arising from&#xD;
      joint or soft tissue restriction and may be related to the distal symptoms in CRPS. Thus,&#xD;
      thoracic spine manipulation can be an aid to the overall treatment of the symptoms in&#xD;
      patients with CRPS I. There is no study involving a control group in the available studies.&#xD;
      As with all case studies, while the findings might be interesting for future research. our&#xD;
      study is the first study to investigate the impact of thoracic manipulation in patients with&#xD;
      CRPS1 by comparing between the control group and the experimental group.&#xD;

    <description>The patient is asked to draw a line at the point that represents their pain severity perpendicular to the VAS line. The score is measured by calculating the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the 'no pain' anchor and the mark of the patient by using a ruler, including a selection of scores from 0-100. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity. The following cut points on the pain VAS have been recommended: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain (5-44mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75- 100 mm). A difference of more than 12 mm is considered the minimum clinically important difference. The patient rated the pain severity at rest.</description>

    <measure>functional disability using disability of arm, shoulder, and hand questionnaire (DASH).</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>DASH is a self-assessment of symptoms and function of the entire upper extremity. Self-assessment and scoring by calculating the arithmetic mean of at least 27 of the 30 items (missing rule) is transformed by (mean - 1) x 25 into the scale from 0 no symptoms/full function to 100 maximal symptoms/no function for the DASH total score. Five of 6 items are necessary for determination of the symptoms score and 22 of 24 items for the function score. Originally, 0 best and 100 worst. All items are easy to comprehend and are not emotionally sensitive (with the exception of item 21). All items are scored on a scale of 5 (Likert) levels: (1) no difficulty/ symptoms, (2) mild difficulty/ symptoms, (3) moderate difficulty/symptoms, (4) severe difficulty/ symptoms, and (5) extreme difficulty (unable to do)/symptoms. Minimal Clinical Important Difference (MCID): 10.2 points. In our current study, the Arabic version was used</description>
