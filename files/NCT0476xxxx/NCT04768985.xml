  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, Phase I, open-label, randomized, 2-sequence, 2-treatment,&#xD;
      2-period, crossover, bioequivalence study with single doses of acalabrutinib administered&#xD;
      orally in healthy participants. The study is designed to demonstrate the bioequivalence of&#xD;
      acalabrutinib tablet (Treatment A) compared with marketed acalabrutinib capsule (Treatment B)&#xD;
      in the fasted state.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible healthy participants will be randomized to receive either treatment sequence 1 (AB)&#xD;
      or treatment sequence 2 (BA), as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment A: Acalabrutinib tablet, 100 mg, fasted state&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment B: Acalabrutinib capsule, 100 mg, fasted state&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive fixed single doses of acalabrutinib on 2 occasions, under fasted&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comprise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1: A screening period of up to 28 days before first dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2: Two treatment periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants will be admitted to the study center on Day -2 of Treatment Period 1&#xD;
                to confirm eligibility before first dosing. Eligibility criteria will be&#xD;
                reconfirmed on Day -1 of each treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  On Day 1 of Treatment Periods 1 and 2, participants will be administered the&#xD;
                assigned treatment (A or B) as randomized, followed by a protocol defined washout&#xD;
                period between Treatment Periods 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 3: A Follow-up Visit/Early Termination Visit at 7 to 10 days after last&#xD;
           administration of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be involved in the study for approximately 6 weeks.&#xD;
