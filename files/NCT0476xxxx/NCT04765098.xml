        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically proven GBM with progression after previous first line chemoradiotherapy&#xD;
             with temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Progression documented by MRI with at least one bi-dimensionally measurable target&#xD;
             lesion with one diameter of at least 10 mm, visible on two or more axial slices 5 mm&#xD;
             apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Not received radiotherapy within the three months before the diagnosis of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroids prior to randomization: corticosteroids&#xD;
             (dexamethasone) should be given at the lowest dose needed to control symptoms arising&#xD;
             from increased intracerebral edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. ECOG performance 0-2 (Appendix 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Age from 18-65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum (or urine)&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to the first dose of study treatment. WOCBP is&#xD;
             defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical&#xD;
             sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy) and&#xD;
             is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over&#xD;
             age 45 years in the absence of other biological or physiological causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients of childbearing / reproductive potential should use adequate birth control&#xD;
             methods, as defined by the investigator, during the study treatment period and for a&#xD;
             period of 60 days after the last dose of study drug. A highly effective method of&#xD;
             birth control is defined as those that result in low failure rate (i.e. less than 1%&#xD;
             per year) when used consistently and correctly.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: abstinence is acceptable if this is established and preferred contraception for&#xD;
             the patient and is accepted as a local standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Laboratory evaluation obtained within 7 days prior to randomization, with adequate&#xD;
             function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ALT &lt; 3 times ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST &lt; 3 times ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alkaline phosphatase &lt; 3 times ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patient must understand and sign an informed consent prior to study registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of another malignancy or a concurrent malignancy (exceptions include patients&#xD;
             who have been disease-free for 3 years, or patients with a history of completely&#xD;
             resected non-melanoma skin cancer or successfully treated in situ carcinoma are&#xD;
             eligible, for example cervical cancer in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt;150 mm Hg or diastolic blood&#xD;
             pressure &gt;100 mm Hg).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any arterial or venous thrombosis up to 6 months before registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Evidence of recent hemorrhage on brain MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Substantial cardiovascular disease: cerebral vascular accident/stroke (&lt;6 months prior&#xD;
             to enrollment), myocardial infarction (&lt;6 months prior to enrollment), unstable&#xD;
             angina, congestive heart failure (&gt; New York Heart Association Classification Class&#xD;
             II), or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication.&#xD;
