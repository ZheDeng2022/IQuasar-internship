  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This first in human clinical study will assess the safety and tolerability, as well as the&#xD;
      single dose pharmacokinetics (PK), of inhaled AZD4604 in healthy volunteers (Part 1a, single&#xD;
      ascending dose [SAD]). The single dose administration will be performed with dry powder&#xD;
      inhaler (DPI) formulation of AZD4604. When at least 4 cohorts of the SAD part of the study&#xD;
      have been completed, AZD4604 will be administered as a single intravenous (IV) or oral (PO)&#xD;
      dose to 2 different cohorts of healthy volunteers (Part 1b). The main purpose is to compare&#xD;
      the PK between IV and inhaled administration as well as between oral and inhaled&#xD;
      administration to further characterize the PK properties of AZD4604 by the various&#xD;
      administration routes. The results will be used to improve future study design and&#xD;
      interpretation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1a of the study will be a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, SAD, sequential&#xD;
      group design study. Seven inhaled dose levels of AZD4604 are planned to be investigated in&#xD;
      cohorts of 8 healthy volunteers, with 6 healthy volunteers randomly assigned to inhaled&#xD;
      AZD4604 and 2 healthy volunteers randomly assigned to inhaled placebo in each cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1a will comprise of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Screening Visit within 28 days before dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Treatment Period (Day -1 to Day 7, in the Clinical Unit) with a single inhaled dose of&#xD;
           AZD4604 or corresponding placebo on Day 1. Although the anticipated systemic exposure&#xD;
           and risk for potential adverse systemic effects are considered to be low for AZD4604,&#xD;
           healthy volunteers will remain resident at site for additional 6 days of monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Final Assessment on day of discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1b, AZD4604 will be administered as a single IV or a PO dose to healthy volunteers in&#xD;
      order to compare the PK between IV, PO and inhaled administration. Part 1b will be open-label&#xD;
      and consist of 2 dose cohorts, IV and PO, with 6 healthy volunteers in each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1b will comprise of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A washout period of at least 2 weeks for the healthy volunteers who received inhaled&#xD;
           dosing in Part 1a will occur before IV or PO dosing in Part 1b. All healthy volunteers&#xD;
           will have a Screening Visit within 28 days of dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Treatment Period (Day -1 to Day 3, in the Clinical Unit) with a single IV or PO dose&#xD;
           of AZD4604 on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Follow-up Visit within 6 ± 1 day after dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 of the study will be a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, MAD, sequential&#xD;
      group design. This part of the study will be conducted in up to 32 healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 will comprise of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Screening Visit within 28 days before first dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Treatment Period (Day -1 to Day 12 in the Clinical Unit) with twice daily (BID)&#xD;
           inhaled doses of AZD4604 or placebo on Day 1 to Day 6 (12-hour [+/- 30 minutes]&#xD;
           intervals between doses), and a single inhaled dose on Day 7. The healthy volunteers&#xD;
           will remain resident at site for additional 6 days of monitoring, which is predicted to&#xD;
           allow sufficient time for near complete washout (estimated time for &gt; 97% of the dose to&#xD;
           have been eliminated) of any target engagement from the lungs. Healthy volunteers will&#xD;
           remain in the Clinical Unit for the duration of the treatment period and will be&#xD;
           discharged on Day 13, 6 days after administration of the last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Final Assessment on day of discharge.&#xD;
