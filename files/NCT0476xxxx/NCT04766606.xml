  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The perioperative treatment of patients receiving long-term anticoagulant therapy is&#xD;
      challenging. This is attributed to the continuation of anticoagulants perioperatively, which&#xD;
      is associated with an increased bleeding risk while their discontinuation increases the risk&#xD;
      of thromboembolic or ischemic events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of surgery and patient's comorbidities (i.e. haematological diseases, renal or hepatic&#xD;
      insufficiency, and concomitant use of other anticoagulants) are significant factors&#xD;
      associated with perioperative bleeding. Bleeding risk is stratifies according to the 2011&#xD;
      Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Antiplatelet&#xD;
      Disorder. Surgical thrombotic risk assessment is based on 2014 ESC / ESA Guidelines on&#xD;
      non-cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate and record the management of anticoagulant&#xD;
      therapy and long term outcome. The primary target is to record the anticoagulant management&#xD;
      in non-cardiac elective surgery during one year in our Hospital. The study involves the&#xD;
      investigation of the degree of compliance according to published guidelines. Immediate&#xD;
      postoperative complications and major events are secondary goals. Data are assessed at 30, 90&#xD;
      days and one year follow up after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding the need to discontinue or not antithrombotic agents and adapting treatment&#xD;
      strategies according to type of surgery is the key to balance their safety and efficacy.&#xD;
      Cardiologists, surgeons, and anaesthesiologists should be aware of the potential catastrophic&#xD;
      risks of early discontinuation or continuation of antithrombotic therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that more than 150,000 patients receive anticoagulant treatment in Greece.&#xD;
      More than 10% of those will need to undergo surgery annually. Major side effects of all&#xD;
      anticoagulants are bleeding or major thromboembolic events perioperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The perioperative treatment of patients receiving long-term anticoagulant therapy is&#xD;
      challenging. This is attributed to the continuation of anticoagulants perioperatively, which&#xD;
      is associated with an increased bleeding risk while their discontinuation increases the risk&#xD;
      of thromboembolic or ischemic events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of surgery and patient's comorbidities (i.e. haematological diseases, renal or hepatic&#xD;
      insufficiency, and concomitant use of other anticoagulants) are significant factors&#xD;
      associated with perioperative bleeding. According to the 2011 Canadian Cardiovascular Society&#xD;
      Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Antiplatelet Disorder, bleeding risk is&#xD;
      stratified as following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Very high risk: neurosurgery (intracranial or spinal surgery), cardiac surgery (coronary&#xD;
           artery bypass grafting or valve replacement).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medium risk: intrathoracic, intra-abdominal procedures, orthopaedic, vascular and other&#xD;
           selective procedures (prostate or cervical biopsy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High Risk: major vascular surgeries (abdominal aortic aneurysm, aortic bypass), major&#xD;
           orthopaedic surgery on the lower extremity (total hip / knee), pneumonectomy,&#xD;
           enterectomy, placement of permanent pacemaker or internal defibrillator and other&#xD;
           selected procedures (kidney biopsy, pericardium puncture, resection of colon polyps).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low risk: laparoscopic procedures (cholecystectomy, inguinal hernia repair), dental,&#xD;
           dermatological, ophthalmic procedures, coronary angiography, gastroscopy /colonoscopy&#xD;
           and other selected procedures (bone marrow or lymph node biopsy, thoracotomy, joint&#xD;
           puncture).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Very low risk: low risk dental procedures (i.e. tooth extraction), skin biopsy or skin&#xD;
           cancer excision, cataract surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical thrombotic risk assessment is based on 2014 ESC / ESA Guidelines on non-cardiac&#xD;
      surgery. Low risk (&lt;1%) surgeries include superficial surgery, breast procedures etc., medium&#xD;
      risk (1-5%) splenectomy, cholecystectomy, etc., and high risk (&gt;5%) are major aortic and&#xD;
      other major blood vessel operations, open limb revascularization or amputation or&#xD;
      embolectomy, gastric surgery, hepatectomy, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate and record the management of anticoagulant&#xD;
      therapy and long term outcome. The primary target is to record the anticoagulant management&#xD;
      in non-cardiac elective surgery during one year in our Hospital. The study involves the&#xD;
      investigation of the degree of compliance according to published guidelines. Immediate&#xD;
      postoperative complications and major events are secondary goals. Data are assessed at 30, 90&#xD;
      days and one year follow up after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data recording involves patient demographics, somatometric data, medical history,&#xD;
      comorbidities and home medication. Specifically, details concerning antiplatelet or&#xD;
      anticoagulant medication, such as diagnosis, duration of treatment, time to treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation prior surgery, bridging, intraoperative administration of anticoagulants if&#xD;
      needed, time of re-administration postoperatively and what medical specialties were involved&#xD;
      in the perioperative management of antithrombotic agents are also included. Hospital length&#xD;
      of stay is also recorded. Complications recorded during the one year study period include the&#xD;
      following: acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, vascular haemorrhage, sudden&#xD;
      death, arrhythmias, aneurysm rupture, bleeding and management, and other major events.&#xD;
      Moreover, after patient discharge, all cause re-hospitalization and any alteration to&#xD;
      antithrombotic treatment is also recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative management of patients receiving antithrombotics is multifactorial and high&#xD;
      quality evidence is lacking. The achievement of the delicate balance between efficacy and&#xD;
      safety, between thrombotic and hemorrhagic risk, remains a challenge for the physicians who&#xD;
      are called upon to treat patients under antithrombotic agents who are candidates for surgery.&#xD;
      Understanding the need to discontinue or not antithrombotic agents and adapting treatment&#xD;
      strategies according to type of surgery is the key to balance their safety and efficacy.&#xD;
      Cardiologists, surgeons, and anaesthesiologists should be aware of the potential catastrophic&#xD;
      risks of early discontinuation or continuation of antithrombotic therapy.&#xD;
