  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension and diabetes are chronic diseases that require long-term management and disease&#xD;
      control is often sub-optimal, leading to complications which place additional burden on&#xD;
      patients and the healthcare system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to address factors such as gender, ethnicity and specific genetics that are&#xD;
      not routinely considered during drug dosing but account for considerable variations in drug&#xD;
      responses by tailoring the treatment to individual patient using CURATE.AI. CURATE.AI is an&#xD;
      artificial intelligence guided dosing decision tool and can be applicable across many&#xD;
      different conditions, as it is disease agnostic. This platform had demonstrated initial&#xD;
      success in cancer and transplant populations but has yet to be applied to chronic disease&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is demonstrate that artificial intelligence guided treatment in chronic&#xD;
      disease of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus will yield actionable medication dosing&#xD;
      optimization.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is demonstrate that artificial intelligence guided treatment in chronic&#xD;
      disease of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus will yield actionable medication dosing&#xD;
      optimization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Artificial intelligence (CURATE.AI) pilot deployment using prospective data in patients&#xD;
           with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Artificial intelligence (CURATE.AI) for behavioural assessment and compliance prediction&#xD;
           to disease management programme in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes&#xD;
           mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Analysis Design and setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective cohort feasibility study will evaluate the blood pressure (n=20) and&#xD;
      glycaemic (n=20) control of patients using the CURATE.AI platform. Participants will be&#xD;
      recruited for a period of 4 months from the day of baseline visit and followed up for up to 4&#xD;
      clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Participants will be recruited from the study site, Alexandra Hospital, Singapore&#xD;
      during their routine clinic visits. The doctor will identify individuals who meet the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and the research team will share further details regarding the study&#xD;
      including the inclusion/ exclusion criteria that is presented below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interested individuals who meet the eligibility criteria will be required to sign the&#xD;
      Informed Consent From prior to any study activity and a baseline visit will be scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adult patients (≥ 21years) with T2DM or hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expected to be followed up in Alexandra Hospital for the next 4-months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signed informed consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with cognitive impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with active cancer undergoing chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients on haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis (which can cause rapid fluctuation of&#xD;
           BP and blood sugar, respectively)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnant patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients whose medications for T2DM and hypertension are changed simultaneously during&#xD;
           the first clinic visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious concomitant disorders that would compromise the safety of the patient or&#xD;
           compromise the patient's ability to complete the study, at the discretion of the&#xD;
           investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures The CURATE.AI correlation requires three data-points to calculate the&#xD;
      initial drug dose. Ongoing readings provide further data-points for dose modulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a patient with hypertension or T2DM is identified and consented, a BP or blood sugar&#xD;
      will be recorded (1st data-point) and baseline assessment performed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following any change of hypertension (or T2DM) medications, a 24-hour ambulatory BP (or&#xD;
      continuous glucose monitoring) will be done during the 7-15 days after baseline visit&#xD;
      (data-point 2 or data-point 3 if retrospective data is available). Data from these recordings&#xD;
      will be used to titrate medications, if necessary, in the follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One month after baseline the patient will return to the clinic for follow-up (data-point 3 or&#xD;
      data point 4 if retrospective data is available) and dose adjustment, if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing decisions at this point and going forward will be made by CURATE.AI and verified by&#xD;
      the clinician. If dose adjustment is required, then the patient will repeat the home&#xD;
      monitoring (24-hour ambulatory BP or continuous glucose monitoring). If dose adjustment is&#xD;
      not needed the patient will undertake no home monitoring. Either way each patient will return&#xD;
      one month later for clinic follow-up (clinic visit 2). This monthly cycle is repeated until&#xD;
      each patient has reached 4-months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the final clinic visit (4-months after baseline) the baseline assessments are repeated. At&#xD;
      this point patients will also be approached to complete a patient experience survey.&#xD;
