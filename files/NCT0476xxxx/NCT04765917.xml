&#xD;
        -  Determine the effect of motor imagery training on balance in children with spastic&#xD;
           hemiplegia.&#xD;
&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with spastic hemiplegia may experience a variety of concomitant health conditions&#xD;
      including, movement difficulty, postural and balance instability, muscle spasticity,&#xD;
      difficulty with motor planning and control, and cognitive impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postural and balance disturbances occur due to the difficulty in maintaining the body&#xD;
      segments aligned on narrow base of support and there is limitation in balance recovery in&#xD;
      hemiplegic children contributing to delayed responses of ankle muscles, inappropriate&#xD;
      sequencing, and increased coactivation of agonists/ antagonists muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will vary depending on the severity of impairments, level of activity,&#xD;
      participation, and on the priorities highlighted by the patient. Walking is often identified&#xD;
      as a main goal, and there is evidence that children with hemiplegia can take steps before&#xD;
      regaining standing balance, which would support early walking. Many advanced treatment&#xD;
      approaches are used to help improve motor function and gait in patients with hemiplegic CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rehabilitation techniques are predominantly focused on alleviating the compromised motor&#xD;
      execution facet of action performance, and have not specifically targeted the motor&#xD;
      preparation or planning processes. Motor imagery is proposed to be a backdoor mechanism to&#xD;
      access the motor system. It being a theoretically feasible method to activate the immature&#xD;
      networks involved in motor control. Therefore, for individuals with motor planning problems&#xD;
      this cognitive MI training may be useful to improve motor skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it has been shown to be beneficial in adult patients with stroke, and it still&#xD;
      awaits empirical testing in young children with CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the potential benefits of motor imagery training, clinical use of motor imagery&#xD;
      training for improving walking and balance abilities is not yet common compared with other&#xD;
      conventional modalities in rehabilitation of children with hemiplegia. Consequently, more&#xD;
      research and further confirmation are needed regarding the impact of motor imagery training&#xD;
      on the gait performance, balance and trunk endurance in children with hemiplegia. Therefore,&#xD;
      the purpose of this study to investigate the effect of motor imagery training on balance and&#xD;
      kinematic parameters of gait in children with hemiplegia.&#xD;

    <description>As a preparation each child will be shown a video of 5 minutes of normal movements.&#xD;
They will be positioned in a comfortable position. The screen is in the child's visual field. Children will be asked to close their eyes and imagine they will perform the physically practiced task for 10 minutes, similar to one shown in the video. Sequence of the task will be verbally explained to the child for better recalling of sensations in muscles during the movements. During the entire exercise schedule child's attention will be focused on the position, and movement of their body, on proprioceptive inputs coming from the leg muscles and on the tactile sensations of foot floor contact.&#xD;
Thereafter, the child will be asked to perform the sequence of tasks, rehearsed mentally for 20 minutes.</description>
