  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the relationship between the duration of evolution of SDRC1 and the&#xD;
      efficacy of continuous peripheral nerve block (c-PNB) associated with an intensive&#xD;
      rehabilitation program to improve the therapeutic strategy of SDRC1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis of this study is that if c-PNB is proposed earlier, the recovery,&#xD;
      measured with a scale achievement of objectives, will be better.&#xD;
