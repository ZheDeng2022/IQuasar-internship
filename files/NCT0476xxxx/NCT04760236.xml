  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to study immune non-inferiority, safety and lot-to-lot consistency of&#xD;
      OCV-S compared to Shanchol™ in 1 to 40 years old healthy Nepalese participants. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the simplified formulation is able to induce non-inferior&#xD;
      immunogenicity compared with non-simplified, licensed OCV.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Lactation: Breastfeeding women will not be enrolled. Should a female participant&#xD;
                  decide to breastfeed during the vaccination period, she will be excluded from&#xD;
                  further vaccination, but will be followed for safety until the end of the study&#xD;
