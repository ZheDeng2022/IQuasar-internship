      Aim: To evaluate plasma/urine/hair Lead (Pb), Cadmium (Cd), Gadolinium (Gd), Arsenic (As),&#xD;
      Mercury (Hg), Cobalt (Co), Vanadium (V), Titanium (Ti), Sulfur (S), Chromium (Cr), Silver&#xD;
      (Ag), Molybdenum (Mo), Boron (B), Lithium (Li), and Nickel (Ni) levels in women with&#xD;
      premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) and to compare the results with those of healthy&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This prospective study will be included 50 women with idiopathic premature ovarian&#xD;
      insufficiency and 50 controls. The blood/urine/hair for analyses will be obtained at the&#xD;
      early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle and plasma Lead (Pb), Cadmium (Cd), Gadolinium&#xD;
      (Gd), Arsenic (As), Mercury (Hg), Cobalt (Co), Vanadium (V), Titanium (Ti), Sulfur (S),&#xD;
      Chromium (Cr), Silver (Ag), Molybdenum (Mo), Boron (B), Lithium (Li), and Nickel (Ni) levels&#xD;
      will be measured using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry.&#xD;

      This will be an observational prospective cohort study conducted at Obstetrics and Gynecology&#xD;
      Department of Cengiz Gokcek Obstetrics and Children's Hospital between January 2020 and June&#xD;
      2021. The authors will be recruited 50 subjects with idiopathic POI, and 50 healthy patients&#xD;
      were selected for the control group. All patients will be given their oral and written&#xD;
      informed consent before their inclusion in the study. The protocol was approved by the Ethics&#xD;
      Committee for Clinical Research of Gaziantep University (Reference number: 2020/320). The&#xD;
      study strictly will be adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women between the ages of 18-39 will be included. A volunteer group of healthy women who will&#xD;
      be visited the gynecology clinic for routine examinations and women who will be admitted for&#xD;
      pre-pregnancy tests will be invited randomly to this research as a control group. Healthy&#xD;
      women, who will be returned during their early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, will&#xD;
      be recruited as the control group subjects. The exclusion criteria will be as follows: women&#xD;
      with evidence for karyotypic, metabolic, toxic, or iatrogenic cause of the ovarian&#xD;
      insufficiency and any women who use any medication for POI treatment. At enrollment, for both&#xD;
      groups, the authors will be collected data about age, height, weight, BMI, age of menarche,&#xD;
      obstetrics history, history of smoking, regular exercise and family history of POI. At&#xD;
      enrolment, all patients will be underwent vaginal ultrasonography for the assessment of&#xD;
      antral follicle count (AFC) and venous blood sample from the antecubital veins for measuring&#xD;
      plasma concentration of Lead (Pb), Cadmium (Cd), Gadolinium (Gd), Arsenic (As), Mercury (Hg),&#xD;
      Cobalt (Co), Vanadium (V), Titanium (Ti), Sulfur (S), Chromium (Cr), Silver (Ag), Molybdenum&#xD;
      (Mo), Boron (B), Lithium (Li), and Nickel (Ni), Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), E2,&#xD;
      anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) and complete blood count (CBC). In control subjects venous blood&#xD;
      samples and AFC will be collected during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle.&#xD;
      Urine and hair samples will be collected at the same time. The plasma and urine samples will&#xD;
      be stored in aliquots at -80°C prior to the analyses of Lead (Pb), Cadmium (Cd), Gadolinium&#xD;
      (Gd), Arsenic (As), Mercury (Hg), Cobalt (Co), Vanadium (V), Titanium (Ti), Sulfur (S),&#xD;
      Chromium (Cr), Silver (Ag), Molybdenum (Mo), Boron (B), Lithium (Li), and Nickel (Ni). Hair&#xD;
      samples will be stored in envelopes at room temperature. The plasma/urine/hair Lead (Pb),&#xD;
      Cadmium (Cd), Gadolinium (Gd), Arsenic (As), Mercury (Hg), Cobalt (Co), Vanadium (V),&#xD;
      Titanium (Ti), Sulfur (S), Chromium (Cr), Silver (Ag), Molybdenum (Mo), Boron (B), Lithium&#xD;
      (Li), and Nickel (Ni) level will be measured using inductively coupled plasma-mass&#xD;
      spectrometry. Then, this study will be determined plasma/urine/hair Lead (Pb), Cadmium (Cd),&#xD;
      Gadolinium (Gd), Arsenic (As), Mercury (Hg), Cobalt (Co), Vanadium (V), Titanium (Ti), Sulfur&#xD;
      (S), Chromium (Cr), Silver (Ag), Molybdenum (Mo), Boron (B), Lithium (Li), and Nickel (Ni)&#xD;
      levels in women with POI (n=50) compared to those of volunteer healthy women (n=50). Then,&#xD;
      these microelements levels will be compared in both group.&#xD;
