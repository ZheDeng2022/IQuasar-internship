  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to develop a training for male peer leaders facilitating diabetes&#xD;
      self-management education and support (DSMES) to specifically encourage conversations&#xD;
      regarding beliefs that affect men's health and to allow modeling of alternative views and&#xD;
      perspectives that allow for successful disease management to be framed as competence and&#xD;
      strength. Given that the life expectancy for Black men in the US is 71, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that targeting men in earlier stages of type 2 diabetes will assist greatly in&#xD;
      facilitating healthy aging and improving diabetes-related health outcomes later in life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the investigators previous work, the long-term goal of our research is to determine&#xD;
      the most effective, practical, and sustainable approach to provide DSMES to older Black men.&#xD;
      The objective is to examine the relative effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of a&#xD;
      peer-leader DSMES intervention for Black men with T2D. To accomplish this, the investigators&#xD;
      will engage in a developmental phase and a validation phase [pilot randomized control trial&#xD;
      (RCT)]. The RCT will be conducted with 60 Black adult male residents of metro Detroit, MI.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to a control group or the tailored peer-leader diabetes&#xD;
      self-management support group (PLDSMS). All participants will receive DSME with a certified&#xD;
      diabetes care and education specialists. Only participants randomized to the PLDSMS group&#xD;
      will also receive an additional 6 weeks of DSMS led by the peer leaders. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that 1) participants in the PLDSMS group will have improved outcomes (A1c, blood&#xD;
      pressure, weight, diabetes distress, self-management behaviors, etc.) over the control group,&#xD;
      and 2) an evaluation of measures will confirm efficacy of the PLDSMS.&#xD;

    <description>Measured by the Perceived Diabetes Self-Management Scale: An 8-item Perceived Diabetes Self-Management Scale (PDSMS). The responses for the PDSMS items range from 1 = &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; to 5 = &quot;Strongly Agree.&quot; Four of the items (#s 1, 2, 6, &amp; 7) are worded such that high agreement signifies low self-efficacy or perceived competence. These four items are reverse scored prior to being added to the other four items. The total PDSMS score can range from 8 to 40, with higher scores indicating more confidence in self-managing one's diabetes.</description>

    <measure>Diabetes-related Distress</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The DDS17 yields a total diabetes distress score plus 4 subscale scores, each addressing a different kind of distress.1 To score, simply sum the patient's responses to the appropriate items and divide by the number of items in that scale. Current research2 suggests that a mean item score 2.0 - 2.9 should be considered 'moderate distress,' and a mean item score &gt; 3.0 should be considered 'high distress.' Current research also indicates that associations between DDS scores and behavioral management and biological variables (e.g., A1C) occur with DDS scores of &gt; 2.0. Clinicians may consider moderate or high distress worthy of clinical attention, depending on the clinical context.</description>

    <measure>Diabetes Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 is a self-reported outcome measure assessing the impact of health on an individual's everyday life. It is often used as a quality of life measure. Using a norm-based algorithm it produces a composite score for self-reported mental and physical between 0 and 100, which allows for comparison between study populations and national averages. Responses to SF-12v2 questions were used to estimate a mental composite score (MCS) and physical composite score (PCS) for each subject on a 0- and 100- point scale in accordance with the methods outlined by Ware et al. (2000). The national mean scores for both mental and physical health are standardized at 50; scores above this represent higher, or healthier, individuals than average.</description>

    <description>While the effectiveness of peer-led interventions delivering diabetes-related education and support for short-term clinical, psychosocial, and behavioral improvements is well-established, older Black men in particular are less likely to participate and are at a higher risk of drop-out from these studies. This intervention aims to determine if using older Black men as peer leaders to other older Black men will improve retention rates for this population.</description>
