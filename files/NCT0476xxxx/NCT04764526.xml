  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to investigate if protein-enriched ice cream has the feasibility to&#xD;
      increase intake of protein without substituting other foods in hospitalized older patients&#xD;
      and secondary, if the protein-enriched ice cream has the feasibility to increases the energy&#xD;
      intake and evokes positive emotions in older hospitalized patients&#xD;

      Methods/Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is conducted as a four days non-blinded randomised cross-over feasibility study&#xD;
      with 24 hospitalized older patients. The intervention is conducted at the hospital. The&#xD;
      intervention is two days with two protein-enriched ice cream daily with the aim of increasing&#xD;
      the intake of protein and energy. The patients are asked to answer a questionnaire concerning&#xD;
      the emotions the protein enriched ice cream evoke.The patients will be randomised to receive&#xD;
      the standard menu the first two days followed by two days with standard menu plus&#xD;
      protein-enriched ice cream or in the opposite order. The randomisation will be done by using&#xD;
      sealed envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only admitted patients will be a part of the trial. The ward staff will identify the patients&#xD;
      there are eligible to the trial as close as possible to the day of admission. The ward staff&#xD;
      will ask those patients who meet the inclusion criteria if they will participate in the&#xD;
      trail. The patients receive oral and written information on the trial and those who agree to&#xD;
      participate are asked to sign a statement of consent before participating. The patients can&#xD;
      at any time withdraw their consent and leave the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is estimated to 24 patients, who will be their own control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-parametric statistical tests, median and range will be performed due to the small sample&#xD;
      size and skew distribution. The Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired data, and Fisher's exact&#xD;
      test for categorical data. Evoked emotion are measured as the percentages of patients who&#xD;
      choose a particular emotion term.&#xD;
