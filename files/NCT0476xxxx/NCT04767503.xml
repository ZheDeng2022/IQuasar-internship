  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatectomies are performed for the treatment of hepatic tumors and livingdonor liver&#xD;
      transplantation. The success of liver resection relies on the remnant liver's ability to&#xD;
      regenerate after major tissue loss. Despite appropriate liver remnant volume after resection&#xD;
      ensures the liver's ability to regenerate, regeneration progresses at variable ratesin&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many researches have established a relationship between the gut microbiome and patients with&#xD;
      liver disease such as liver cirrhosis, alcoholic liver disease and obesity related liver&#xD;
      diseases. These liver disorders are associated with bacterial overgrowth, dysbiosis, and&#xD;
      increased intestinal permeability. However, the relationship between hepatectomy and&#xD;
      microbiota has not been fully investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurement of small-molecule metabolites has been an integral part of clinical practice&#xD;
      including the familiar clinical standards like glucose and creatinine. Metabolomics, however,&#xD;
      is able to measure all the metabolites at once. It is possible to get a far more&#xD;
      comprehensive picture of what is happening to a patient's physiology or metabolism. Although&#xD;
      gut microbiota has been shown to be related to liver disease and liver regeneration.&#xD;
      Obtaining a more comprehensive analysis by identifying not only the microbial composition but&#xD;
      also the metabolites will be more insightful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many routine perioperative aspects of surgical care can impact the state of the microbiome&#xD;
      and therefore can impact clinical outcomes, like bowel preparation and antibiotics. Potential&#xD;
      factors affecting the gut microbiota also include perioperative manipulation, stress released&#xD;
      hormones, and opioids. Maintenance of proper anesthetic depth is beneficial to attenuate&#xD;
      surgical stress. General anesthesia including volatile anesthetics and opioids, is associated&#xD;
      with altered gut microbiota which might in turn affect liver regeneration. In this regard,&#xD;
      perioperative care such as anesthesia, is one of the key points for the success of a liver&#xD;
      resection. However, which anesthetic method is preferable regarding postoperative outcome or&#xD;
      recovery is controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the study population will include liver tumor resection and living donor&#xD;
      hepatectomy. We aimed to 1) identify the relationship of hepatectomy and changes of gut&#xD;
      microbiota and metabolomics. 2) investigate the impact of different anesthetic methods on the&#xD;
      interaction of gut microbiota and metabolomics.&#xD;
