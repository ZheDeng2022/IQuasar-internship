  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At a tertiary care university hospital a specialized interdisciplinary team of paediatric&#xD;
      anaesthesiologists and paediatric intensivists was established for providing analgosedation&#xD;
      for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The aim of the present study was to analyse the&#xD;
      incidence and risk factors of adverse events during procedural sedation performed by the&#xD;
      Children's Analgosedation Team (CAST).&#xD;

      At a tertiary care university hospital a dedicated Children's Analgosedation Team (CAST)&#xD;
      performs all procedural sedations in children outside the operating room. Often patient age,&#xD;
      comorbidities and procedures involving the airway are considered risk factors for adverse&#xD;
      events, but previous studies investigating adverse events did not involve implementation of a&#xD;
      specialised sedation team. Medical records of all children receiving procedural sedation by&#xD;
      the CAST were reviewed for the incidence of adverse events. A bivariate analysis as well as&#xD;
      an analysis of variance using type II Wald chi-square tests were conducted for identifying&#xD;
      potential risk factors for adverse Events.&#xD;
