      The study will provide important insight into current HPV vaccine knowledge/awareness, health&#xD;
      beliefs, affect, vaccine discussions, decision preparedness, and vaccine intentions and&#xD;
      behaviors among those ages 18-45, while examining potential differences in responses between&#xD;
      those ages 18-26 and those ages 27-45 and vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals.&#xD;

      The study will provide important insight into current HPV vaccine knowledge/awareness, health&#xD;
      beliefs, affect, vaccine discussions, decision preparedness, and vaccine intentions and&#xD;
      behaviors among those ages 18-45, while examining potential differences in responses between&#xD;
      those ages 18-26 and those ages 27-45 and vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. In&#xD;
      addition, the study will illuminate gaps in knowledge and awareness as well as the education&#xD;
      intervention preferences (e.g., intervention platform, source of information, timing of&#xD;
      intervention) of individuals ages 18-45. Among those ages 27-45, shared clinical&#xD;
      decision-making is recommended. Compared to individuals ages 18-26, individuals ages 27-45&#xD;
      may need to be supported uniquely so that they are prepared to engage in shared clinical&#xD;
      decision-making about HPV vaccination with their healthcare provider. Thus, among&#xD;
      unvaccinated individuals ages 27-45, for whom shared clinical decision-making is recommended,&#xD;
      preparedness for engagement in shared clinical decision-making will be assessed and explored.&#xD;
      The study also will allow investigators to identify how best to target information to young&#xD;
      adults and mid-adults both for themselves, and among those with children, for their children.&#xD;
