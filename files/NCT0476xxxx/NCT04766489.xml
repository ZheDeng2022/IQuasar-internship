      This study aims to evaluate the effects of the treatment for breast cancer lymphedema. After&#xD;
      taking a detailed history and giving a physical examination, breast cancer related lymphedema&#xD;
      patients(n:30) will be informed and will be given Complete Decongestive Therapy, which&#xD;
      includes decongestive exercises, manual lymphatic drainage, compression therapy(either&#xD;
      through short stretch bandaging and/or pneumatic device) and exercise. Patients will be&#xD;
      evaluated with limb volume, lymphedema index acquired through bioimpedance device, QuickDASH&#xD;
      for upper extremity function, hand dynamometer for upper extremity grip strength and&#xD;
      CLUE(Breast Cancer-Related Lymphedema of the Upper Extremity standardized clinical evaluation&#xD;
      tool) scoring for lymphedema before and after the intervention. The values will be compared&#xD;
      in order to show whether there are significant differences between before and after scores,&#xD;
      and whether CLUE score is correlated with the other indicators of breast cancer related&#xD;
      lymphedema.&#xD;

    <description>Breast Cancer-Related Lymphedema of the Upper Extremity (CLUE) is a standardized clinical evaluation tool which was developed to evaluate the severity of the lymphedema, especially in the context of clinical trials. CLUE involves assessing obscuration of anatomical architecture (eg, bony prominences, tendons), deviation from normal anatomical contour, change of soft-tissue texture, and the presence of pitting or nonpitting edema. It consists of these four assessments conducted in three different parts or the upper extremity(arm, forearm and hand). CLUE scores have a range of 0 to 72, with greater numbers associated with more severe lymphedema. It was shown to be valid and reliable for the assessment of breast cancer related lymphedema by Spinelli et al.(1)</description>

    <measure>Hand Grip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Month</time_frame>
    <description>Hand grip strength: Hand grip strength will be measured using JAMAR® hand dynamometer. It has been used to assess hand grip strength in many studies over half a century. Patients will be asked to sit down with shoulder adducted, elbow flexed (90°) and forearm in the neutral position. Mean of the 3 measurements taken with 1 minute apart from each other will be recorded. Patients' measurements will be taken for both affected and unaffected arm, and will be recorded as kgf.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Extremity volume</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Month</time_frame>
    <description>Volume measurements will be taken using ulnar styloid process as a index point, and circumferential measurements were taken with 5 cm spaces from distal to the proximal. Using a computer programme (Limb Volumes Professional version 5.0), the total volume of the arm will be calculated and recorded before and after the treatment for both arms.&#xD;
All patients' measurements will be taken by the same researcher, who happens to be experienced in this field.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lymphedema index</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Month</time_frame>
    <description>Lymphedema index will be acquired with a bioimpedance spectroscopy device (L-DEX U400, ImpediMed Limited, Brisbane-Australia). The device utilizes the characteristics of frequency dependent current flow to quantify changes in extracellular fluid in the patient's limb. The lymphedema index value increases on the scale with the higher levels of extracellular fluid, which is directly associated with the presence of lymphedema.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>QuickDASH</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Month</time_frame>
    <description>Short version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Questionnaire(Quick-DASH) will be used to assess the function of the upper extremities. The Quick-DASH contains 11 items (scored 1-5) and reflects both function and pain in persons with musculoskeletal disorders of the upper extremity. To be able to calculate a score, at least 10 of the 11 items must be completed. The overall score ranges from 0 to 100 points with higher score representing greater disability.</description>
