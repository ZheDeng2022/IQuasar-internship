  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this research project are to evaluate whether global olfactory impairment is a&#xD;
      reliable indicator of preoperative frailty and cognitive impairment, and whether it may&#xD;
      predict postoperative neurocognitive disorders, morbidity and mortality in a population of&#xD;
      older patients scheduled for elective intermediate- to high-risk elective surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. We will measure preoperative global olfactory function (threshold, discrimination,&#xD;
           identification) and evaluate whether olfactory impairment predicts preoperative frailty&#xD;
           (using the Edmonton Frail Scale, the Clinical Frailty Scale and handgrip strength) and&#xD;
           postoperative complications and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. We will address the question whether preoperative olfactory impairment may be associated&#xD;
           with a preoperative cognitive impairment (through a neuropsychological test battery) and&#xD;
           whether it may predict a decrease in postoperative neurocognitive function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Olfactory impairment increases with age, affecting more than 50% of the population aged&#xD;
      between 65 and 80 years old. Recently, many studies have demonstrated a strong association&#xD;
      between olfactory impairment and overall mortality risk. At the moment, the underlying&#xD;
      physiopathology linking olfactory impairment to mortality remains unknown and only putative&#xD;
      mechanisms are suggested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among them, accelerated physiological brain aging seems to be involved, making olfactory&#xD;
      decline a possible marker of frailty. To date, only a few studies (mostly using subjective&#xD;
      olfactory assessment) investigated the potential relationship between olfactory impairment&#xD;
      and frailty. Moreover, neurodegenerative diseases, through cognitive dysfunction, seem likely&#xD;
      to represent a second mechanism potentially underlying the link between olfactory impairment&#xD;
      and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery, and more broadly the perioperative period, remains a major source of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Meanwhile, the average age of the surgical population continues to rise, making&#xD;
      preoperative risk assessment an essential step in order to detect the most vulnerable&#xD;
      patients. Yet, it is well-known that frailty is predictive of complications and mortality and&#xD;
      that preoperative cognitive impairment is associated with postoperative neurocognitive&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first objective of this research project is thus to evaluate global olfactory function of&#xD;
      preoperative older surgical patients in light of an assessment of their frailty and cognitive&#xD;
      status. Frailty will be tested with the Edmonton Frail Scale, the Clinical Frailty Scale and&#xD;
      handgrip strength. Cognitive function will be tested through a neuropsychological test&#xD;
      battery preoperatively and postoperatively. The second and third objectives are to correlate&#xD;
      preoperative olfactory function with, on the one hand, postoperative neurocognitive&#xD;
      disorders, and on the other hand, postoperative morbidity and mortality.&#xD;

    <description>Olfactory function will be evaluated through the Burghart Sniffin' Sticks test which is a validated psychophysical testing method. Sniffin' Sticks test is based on pen-like odor dispensing devices that will be presented to the patients. The extended version of this test will be used and consist of three tests of olfactory function, namely tests for odor threshold, odor discrimination and odor identification.</description>

    <description>The Edmonton Frail Scale (EFS) involves nine domains of frailty : functional performance, cognitive function, general health, functional independence, social support, used medications, nutrition, mood and continence. It has been validated with respect to comprehensive geriatric assessment and to other screening tools related to frail state. EFS test is considered most appropriate for use in routine preoperative screening and only requires 5 minutes.</description>
