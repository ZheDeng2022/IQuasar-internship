      There are few programs related to vocational peer support services in persons with&#xD;
      psychiatric disability in Taiwan. This study aims to develop a peer co-lead services in the&#xD;
      community rehabilitation center and evaluate the outcomes among service users with&#xD;
      schizophrenia under the integrated peer-support services in a supported employment program.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Taiwan, mental health services are provisioned through hospital-based treatment majorly&#xD;
      and shifted to community care gradually in recent decades. In 2020, the totally 7,350 beds of&#xD;
      acute wards and 13,559 beds of chronic wards covered the general population in Taiwan with&#xD;
      3.12/10,000 persons and 5.75/10,000 persons rates, respectively. In contrast to hospital&#xD;
      treatment, there were 71 community rehabilitation centers and 155 halfway houses in local&#xD;
      communities with coverage rate of 1.45/10,000 persons and 2.82/10,000 persons respectively.&#xD;
      The sheltered or supported employment in Taiwan is still primarily delivered by trained&#xD;
      professionals or paraprofessionals in the community facilities for the persons with severe&#xD;
      mental illness. Although the trained peers can deliver vocational supports based on recovery&#xD;
      concept as well as professionals at least in the supported employment services, the large&#xD;
      absence of peer support workers is rooted in the lack of insurance coverage and limited&#xD;
      government budgets in Taiwan. Accordingly, further investigations are warranted to evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of peer support services in vocational rehabilitation among persons with&#xD;
      severe mental illness under the development of peer-deliver services in Taiwan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators designed a 2-phase pilot program: establishment of peer support&#xD;
      training curriculum in Phase I to develop peer support services in vocational rehabilitation&#xD;
      system feasibly, and measurement of effectiveness under peer codelivered services in Phase II&#xD;
      (Protocol). The investigated effectiveness among persons with schizophrenia in this study&#xD;
      included the received social supports, mental health, psychiatric symptoms, functional and&#xD;
      occupational outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot program was held from April 2017 to December 2018 at the Taipei Veterans General&#xD;
      Hospital Yuli Branch (TVGH-YL). The hospital provides treatment and community care for&#xD;
      patients with mental illness who reside in the rural area of eastern Taiwan. The TVGH-YL&#xD;
      administers a half-way house, a community rehabilitation center, and a supported housing&#xD;
      program. The hospital also provides sheltered and supported employment as part of its&#xD;
      community care services for persons with mental illness. In one month before the program of&#xD;
      Phase I or II, the investigators recruited the participants by presenting poster on bulletins&#xD;
      in the half-way house and community rehabilitation center. The investigators also invited the&#xD;
      participants who had cared elderly persons in the past to join the training curriculum in the&#xD;
      Phase I program, because these persons were the candidates of peer support workers to share&#xD;
      the previous work experiences in the Phase II program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot program&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training for peer support workers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, there were 7 professionals who had the experiences in the community facilities for&#xD;
      at least 5 years discussing about the framework and contents of training curriculum for peer&#xD;
      support workers in the focus groups. These seven professionals specializing in 6 medical&#xD;
      disciplines were also the teachers in the curriculum. Table 2 details the themes of&#xD;
      curriculum at various intervention levels. In the end of each lecture session, there were&#xD;
      four questions being proposed by the teacher to exam the trainees about the core concepts of&#xD;
      class.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the practice session, the performance of trainees would be examined by the case discussion&#xD;
      or practice in roles playing or situation simulation. No final exam in Phase I program.&#xD;
      However, the trainee should pass all class after the teachers' agreement. If someone needed&#xD;
      to improve the knowledge or skills, he or she had gotten the personal time to receive more&#xD;
      helps from the teacher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extended vocational rehabilitation services co-led &amp; assisted by peer support workers&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program in Phase II was held twice in August of 2017 and April of 2018. Based on the&#xD;
      needs of elderly persons with disability or dementia in local community, the 2 occupational&#xD;
      therapists (Ching-Hui Wu &amp; Meng-Ping Kao) organized the extended work training course which&#xD;
      focused on improvements of care skills of Phase II program participants (service users). The&#xD;
      2 occupational therapists also held workplace problem-solving group once per 2 weeks for the&#xD;
      service users. The above interventions were originally parts of supported employment service&#xD;
      in the community rehabilitation center, but the participated rate was not satisfied&#xD;
      previously. Therefore, the investigators integrated the peer support service into this&#xD;
      service system. Before each training session, peer support workers discussed with 2&#xD;
      occupational therapists (&quot;stakeholders&quot;) to decide on the content and process of the session.&#xD;
      Peer support workers' involvement should account for at least 50% of the session time to&#xD;
      ensure the intensity of support. The supervisor (Kan Yuan Cheng) discussed with the&#xD;
      occupational therapy weekly and the peer support worker monthly based on the feedback in&#xD;
      satisfaction questionnaire by service users and the records in group. Four times of&#xD;
      observation by the supervision were also arranged to audit the performance of the&#xD;
      occupational therapist and peer support workers in the all sessions of Phase II program. More&#xD;
      specifics about this phase of the program can be found in study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process of assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre- and post-intervention self-report questionnaire was assisted by the occupational&#xD;
      therapist ( Meng-Ping Kao). The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-18 and Global Assessment of&#xD;
      Function scale were measured by board psychiatrist (Kan Yuan Cheng) who had experiences in&#xD;
      the multiple-center clinical trial. The assistant and investigator both belonged to the&#xD;
      intervention group because there was no control group or blind procedure in the study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      As all indicators examined in this study were continuous variables, the investigators used&#xD;
      paired t-test to compare the measurements before and after the intervention. IBM&#xD;
      (International Business Machines Corporation) SPSS Statistics 16.0 was employed for&#xD;
      statistical analysis.&#xD;
