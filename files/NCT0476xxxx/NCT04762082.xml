  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single dose, randomized, five-period, crossover design study to&#xD;
      evaluate the relative bioavailability of a single oral dose of tadalafil gummy 10 mg (Test)&#xD;
      and tadalafil oral tablets 10 mg (Reference) under fasted conditions in healthy adult male&#xD;
      and female subjects, and the impact on the bioavailability of tadalafil gummy sugar free 10&#xD;
      mg when administered with food, when administered with or without water, and when chewed or&#xD;
      swallowed whole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will receive tadalafil gummy (10 mg) or tadalafil tablet and thereby will be&#xD;
      his/hers own control.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Eligible subjects will receive a single oral dose of one of five treatments (Treatments A, B, C, D or E) in five separate periods in a randomly assigned sequence, with each treatment separated by an approximate 5-day washout period. In each study period, dosing will occur in the morning after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours.&#xD;
All doses will be administered under fasted conditions except for Treatment C, when tadalafil gummy 10 mg will be administered after consumption of a high-calorie, high-fat breakfast.&#xD;
All doses will be administered with approximately 240 mL of room temperature water except for Treatment D, when tadalafil gummy 10 mg dose will be administered without water.&#xD;
All doses of tadalafil gummy 10 mg will be chewed before swallowing except for Treatment E, when subjects will be instructed to swallow the dose whole.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>PK blood samples to measure plasma concentrations of tadalafil will be collected by direct venipuncture or by use of an indwelling cannula. Blood will be collected into tubes containing K2EDTA for determination of plasma tadalafil concentration at time 0 (within 60 minutes pre-dose), 10, 20 minute post-dose and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post-dose. Plasma tadalafil concentrations will be listed at each time point by subject and summarized by treatment at each time point using descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation (SD), Coefficient of variation (CV%), median, minimum and maximum values). Pharmacokinetic calculations will be performed based on actual time of blood sample collection, using non-compartmental methods with Phoenix WinNonlin Version 8.1 (Certara USA, Inc., Princeton, New Jersey, USA). Plots of mean concentrations of plasma tadalafil versus time will be generated and Cmax will be generated from the plot.</description>
