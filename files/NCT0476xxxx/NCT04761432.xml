  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This feasibility study will demonstrate the safety and accuracy of the Neopenda's wireless&#xD;
      vital signs monitor, neoGuard, on 30 adult patients in a Ugandan clinical setting. The&#xD;
      technology will be tested against a conventional patient monitor. Root mean square deviation&#xD;
      (RMSD) and Bland-Altman plots will be used to assess concordance between paired measurements&#xD;
      from the two equipment collected over a 1-hour period for each patient.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Continuous vital sign monitoring is a basic tenet of specialized care in the developed world&#xD;
      that is vastly underutilized in the intensive care units of most low-and-middle income&#xD;
      countries. Despite the positive outcomes associated with vital signs monitoring (i.e.&#xD;
      increased survival-to-discharge, lower complication rates and shorter length of&#xD;
      hospitalization), the prohibitive costs of conventional patient monitors and the difficulty&#xD;
      in maintaining complex medical equipment limit its accessibility in the developing world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feasibility study will demonstrate the safety and accuracy of the Neopenda's wireless&#xD;
      vital signs monitor, neoGuard, on adult patients in a Ugandan clinical setting. The&#xD;
      technology will be tested against a conventional patient monitor. Root mean square deviation&#xD;
      (RMSD) and Bland-Altman plots will be used to assess concordance between paired measurements&#xD;
      from the two equipment collected over a 1-hour period for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This technology innovation has large potential to impact health outcomes in low-resource&#xD;
      settings, as it is a portable, reusable, long-lasting, cost-efficient monitoring tool&#xD;
      designed for settings where patient loads are high and such solutions are direly needed.&#xD;
