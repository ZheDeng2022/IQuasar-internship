  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA) is form of scarring hair loss that&#xD;
      predominately affects middle-aged women of African descent.1 . Clinically, the natural&#xD;
      progression of CCCA starts at the crown as roughly circular scarred patches, which evolve&#xD;
      into scarred areas increasing in size circumferentially. Characteristically, the scar is&#xD;
      often smooth and shiny, and the hair density in the affected area is frequently decreased.&#xD;
      The hair remaining in the scarred areas is more brittle and shorter than the hair in&#xD;
      unaffected areas. Since CCCA is a scarring disorder, it can cause permanent hair loss,&#xD;
      dyesthesias, and psychological distress which can affect overall quality of life. Affected&#xD;
      individuals may complain of pruritus, pain, or tenderness.2&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of CCCA is challenging due to limited current treatments and a lack of&#xD;
      randomized controlled trails. Management focuses on behavioral and styling modifications, in&#xD;
      addition to symptomatic relief. Any potentially damaging hair care practices such as chemical&#xD;
      relaxers, heat application to the scalp, and the use of hardening gels and sprays are&#xD;
      discouraged.3 Many commonly used therapies are anti-inflammatory in nature, including&#xD;
      intralesional steroids, topical steroids, oral antibiotics and increased frequency of hair&#xD;
      washing with antidandruff shampoos.4 These treatments not only lead to improvement in&#xD;
      pruritus and tenderness, but in some cases result in increased hair density.5 Since there is&#xD;
      limited investigation done to determine the most effective treatment approach for CCCA&#xD;
      subjects, it would be of great benefit to determine if there is any advantage in using one&#xD;
      particular anti-inflammatory therapy over others and whether one is more efficacious in&#xD;
      relieving symptoms or promoting hair regrowth in follicles that have not yet become scarred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Revian Red All LED cap is a dual-band LED light therapy wireless &quot;smart&quot; cap. It has been&#xD;
      effective in androgenetic alopecia (used once daily, 10-minute treatment regimen) for both&#xD;
      men and women. There are also reportedly minimal side effects, unlike with topical minoxidil&#xD;
      which can cause pruritus and initial hair shedding in the first few weeks, or finasteride&#xD;
      which can cause gynecomastia and loss of libido. In this study we hope to see if the&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory capabilities of this cap can improve scalp symptoms, reduce hair loss, and&#xD;
      promote maturation of vellus and intermediate hairs in non-scarred areas of the scalp in&#xD;
      those affected by CCCA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if the Revian Red All LED cap shows potential&#xD;
      to be an effective treatment for CCCA by recruiting hair follicles back to anagen growth or&#xD;
      by improving inflammation. The primary outcome is to determine if hair loss regression is&#xD;
      halted. Secondary outcomes include hair regrowth and alleviation of signs and symptoms of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design 5 subjects who are willing to participate in a novel treatment for Revian Red All LED&#xD;
      cap will be enrolled in this study. The cap uses two wavelengths of light, 620 nm and 660 nm.&#xD;
      A study caps will be provided for each subject. Subjects will use the cap once daily,&#xD;
      10-minute treatment regimen which is the current androgenetic alopecia recommendation. The&#xD;
      subjects will use the cap for a total of 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized photos and dermatoscope photos before starting treatment and every 2 months for&#xD;
      x 6 total months will be taken to assess hairline stabilization and potential for regrowth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to study enrollment, all participants will receive a detailed explanation of the&#xD;
      purpose of the study and will undergo written informed consent. Clinical history of hair loss&#xD;
      and history of prior treatment will be obtained by administering a standardized questionnaire&#xD;
      to all subjects. Subjects will also fill out a questionnaire regarding symptoms of their hair&#xD;
      loss at each subsequent treatment visit and at follow-up. In order to be eligible, subjects&#xD;
      must be diagnosed clinically and histologically with CCCA. Diagnosis will be made only by a&#xD;
      board-certified dermatologist.&#xD;
