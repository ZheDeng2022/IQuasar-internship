  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, nerve hydrodissection is utilized to assist ultrasound-guided nerve injection and&#xD;
      studies recommend its clinical benefit for peripheral entrapment neuropathy. Hyaluronic acid&#xD;
      (HA) can decrease the post-surgery adhesion of soft tissue and nerve but its clinical&#xD;
      application in clinical practice is very rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We just proved that single HA injection have short-term effectiveness in mild-to-moderate&#xD;
      carpal tunnel (CTS) cases and this finding may hint the therapeutic effectiveness of nerve&#xD;
      hydrodissection for CTS depend on absorption time of solution. In addition, no study compare&#xD;
      different weight of HA for nerve injection so far. Hence, the purpose of this study aim to&#xD;
      compare different weight of HA for CTS and whether hydrodissection effect depend on the&#xD;
      absorption time of solution or not.&#xD;

      Participants established with diagnosis of mild-to-moderate CTS will been randomly assigned&#xD;
      to high molecular weight HA (Aragan Plus, 20 mg/2 ml, 3000kDa) or low molecular weight HA&#xD;
      (ARTZDispo, 25 mg/2.5 ml, 600-1200kDa) groups. With ultrasound guidance, total two-sessions&#xD;
      of high or low molecular weight HA with one week interval will been injected into&#xD;
      intra-carpal region. The Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire is assigned as primary&#xD;
      outcome. The secondary outcomes encompass visual analog scale, electrophysiological studies,&#xD;
      cross-sectional area of the median nerve, mobility of median nerve and absorption time of HA.&#xD;
      The assessment is performed prior injection and at 2 week, 1, 2, 3 and 6 months&#xD;
      post-injection.&#xD;

    <description>Boston carpal tunnel syndrome questionnaire (BCTQ) is a frequently used patient-based questionnaire for measurement of CTS which encompasses two components. In total, 11 questions and 8 items were evaluated to rate the symptom severity scale (SSS) and functional status scale (FSS), respectively. Both subscales range from 1 to 5 with a higher score indicating a higher degree of disability. The mean of total SSS and FSS divided with each item score were used for further analysis.</description>
