  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medication overload is an epidemic causing widespread harm, particularly to older Canadians.&#xD;
      While most prescriptions are intended to help people live longer and healthier lives, taking&#xD;
      multiple medications can increase frailty, and lead to dangerous side effects.This is a&#xD;
      mixed-methods study to determine the impact of MedReviewRx on prescribing in New Brunswick&#xD;
      Nursing Homes (NBNHs). MedReviewRx is an application which allows MedSafer to analyze a&#xD;
      person's medications and medical conditions and produce a report with suggestions for how to&#xD;
      simplify medications and make them safer. MedSafer reports will be used to assist physicians&#xD;
      and pharmacists identify potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) and conduct medication&#xD;
      reviews in NBNHs. The prevalence of PIMs in NBNHs before MedReviewRx will be measured and the&#xD;
      change in PIM use after implementation will be calculated. User experience with MedSafer&#xD;
      reports and MedReviewRx will be explored. Patient and Family attitudes towards deprescribing&#xD;
      will also be studied. Investigators hypothesize that implementing MedReviewRx in New&#xD;
      Brunswick Nursing Homes (NBNHs) will promote deprescribing which will lead to a decrease in&#xD;
      the number of PIMs and a decrease in medication costs for older adults living in NBNHs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Medication overload is an epidemic causing widespread harm, particularly to older Canadians.&#xD;
      While most prescriptions are intended to help people live longer and healthier lives, taking&#xD;
      multiple medications can increase frailty, and lead to dangerous side effects. As people age,&#xD;
      the way medicines work may change and certain medicines are more likely cause problems with&#xD;
      memory, thinking and balance. To minimize these risks, it is important to regularly review&#xD;
      all medicines an older adult is taking. A medication review can be complicated, and it takes&#xD;
      time. MedSafer is a computer program that helps physicians and pharmacists identify medicines&#xD;
      that may no longer be needed or are dangerous. The software runs an analysis of a person's&#xD;
      medications and medical conditions and produces a report with suggestions for how to simplify&#xD;
      combinations of medications and make them safer. The process of safely reducing medications&#xD;
      is called deprescribing. A computer application powered by MedSafer was built for nursing&#xD;
      homes. This Polypharmacy App was piloted at a large urban nursing home. Initial impression of&#xD;
      the system was positive. Improvements were made and it was rebranded as MedReviewRx. The&#xD;
      current study will test MedReviewRx in other nursing homes in New Brunswick. MedReviewRx&#xD;
      allows health care providers (prescribers, pharmacists and nurses) in nursing homes to access&#xD;
      MedSafer analysis on a tablet or laptop. The investigators expect that access to this&#xD;
      information will promote deprescribing in nursing homes, reduce potentially inappropriate&#xD;
      medications (PIMs) and result in cost savings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation design for quality improvement&#xD;
      research that will make use of mixed methods of evaluation. Implementation consists of using&#xD;
      MedReviewRx. Effectiveness analysis consists of measuring the impact of the MedReviewRx on&#xD;
      PIMs. Exploratory surveys (the mixed methods component of the study) which look at&#xD;
      qualitative and quantitative user feedback and patient and caregiver attitudes about&#xD;
      deprescribing will be used to explain study findings. Informal feedback, surveys and&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews will be used to examine user experience with MedReviewRx. The&#xD;
      Revised Patient Attitude Towards Deprescribing (rPATD) questionnaire &quot;older adult&quot; version&#xD;
      for the patients and a &quot;caregiver&quot; version for family members/substitute decision makers will&#xD;
      be used to describe patient and family member attitudes about deprescribing medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated study duration is 18 months. Deployment will approximate a Stepped Wedge Cluster&#xD;
      Randomized Trial Design (SW-CRT). This type of study design allows us to approximate a&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial. It has many advantages and is considered the most robust type of&#xD;
      study design for a pragmatic quality improvement intervention. All clusters act as an&#xD;
      internal control (before and after) as well as a control for the other clusters (external&#xD;
      control). This novel study design addresses issues with seasonality and allows all clusters&#xD;
      to participate in the intervention, which is an advantage when the intervention is related to&#xD;
      quality improvement. It also allows us to measure for within and between cluster comparisons.&#xD;
      Moreover, stepped-wedge trials are claimed by many researchers to have a statistical&#xD;
      advantage over parallel cluster randomized trials. In the same direction, more researchers&#xD;
      state that on one hand, for cluster randomized trials (CRTs), the stepped wedge design is far&#xD;
      more efficient than the parallel group and ANCOVA design in terms of sample size. On the&#xD;
      other hand, these researchers also state that the stepped wedge design requires a&#xD;
      substantially smaller sample size than a parallel group and ANCOVA design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have three clusters with a combined total of approximately 750 nursing home&#xD;
      beds. Nursing home resident turnover rates may be as high as 30% per year therefore the&#xD;
      researchers anticipate that up to 1000 residents will be screened by MedSafer at least once&#xD;
      and 300 of them, or more, will have a potentially inappropriate medication (PIM) identified.&#xD;
      A random generator was used to place participating nursing homes into the following three&#xD;
      clusters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cluster 1: 3 months control + 9 months intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cluster 2: 6 months control + 6 months intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cluster 3: 9 months control + 3 months intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      As illustrated, the study will begin with a minimum three-month control phase. During the&#xD;
      control phase, MedReviewRx will not be accessible to health care professionals at the nursing&#xD;
      homes. This serves to obtain baseline deprescribing levels for each nursing home. Every three&#xD;
      to four months thereafter, a cluster of nursing homes will enter intervention mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the control phase, nursing home residents and their families or substitute decision&#xD;
      makers will be recruited to complete a survey to explore patient attitudes about&#xD;
      deprescribing in this NB study population. The rPATD questionnaire &quot;older adult&quot; version will&#xD;
      be provided to nursing home residents and the &quot;caregiver&quot; version will be provided to family&#xD;
      members and substitute decision makers. Survey questions will be entered in Lime survey to&#xD;
      promote electronic completion whenever possible. A recruitment poster will be displayed at&#xD;
      study sites and a recruitment communication will be sent to family members and substitute&#xD;
      decision makers identified in the resident's admission package. Paper copies will also be&#xD;
      available from the study site contact. Residents and family members who ask nursing home&#xD;
      staff about the survey will have their contact information forwarded to the Centre for&#xD;
      Innovation and Research in Aging (CIRA) research manager to answer questions and obtain&#xD;
      verbal consent to have a survey e-mailed to them. If e-mail is not available, a research&#xD;
      assistant will contact the participant to administer the survey over the phone. Study site&#xD;
      contacts may also distribute paper copies of the surveys if requested and permitted by the&#xD;
      study site. Stamped envelopes addressed to the CIRA research manager will be provided with&#xD;
      each paper survey distributed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also during the control phase, health care providers and study site staff will be recruited&#xD;
      to register for MedReviewRx. A recruitment communication will be sent by e-mail and placed in&#xD;
      study site mailboxes. Study recruitment will also be encouraged at interdisciplinary nursing&#xD;
      home meetings such as Pharmacy and Therapeutics and Medical Advisory Committee meetings. User&#xD;
      training will be provided by the study site contact or designate(s) as determined by the&#xD;
      site-specific implementation plan. Nursing home site contacts will participate in an&#xD;
      interview to evaluate MedReviewRx implementation. Implementation interviews will be conducted&#xD;
      within the first 3 months of the site intervention phase videoconference by the CIRA research&#xD;
      manager or designate via telephone or Zoom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the intervention phase, MedReviewRx will be made available to nursing homes with the&#xD;
      understanding that it will be used to facilitate medication reviews and prescription&#xD;
      check-ups. MedReviewRx provides clinicians with access to individualized and prioritized&#xD;
      deprescribing information from MedSafer which: a) identifies PIMs, b) explains why the&#xD;
      medication is potentially inappropriate and c) provides instructions on how to safely&#xD;
      stop/taper the medication. Nursing homes will also have the option to print MedSafer&#xD;
      deprescribing reports from MedReviewRx for clinicians who do not have computer access or who&#xD;
      choose not to register to use MedReviewRx. If reports are printed, they will be placed in a&#xD;
      binder for the prescriber to sign and date indicating that they have read the report.&#xD;
      Prescribers and nursing home staff will be encouraged to write feedback directly on the&#xD;
      report if they wish too. To assess the proportion of reports that were read, and feedback&#xD;
      provided on the reports, signed reports will be kept in a locked cabinet for research&#xD;
      assistants to collect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinicians will review deprescribing opportunities (electronically or via a paper report) and&#xD;
      determine if medications can be tapered or stopped. Medication changes are discussed with the&#xD;
      resident or substitute decision maker as part of usual care. This process will not change&#xD;
      with the implementation of MedReviewRx. If the prescriber decides to alter a medication based&#xD;
      on the deprescribing opportunities provided by MedSafer and their expert knowledge, the&#xD;
      prescriber will do so in the same manner as they did prior to implementation of MedReviewRx,&#xD;
      and discussion with the resident and/or substitute decision maker will occur according to the&#xD;
      process in place at each nursing home. During the intervention phase, an analysis of&#xD;
      deprescribing opportunities will be conducted by MedSafer once every 3 months for each&#xD;
      resident in the nursing home. Results will be stored in the MedReviewRx system to be accessed&#xD;
      at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      User feedback on MedReviewRx and MedSafer deprescribing information will be solicited from&#xD;
      prescribers, pharmacists and nursing home staff throughout the study using surveys. Surveys&#xD;
      may be completed via Lime Survey, on paper or by telephone (depending on the preference of&#xD;
      the person). Three surveys will be distributed by e-mail to registered MedReviewRx users as&#xD;
      well as other study site prescribers, pharmacists and nurses who may have access to printed&#xD;
      reports from MedReviewRx. A MedReviewRx user feedback survey will be distributed at the end&#xD;
      of the first and third quarter of the intervention and an acceptability and feasibility&#xD;
      survey will be distributed at the end of the study. Informal feedback received by e-mail from&#xD;
      users will be reviewed and actioned by the CIRA research manager or designate. E-mail&#xD;
      feedback will be documented anonymously in an excel spreadsheet and reported to the study&#xD;
      principle investigators within 1 week of receipt to determine if tasks need to be submitted&#xD;
      to the technical team for software updates. Rapid cycle improvements in usability of the&#xD;
      system and MedSafer output will be made based on survey results and informal feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informal feedback written on printed MedSafer reports will be documented in an excel&#xD;
      spreadsheet and included in the analysis of qualitative feedback provided by survey and&#xD;
      interview. Frequency of MedReviewRx use will be measured electronically by counting the&#xD;
      number of times a user accesses their account. Overall experience with the research project&#xD;
      will be evaluated using semi-structured interview conducted at the end of the intervention&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
