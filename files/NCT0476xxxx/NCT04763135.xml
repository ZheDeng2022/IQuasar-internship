    <textblock>
      Multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trial based on a mixed-method methodology&#xD;
      using parallel groups, of oral mirtazapine (intervention) compared with oral escitalopram&#xD;
      (control), with a 56 days follow-up. Improvement of the Global health Status (issued from the&#xD;
      EORTC-QLQ-C30 (Quality of Life Questionnaire)) will be used as the primary outcome on day 56.&#xD;
      Semi-structures interviews will be performed on a purposive sample for qualitative analysis.&#xD;
      The 418 participants will be followed-up at day 7, 14, 28 and 56 for a 56 days period. A&#xD;
      sub-group of participants will be invited to take part into qualitative interviews at&#xD;
      baseline and day 56. Recruitment of participants to the qualitative part will be based on a&#xD;
      purposive sampling.&#xD;
