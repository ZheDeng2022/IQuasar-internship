  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see if the Paxman scalp cooling device can prevent hair loss in&#xD;
      pediatric patients receiving chemotherapy for non-cancerous conditions and to compare the&#xD;
      amount of hair loss between the patients receiving chemotherapy for non-cancerous conditions&#xD;
      who wear the scalp cooling device during chemotherapy and those who do not wear the device&#xD;
      during their chemotherapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and feasibility of the use of a scalp cooling device in pediatric&#xD;
           and young adult patients receiving chemotherapy for non-malignant disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the incidence and intensity of chemotherapy induced hair loss in patients&#xD;
           receiving chemotherapy for non-malignant conditions who have used a scalp cooling&#xD;
           device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants receiving cooling cap therapy will receive scalp hypothermia as delivered by the&#xD;
      scalp cooling system and as per the manufacturers recommendations. Scalp cooling will begin&#xD;
      30-45 minutes prior to administration of each chemotherapy (45 minutes for those with thick&#xD;
      or coarse hair types). Scalp temperature will be maintained at +3°C (37°F) throughout drug&#xD;
      administration and for 90-120 minutes after discontinuing the infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A trained study staff member will be present to place the cool cap on the participant, ensure&#xD;
      proper fit, begin the cooling process, and ensure functionality. The bedside nurse on the&#xD;
      inpatient unit will monitor the participants during the duration of cool cap therapy while&#xD;
      also receiving chemotherapy infusion. A trained study team member will be available for any&#xD;
      questions or issues that may arise during this time. When the participant is ready to remove&#xD;
      the cooling cap a trained study team member will return to shut off the device, remove the&#xD;
      cap, and assess the participant.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving a chemotherapeutic agent likely to cause alopecia. Any patient&#xD;
             receiving the following drugs may experience complete alopecia (dose and schedule&#xD;
             dependent). If they are receiving such a drug for a non- malignant indication, they&#xD;
             may be suitable for inclusion in the study and may benefit from the use of a scalp&#xD;
             cooling device. These drugs include alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide,&#xD;
             busulfan, thiotepa), and topoisomerase inhibitors (etoposide, irinotecan). Alopecia is&#xD;
             less common or incomplete with bleomycin, oral cyclophosphamide, gemcitabine,&#xD;
             melphalan, methotrexate, the platinums (oxaliplatin, cisplatin, and carboplatin),&#xD;
             topotecan, and the vinca alkaloids. Antibody-drug conjugates are also associated with&#xD;
             variable hair loss, which is agent specific.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed with a non-malignant condition (such as Sickle Cell Disease or Aplastic&#xD;
             Anemia)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be at least 7 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should have a head circumference of 50 cm or greater&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving a chemotherapeutic agent for a malignant/neoplastic condition&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a previous history of adverse event associated with the Paxman scalp kit&#xD;
             or scalp cooling device&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with cold agglutinin disease or cold urticaria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability or unwillingness of research participant or legal guardian/representative to&#xD;
             give written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an active infection/infestation of scalp at the time of study enrollment&#xD;
