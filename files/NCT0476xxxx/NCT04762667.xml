    <textblock>
      Degenerative diseases and traumatic injuries of the shoulder joint, lead to dysfunction of&#xD;
      the arm. Arthroplasty has recently become an increasingly popular operation for severe damage&#xD;
      to the shoulder joint. In clinical practice, the most effective operation today is the&#xD;
      reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA), after the installation of which the pain syndrome&#xD;
      disappears in patients and a satisfactory range of motion in the shoulder joint resumes. With&#xD;
      the increasing use of reverse shoulder arthroplasty and its expanding indications, surgeons&#xD;
      today are facing tougher reconstructive challenges while still providing the patient with a&#xD;
      good clinical outcome. The damaged joint presents a problem for the surgeon during component&#xD;
      positioning. Implants must place the in a location and orientation that optimizes range of&#xD;
      motion and stability while minimizing impingement. In order to address this, surgeons can&#xD;
      look to the use of 3D imaging in order to better understand each patient's pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are performed computed tomography scans (CT) of the shoulder joint. Then, were&#xD;
      reconstructed 3D model. To determine the position of the components is mounted a scapular&#xD;
      plane was created based on 3 points on the 3D reconstructed scapula: center of the glenoid&#xD;
      fossa, most medial point on the spinal border of the scapula, and most distal point on the&#xD;
      inferior angle of the scapula. The investigators use a scapular plane for to determine the&#xD;
      optimal angles of inclination of the reverse baseplate. Then the position and direction of&#xD;
      the pilot pin is determined. The position of the fixing screws and their length are also&#xD;
      calculated. A resection line is planned for the humerus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative virtual templating can be used to translate the preoperative plan into the&#xD;
      operating suite in the form of patient specific instrumentation (PSI) and intraoperative&#xD;
      navigation. PSI to reference the local anatomy in order to place the guide pin in the desired&#xD;
      location, version, and inclination based on the preoperative plan. After surgery, all&#xD;
      patients undergo a CT scan of the shoulder joint. These data are compared with CT scan of&#xD;
      patients operated on according to the standard method. The range of motion is also assessed&#xD;
      and compared.&#xD;

      Background: Degenerative diseases and traumatic injuries of the shoulder joint, lead to&#xD;
      dysfunction of the arm. Arthroplasty has recently become an increasingly popular operation&#xD;
      for severe damage to the shoulder joint. In clinical practice, the most effective operation&#xD;
      today is the reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA), after the installation of which the pain&#xD;
      syndrome disappears in patients and a satisfactory range of motion in the shoulder joint&#xD;
      resumes. With the increasing use of reverse shoulder arthroplasty and its expanding&#xD;
      indications, surgeons today are facing tougher reconstructive challenges while still&#xD;
      providing the patient with a good clinical outcome. The damaged joint presents a problem for&#xD;
      the surgeon during component positioning. Implants must place in a location and orientation&#xD;
      that optimizes range of motion and stability while minimizing impingement. In order to&#xD;
      address this, surgeons can look to the use of 3D imaging in order to better understand each&#xD;
      patient's pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: show the effectiveness of accurate preoperative planning and prove it using&#xD;
      patient-specific instrumentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Patients aged 18 and older, male and female, are participating in our study. The&#xD;
      established diagnosis: multifragmental fracture of the humerus head; aseptic necrosis of the&#xD;
      humerus head; complete tears of the rotator cuff; arthrosis of the shoulder joint; rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis of the shoulder joint. The study included 65 shoulders with shoulder joint&#xD;
      pathology. The main group included 15 patients. This group of patients will undergo reverse&#xD;
      shoulder arthroplasty with patient-specific instrumentation. Second group of patients will&#xD;
      undergo conventional reverse shoulder arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In investigators work, all patients are performs MSCT of the shoulder joint, clinical&#xD;
      assessment of the shoulder joint and assessment of neurological status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planning of the position of the endoprosthesis components in the main group of patients&#xD;
      was carried out in several stages. The first stage: the position of the guide wire was&#xD;
      calculated, taking into account the individual anatomy of the patient. The second step is to&#xD;
      measure the angle of the pilot spoke in the axial projection. In the third stage, the&#xD;
      planting depth is estimated. It is necessary to strive for complete adherence of the&#xD;
      component, but at the same time, one should not forget about the preservation of the glenoid&#xD;
      bone mass. At the fourth stage, the position of the fixing screws was calculated. Given the&#xD;
      angle of inclination of the screws of 30 degrees, it is necessary to design the position of&#xD;
      the screws on the 3D model so that they are as deep as possible in the bone mass. Due to&#xD;
      this, we will obtain a reliable fixation for the glenoid base. Then we measure the length of&#xD;
      the bone canals for the screws. The fifth stage is to calculate the direction of resection of&#xD;
      the humeral head. For this, in a direct projection in the area of the anatomical neck, an&#xD;
      angle of 135 degrees is built relative to the central axis of the bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Construction of a 3D model is carried out using the obtained data first group patients.&#xD;
      Taking into account the individual features of the bone structure of the shoulder joint,&#xD;
      images of the pilot wire guides, fixing screws and a resection template for the humerus are&#xD;
      created. Holes for fixing spokes for the planned structures are also calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a 3D printer, models of guides and a resection template are printed. During the reverse&#xD;
      shoulder arthropalsty, instead of a standard guide, patient-specific instrumentation are used&#xD;
      for first group patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the early postoperative period, all patients are performs MSCT of the shoulder joint. The&#xD;
      obtained data are compared with the results of MSCT of the shoulder joints of patients&#xD;
      previously operated on using the standard technique. Functional outcomes are assessed&#xD;
      according to the Constant-Murley Score, the University of California, Los Angeles Shoulder&#xD;
      Assessment, and (Shoulder assessment form american shoulder and elbow surgeons, (ASES)&#xD;
      Shoulder Outcome Score). Functional results are seen after 1, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned results: in this study, we hope to prove the effectiveness of preoperative planning.&#xD;
      The investigators expect that the precise positioning of the components using&#xD;
      patient-specific instrumentation will increase the range of motion in the shoulder joint,&#xD;
      reduce the complication rate, and also improve the quality of life of patients after reverse&#xD;
      shoulder arthroplasty.&#xD;
