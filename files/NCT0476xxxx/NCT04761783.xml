  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective data collection study of patients with advanced solid tumors who will&#xD;
      receive standard of care immunotherapy (IO) and will be monitored with SIGNATERA™ testing.&#xD;
      SIGNATERA™ test will be performed at baseline and during routine care. The test results will&#xD;
      be part of assessing tumor response. The correlation between SIGNATERA™ test results and&#xD;
      subsequent treatment decisions will be examined to compare actual treatment delivered against&#xD;
      treatment decisions potentially impacted by SIGNATERA™ results. Treatment administered, tumor&#xD;
      assessment results, time to progression, overall survival, physician questionnaires, and&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes will be collected/recorded.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ● To examine the impact of SIGNATERA™ on clinical decision-making regarding continuation,&#xD;
      discontinuation, escalation, or de-escalation of immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ● To prospectively evaluate the utility of SIGNATERA™ as a tool to detect early evidence of&#xD;
      response or progression in patients with advanced solid tumors receiving immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitors.&#xD;

      There are two arms to this study: A prospective arm that will enroll 1539 patients, and a&#xD;
      historical control (retrospective arm) that will enroll 513 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant in the Prospective arm will have received the commercially available&#xD;
      SIGNATERA™ test.&#xD;
