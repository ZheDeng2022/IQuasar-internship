  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking remains one of the leading causes of preventable death. Effective smoking&#xD;
      cessation medications exist but use of these treatments is low, making it difficult for most&#xD;
      to quit smoking. Behavioral interventions are needed to engage current smokers in the process&#xD;
      of quitting smoking and promote the use of evidence-based cessation medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, genetics influences one's smoking behaviors (e.g., how much they smoke,&#xD;
      difficulty quitting) and risk of smoking-related diseases, yet these personalized factors&#xD;
      have not been included in existing behavioral interventions. Incorporating these&#xD;
      individualized factors into smoking cessation interventions may make them more personally&#xD;
      engaging and thus motivating for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will pilot test a risk communication tool that is personalized to one's genetics&#xD;
      and will demonstrate the feasibility of a larger trial to test the effect of this&#xD;
      personalized genetically-informed intervention on smoking cessation.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Project data will be shared in de-identified form in accordance with NIH policies including the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy. The informed consent process will explain policies for sharing de-identified data with other investigators and NIH repositories.&#xD;
Even though the dataset to be shared will be stripped of identifiers prior to release for sharing, there may be the possibility of deductive disclosure of subjects with unusual characteristics. Thus, the investigators will make the individual-level data and associated documentation available to users only under a data-sharing agreement that provides for: (1) a commitment to use the data only for research purposes and not attempt to identify any individual participant; (2) a commitment to store the data on a secure server and take necessary precautions to protect the security of the data; and (3) a commitment to destroy the data after analyses are completed.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_time_frame>Plan to publish within 12 months of ending data collection.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>The investigators will disseminate study findings through manuscripts, presentations, and lay reports. The investigators will make available via publications the steps and programs needed to implement the intervention. The investigators will make the protocols and tools available to other researchers to be used as a model template for interventions bringing genetics to the treatment of other substance use disorders.</ipd_access_criteria>
