    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human Phase 1, single-arm, open-label, multicenter, multiple-dose,&#xD;
      dose-escalation and dose-expansion study of ABL503 to evaluate the safety, tolerability, MTD&#xD;
      and/or RP2D, PK, immunogenicity, preliminary antitumor activity, and the PD effect of ABL503&#xD;
      in subjects with any progressive locally advanced (unresectable) or metastatic solid tumors&#xD;
      who are relapsed or refractory following the last line of treatment and have no available&#xD;
      standard of care option. This study includes 2 parts: a dose-escalation part and a&#xD;
      dose-expansion part.&#xD;
