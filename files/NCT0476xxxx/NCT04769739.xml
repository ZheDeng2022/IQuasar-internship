  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to compare the left colon mucus production between carbon dioxide (CO2)&#xD;
      insufflation and water exchange (WE) colonoscopy in patients that require a routine or repeat&#xD;
      colonoscopy. There will be four arms in this study: CO2 insufflation (control group 1), WE&#xD;
      with water infusion (control group 2), WE with 50% saline infusion (study group 1), and WE&#xD;
      with 25% saline infusion (study group 2). The patient will prepare himself/herself for the&#xD;
      colonoscopy as per normal instructions and he/she will be given the information for the study&#xD;
      at that time so that he/she can make a decision to participate in the study. The WE control&#xD;
      group will use sterile water filling during colonoscope insertion. The study method will use&#xD;
      saline filling during colonoscopy insertion. This study will confirm if using the saline&#xD;
      infusion is a better method in reducing mucus production when WE colonoscopy is used.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multi-site, blinded investigators, prospective randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT). Randomization (CO2, WE with water, WE with 50% saline, WE with 25% saline) will be&#xD;
      based on computer generated random numbers placed inside opaque sealed envelopes. The&#xD;
      envelope (in pre-arranged order) will be opened to reveal the code when the colonoscopist is&#xD;
      ready to insert the endoscope to begin the examination. This will be a comparison of two&#xD;
      different insertion methods with four arms (CO2 insufflation, WE with water, WE with 50%&#xD;
      saline, WE with 25% saline) to see which solution used in WE is better in reducing mucus&#xD;
      production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are willing to participate will sign an informed consent before starting the&#xD;
      colonoscopy procedure. Separate parallel randomization will be set up at each site,&#xD;
      stratified by investigators and indication of colonoscopy (screening, surveillance, or&#xD;
      positive fecal immunochemical test). Mode of sedation will include unsedated (Taipei Medical&#xD;
      University Hospital), conscious sedation (Evergreen General Hospital), or full sedation with&#xD;
      propofol (Taipei Medical University Hospital). Randomization (prepared by statistics&#xD;
      consultant) will be carried out by the method of random permuted block design (based on&#xD;
      computer generated random numbers) with variable block of 3 and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control method: One arm of the study will include sedated/unsedated colonoscopy with water&#xD;
      infusion during insertion as the control method. Residual air in the colon will be removed&#xD;
      and sterile water will be infused to guide insertion through an airless lumen. Infused water&#xD;
      will be removed by suction, along with residual fecal debris, predominantly during insertion.&#xD;
      Another arm of the study will include sedated/unsedated colonoscopy with CO2 insufflation&#xD;
      during insertion as an additional control method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study method: Two arms of the study will include sedated/unsedated colonoscopy with saline&#xD;
      infusion of different strength, i.e., 50% saline and 25% saline, during insertion. Residual&#xD;
      air in the colon will be removed and normal saline will be infused to guide insertion through&#xD;
      an airless lumen. Infused saline will be removed by suction, along with residual fecal&#xD;
      debris, predominantly during insertion.&#xD;
