  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-neurogenic male lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS) is one of the most common symptom&#xD;
      presented in urological clinic. Male LUTS could be a result of a combination of many&#xD;
      different conditions, including benign prostate hypertrophy, overactive bladder, diabetes,&#xD;
      noctural polyuria, sleep apnoea etc. Also male LUTS has shown to have close relationship with&#xD;
      metabolic and cardiovascular conditions. Because of the increasing evidences to suggest a&#xD;
      close relationship of cardiovascular condition and metabolic problems and male LUTS, this is&#xD;
      a study to retrospective review of the patients assessed in this urology clinic and have a&#xD;
      more in-depth assessment of the relationship of the baseline characteristics of these medical&#xD;
      conditions with the presenting symptoms, as well as the long term urological and overall&#xD;
      clinical outcomes of these patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective study.Male patients who presented with lower urinary tract symptom to&#xD;
      our centre and assessed in the urology clinic from 2005 to 2019 would be enrolled to the&#xD;
      study. This study will be conducted by observation; that is, data will be captured from&#xD;
      medical records and central medical system (CMS), but patients will not be contacted. All the&#xD;
      demographic and medical background, as well as investigations performed during the assessment&#xD;
      including uroflowmetry, post-voiding residual, questionnaires, blood pressure, pulse,&#xD;
      vascular assessment and blood result will be collected. Follow-up data including usage of&#xD;
      medication, clinical outcomes (such as development of urinary retention, cardiovascular&#xD;
      events, need of surgical intervention, mortality etc.) will be captured from the medical&#xD;
      records.&#xD;
