    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized study for adult patients presenting to the Carilion Clinic&#xD;
      Institute of Orthopedics and Neurosurgery. Patients undergoing isolated ACL reconstruction&#xD;
      will be eligible for inclusion. All patients will receive an adductor canal block (either&#xD;
      with bupivacaine or Exparel. Patients will be given a pain diary for self-report of pill&#xD;
      counts, pain scores, block duration, and pain control satisfaction). Pill counts and pain&#xD;
      scores will also be taken by a team member at two and six-week post-operative visits. Primary&#xD;
      outcomes include opioid requirements and pain scores.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients who have an isolated anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction scheduled to be&#xD;
      performed at Roanoke Ambulatory Surgery Center (RASC) by one of the participating Carilion&#xD;
      surgeons will be prescreened, assessed for eligibility and consented at the pre-operative&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This office visit already includes: a formatted discussion regarding the risks, benefits and&#xD;
      alternatives to surgery; and a review of the opioid policy and patient agreement used by&#xD;
      Carilion Clinic's Institute for Orthopaedics and Neurosciences (ION). The PI or&#xD;
      sub-investigators will conduct the discussion regarding the rationale and use of adductor&#xD;
      canal block (ACB) with the procedure, the rationale for assessment of alternate medications&#xD;
      used for the study, and any other pertinent details. An approved research team member will&#xD;
      review all sections of the IRB approved research consent in detail, in person at the pre-&#xD;
      operative visit. All questions will be answered, and physical signatures will be obtained.&#xD;
      Both research groups, control and experimental, will sign the same consent document. A copy&#xD;
      of the signed consent will be provided to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be given a pain diary to take home and begin filling out on post-op day&#xD;
      #1 (POD#1). Per patient preference, pain diary may be physical copy or done electronically&#xD;
      via REDCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be instructed on how to record entries in the pain diary by an approved&#xD;
      research team member, and will be instructed to record entries daily. The pain diary will&#xD;
      have templated pages with areas to record the amounts and names of medications they consumed,&#xD;
      Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score, Intervention Based Pain Scale (IBPS) score, as well as&#xD;
      satisfaction levels and a place to record how long their anesthetic block lasted. NRS&#xD;
      responses will be indicated by circling a number ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain&#xD;
      imaginable). IBPS responses will be indicated by asking patients to check a box next to the&#xD;
      statement that best describes their pain management that day. A numerical score will be&#xD;
      associated with responses ranging from 1-6. Patient satisfaction will be asked regarding&#xD;
      their pain management for the day on a 5-point likert scale ranging from very dissatisfied to&#xD;
      very satisfied. Field block duration will be recorded in hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be provided the same information and education regarding postoperative&#xD;
      pain management protocol and expectations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is standard of care at Carilion Clinic's ION and includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A review of the opioid policy and patient agreement used by Carilion Clinic's ION as well as&#xD;
      a discussion about proper use of the pain medication to be prescribed for postoperative pain&#xD;
      management A discussion regarding the pain blocks used with the procedure and their likely&#xD;
      duration of analgesia A discussion of scheduled postoperative visits and how to contact the&#xD;
      office with questions/concerns regarding recovery&#xD;
&#xD;
      The random number generator feature in REDcap will be used to randomly assign subjects to&#xD;
      receive the standard Bupivacaine HCl ACB or the Exparel ACB. Surgery schedules at RASC are&#xD;
      released on Friday the week before. We will retrieve the surgery schedule on Fridays from&#xD;
      RASC, find our study subjects, and randomize them to group A (Exparel) or group B&#xD;
      (Bupivacaine HCl) that same day (the Friday before surgery). Once the subjects are&#xD;
      randomized, we will communicate the randomization to a RASC staff member, and they will put&#xD;
      the arm designation (group A or group B) in an envelope and attach it to the subject's chart&#xD;
      for the day of surgery. The contents of the envelope will only be seen by Anesthesia&#xD;
      providers and charge nurses prior to the surgery with no other study staff in the room (so&#xD;
      the blind is not broken). Charge nurses and anesthesiologists at RASC will be unblinded to&#xD;
      the definitions of groups A &amp; B in order to gather and administer the proper medications.&#xD;
      Charge nurses will see the designation of group A or B in the envelope attached to the&#xD;
      subject's chart and gather the appropriate anesthetic medications for the anesthesiologists.&#xD;
      Surgeons will not be in the room at the time of anesthetic administration. The patient and&#xD;
      all other providers including physicians and physician assistants will be blinded to the&#xD;
      result of the randomization. Patients may opt to be unblinded to their group assignment at&#xD;
      their 6- week post- operative visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be undergoing a routine ACLR. The procedure will not deviate from the&#xD;
      standard of care operation that is typically performed. All patients will receive&#xD;
      post-operative pain medication regimens established by the participating physicians. This&#xD;
      regimen is as follows: Loading dose of Toradol in OR (15- 30mg dependent on patient risk&#xD;
      factors) followed by prescription for 20 tabs oral Hydrocodone /Acetaminophen (Norco) 5/325&#xD;
      mg and 15 tabs oral Toradol 10mg. Intraoperative supplemental anesthesia will include&#xD;
      Marcaine 0.5% or 1% with epinephrine (dependent on medication availability). Additional NSAID&#xD;
      use and DVT prophylaxis will be left to discretion of patient and provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to their operation, all patients will receive an ultrasound-guided ACB by a pool of&#xD;
      anesthesia providers at RASC. The only difference between subject groups is that the control&#xD;
      group will receive a standard Bupivacaine HCl ACB and the experimental group will receive an&#xD;
      Exparel ACB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of surgery all patients will be brought to the pre-operative holding area at RASC&#xD;
      where they are seen prior to the surgical procedure by both the operating surgeon and the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist. The operating surgeon will review the surgical procedure with all patients&#xD;
      and will mark the side and location of the procedure. The anesthesiologist will review the&#xD;
      ACB procedure with the patient and ensure correct side and location marked by physician.&#xD;
      Before the anesthesiologist begins administration of the ACB, a surgical time-out is&#xD;
      performed with the operating surgeon, the anesthesiologist and the patient. This is a&#xD;
      universal procedure and is the final reassurance of accurate patient identity, surgical site,&#xD;
      and planned procedure. In addition, the correct patient positioning, presence of allergies,&#xD;
      and the availability of relevant documents and diagnostic tests, instruments, implants and&#xD;
      other pertinent equipment are confirmed during this time. A second time-out will also be&#xD;
      performed prior to the start of the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pre-operative holding area, the anesthesiologist will administer the ACB under&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance. Patients in the control group will receive 20mL of standard 0.5%&#xD;
      bupivacaine. Patients in the intervention group will receive 10mL of standard 0.5%&#xD;
      bupivacaine, followed by 10mL of Exparel. If patients are unable to sit still during ACB&#xD;
      administration, they may be sedated by the anesthesiologist with one of the following&#xD;
      (Medications and dosages vary based on patient need. Most common medications used listed&#xD;
      below):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Versed Fentanyl Propofol&#xD;
&#xD;
      15-20 minutes after administration of ACB's (Bupivacaine HCl or Exparel), all patients will&#xD;
      undergo induction of anesthesia by the anesthesiologist. After general anesthesia takes&#xD;
      effect, all patients will be operated on by their orthopaedic surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be called or seen in the office within 72 hours after surgery to assess&#xD;
      pain status, ensure adequate pain management, and will be reminded to complete the pain&#xD;
      diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will fill out a pain diary during the first 2 weeks post-operatively that&#xD;
      will assess 5 measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication consumption (dose &amp; number of pills) - will be asked to record daily Pain score on&#xD;
      the NRS - will be asked to record daily Pain score on an institutional IBPS - will be asked&#xD;
      to record daily Patient satisfaction - will be asked to record daily Block duration - will be&#xD;
      reminded to record if their block has worn off, and if so, how many hours it was effective&#xD;
      (until they regained sensation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be called before their 2- and 6-week follow-up appointments and will be&#xD;
      asked to bring in their pain diaries as well as their opioid medication pill bottles to their&#xD;
      visit so that pill counts may be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All calls will be made by trained, authorized site delegates. There will be a locked drop-box&#xD;
      in the ION building where patients can drop off their pain diaries after their 2-week follow-&#xD;
      up appointment if they forget to bring it in to their appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will come into the office for a follow-up appointment at 2-weeks and all&#xD;
      particpants will have either a telehealth or in-person appointment at 6 weeks. 2-week&#xD;
      appointments will be in-person, as they will need to come in for suture removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first follow up appointment (week 2), all participants will be expected to bring in&#xD;
      their opioid medication pill bottles and their pain diaries per instructions given at study&#xD;
      enrollment and on the reminder phone call. All participants will be shown where the lock&#xD;
      boxes are to deposit their pain diaries. Pill counts will be conducted and recorded as well&#xD;
      as number of refills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the second follow up appointment (week 6), all participants will be expected to bring in&#xD;
      their opioid medication pill bottles (if in person) per instructions given at study&#xD;
      enrollment and on the reminder phone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pill counts will be conducted and recorded as well as number of refills. If 6-week visit is&#xD;
      done via telehealth, the same procedures will apply accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participant follow-up appointments will be conducted at Carilion's Institute for&#xD;
      Orthopaedics and Neurosciences (ION) or via telemedicine, and should not take significantly&#xD;
      longer than normal follow up appointments. Slightly increased visit duration related to&#xD;
      conducting pill counts should not exceed about 5 minutes. All participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      in the study for 6 weeks after their surgical date, at which point their involvement in the&#xD;
      study will conclude.&#xD;
