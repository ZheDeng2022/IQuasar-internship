  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects of acalabrutinib and rituximab and its effect in&#xD;
      treating patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma. Acalabrutinib may stop the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Rituximab is a&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody that binds to a protein called CD20, which is found on B-cells, and may&#xD;
      kill cancer cells. Giving acalabrutinib and rituximab may help to control mantle cell&#xD;
      lymphoma in elderly patients.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the efficacy measured by complete remission (CR) rate of the acalabrutinib in&#xD;
      combination with rituximab in newly diagnosed elderly mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the safety profile of acalabrutinib with rituximab combination in elderly&#xD;
      patients with MCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the overall response (OR) rate. II. To evaluate the progression-free survival&#xD;
      and overall survival. III. To assess serial minimal residual disease (MRD) using clonoseq,&#xD;
      circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ct-DNA) based serial clonal evolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Perform baseline genomic profiling for recognizing the predictive signature for response,&#xD;
      serial MCL specific analytes assessments while on therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Clonal evolution with targeted sequencing (seq) on ctDNA samples in sequential samples&#xD;
      using a MCL specific customized gene panel would be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. MRD assay using IgH clonoseq and ctDNA analysis, flow cytometry at various time points&#xD;
      from peripheral blood (PB)/bone marrow (BM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Sequential immunologic studies with cytokines/chemokines using a analyte panel, T cell&#xD;
      numbers, and immunoglobulins (Ig).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Tissue microenvironmental studies with simultaneous assessment of PB, BM and lymph nodes&#xD;
      for gene expression profiling (GEP), single cell seq, ribonucleic acid (RNA) seq and clonal&#xD;
      heterogeneity and the impact of acalabrutinib (A)-rituximab (R) treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Extensive bioinformatics studies. VI. Identification of signaling pathways or biomarkers&#xD;
      that predict sensitivity after therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive acalabrutinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also&#xD;
      receive rituximab intravenously (IV) over 3-4 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of cycle 1, and&#xD;
      day 1 of cycles 2-12, 14, 16, 18, 20, and 24. Cycles repeats every 28 days for up to 24&#xD;
      months or until complete remission is achieved in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 4 months&#xD;
      for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 3 years.&#xD;
