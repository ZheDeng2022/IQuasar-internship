  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)&#xD;
      therapy in patients with malignant refractory/relapsed gynecologic tumors. Autologous TILs&#xD;
      are expanded from tumor resections or biopsies and infused i.v. into the patient after NMA&#xD;
      lymphodepletion treatment with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
