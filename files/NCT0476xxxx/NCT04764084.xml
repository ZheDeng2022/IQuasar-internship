  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Homologous Recombination Repair (HRR) gene mutations can be detected in many solid tumors,&#xD;
      patients with HRR gene mutations may benefit from PARP inhibitor. Antiangiogenic drugs can&#xD;
      induce hypoxia and increase the sensitivity to PARP inhibitor. The combination of PARP&#xD;
      inhibitor and antiangiogenic drug can play a synergistic anti-tumor role and achieve good&#xD;
      efficacy in HRR gene-mutated tumors. The purpose of the study is to determine the dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of Niraparib plus Anlotinib in HRR&#xD;
      gene-mutated advanced solid tumors, and evaluate the safety and effectiveness of this&#xD;
      combination therapy preliminarily.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, single-center, phase I study to investigate the DLT and MDT, safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of Niraparib combined with Anlotinib in the treatment of advanced solid tumors with&#xD;
      HRR gene mutations. In this study, 52 histological or cytological diagnosis, previous&#xD;
      treatment failure patients of HER2 negative breast cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, gastric&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer are included and receive Niraparib combined with&#xD;
      Anlotinib. Patients are required to carry pathogenic or suspected pathogenic gBRCA or sBRCA&#xD;
      mutations, or HRR gene mutations defined by the inclusion criteria. The study will be divided&#xD;
      into two phase. The first phase will include 6-12 patients on a 21-day cycle to determine the&#xD;
      DLT and MTD. In the second phase, 40 patients will be included to treated with Niraparib plus&#xD;
      Anlotinib until disease progression or intolerable toxicity or withdrawal of the trial.&#xD;
