  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Artificial intelligence is deeply integrated with medical diagnosis, and intelligent&#xD;
      colonoscopy technology has broad room for development. At present, the assist device of&#xD;
      colonoscopy is insufficiently studied. It is the part that needs to be further explored in&#xD;
      the development of artificial intelligence colon diagnosis and treatment technology. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted at the Digestive Endoscopy Center and it is expected that 380&#xD;
      subjects will participate voluntarily. Subjects met: 1) routine colonoscopy; 2) willing to&#xD;
      provide relevant information required by the experiment; 3) signed informed consent for the&#xD;
      study. This topic focuses on the colonoscope assist device, through the combination of power&#xD;
      assisting device, dynamic analysis, and migration expert skills, to achieve a combination of&#xD;
      intelligent power and precise treatment, and establish a prototype of the&#xD;
      patient-colonoscopy-assisted assist system-doctor's four-in-one diagnosis and treatment&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
