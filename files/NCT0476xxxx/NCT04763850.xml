  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Control of the dynamic functional leg alignment (dFLA) and biomechanical load are important&#xD;
      joint related aspects regarding the development of osteoarthritis (OA). Research on level&#xD;
      walking with feedback on load related parameters provided innovative treatment possibilities.&#xD;
      Concerning walking on sloped surfaces, fundamental biomechanical knowledge exists. However,&#xD;
      deeper insights into the control of the dFLA during decline walking, and the usefulness of&#xD;
      real-time feedback are missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is set up as cross-sectional observation of gait under four conditions, which&#xD;
      follows a randomized sequence in order to avoid carry over effects. Thirty (30) participants&#xD;
      aged between 18 and 35 years will be included. They will complete a three-dimensional gait&#xD;
      analysis on a 5-m ramp with 10° inclination. Afterwards they will be observed under four&#xD;
      different conditions a) self-paced walking b) self-paced walking with internal focus of&#xD;
      attention, c) self-paced walking with real-time feedback, and d) condition c speed-matched&#xD;
      walking, on a 10° declined split belt treadmill. The primary outcome parameter will be the&#xD;
      frontal knee range of motion (fKROM). Secondary outcomes include the ground reaction force&#xD;
      loading rate, spatial-temporal parameters, sagittal frontal and transversal kinematics, and&#xD;
      kinetics for the lower extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings should improve the understanding of effects of real-time feedback on the control&#xD;
      of the dFLA and lower limb loading. Results will be published in a peer-review journal.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study is set up as cross-sectional observation of gait under four conditions, which follows a randomized sequence in order to avoid carry over effects. Chronologically, the assessments will start with the tertiary observation, investigating agreements between declined/inclined ramp and treadmill walking. Thereafter, three out of four conditions (self-paced walking, self-paced walking with internal focus of attention, and self-paced walking with real-time feedback) are tested under block randomization of their six possible permutations . With three conditions (n=3), this represents the smallest number of permutations, equaling a Williams design, where each condition precedes each other condition equally often and each treatment occurs equally frequently at each position. The fourth corresponding condition (speed-matched walking) is exempted from the sequence randomization and always follows after self-paced walking with real-time feedback.</intervention_model_description>
