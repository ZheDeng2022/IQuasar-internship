      This study will compare the impact of the Yeahhh Baby! Ointment, as compared to a placebo, on&#xD;
      measures of joint pain and discomfort in those who regularly experience joint pain. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that perceived pain will be reduced when subjects use the Yeahhh Baby! Ointment.&#xD;
      Previous studies exploring the efficacy of topicals on joint pain relief have used a similar&#xD;
      design and similar joint pain assessments as employed herein (The Western Ontario and&#xD;
      McMaster Universities Arthritis Index [WOMAC] and visual analog scale [VAS] for pain).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Joint pain is a common ailment among adults in the United States. In 2014, an estimated 14.6&#xD;
      million Americans with arthritis suffered from severe joint pain. It is therefore&#xD;
      unsurprising that many topical ointments are currently marketed for joint pain relief&#xD;
      including Bengay®, Icy Hot®, Jointflex®, and Aspercreme®. These ointments aim to reduce pain&#xD;
      often through a combination of analgesic ingredients include capsaicin, salicylates, menthol,&#xD;
      camphor, and lidocaine. Bengay® products, for instance, contain one or more of menthol,&#xD;
      camphor, salicylates, and lidocaine. Icy Hot® products contain menthol, while some also&#xD;
      include lidocaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yeahhh Baby! ointment is an herbal (botanical: plant-based) treatment for those impacted by&#xD;
      joint pain. The product contains a variety of herbal ingredients that have been touted by&#xD;
      some within the alternative medicine community as &quot;healing agents.&quot; The product started&#xD;
      selling in 2016 and is available commercially as an all-natural alternative to other&#xD;
      commercially available products. This ointment consists primarily of coconut oil (98%), with&#xD;
      magnesium and small amounts of herbal ingredients (tanner's bark, slippery root, sweet weed,&#xD;
      velvet plant, walnut hulls, kidney root, green ginger, Indian pink, mad dogweed, and nigella&#xD;
      seed) thought to reduce inflammation and to promote tissue healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will compare the impact of the Yeahhh Baby! Ointment, as compared to a&#xD;
      placebo, on measures of joint pain and discomfort in those who regularly experience joint&#xD;
      pain. We hypothesize that perceived pain will be reduced when subjects use the Yeahhh Baby!&#xD;
      Ointment. Previous studies exploring the efficacy of topicals on joint pain relief have used&#xD;
      a similar design and similar joint pain assessments as employed herein (The Western Ontario&#xD;
      and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index [WOMAC] and visual analog scale [VAS] for pain).&#xD;
