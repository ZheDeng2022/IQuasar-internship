  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transesophageal Lung ultrasound (TELUS) was described for the first time in 2016. The&#xD;
      clinical significance and benefits for the patient of the results of a TELUS examination has&#xD;
      not been investigated to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since all cardiac surgery with CPB cases in adult patients are performed using a TEE probe to&#xD;
      monitor cardiac function, a concomitant TELUS examination is possible in all cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study seeks to describe the incidence and severity of the modifications of the aeration&#xD;
      of both lungs assessed by TELUS in the perioperative period of adult cardiac surgery and to&#xD;
      establish the relation of the TELUS findings with the occurence of postoperative respiratory&#xD;
      events (PORE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eventually, the study will also provide results about the interobserver variation of the&#xD;
      TELUS examination for which there no reference to date.&#xD;

      Trans Esophageal Lung Ultrasound (TELUS) score in Cardiac surgery (CS) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect of CPB and relationship between changes on TELUS score and postoperative respiratory&#xD;
      events (PORE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      International recommendations for LUS assessment are available as well as the LUS methodology&#xD;
      and nomenclature are widely accepted (1). Additionally, transthoracic LUS demonstrated a&#xD;
      predictive value for postoperative pulmonary complication in non-cardiac surgery (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, the Trans Esophageal Lung Ultrasound (TELUS) has been described (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult cardiac surgery patients are at special risk of perioperative respiratory complications&#xD;
      including pulmonary edema, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), prolonged ventilation&#xD;
      and non-invasive ventilation (NIV), tracheotomy and pulmonary infection (4). These&#xD;
      complications are responsible for a substantial part of the perioperative case fatality rate.&#xD;
      Prevention of these complications by using low tidal volume and an open lung strategy has&#xD;
      failed to significantly reduce the incidence of postoperative respiratory events (PORE) (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A worsening of the TELUS imaging occurs after CPB when compared with pre CPB imaging has been&#xD;
      observed. These observations are consistent with the increase of extra vascular lung water&#xD;
      during CPB along with specific effects of CPB on lung vessels (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary hypothesis is that CPB induced changes in the TELUS imaging score. Our secondary&#xD;
      hypothesis is that magnitude of modifications are related to post-operative respiratory&#xD;
      events (PORE) and postoperative complications. The TELUS modifications could have a&#xD;
      predictive value for post-operative PORE and thus may help to discriminate patients at risk&#xD;
      for PORE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives 1 - Primary objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 - 1 Describing the incidence and severity of the changes in TELUS imaging between the pre&#xD;
      CPB and the post CPB assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - 2 Describing the relation of the post CPB TELUS findings and the occurrence of PORE&#xD;
           during hospital stay. The primary end-point will be a composite of prolonged NIV (&gt; 12&#xD;
           hours) and / or return to Mechanical Ventilation (MV) after a first successful&#xD;
           extubation and / or ICU readmission after a first successful ICU discharge. The&#xD;
           secondary endpoints will be : total MV duration, total ICU LOS, total hospital LOS, need&#xD;
           for tracheotomy, death from all cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 - 1 pre / post CPB TELUS imaging will be assessed by a second examiner allowing us to&#xD;
      calculate for the first time the pre / post CPB inter-observer variability of TELUS imaging&#xD;
      in adult cardiac surgery. Intra observer variability will be assessed as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 - 2 As a standard transthoracic LUS is performed in all CS patients at admission in the ICU&#xD;
      post-operatively, the respective relation of the admission LUS and post-CPB TELUS scores with&#xD;
      the first PaO2 / fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) (P/F) ratio obtained at admission in the&#xD;
      ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This is a single center, non-interventional, observational and prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be registered at Clinical trials.gov. The study will be conducted according to&#xD;
      the STROBE guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be informed orally during the mandatory pre-anesthesia interview usually&#xD;
      performed the day before surgery. A written information document will be given preoperatively&#xD;
      to each patient and filed. Patients will be included at the start of the pre-CPB TEE&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - Anesthesia Briefly, Two standard anesthesia protocols are in use in the institution.&#xD;
           Anesthesia will be maintained either with Total Intravenous Anesthesia (TIVA)&#xD;
           (continuous infusion of propofol and remifentanil with titration to keep the Bispectral&#xD;
           index (BIS) values between 50 and 60) or inhalation anesthesia (remifentanil infusion&#xD;
           and continuous sevoflurane inhalation including during CPB). Full muscle relaxation will&#xD;
           be obtained with standard doses of atracurium or cisatracurium. Lungs will be ventilated&#xD;
           with a low tidal volume of 6 ml.kg-1 (IBW). Standard arterial and central venous&#xD;
           catheterization will be inserted in all patients. Hemodynamic monitoring will be&#xD;
           performed with a Flotrac sensor and EV1000 monitor (EDWARDS Life Science - Irvine -&#xD;
           USA). A continuous airway pressure of 5 cmH2O will be maintained during CPB. After skin&#xD;
           closure, patients will be transferred to the ICU and anesthesia infusions will be&#xD;
           discontinued after 2 hours if extubation criteria are met : bleeding &lt; 200 ml, normal&#xD;
           ECG recording, normal gas exchange, hemodynamic stability with or without low dose&#xD;
           vasopressive support (norepinephrine &lt; 100 µg.kg-1.h-1 IV).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - CPB CPB will be performed according to institutional standard of care and&#xD;
           international guidelines (7) CPB flow will be performed using a centrifugal pump after&#xD;
           caval and aortic canulation. In some cases femoral or bicaval canulation will be used.&#xD;
           Full anticoagulation will be performed with unfractioned Heparin with POC monitoring&#xD;
           (target Activated clotting Time (ACT) : 480 sec) according to guidelines. A minimum of&#xD;
           2.5 l/min CPB flow will be maintained. Cardioplegia will be performed by antegrade&#xD;
           and/or retrograde normothermic cardioplegia according to the type of surgery.&#xD;
           Centrifugation of the residual volume of the CPB circuit at the end of the procedure&#xD;
           will be performed and re-transfused to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - TEE Comprehensive TEE will be performed in anesthetized patients before skin incision&#xD;
           (preCPB) and after chest closure (post CPB) using a GE Vivid S7 ultrasound system (GE&#xD;
           Healthcare, Chicago IL, USA). TEE examination will be performed according to our&#xD;
           standard procedure, reporting and archiving. Pre and post CPB LV function indices (LVEF,&#xD;
           E wave, A wave velocities, E' and S'Lat velocities, quantification of Mitral&#xD;
           Regurgitation (MR) if present).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. - TELUS Using the same imaging system, TELUS will be performed pre and post CPB&#xD;
           according to the method described by previous authors (3). Sagittal (90°) mid-esophageal&#xD;
           view and rotation of the probe will allow right lung interrogation of the anterior (60°&#xD;
           rotation), lateral (90° rotation) and posterior (120° rotation) zones and left lung&#xD;
           interrogation of the anterior (300° rotation), lateral (270° rotation) and posterior&#xD;
           (240° rotation) zones. For each zone a TELUS score will be defined according to standard&#xD;
           definitions : TELUS 0 : presence of A lines, TELUS 1 : less than 3 B lines , TELUS 2 :&#xD;
           more than 3 B lines or confluent B lines, TELUS 3 : sub pleural condensation.&#xD;
           Additionally, immediate findings (Pleural effusion, Alveolar consolidation,&#xD;
           Pneumothorax) will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Thus, the maximum LUS score per lung will be 9 and the maximum LUS score per patient&#xD;
           will be 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. - LUS A transthoracic LUS examination will be performed immediately after arrival in the&#xD;
           ICU (standard routine practice). For each lung the anterior, lateral and posterior zones&#xD;
           will be interrogated. For each zone a LUS score will be defined according to standard&#xD;
           definitions : LUS 0 : presence of A lines, LUS 1 : less than 3 B lines , LUS 2 : more&#xD;
           than 3 B lines or confluent B lines, LUS 3 : sub pleural condensation. Additionally,&#xD;
           immediate findings (Pleural effusion, Alveolar consolidation, Pneumothorax) will be&#xD;
           recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Thus the maximum LUS score per lung will be 9 and the maximum LUS score per patient will&#xD;
           be 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. - Biological data&#xD;
&#xD;
           Arterial blood gas are routinely drawn as a standard practice :&#xD;
&#xD;
           a - After anesthesia and before skin incision b -Immediately after obtaining the CPB&#xD;
           full flow c - Every 20 - 25 min during CPB d -5 - 10 min after protamine injection. e -&#xD;
           15 min after arrival in the ICU&#xD;
&#xD;
           a,d, and e blood gases results will be recorded and P/F ratio will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Troponin will be measured (ROCHE Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) in all patients at H24&#xD;
           as an institution standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. - Recorded data&#xD;
&#xD;
           All data will be recorded in an anonymous database (EXCEL worksheet). The recorded data&#xD;
           will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hospital file number, initials, Demographic and procedural data, comorbidities,&#xD;
                medications, baseline hematocrit and creatinine level&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pre CPB TELUS data and score, TEE data, P/F, MAP, SAP, DAP, Heart Rate, O2 arterial&#xD;
                saturation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  post CPB TELUS data and score, TEE data, P/F, MAP, SAP, DAP, Heart Rate, O2&#xD;
                arterial saturation, total IV fluid balance during CPB.&#xD;

             -  LUS data and score, P/F after arrival in the ICU&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Post-operative respiratory events (PORE) : time to extubation (hours), total time&#xD;

                ventilation (hours),Tracheotomy and duration (hours), length of stay (LOS) in ICU&#xD;
                (hours), pneumothorax after removal of chest tubes, pleural effusion, pneumonia (≥&#xD;
                2 criteria including fever&gt; 38.5 ° C or T &lt;36 ° C, leukocytosis&gt; 109/ L , purulent&#xD;
                tracheal secretions and the appearance or persistence of an infiltrate on the CXR),&#xD;
                atelectasis, pulmonary embolism, NO inhalation and total duration (hours), ARDS&#xD;
                (Berlin definition), sternal wound infection, in-hospital LOS (days)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Other in-hospital complications : cardiac ischemia, congestive heart failure,&#xD;
                ventricular dysrhythmia, new onset of atrial fibrillation (NOAF), Acute kidney&#xD;
                failure (AKI), Renal replacement therapy (RRT) and total duration (hours), cerebral&#xD;
                ischemia, sepsis from other origin than the lungs, blood transfusion (units count),&#xD;
                ICU Readmission, death from all cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. - Statistical analysis As there is no previous study that have observed TELUS during CPB&#xD;
           in CS, sample size calculation cannot be done because mean score and standard deviation&#xD;
           are not known. All patients with complete TELUS and LUS examinations during a four month&#xD;
           period will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inter-observer variability will be assessed using the Bland Altman method (8), Lin test (9),&#xD;
      and weighted kappa test (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative variables will be expressed as an absolute value and percentage. Quantitative&#xD;
      variables will be expressed as a mean and Standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile&#xD;
      range depending on the normality of the data distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comprehensive descriptive statistics. Comparisons will be made between the pre and post CPB&#xD;
      TELUS recordings for demographic, procedural and biological data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups will be defined according to the value of the PostCPB TELUS Score. Group HITELUS&#xD;
      with the patients with TELUS score of 12 or higher. Group LOTELUS with the patients with&#xD;
      TELUS score under 12. The two groups will be compared for the incidence of the primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes and for all comorbidities and procedural variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons will be made between the post CPB TELUS and ICU LUS recordings for demographic,&#xD;
      procedural and biological data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A composite score of PORE will be built. To determine TELUS / LUS variables associated with&#xD;
      PORE occurrence, multivariate logistic regression will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the predictive performance of TELUS / LUS scores for RE occurrence ROC curves&#xD;
      will be generated with calculation of Area Under the Curve (AUC) with confidence intervals,&#xD;
      Se, Sp, positive and Negative predictive values (PPV and NPV), Youden index values.&#xD;
