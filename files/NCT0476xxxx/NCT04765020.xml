      The POWER-study is a two-arm exercise intervention study for pediatric patients following&#xD;
      acute cancer treatment. This clinical trial will investigate the effects of a 12-week&#xD;
      moderate to high-intensity exercise program on cardiorespiratory fitness in children and&#xD;
      adolescents beginning 6 weeks after completion of acute cancer treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the POWER study is to investigate the effects of a 12-week moderate to&#xD;
      high-intensity, partially supervised exercise program on cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2peak)&#xD;
      in children and adolescents who have completed acute cancer treatment. This randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial will include n=56 patients. Patients will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      intervention or the control group. Patients in the intervention group will perform two&#xD;
      supervised exercise sessions per week, one personal training session and one group-based&#xD;
      training session. During an initial consultation, both groups receive recommendations for&#xD;
      individual physical activity goals and a brochure with exercise recommendations as well as a&#xD;
      fitness tracker to monitor their daily physical activity. Only the intervention group will&#xD;
      receive daily activity targets, which will be adjusted on a regular basis. The study starts 6&#xD;
      weeks after completion of the patient's acute cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims of this interventional study are to evaluate additional performance markers,&#xD;
      including muscle strength, functional mobility, balance, body composition and&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes including QoL, fatigue, and cognitive function as well as blood&#xD;
      markers to evaluate changes in metabolic, immune, and heart health.&#xD;

    <description>CPET is performed on an electronically braked cycle ergometer (Ergoline ergoselect 150 P) following the GDPK-Ergometry-Protocol). Ventilation and gas exchange data are determined breath-by-breath (Geratherm Respiratory Ergostik).
