      The aim of this study is to examine the effect of secondary prevention education given to&#xD;
      individuals after acute myocardial infarction on physiological parameters, anxiety and&#xD;
      quality of life.The population of the study will be the individuals hospitalized with the&#xD;
      diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in the Coronary Intensive Care Unit of Abant Izzet&#xD;
      Baysal University Izzet Baysal Training and Research Hospital. The study will be conducted in&#xD;
      a randomized controlled manner with two groups, 43 in the control group and 43 in the&#xD;
      secondary prevention education group. CAG (Coronary Angiography) Procedure Training Form,&#xD;
      Patient Identification Form, Physiological Parameters Form and Visual Analogue Scale,&#xD;
      Spielberg State and Trait Anxiety Scale and Myocardial Infarction Dimensional Assessment&#xD;
      Scale will be used to collect data. The data will be collected by face to face interview&#xD;
      technique. For descriptive statistics, mean and standard deviation or median and&#xD;
      minimum-maximum values for numerical variables, number and percentage values for categorical&#xD;
      variables will be given. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (p &lt;0.05), skewness and kurtosis&#xD;
      coefficients (should be ± 1) and X ̅ / SS &lt;4 inequalities will be examined at the same time,&#xD;
      and the weight in which group will be preferred.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>means of subjective anxiety scores</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 45 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Spielberg State- Trait Anxiety Scale. The total score between 0-19 obtained from the state anxiety scale shows that there is no anxiety, the total score between 20-39 indicates mild, the average score between 40-59 indicates moderate, and the total score between 60-79 indicates severe anxiety, and over 60 points are needed for professional help. The scores obtained from the trait anxiety scale vary between 20 and 80. A high score means a high and a low level means anxiety</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>means of subjective quality of life scores</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 45 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of 35 items and the quality of life is based on physical activity (12 items), insecurity (9 items), emotional response (4 items), addiction (3 items), diet (3 items), concerns about medication (2 items), Each sub-dimension of MIDAS, which measures seven domains as (2 items), is scored between 0-100. High scores indicate poor health.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>means of subjective pain score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 45 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>visual analog scale. It consists of a straight line with endpoints that define end limits such as &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;pain as bad as possible&quot;. The patient is asked to mark the level of pain on the line between the two endpoints.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>means of blood pressure (mmHg)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 45 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>In the study, a digital sphygmomanometer, which has been calibrated in comparison with the mercury sphygmomanometer, is used in order to prevent individual differences in the measurement of blood pressure. For accurate results, the sphygmomanometer sleeve is sized for adult individuals (width = about 20 cm, length = about 40 cm). In order for the blood pressure not to be affected by the conditions during the measurement, it is taken into account that the individual did not drink tea or coffee, take caffeine, and preferably did not eat during the 30 minutes prior to measurement.</description>

    <description>Secondary prevention training will be given to 43 randomly selected patients between the fourth and sixth hours after AMI (in accordance with the patient's request). Secondary protection training will be carried out in two parts. First of all, the anatomical structure and functions of the heart, the definition of AMI, its causes, symptoms and risk factors will be explained, and then the issues to be considered after AMI will be explained. The content of the training will also be given to the participants in a written booklet.</description>
