  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In today's context of bioethics laws revision concerning Medically Assisted Procreation, the&#xD;
      investigators focus on the opinion of couples resorting to In Vitro Fertilization on a&#xD;
      fundamental, much debated issue ; the choice of the embryo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      French lawmakers fear the investigators might be drifting towards embryo selection&#xD;
      procedures, but no study allows us to state this is what patients request. This study aims at&#xD;
      determining, among the population of patients who resort to Medically Assisted Procreation in&#xD;
      France, the ratio of patients who are willing to select the embryo due to its genetic&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;
