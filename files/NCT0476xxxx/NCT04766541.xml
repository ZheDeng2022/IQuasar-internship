      In this study, the correlation of cardiac marker values (Troponin I, CK, CK-MB) measured&#xD;
      before treatment with the long-term neurodevelopmental score of newborns diagnosed with&#xD;
      perinatal asphyxia and treated with therapeutic hypothermia with a diagnosis of hypoxic&#xD;
      ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination, laboratory (especially cardiac markers), aEEG findings and diffusion&#xD;
      MRI findings of babies who have been hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit between&#xD;
      2015-2020 due to respiratory distress and who have undergone perinatal asphyxia but have&#xD;
      undergone therapeutic hypothermia treatment will be recorded from their files in the hospital&#xD;
      system. The neurological evaluations and neurodevelopmental scores of the babies in the&#xD;
      follow-up in the neonatal high risk follow-up clinic after discharge will be recorded from&#xD;
      their files.&#xD;

      With therapeutic hypothermia, it is aimed to reduce the temperature of brain structures and&#xD;
      basal ganglia to 32- 34 degrees for 72 hours. The mechanism of action of hypothermia can be&#xD;
      listed as decrease in cerebral metabolism, inhibition of edema, decrease in energy&#xD;
      metabolism, decrease in cytotoxic amino acid and nitric oxide accumulation, inhibition of&#xD;
      platelet activating factor and inflammatory cascade, suppression of free radical activity and&#xD;
      prevention of cell death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perinatal hypoxia not only affects brain tissue, but also all organs. Therefore, the baby's&#xD;
      respiratory system, blood gases, cardiac functions and liver functions are evaluated.&#xD;
      Electrolyte, blood sugar and blood pressure are closely monitored due to the possibility of&#xD;
      adrenal glands being affected. Since gastrointestinal injury is possible, nutrition is done&#xD;
      extremely slowly and carefully. The useful markers in determining the neurological prognosis&#xD;
      are the neurological findings of the patient as well as the defect in the aEEG monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac markers (CK, CK-MB, Troponin-I) have been shown to be a sensitive marker for asphyxia&#xD;
      in term infants. Any interruption in the placental blood supply can cause the fetus to&#xD;
      undergo hypoxic ischemia with the activation of the 'diving reflex' to protect the most vital&#xD;
      organs. However, because myocardial tissue has insufficient reserves to tolerate hypoxia,&#xD;
      myocardial injury may occur and an increase in serum troponin I, CK, CK-MB may occur. High&#xD;
      levels of cardiac markers are an indicator of ongoing myocardial damage during HIE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diffusion MR imaging performed after hypothermia tries to see the damaged areas in the brain.&#xD;
      Diffusion MRI and aEEG follow-up have been shown to be prognostic in the literature. Patients&#xD;
      with hypothermia are followed up in our neonatal outpatient clinic and monitored in terms of&#xD;
      growth and neurodevelopmental aspects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the correlation of cardiac marker values (Troponin I, CK, CK-MB) measured&#xD;
      before treatment with the long-term neurodevelopmental score of newborns diagnosed with&#xD;
      perinatal asphyxia and treated with therapeutic hypothermia with a diagnosis of hypoxic&#xD;
      ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) will be evaluated.&#xD;
