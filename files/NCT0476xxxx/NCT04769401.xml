  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thanks to recent advances in clinical practice and laboratory, embryo cryopreservation has&#xD;
      become the first-line procedure in assisted reproductive technology. Embryo freezing process;&#xD;
      Prevention of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is becoming an accepted practice for a&#xD;
      growing number of indications, including preimplantation genetic testing (PGT), late&#xD;
      follicular phase progesterone elevation, and embryo-endometrial asynchrony. Progesterone;&#xD;
      plays a key role in the preparation of the endometrial cavity for embryo attachment.&#xD;
      Supplementary progesterone preparations can be used to prevent luteal phase defects and&#xD;
      provide progesterone support during cycle preparations for frozen-thawed embryo transfer. Our&#xD;
      aim in this study is to show the effect of serum progesterone level on pregnancy outcomes on&#xD;
      the day of embryo transfer.&#xD;

      This prospective cohort study was conducted at IVF center of Bezmialem University Hospital&#xD;
      and Acibadem Health Group between November 2020-November 2021. A total of 234 programmed&#xD;
      frozen ultrasound-guided ETs, performed by two physicians (P.O. and C.F.) were included. The&#xD;
      study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Medical Faculty of Bezmialem&#xD;
      University. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Inclusion criteria were&#xD;
      patients underwent IVF with body mass index (BMI) ≤25 kg/m2, between 18 and 41 years old and&#xD;
      with FSH levels on cycle day 3 of ≤12 mIU/mL. Exclusion criteria were patients with&#xD;
      uncorrected intracavitary structural uterine anomalies including unicornuate, bicornuate or&#xD;
      didelphic uterus, recurrent miscarriage, presence of hydrosalpinx, and cycle cancelation.&#xD;
      Those undergoing corrective uterine anomalies such as uterine septum, submucosal fibroids,&#xD;
      and endometrial polyps were not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected included age, duration of infertility, type of infertility, indication of IVF,&#xD;
      smokers (%),number of previous attempts, serum estradiol (pg/ml), LH (IU/l), progesterone&#xD;
      level (ng/ml) and endometrial thickness (mm) prior to progesterone introduction and on embryo&#xD;
      transfer day, number of embryos transferred, embryo stage at transfer (Day 3/blastocyst) (%),&#xD;
      control progesterone level on post-embryo transfer (ng/ml), length of the uterine cavity (A),&#xD;
      distance between the fundal endometrial surface and the tip of inner catheter (B), and&#xD;
      distance between the fundal endometrial surface and the air bubbles (C) at 1 and 60 minutes&#xD;
      after embryo transfer, biochemical pregnancy rate, miscarriage, clinical pregnancy rate (the&#xD;
      presence of fetal heartbeat visualized by transvaginal ultrasound examination) and ongoing&#xD;
      pregnancy rate at 12 weeks of amenorrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Embryo Selection and ET Vitrification on Day 3 or at the blastocyst stage and warming were&#xD;
      performed by using commercial vitrification kits according to the manufacturer's&#xD;
      instructions. All ETs were performed by two experienced operator (P.O. and C.F.) with Wallace&#xD;
      catheter (Smiths Medical International Ltd.) using after-load transfer technique under&#xD;
      transabdominal ultrasound guidance with moderately full bladder, without any anesthesia or&#xD;
      sedation. Embryos were graded according to standard morphologic criteria as described by&#xD;
      Gardner and Lane. The highest quality embryos according to morphology and cleavage criteria&#xD;
      were selected for transfer. After the procedure, the patient was kept supine for&#xD;
      approximately 60 minutes. Ultrasonography were carried out at 1 and 60 minutes after ET to&#xD;
      record the embryo flash position assessed by measuring the distance between the air bubble&#xD;
      and the uterine fundus in the coronal image. The embryo flash movement/migration was assessed&#xD;
      by measuring the change of the embryo flash position at 60 minutes after ET. If embryo had&#xD;
      migrated &gt;15 mm toward the fundus, it was classified as fundal, or &gt;15 mm toward the cervix,&#xD;
      it was classified as cervical, and if the embryo flash had remained within ±15 mm from its&#xD;
      original position, it was classified as static. When more than one air bubble was seen, the&#xD;
      closest one to uterine fundus was used for the measurements. Investigators measured the&#xD;
      distance from the lead portion of the air bubble to the uterine fundus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endometrial preparation and progesterone support Down-regulation with OCS and a GnRH agonist&#xD;
      (Lucrin® 3.75 mg IM, single dose, Ipsen Pharma, Barcelona, Spain) was first done for all&#xD;
      patients at the previous cycle and then HRT was used for endometrial preparation at next&#xD;
      cycle. Transvaginal ultrasound was performed and serum estradiol, LH and progesterone levels&#xD;
      were also measured on the second or third day of menstrual cycle. HRT was started with oral&#xD;
      estradiol valerate (Estrofem®, Bayer Hispania, Barcelona, Spain) in a stepwise manner up to 8&#xD;
      mg/day. After 14 days on estrogen supplementation, endometrial thickness was measured by a&#xD;
      vaginal 2D ultrasound and serum estradiol, LH and progesterone levels were also measured. If&#xD;
      endometrial thickness was &gt;7 mm with a triple layer pattern and quiescent ovaries, serum E2&#xD;
      was &gt;100 pg/ml and the serum P level was &lt;1.5 ng/ml, progesterone supplementation was&#xD;
      initiated by the use of 100 mg of a vaginal progesterone tablet two times daily (Lutinus,&#xD;
      Ferring Pharmaceuticals) plus 250 mg of intramuscular hydroxyprogesterone caproate in oil&#xD;
      twice a week (IMHPC) or 25 mg/d of SC progesterone daily (prolutex) as luteal phase support&#xD;
      (referred to as day 0 of progesterone administration). Embryo transfer was performed on the&#xD;
      day 3 for Day 3 embryos and on day 5 for blastocysts. The blood samples were taken for all&#xD;
      patients to measure serum progesterone, estradiol and LH levels at the day of ET. If serum&#xD;
      progesterone levels were &lt;10 ng/ml at the day of embryo transfer, 100 mg intramuscular&#xD;
      micronized progesterone administration per day were given to patients and a the blood sample&#xD;
      was taken 2 days later to check serum progesterone levels. Serum quantitative beta- hCG&#xD;
      levels were obtained at 12 days after ET. Progesterone supplementation as luteal phase&#xD;
      support was continued at the same dose until 10-12 gestational weeks of viable pregnancies&#xD;
      and discontinued if no pregnancy. Oral E2 was discontinued after the presence of fetal&#xD;
      heartbeat visualized by transvaginal ultrasound examination.&#xD;
