  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the safety of a daily high dose of a&#xD;
      probiotic supplement by comparing the growth (weight gain, g/day) of formula-fed and/or&#xD;
      breastfed infants in high dose group versus placebo group from enrolment to 8 weeks of&#xD;
      intervention&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of healthy term infants,&#xD;
      consisting of three randomized arms: placebo control group, high dose experimental group, and&#xD;
      low dose experimental group. The study population, approximately 228, are infants 14 - 21&#xD;
      days of age who are formula-fed and/or breastfed who is aligned with the intended target&#xD;
      population for a probiotic supplement. Placebo and probiotic supplements will be mixed with&#xD;
      formula or breastmilk and fed orally using a feeding cup or syringe. All enrolled infants&#xD;
      will participate in the trial for approximately 8 weeks.&#xD;
