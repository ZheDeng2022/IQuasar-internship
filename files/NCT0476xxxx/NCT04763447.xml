  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The optimal duration of the treatment by OMA remains unclear when asthma is well controlled.&#xD;
      Data suggest that a large part of patients with well controlled asthma can discontinue OMA&#xD;
      therapy without any asthma control deterioration or with an acceptable decrease in asthma&#xD;
      control, therefore French experts propose that omalizumab can be given for &quot;3 to 5 yrs if&#xD;
      asthma remains well controlled&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The costs related to OMA are high and frequent injections represent severe constraints for&#xD;
      patients. For all these reasons, evaluating whether shortening duration of OMA therapy is&#xD;
      feasible while maintaining acceptable asthma control is a critical point. Therefore, the aim&#xD;
      of this study is to evaluate asthma control after OMA discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of&#xD;
      treatment when asthma is well controlled.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Omalizumab (OMA) is a monoclonal anti IgE antibody, developed for severe uncontrolled&#xD;
      allergic asthma. Efficacy of OMA in this indication is well documented in randomized trials&#xD;
      as well as in real life studies, reducing the number of severe exacerbations by about 50% and&#xD;
      improving asthma control score .&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, despite commercialized since 2006 in France, the optimal duration of the treatment&#xD;
      remains unclear when asthma is well controlled. In particular, there is no guideline to apply&#xD;
      the &quot;step down theory&quot; to biologics in well controlled patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It seems clear that a treatment given for less than one year is associated with an early&#xD;
      relapse of the disease. However, in a randomized controlled study including 176 patients,&#xD;
      stopping the treatment after 5 years induced a small, but acceptable loss of control (average&#xD;
      decrease of asthma control test (ACT) by 2.88 and 1.16 point, p= 0.18), but some patients had&#xD;
      uncontrolled asthma when the treatment was stopped. In a smaller cohort of 49 patients in&#xD;
      Spain who voluntarily accepted to discontinue OMA treatment after 6 years of therapy, asthma&#xD;
      deterioration (defined by one or more exacerbation and any Asthma Control Test change during&#xD;
      the 1st year) was observed in 24% of patients during the first year following discontinuation&#xD;
      , with a maximal rate of 2 exacerbations/yr. After 4 years of discontinuation, 60% of&#xD;
      patients still take advantage of the 6 yrs of treatment with OMA. A retrospective study in&#xD;
      France found that 14/26 patients treated for at least 3 years kept the same level of control&#xD;
      after discontinuation. All these data suggest that a large part of patients with well&#xD;
      controlled asthma can discontinue OMA therapy without any asthma control deterioration or&#xD;
      with an acceptable decrease in asthma control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inducing long term asthma remissions, rather than complete cure, is one potential goal of&#xD;
      biologics. OMA is supposed to have disease modifying effects , explaining why there is a hope&#xD;
      for a good asthma control being maintained after discontinuation. For this reason, French&#xD;
      experts propose that omalizumab can be given for &quot;3 to 5 yrs if asthma remains well&#xD;
      controlled&quot; . After an asthma relapse, OMA can be prescribed again theoretically, but no data&#xD;
      regarding clinical response after a &quot;second line&quot; of treatment with the same biologic are&#xD;
      available. The question of optimal treatment duration is also questioned with other&#xD;
      biologics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The costs related to OMA are high (estimated to 12 k€/year/patient). Frequent injections (1&#xD;
      subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks for the lowest dose to 4 injections every 2 weeks for&#xD;
      the highest dose) represent severe constraints for patients, especially for the youngest&#xD;
      ones. For all these reasons, evaluating whether shortening duration of OMA therapy is&#xD;
      feasible while maintaining acceptable asthma control is a critical point. The main objective&#xD;
      is to demonstrate the non-inferiority (i.e. no more exacerbations at 12 months) of OMA&#xD;
      withdrawal attempt compared to OMA continuation in asthma-controlled patients treated for 3&#xD;
      to 5 years with OMA. Secondary objectives are to compare OMA withdrawal attempt versus OMA&#xD;
      continuation in asthma-controlled patients treated for 3 to 5 years with OMA on other asthma&#xD;
      control features at 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
