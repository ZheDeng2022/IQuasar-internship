  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current treatments for relapsed/refractory hematopoietic malignancies such as B-cell&#xD;
      lymphomas (BCLs) and peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are far from satisfactory. CD5 is&#xD;
      widely expressed in multiple subtypes of BCLs and PTCLs but rarely found in normal tissues&#xD;
      except certain types of lymphocytes. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells against CD5&#xD;
      offer another potential therapeutic option for patients with relapsed/refractory CD5 positive&#xD;
      hematopoietic malignancies. In the current study, the safety and efficacy of a novel CAR T&#xD;
      cell therapy, termed CT125A cells, are evaluated in patients with relapsed/refractory CD5+&#xD;
      hematopoietic malignancies. The endogenous CD5 in CT125A cells is knocked out via CRISPR/Cas9&#xD;
      genome editing technology to prevent fratricide during CAR T cells manufacturing.&#xD;

    <description>Incidence and types of dose limited toxicities (DLTs) after administration of CT125A cells in patients with relapsed/refractory CD5+ hematopoietic malignancies will be recorded at 3 dose levels to investigate the maximum tolerated dose of CT125A. DLT is defined as the following adverse events that occur during the first 28 days after CT125A infusion and are definitely or probably related to CT125A cells: 1) Cytokine release syndrome equal or greater than grade 4 lasting longer than 3 days graded by ASTCT 2019 consensus; 2) Grade 4 immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome graded by ASTCT 2019 consensus; 3) Grade 4 hematological toxicity lasting longer than 28 days except for T cell aplasia; 4) Non-hematological toxicity equal or greater than grade 3 lasting longer than 7 days or Grade 4 non-hematological toxicity lasting longer than 3 days.</description>

    <description>The tolerability and safety of CT125A cells will be assessed according to the &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation design. There will be three dose levels, 1×10^6, 2×10^6, and 3×10^6, CAR+T cells/kg. For each level, 1-3 subjects will be enrolled. If no dose limited toxicity (DLT) occurs, next level will be assessed for DLT. If DLT occurs in one subject, 3 more subjects will be enrolled in this cohort for the evaluation of DLT. If DLT occurs in ≤ 1/6 subjects, next level will be assessed for DLT. If DLT occurs in ≥ 2 subjects, no more subjects will be enrolled in this cohort and dose escalation will be canceled. For each cohort, following subjects can only receive CT125A infusion at least 14 days after the first subject received CT125A infusion. If DLT occurs in 2 subjects at Dose Level 1, whether to explore a lower dose will be determined by the investigator. After dose escalation phase is completed, the dose for extension phase will be determined based on safety and PK data.</description>
