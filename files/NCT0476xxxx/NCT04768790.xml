  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The etiology of cervical pain is multifactorial and studies based on the bio-psychosocial&#xD;
      model also link chronic neck pain to psychological factors. Among them, kinesiophobia has&#xD;
      been reported as an important determinant. Over time, the use of multidisciplinary&#xD;
      interventions for chronic vertebral pain (instead of segmental treatments) has grown in order&#xD;
      to improve disability, pain and proactive behaviors towards the problem manifested. To date,&#xD;
      the evidence relating to the effects of multidisciplinary approaches is inconclusive and&#xD;
      lacking. In light of these premises, it appears necessary to deepen the conduct of studies&#xD;
      aimed at evaluating the efficacy of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program that&#xD;
      integrates cognitive-behavioral therapy based on kinesiophobia with specific exercises, in&#xD;
      the treatment of chronic neck pain of working subjects.&#xD;

      Background The etiology of cervical pain is multifactorial and includes age, gender,&#xD;
      incongruous postures, repeated efforts. Studies based on the bio-psychosocial model also link&#xD;
      chronic neck pain to psychological factors. Among them, kinesiophobia has been reported as an&#xD;
      important determinant. It is debatable whether interventions targeting cognitive processes&#xD;
      and pain-associated behaviors can lead to clinically significant changes in terms of&#xD;
      disability, pain and quality of life of these individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of the types of exercises to be&#xD;
      proposed. This makes it difficult to choose between general exercises (aimed at improving&#xD;
      cervical muscle and joint skills) and motor-oriented (or task-oriented) exercises (aimed at&#xD;
      cervical functional recovery in an ecological context). Over time, the use of&#xD;
      multidisciplinary interventions for chronic vertebral pain (instead of segmental treatments)&#xD;
      has grown in order to improve disability, pain and proactive behaviors towards the problem&#xD;
      manifested. To date, the evidence relating to the effects of multidisciplinary approaches is&#xD;
      inconclusive and lacking. In light of these premises, it appears necessary to deepen the&#xD;
      conduct of studies aimed at evaluating the efficacy of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation&#xD;
      program that integrates cognitive-behavioral therapy based on kinesiophobia with specific&#xD;
      exercises, in the treatment of chronic neck pain of working subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The hypothesis is that a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program induces&#xD;
      clinically significant and long-term improvements in the disability, pain and quality of life&#xD;
      of working subjects with chronic neck pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the study Verify the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary program in inducing&#xD;
      clinically significant and long-term improvements in the disability, pain and quality of life&#xD;
      of working subjects suffering from chronic neck pain. Evaluate the work discomfort linked to&#xD;
      the condition of chronic neck pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure The subjects eligible for the study will be assigned to one of two treatment&#xD;
      programs (multidisciplinary or general) using a permuted block randomization procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventions will be offered by a psychologist and two physiotherapists of equal&#xD;
      experience, responsible separately for the multidisciplinary and general groups. Each&#xD;
      participant will be assessed individually by postural observation, cervical and muscle&#xD;
      mobility examination. Based on this evaluation, the exercises will be planned and performed&#xD;
      on a single patient. Patients assigned to the multidisciplinary team will meet with a&#xD;
      psychologist once a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the interventions of the multidisciplinary program: multimodal exercises to&#xD;
      improve, through gradual exposure, cervical mobility, postural control and strengthening of&#xD;
      the cervical muscles; stabilization techniques for the deep neck muscles; task-oriented&#xD;
      exercises maintaining the activation of the deep spinal muscle. Under the supervision of a&#xD;
      psychologist, the subjects will also be involved in cognitive-behavioral therapy aimed at&#xD;
      modifying the fear of movement (kinesiophobia) and the maladaptive behavior of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the interventions of the general program: exercises for muscle strengthening,&#xD;
      regional stretching and spinal mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the interventions that will be carried out on both groups: ergonomic&#xD;
      consultancy. At the end of the treatment, patients will be asked to continue with the&#xD;
      exercises at home. At the end of each session a control of the program performed will be&#xD;
      conducted based on a manual that includes the complete list of exercises to be performed.&#xD;
      Patients' GPs will be asked to avoid referrals for other visits / other treatments while the&#xD;
      programs are running.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of data collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Personal and anthropometric data; lifestyle habits; work, pharmacological and pathological&#xD;
      history; levels of neck disability, kinesiophobia, catastrophism, intensity of pain, quality&#xD;
      of life, work discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires will be administered before treatment, ten weeks after (post-treatment) and 12&#xD;
      months after the end of treatment (follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the treatment, subjects will be asked to rate the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      treatment using a Likert Global Perceived Effect scale. Using a specific form, patients will&#xD;
      be asked to report any symptoms they experience during the study that may require further&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end date of the follow up will be considered that of December 31, 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of the treatment between the two groups over time will be analyzed through the&#xD;
      use of linear models with mixed effects for repeated measurements. The differences between&#xD;
      the two groups relating to measures with non-normal distribution will be analyzed by&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test. The null hypothesis will be rejected for p values&gt; 0.05 (two-tailed&#xD;
      test).&#xD;
