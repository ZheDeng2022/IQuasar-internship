  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a pragmatic pilot test of a remote patient monitoring system&#xD;
      (RPM) for blood pressure measurement for Medicare patients with hypertension with and without&#xD;
      the support of a care management program. The primary objective is to better understand how&#xD;
      patients' remote monitoring of blood pressure and the direct transmission of this data to a&#xD;
      healthcare system's EHR can be used by the patient and the care team to support optimal&#xD;
      hypertension care and whether the addition of active care management increases the use of RPM&#xD;
      and improvements in blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will be conducted in four Northwestern Medical Group (NMG) primary care&#xD;
      practices. Two practices will have RPM available for primary care physicians to order for&#xD;
      their eligible Medicare patients and two practices will also receive the support of a care&#xD;
      management program to assist with patient enrollment, blood pressure monitoring and taking&#xD;
      action in the setting of uncontrolled blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a pragmatic non-blinded, non-randomized pilot study with&#xD;
      contemporaneous controls among NMG outpatient clinics that provide adult primary care. They&#xD;
      will make comparisons of data obtained through the course of routine care delivery from pilot&#xD;
      and non-pilot practices.&#xD;

Primary care clinicians at these sites will receive clinical decision support (Epic Best Practice Alert) for patients meeting primary or secondary eligibility criteria. It will be at the discretion of the primary care clinicians when to offer or refer patients to RPM. In addition, PCPs will receive lists of candidate patients. Care managers will assist with the outreach to patients to offer RPM when recommended by the PCP, will monitor and support patient use of the remote monitor, and will promote action on the part of the patient or PCP when uncontrolled hypertension is present.</description>

        This study will take place in several Northwestern Medicine Group outpatient primary care&#xD;
        clinic settings. Patients at these practices will be eligible for inclusion in the primary&#xD;
        study population if they have diagnosed hypertension, are 65 to 85 years old, have Medicare&#xD;
        insurance, and have their last two prior office blood pressures ≥140 mm Hg systolic or ≥90&#xD;
        mm Hg diastolic. Patients at these practices will be eligible for inclusion in the&#xD;
        secondary study population if either they meet the inclusion criteria for the primary&#xD;
        population or they are 65 to 85 years old, have Medicare insurance and either have&#xD;
        diagnosed hypertension but do not have their last two office blood pressures prior ≥140 mm&#xD;
        Hg systolic or ≥90 mm Hg diastolic, or they do not have hypertension diagnosed and have&#xD;
        their most recent prior office blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg systolic or ≥90 mm Hg diastolic.&#xD;
