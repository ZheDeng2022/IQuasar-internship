    <textblock>
      This study aims to study SGLT2 inhibitors in patients who are undergoing haemodialysis for&#xD;
      end stage renal disease and established ASCVD, to examine the safety and clinical outcomes,&#xD;
      consisting of a composite of non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or&#xD;
      cardiovascular death as the primary outcome. The key secondary composite outcome was all&#xD;
      cause death or hospitalization for unstable angina.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease accounts for more than 50% of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) deaths.&#xD;
      The reported cardiovascular death rates in patients receiving dialysis are substantially&#xD;
      higher than in the general population. Cardiovascular mortality in ESRD is particularly high&#xD;
      after acute myocardial infarction, but it is also elevated in ESRD patients with other forms&#xD;
      of atherosclerotic vascular disease (eg, chronic coronary artery disease, strokes, transient&#xD;
      ischemic attacks, and peripheral arterial disease). Left ventricular hypertrophy and dilation&#xD;
      are associated with increased cardiovascular mortality, as is congestive heart failure. One&#xD;
      of the major reasons for such high cardiovascular mortality in ESRD is the large burden of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease present in patients with chronic artery disease before renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated benefits in reduction of major adverse cardiac events and&#xD;
      heart failure hospitalisation in phase 3 randomised controlled trials. In addition, several&#xD;
      recent clinical publications have also indicated renal benefits in patients with chronic&#xD;
      renal impairment (eGFR &gt;30ml/min).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary SGLT2 inhibition predominantly occurs at the proximal tubules of kidneys. The&#xD;
      mechanistic benefits postulated (other than serum glucose lowering) included SGL2i mediated&#xD;
      naturesis and glucosuria. Independent of this class's effects at the renal level, SGL2i&#xD;
      possibly affect cardiac metabolism (in animal studies), with reverse adverse cardiac&#xD;
      remodelling by switching myocardial substrate utilization from glucose toward oxidation of&#xD;
      fatty acids, ketone bodies and branch-chained amino acids. Such improvement in cardiac&#xD;
      metabolism may attenuate myocardial ischemia, improve cardiac haemodynamics and reduce&#xD;
      overall cardiac mortality, either independent of or synergistic with SGLT2 inhibition at the&#xD;
      kidney level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is a gap in knowledge and paucity of safety, efficacy and clinical outcomes&#xD;
      data for the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients who are undergoing haemodialysis for end&#xD;
      stage renal disease and established ASCVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to study SGLT2 inhibitors in this population and examine the safety and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes, consisting of a composite of non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, or cardiovascular death as the primary outcome. The key secondary composite&#xD;
      outcome was all cause death or hospitalization for unstable angina.&#xD;
