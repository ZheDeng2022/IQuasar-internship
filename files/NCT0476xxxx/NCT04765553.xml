&#xD;
               -  Axillary body temperature: 35.2 - 37.5℃&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Heart rate (after at least 3 minutes of rest, measured in the supine position):&#xD;
                  40-100 bpm&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Subject having C-reactive protein (CRP) levels within the normal range (local&#xD;
             laboratory range).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of&#xD;
             becoming pregnant having agreed to use highly effective methods of contraception&#xD;
             during dosing and for 6 months after receiving IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Highly effective contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before&#xD;
                  taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive&#xD;
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on&#xD;
                  the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that&#xD;
                  patient, otherwise highly effective methods to be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of oral (estrogen and progesterone) hormonal method of contraception, or&#xD;
                  placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same&#xD;
                  brand (or generic equivalent) for a minimum of 3 months before taking study&#xD;
                  treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have&#xD;
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile&#xD;
             (e.g., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any clinically significant abnormality in the results of the safety laboratory tests.&#xD;
             Subjects presenting a minor deviation from laboratory ranges could be enrolled if the&#xD;
             investigator judge it to be non-clinically significant&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any clinically significant abnormality on the screening electrocardiogram (ECG), as&#xD;
             judged by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History or clinical evidence of any disease and/or existence of any surgical or&#xD;
             medical condition that might interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism&#xD;
             or excretion of the study drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Actual presence or occurrence of any bacterial, viral, parasitic or fungal infection&#xD;
             within the 4 weeks preceding IMP infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Positive results from serology examination for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg),&#xD;
             Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), syphilis (TP-antigen and&#xD;
             RPR) or pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Positive stool test for Shigella or salmonella infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Positive results from Sars-CoV-2 screening within 96 hours prior to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History or clinical evidence suggestive of active or latent tuberculosis at screening.&#xD;
             (i.e. test positive to the interferon gamma (IFNγ)-release assay)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History or presence of any severe allergic reactions&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of hypersensitivity or allergy to any component of emapalumab and/or&#xD;
             valaciclovir hydrochloride&#xD;

         16. Usage of any prescription drugs within 2 weeks or over-the-counter medication&#xD;
             including herbal supplements (with the exception of multi-vitamins) within 1 week&#xD;

         17. Positive pregnancy test at screening or Day -1&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Any circumstances or conditions, which, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect&#xD;

&#xD;
         19. Enrollment in another concurrent clinical interventional study, or intake of another&#xD;
