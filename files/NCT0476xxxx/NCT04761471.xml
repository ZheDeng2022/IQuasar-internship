  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While people are reading, talking or playing computer games, their brain cells elicit&#xD;
      electrical signals so they could perform these actions. The firing of these cells is not&#xD;
      random but is organized in a temporal pattern, such that a group of cells are simultaneously&#xD;
      active at a particular frequency. The researchers can read the frequency of brain signals and&#xD;
      identify their location using different brain-imaging tools like EEG and fMRI. These methods&#xD;
      are applied to healthy individuals and do not pose any danger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators of this project would like to use these techniques to study the brain&#xD;
      signals, while healthy participants are making the decisions choosing between 2 rewards,&#xD;
      e.g., 2 food items. Participants who have depression show different behavior while performing&#xD;
      decision-making tasks and the investigation of processes that underlie them will lead to a&#xD;
      better understanding of this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, there is another category of tools, which help to study the brain. This category&#xD;
      includes electrical stimulation, which mimics the electrical pattern that brain cells elicit.&#xD;
      Application of external electrical stimulation can enhance this pattern or disrupt it and&#xD;
      this process will affect the behavior of a person. Recent investigations have led to the&#xD;
      development of a new stimulation technique that allows targeting deep brain regions. The&#xD;
      investigators of this project want to apply this method to change the performance of healthy&#xD;
      participants in the tasks on decision-making. If this experiment is successful, then&#xD;
      stimulation can be used as a therapy for participants with depression.&#xD;

    <description>Temporal interference (TI) stimulation is a type of low-intensity transcranial electrical stimulation with alternating current (tACS). In case of TI stimulation, 2 electric fields in kHz range are delivered to 4 electrodes, which are placed on the surface of the skull, to modulate neural oscillations.</description>

    <description>Participants will undergo transcranial electrical stimulation, which will be delivered with low current amplitudes (&lt;= 2 mA) established with international safety guidelines for electrical stimulation. Threshold for the current amplitude will be established by participants themselves, such that they cannot distinguish when stimulation is applied and not applied.&#xD;
Duration of stimulation will not last longer than 30 minutes.</description>
