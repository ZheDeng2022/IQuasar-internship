  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open label single-arm clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of HMPL-306 in advanced or metastatic solid tumors with IDH mutation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HMPL-306 is a dual IDH1/2 inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase 1, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      HMPL-306 administered orally in the treatment of subjects with advanced or metastatic solid&#xD;
      tumors with IDH mutation. The study consists of 2 parts: Part 1 (dose escalation) and Part 2&#xD;
      (dose expansion). The dose escalation part will determine the MTD/RP2D. The dose expansion&#xD;
      part will administer the MTD/RP2D to mIDH-positive solid tumor malignancies including, but&#xD;
      not limited to, cholangiocarcinoma, skeletal chondrosarcoma, low-grade glioma, perioperative&#xD;
      low-grade glioma&#xD;
