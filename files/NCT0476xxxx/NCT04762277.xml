  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is open to adults with a chronic inflammatory skin disease called hidradenitis&#xD;
      suppurativa. The purpose of this study is to find out whether a medicine called spesolimab&#xD;
      helps people with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are put into 2 groups by chance. One group takes spesolimab. The other group&#xD;
      takes placebo. Every participant has twice the chance of being in the spesolimab group than&#xD;
      in the placebo group. Participants get spesolimab or placebo as an infusion into a vein every&#xD;
      week for the first 3 weeks. Afterwards, they get spesolimab or placebo as injections under&#xD;
      the skin every 2 weeks. Placebo infusions and injections look like spesolimab infusions and&#xD;
      injections but do not contain any medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are treated in the study for about 3 months. During this time, they visit the&#xD;
      study site about 9 times. After completing this part of the study, participants are offered&#xD;
      to join another clinical study in which all participants get spesolimab. Participants who&#xD;
      cannot join the other study, stay in this study for about 4 more months. During this time,&#xD;
      participants do not take spesolimab nor placebo but they visit the study site 2 times to have&#xD;
      their health checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study visits, doctors thoroughly check the skin of participants to count lumps (nodules)&#xD;
      and boils (abscesses). The results between the spesolimab group and the placebo group are&#xD;
      compared after 3 months of treatment. The doctors also regularly check the general health of&#xD;
      the participants.&#xD;

    <measure>Absolute change from baseline in International Hidradenitis Suppurativa Severity Score System (IHS4) value at week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The IHS4 assesses the HS severity and the resulting IHS4 score is arrived at by the number of nodules (multiplied by 1) plus the number of abscesses (multiplied by 2) plus the number of draining tunnels (multiplied by 4). A total score of 3 or less signifies mild, 4-10 signifies moderate and 11 or higher signifies severe disease.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain NRS assesses the HS-related pain severity. The Pain NRS will be completed on a daily diary by subjects from Screening through Week 12. Response is given by an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no HS pain) to 10 (HS pain as bad as one can imagine).</description>

    <measure>Absolute change from baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score at week 12</measure>

    <description>DLQI is a patient-administered, ten-question, quality of life questionnaire that covers six domains including symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships and treatment. It's total score is calculated by summing the scores of each question resulting in a range of 0 to 30. The higher the score, the more the quality of life is impaired.</description>

    <measure>Absolute change from baseline in Hidradenitis Suppurativa Quality of Life (HiS-QoL) Total score at week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>HiS-QoL is a patient-administered, 17-item instrument to measure HS-specific quality of life in clinical trials. The 17-item HiS-QoL included four symptom items, eight activity-adaptation items and five psychosocial items. The item scores are summed to create a total ranging from 0 to 68, with higher scores indicating more severe impact on quality of life.</description>
