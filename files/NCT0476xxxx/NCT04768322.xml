  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a severe disease affecting approximately 1-2% of the adult population in&#xD;
      developed countries and around 26 million people worldwide. Up to 10% of these patients are&#xD;
      in advanced stage heart failure, which is defined by a significant morbimortality and&#xD;
      considerable medical expenses. Despite advances in its medical management, advanced (or end&#xD;
      stage) heart failure is characterized by refractoriness to conventional therapies including&#xD;
      guideline-directed pharmacological and non-surgical device treatments. These patients remain&#xD;
      severely symptomatic (NYHA IV) and have objective signs of congestion or low cardiac output.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have been used in patients with heart failure with&#xD;
      reduced ejection fraction for almost 20 years either as an alternative or a bridge to heart&#xD;
      transplantation. LVADs improve heart failure symptoms and survival at the cost of increased&#xD;
      rates of infection, stroke and bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the lack of evidence, LVAD implantation in ambulatory patients is not rare, with&#xD;
      INTERMACS profiles ≥4 patients representing 15.7% of the overall population implanted between&#xD;
      2012 and 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of left ventricular assist&#xD;
      devices compared to traditional HF medical treatment alone in a population of ambulatory&#xD;
      advanced heart failure patients. Secondary objectives are to better identify subgroups of&#xD;
      patients that would benefit the most from the implantation of an LVAD as well as to assess&#xD;
      the optimal timing of intervention.&#xD;

    <measure>All-cause mortality rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Through 24 months when the last subject completes 12 months of follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The composite of 5 clinical endpoints is using a win ratio concept. Mortality has higher priority than Urgent ECMO implantation, urgent heart transplantation or LVAD implantation, unplanned hospitalization for heart failure, improvement of KCCQ by at least 5points, improvement of 6-minute walk test distance by at least 75 meters. Our main approach uses matched pairs of patients. Each pair is 'untied' first on the basis of the most important event (death) and secondly (if necessary) on the lesser event. The numbers of pairs in which the patient on new treatment 'won' and 'lost' are compared to produce the 'win ratio'. The 95% CI and P-value for the win ratio are readily obtained.</description>
