  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Needle phobia occurs in more than half of diabetic patients due to the pain caused by&#xD;
      frequent insulin injection. Therefore, this study evaluated the effect of topically&#xD;
      administered lavender aromatherapy on the pain of insulin injection in diabetic patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a serious chronic disease that negatively affects the quality of&#xD;
      life. To control the course of the disease and to reduce its complications, insulin treatment&#xD;
      is planned for the whole life of Type 1 diabetic patients, and frequently for approximately&#xD;
      40% of Type 2 diabetic patients. Frequent or incorrect administration of insulin injections&#xD;
      may lead to the development of complications such as regional pain, ecchymosis, or hematoma&#xD;
      on the injection site. It is emphasized that the pain caused by repeated insulin injections&#xD;
      negatively affects the psychological well-being of the individuals as well as their physical&#xD;
      comfort. Pain control is one of the main tasks of nurses. By alleviating pain, the patient's&#xD;
      acceptance of treatment increases, and thus the quality of life improves. In the literature,&#xD;
      lavender is reported to have the ability to heal burns and insect bites as well as analgesic,&#xD;
      wound healing, antibacterial, antifungal, sedative, and antidepressant effects. The main&#xD;
      components of lavender, such as lavender and linalyl acetate and linalool, are also&#xD;
      recommended as topical analgesics in animal models. Whatever the cause, acute pain is a&#xD;
      serious problem for individuals with chronic illnesses. Therefore, this study evaluated the&#xD;
      effect of topically administered lavender aromatherapy on the pain of insulin injection in&#xD;
      diabetic patients.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The sample was determined as 159 (53 for each group) patients for three groups (lavender oil group, placebo group, control group) by using the power analysis method (G*Power 3.1.9.6 program), with the margin of error Î±=0.05, 0.25 medium effect size, and 0.80 (80%) target strength of the test. However, 7 patients who met the study inclusion criteria were added to each group (60 in the lavender oil group, 60 in the placebo group, 60 in the control group) in case some of the participants quit the study for any reason (Figure 1). While the patients were randomized, different application groups (topical lavender oil, placebo, control group) were determined by lot in different months (May, June, and July) to minimize the possibility of being affected by each other.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Participant, Care Provider)</masking>
    <masking_description>Since this study was a double-blind randomized controlled study, no information about the drug (topical lavender oil, topical water) was given to the nurse (researcher) who gave insulin injection, and the patient to reduce bias. The drug to be used was applied in spray bottles without any labels.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Level before insulin injection</measure>
    <time_frame>day 1</time_frame>
    <description>It was evaluated between the Verbal Category Scale (VCS) pain scores of the patients in the topical lavender oil group before insulin injection. Verbal Category Scale is based on the patient's choice of the most appropriate word to identify his/her pain. Accordingly, the patient was asked to rate his/her pain between 0-4 as 0; no pain, 1: mild pain, 2: severe pain, 3: very severe pain, 4: unbearable pain.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Level before insulin injection</measure>
    <time_frame>day 1</time_frame>
    <description>It was evaluated between the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain scores of the patients in the topical lavender oil group before insulin injection. Visual Analogue Scale is used to digitalize the pain level that cannot be measured numerically. A line with a length of 100 mm has the words &quot;no pain&quot; at one end and &quot;the most unbearable pain&quot; on the other. The patient indicates his/her pain by choosing the most appropriate place on the line. Then, the level of pain experienced by the patient is determined by using a scale with scores between 0-10. According to this scoring system, less than 3 points indicate mild pain, 3-6 points indicate moderate pain, and more than 6 points indicate severe pain.</description>

    <measure>Blood glucose before insulin injection</measure>
    <time_frame>day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Before the administration blood glucose (mg/dl) of all patients (topical lavender oil, placebo, and control groups) were measured. Blood glucose measurement is done with a blood glucose meter (glucometer) and a measuring stick (strip). Fasting blood glucose 70-125 mg / dl was considered normal.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Oxygen Saturation (SPO2) before insulin injection</measure>
    <time_frame>day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Before the administration oxygen saturation level (SPO2)(%) of all patients (topical lavender oil, placebo, and control groups) were measured. The researcher measured the oxygen saturation in subcutaneous arterial blood with a &quot;Pulse oximeter&quot; device that is reliable, easy to use, does not require calibration and does not cause pain to the patient in its application. Normal value of oxygen saturation (SpO2) (%) was accepted as 96-98%. After placing a probe in the periphery (on the patient's finger) by the investigator, the signal received from the periphery and the value on the image screen (monitor) where the pulse wave sample was projected was recorded as oxygen saturation.</description>

    <measure>Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure before insulin injection</measure>
    <time_frame>day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Before the administration blood pressure (mm/Hg) of all patients (topical lavender oil, placebo, and control groups) were measured. Blood Pressure Measurement was performed using a conventional cuffed sphygmomanometer that can measure systolic and diastolic blood pressure, whose reliability was approved according to international standards and calibrated by the company in technical laboratories for certain periods. The cuff of the sphygmomanometer will be inflated to 20 mm / Hg above the systolic pressure by tying it to cover 2/3 of the arm, and the measurement will be carried out by the researcher.</description>

    <measure>Pulse rate before insulin injection</measure>
    <time_frame>day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Before the administration pulse rate (min) of all patients (topical lavender oil, placebo, and control groups) were measured. The pulse was obtained by the investigator palpating the superficial arteries (by touching them with the hand) and counting the beats felt for one minute. 60 to 100 beats per minute was considered normal for an adult.</description>

    <measure>Respiration rate before insulin injection</measure>
    <time_frame>day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Before the administration Respiration rate (min) of all patients (topical lavender oil, placebo, and control groups) were measured. Respiration rate was measured by the number of diaphragm movements per minute. For an adult at rest, 12 to 20 per minute was considered normal for respiratory rate.</description>
