  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is the first line treatment for locally advanced breast cancer&#xD;
      (BC). Besides making breast conserving surgery feasible, its main aim is to achieve a&#xD;
      pathological complete response (pCR). Previous studies demonstrated that a pCR correlated&#xD;
      with a higher disease-free survival. Tumor response may vary among different BC subtypes and&#xD;
      only 30% of BC respond completely to NAC. Treating chemo-resistant disease with NAC may cause&#xD;
      patient harm due to drug toxicity and surgery delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore very important to promptly identify those women who will not benefit from&#xD;
      NAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mammography and ultrasound proved ineffective in monitoring changes in lesion size due to&#xD;
      therapy-induced fibrosis. MRI is the most accurate imaging technique for assessing early&#xD;
      clinical response by measuring tumor size, however its accuracy is lower post NAC. This&#xD;
      necessitates the need for a new technique able to non invasively assess the effectiveness of&#xD;
      NAC. Optical techniques are sensitive to the biological changes that occur within the tumor&#xD;
      after NAC administration. These changes occur prior to tumor size reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optically estimated total hemoglobin concentration correlates with the histological analysis&#xD;
      of vasculature as well as with tumor-associated angiogenesis which can affect tumor changes&#xD;
      during NAC. Other promising biomarkers related to tissue composition (water, lipid, collagen&#xD;
      content) and structure (scattering) may also be evaluated by optical techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to monitor the effectiveness of NAC in BC patients with a near&#xD;
      infrared spectroscopic imaging platform which allows to non-invasively detect changes in&#xD;
      vascularization and size of BC and to characterize the presence of temporal changes in&#xD;
      regional concentrations of relevant biomarkers (oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin, water, lipid and&#xD;
      collagen concentration, scattering) within tissue during NAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This optical imaging technique will provide a non-invasive, safe and relatively inexpensive&#xD;
      tool to monitor patients' response to NAC and to predict their outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, an accurate, reliable, non-invasive modality with good patient tolerance will&#xD;
      be tested to predict response to NAC in order to tailor the medical and surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to monitor the effectiveness of NAC in BC patients with a new near&#xD;
      infrared spectroscopic imaging platform which allows to non-invasively detect changes in&#xD;
      size, vascularization and blood oxygenation in tumors and to characterize the presence of&#xD;
      temporal changes in regional concentrations of relevant biomarkers like oxy- and&#xD;
      deoxyhemoglobin, water, lipid and collagen and scattering in the tissue during NAC. This&#xD;
      optical imaging tool will allow a non-invasive, safe and relatively inexpensive monitoring of&#xD;
      NAC and prediction of patients' outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single-site, national, non-comparative, non-randomized study will be conducted at the San&#xD;
      Raffaele Hospital in Milan in collaboration with the Politecnico di Milano. The medical&#xD;
      device is a prototype developed by Politecnico di Milano.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty adult women with a recent diagnosis of breast cancer and candidate for NAC, who fulfil&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria and agree to voluntary participate in the study under informed&#xD;
      consent, will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides assessing the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy using conventional imaging&#xD;
      evaluation (x-ray mammography and breast ultrasound prior to commencement/baseline, half way&#xD;
      through and on completion of NAC; contrast-enhanced MRI prior to commencement/baseline and on&#xD;
      completion of NAC), the patients enrolled will be evaluated with optical imaging at the&#xD;
      following six selected time points (prior to commencement of NAC/baseline, 2-5 days post-NAC,&#xD;
      6-8 days post-NAC, 2 weeks post-NAC, half-way through and on completion of NAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A preliminary phase will be performed on the first 5 patients out of the 20 patients&#xD;
      enrolled, in order to evaluate the potential artefacts related to a recent breast biopsy and&#xD;
      to the positioning of a clip. In this preliminary phase, 2 additional optical evaluations&#xD;
      will be carried out, one prior to the breast biopsy and one after the positioning of the&#xD;
      clip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are enrolled in the study for the entire duration of NAC. No follow-up is required&#xD;
      and patients will be followed according to the regular clinical standard of care. Moreover,&#xD;
      the outcome of the optical investigation does not affect the treatment and management of the&#xD;
      women enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of enrolment of the study is expected to be approximately 12 months. The study&#xD;
      will end when the last patient enrolled will complete her chemotherapy treatment.&#xD;
