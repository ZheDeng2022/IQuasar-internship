      The purpose of this study is to determine if stents placed with only one loop in the kidney&#xD;
      move more than stents placed with a loop in both the kidney and a bladder. Participants in&#xD;
      this study will undergo placement of a stent into the ureter that drains urine from the&#xD;
      kidney into the bladder. The stent will be placed in 1 of 2 ways: either with only a loop of&#xD;
      the stent is left in the kidney or in the regular manner where a loop of the stent is left in&#xD;
      both the kidney and in the bladder. The position of the stent will be measured at the time of&#xD;
      placement. When the stent is removed, the position of the stent will be measured prior to&#xD;
      pulling the stent.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ureteral stent is one of the most extensively used tools in the field of urology. They&#xD;
      are used for aiding post-operative healing of the ureter, visualizing the ureteral during&#xD;
      procedures, and alleviating ureteral obstruction (eg. nephrolithiasis). Double-J stents,&#xD;
      which are secured by loops in both the renal pelvis and the bladder, have become most&#xD;
      urologists' go-to choice for ureteral stents since they were introduced in the 1970s.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, it has been shown that 80-90% of patients with ureteral stents have urinary&#xD;
      complaints following stent placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, a recent study suggested utility of intraureteral stents. These stents have&#xD;
      one loop in the renal pelvis while their distal end is positioned proximal to the ureteral&#xD;
      orifice. The above-mentioned study showed that patients with intraureteral stents had less&#xD;
      discomfort as opposed to the those that had double-J stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the immense number of patients that require ureteral stent placement, this improvement&#xD;
      in comfort is very promising for the urological field. However, no one has studied if stents&#xD;
      placed intraureterally migrate from the time they are placed to the time they are removed. If&#xD;
      stents migrate proximally toward the renal pelvis, it is possible that retrieval could be&#xD;
      more difficult, and the ureteral patency established by the stent could be compromised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine if intraureterally placed stents migrate as&#xD;
      compared to ureteral stents placed via the conventional method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a prospective, randomized controlled, single-blinded trial. The subjects&#xD;
      will include up to 140 patients (about 70 subjects per group) from ages 1-100 years old that&#xD;
      are to undergo stent placement for nephrolithiasis, hydronephrosis, and urological cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the procedure, each patient that has agreed to participate in this study will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive a stent placed intraureterally or a stent placed in the&#xD;
      conventional manner. After each intraureteral stent is placed via cystoscopy, the distance of&#xD;
      the distal end of the stent to the ureteral orifice will be measured via fluoroscopy that was&#xD;
      calibrated prior to the procedure. After each double-J stent is placed via cystoscopy, the&#xD;
      length of stent that is present in the bladder will also be measured using calibrated&#xD;
      fluoroscopy . Subjects will not be informed of which group they are assigned to. When the&#xD;
      patients return for stent removal, the previously mentioned distances will be measured again&#xD;
      prior to pulling the stent. They will also be asked to complete the ureteral stent symptom&#xD;
      questionnaire (USSQ) to assess stent-associated discomfort. The primary endpoint of the study&#xD;
      would be stent migration distance (mm). Secondary endpoints would include patient comfort&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All medical records will be accessed on secure devices and networks. All subjects will be&#xD;
      assigned a subject number upon enrolled in the study. When a researcher needs to record data&#xD;
      from a patient's medical records, they will record this information with the patient's&#xD;
      corresponding subject number. Only the researchers involved in this study will have access to&#xD;
      the document that includes patient identifiers and their subject number. At the conclusion of&#xD;
      this study, the document with patient identifiers and subject numbers will be destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected from electronic medical records of patients from ULP (University of&#xD;
      Louisville Physicians) Urology.&#xD;
