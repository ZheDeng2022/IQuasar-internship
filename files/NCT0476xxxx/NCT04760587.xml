      According to the definition of Health Literacy, health literacy means that a person can apply&#xD;
      his or her reading, writing, and computing abilities to health-related information and&#xD;
      activities. WHO consider Health Literacy is the cognitive and social skills which determine&#xD;
      the motivation and ability of individuals to gain access, to understand and use information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of this study will to understand the relationship between health literacy,&#xD;
      weight control behavior and weight control health outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the purpose, the study will be multi wave longitudinal panel study. The study&#xD;
      will apply mobile phone applications and smart watches to understand the relationship between&#xD;
      weight control behaviors and weight control health outcome in adolescent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two blocks in the mobile phone applications: questionnaire block and Weight status&#xD;
      block will be design for the study. Questionnaire block include demography, and health&#xD;
      literacy scales and diet diary. Weight status block include height, weight, waist&#xD;
      circumference, and hip circumference. After the participant key-in the height and weight, the&#xD;
      system will automatically calculate the BMI, also show the results of the BMI. The standard&#xD;
      for BMI interpretation was by Dr. Chang's research about New Growth Charts for Taiwanese&#xD;
      Adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data of smart watches will be upload into the NTUH health cloud system (named NTU MED&#xD;
      GOD). This is the NTUH health cloud, different kinds of medical materials and data could be&#xD;
      sent to the system, such as mobile phone and smart watches data.&#xD;
