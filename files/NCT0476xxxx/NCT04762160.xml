  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to examine the feasibility and efficacy of adding the EZH2&#xD;
      inhibitor, tazemetostat, to rituximab, standard second line or beyond therapy as a means to&#xD;
      improve disease response.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, multicenter, open-label study of oral tazemetostat in combination with&#xD;
      rituximab in subjects with relapsed or refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL). This study&#xD;
      is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tazemetostat in combination with rituximab&#xD;
      in subjects previously treated with at least 2 prior systemic lines of therapy for FL, and&#xD;
      features early futility stopping to maintain subject safety.&#xD;

    <description>Tazemetostat 800 mg BID is administered daily starting on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1). Tazemetostat is supplied by Epizyme in pre-counted, appropriately labeled bottles. Tazemetostat will be administered from C1D1 to the end of Cycle 24, for a total of 24 months of therapy. Rituximab will be administered by either subcutaneous injection or IV infusion according to the regional product prescribing information and labeling. Rituximab will be administered at a dose of 375 mg/m2 on Day 1, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1, and then on Day 1 of Cycles 3 through 6, accounting for an additional 4 doses, i.e., a total of 8 doses of rituximab in 6 cycles. Rituximab will be procured by the clinical sites from commercial sources. Disease Assessments will be performed at screening, C3D1, C6D1, C12D1, C18D1, C24D1</description>
