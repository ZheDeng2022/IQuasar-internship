  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is to assess efficacy, safety, blood levels and bodily effects of up to 2 dose&#xD;
      levels of intravenous (IV) pegloticase (KRYSTEXXA) infusions at every 4 week intervals (Q4&#xD;
      Weeks) for up to 6 months (Day 1 to 24 weeks with an optional 24 - 48 weeks treatment&#xD;
      duration) when given in combination with weekly oral doses of methotrexate (MTX). The goal is&#xD;
      to identify an appropriate dose to be administered every 4 weeks to be used for future&#xD;
      clinical trials for patients with chronic gout that does not adequately respond to&#xD;
      conventional therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The primary objective is to choose a dose for further investigation by assessing the effect&#xD;
      of pegloticase 16 mg dose with a possibility of potential additional dose (e.g., 24 or 32 mg)&#xD;
      administered via IV Q4 Wks, co-administered with weekly doses of oral MTX, as measured by the&#xD;
      sustained normalization of serum uric acid (sUA) to &lt;6 mg/dL for at least 80% of the time&#xD;
      during Month 6 and the duration of sUA to &lt;6 mg/dL over 24 week treatment period in adult&#xD;
      participants with chronic gout refractory to conventional therapy.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Screening period up to 35 days, followed by a 4-week methotrexate (MTX) tolerability run-in. Treatment will consist of pegloticase IV Q4 Wks dose for a total of 6 infusions (24 Weeks) with co-administered weekly doses of oral MTX. An optional extension treatment (24-48 weeks) will be available for 6 more infusions (total of 12). After completing 2 infusions, the data from the first ~10 participants will be analyzed to determine if: 1) 5 more participants in the first cohort should be enrolled, 2) &gt; 5 participants should be enrolled in the first cohort, 3) enrollment in the first cohort should discontinue, and/or 4) enrollment for a second cohort should begin.&#xD;
-Cohort 1: 16 mg pegloticase, co-administered with weekly doses of oral MTX ; and, if required, potential Cohort 2: 24 or 32 mg pegloticase, co-administered with weekly doses of oral MTX.</intervention_model_description>
