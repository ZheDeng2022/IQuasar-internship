  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme-inhibitors-dependent angioedema (ACEi-AE) is the most frequent&#xD;
      form of bradykinin-mediated AE, with an estimated prevalence of 0.1% to 0.7%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These AE can be explained by the accumulation of bradykinin (BK), a peptide responsible for&#xD;
      increase of vascular permeability: ACE inhibitors block ACE, the main inactivation pathway of&#xD;
      the BK, thus extending its half-life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In spite of the the stopping of the drug, systematically performed in the case of ACEi-AE, up&#xD;
      to 50% of patients relapsed within 6 months, with maximum risk in the first month after&#xD;
      stopping. In addition, the discontinuation of these drugs represents a loss of chance for&#xD;
      some patients, without clearly established mastocytic (or histaminic) or bradykinic etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present there is no method to predict the risk of crisis recurrence in patients who have&#xD;
      developed AE-IEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the risk of relapse is associated with a decrease in the&#xD;
      activity of BK degradation enzymes (including aminopeptidase P (APP), dipeptidyl peptidase-4&#xD;
      (DPP4), and ECA) that persists at the cessation of IEC.&#xD;
