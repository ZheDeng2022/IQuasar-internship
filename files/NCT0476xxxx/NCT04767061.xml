  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the impact of beta-blockers on physical function&#xD;
      in older adults with heart failure. We will achieve this objective by conducting N-of-1&#xD;
      trials. N-of-1 trials are personalized experiments that test different treatment options in&#xD;
      an individual patient.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in physical activity when on beta-blocker versus when off beta-blocker, as measured by step count on wearable activity monitoring device</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 5-6, Weeks 11-12, Weeks 17-18, Weeks 23-24</time_frame>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in lower extremity function when on beta-blocker versus when off beta-blocker, as measured by Short Physical Performance Battery</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6, Week 12, Week 18, Week 24</time_frame>

  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in exercise capacity when on beta-blocker versus when off beta-blocker, as measured by peak oxygen consumption (VO2) during cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) measures breath-by-breath oxygen production during symptom-limited exercise on a stationary bike. This permits calculation of peak oxygen consumption (VO2). Percent predicted peak VO2 for body weight will also be calculated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in patient-reported quality of life when on beta-blocker versus when off beta-blocker, as measured by Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System-29 (PROMIS-29)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weekly over 24 weeks, Month 9, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System-29 (PROMIS-29) is a health-related quality of life survey, with questions from 6 domains: depression, anxiety, physical function, pain interference, sleep disturbance, and ability to engage in social roles and activities. Questions are ranked on a 5-point Likert scale, with higher scores at times indicating better quality of life, and at other times indicating poorer quality of life. There is a pain rating scale ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating higher pain level. Scores are reported for each domain, as well as for pain rating.</description>

    <description>Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System-Short Form 6a (PROMIS SF-6a) is a survey of patient-perceived cognitive deficits. Questions are ranked on a 5-point Likert scale, with higher scores indicating poorer cognitive function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in patient-reported health status when on beta-blocker versus when off beta-blocker, as measured by Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Biweekly over 24 weeks, Month 9, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ-12) is a heart failure-specific health status survey. Questions are ranked on 5- to 7-point Likert scales, with higher scores indicating better health status.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in patient-reported health when on beta-blocker versus when off beta-blocker, as measured by the EuroQol-5D Visual Analogue System (EQ-5D VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6, Week 12, Week 18, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The EuroQol-5D Visual Analogue System (EQ-5D VAS) indicates patient-perceived health on a vertical visual analogue scale. The scale ranges from 0, indicating poorest health, to 100, indicating best health.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Beta Blocker ABAB Sequence</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>This arm will follow an ABAB sequence. &quot;A&quot; representing ON beta blockers and &quot;B&quot; representing OFF beta blockers. Subjects in this arm will continue their home dose during the initial A period, they will then crossover into Period 2, where dose reduction will begin until they are off of beta blockers. During Period 3, they will restart beta-blockers, gradually uptitrating until reaching their home dose and finally during period 4, we will again conduct a dose reduction until off of beta blockers.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Beta Blocker BABA Sequence</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>This arm will follow a BABA sequence. &quot;A&quot; representing ON beta blockers and &quot;B&quot; representing OFF of beta blockers. Subjects in this arm will have their previously prescribed beta blocker dose reduced until they are completely off of beta blockers during Period 1. They will then crossover into Period 2, where uptitration will begin until they are back on their previously prescribed dose of beta blockers. During Period 3, we will again conduct a dose reduction, until the subject is off of beta blockers and finally during Period 4, we will uptitrate them back to their home dose of beta blockers.</description>

    <description>The intervention is a two-arm crossover withdrawal/ reversal design (On [A] vs Off [B]) with 4 periods, each period lasting up to 6 weeks. During the On period (A), subjects will be on their beta blocker. During the Off period (B), their beta blockers will be down titrated and subsequently discontinued.&#xD;
Subjects will be randomized into either ABAB or BABA sequences.</description>
