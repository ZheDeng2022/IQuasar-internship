  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective, multi-center study to assess the safety and performance by&#xD;
      proactively reviewing pre-existing medical records and imaging of patients who had previous&#xD;
      placement of FLUENCY® PLUS Vascular Stent Graft in iliac artery vessel(s) between January&#xD;
      2010 and March 2020.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to retrospectively collect and analyze data on the FLUENCY® PLUS&#xD;
      Vascular Stent Graft to summarize and describe real-world experience, and long-term data&#xD;
      regarding its safety and efficacy and to compare these findings with published data on&#xD;
      stent-treatment in iliac artery disease. The present study aims to collect clinical data&#xD;
      about FLUENCY® treatment of atherosclerotic disease (stenosis, occlusion, dissection) as well&#xD;
      as to explore safety and effectiveness data for off-label use in additional indications in&#xD;
      the iliac segment that have been described in the scientific literature (vessel rupture,&#xD;
      aneurysm).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The FLUENCY® PLUS Vascular Stent Graft implantation procedure was for the purpose of&#xD;
             lesions in the iliac arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The FLUENCY® PLUS Vascular Stent Graft was placed between January 2010 and March 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female ≥ 18 years old at the time of implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject provides written informed consent. The subject may be enrolled without&#xD;
             informed consent for anonymous data collection if the responsible Ethics Committee has&#xD;
             waived the requirement due to the retrospective study design, and written&#xD;
             documentation about this decision is provided to the Investigator and the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The FLUENCY® PLUS Vascular Stent Graft was implanted in an anatomic location other&#xD;
             than iliac arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of a target lesion (i.e. diseased or damaged artery) in the area covered by&#xD;
             the FLUENCY® PLUS Vascular Stent Graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects without any existing follow-up information after hospital discharge (This&#xD;
             criterion does not apply to subjects who deceased during implantation/prior to&#xD;
             discharge).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject was identified with a medical condition, which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, may cause him/her to be noncompliant with the protocol, or confound the&#xD;
             data interpretation.&#xD;
