  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multiple dose, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of belcesiran to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD in adult patients with PiZZ A1ATD-associated&#xD;
      liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 2 parallel cohorts. A total of up to 27 participants may be&#xD;
      enrolled in a single cohort. The 2 cohorts are differentiated only by the duration of the&#xD;
      treatment period, the number of doses administered, and the timing of the end-of-treatment&#xD;
      (EOT) liver biopsy. Participants in Cohort 1 will undergo EOT biopsy at 24 weeks, and&#xD;
      participants in Cohort 2 will undergo EOT biopsy at 48 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A1ATD-associated liver disease is a progressive Alpha-1 Antitrypsin-Deficiency Associated&#xD;
      Liver Disease condition resulting in liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
      The lack of functional A1AT in individuals with the PiZZ genotype, in conjunction with other&#xD;
      precipitating factors, can lead to unchecked activity of neutrophil elastases in the alveoli;&#xD;
      causing emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This loss-of-function&#xD;
      mechanism can be addressed with intravenous augmentation therapy, which aims to substitute&#xD;
      the missing A1AT by infusing alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor (A1PI), purified from pooled human&#xD;
      plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While augmentation therapy can address the loss of A1AT in the lung, no treatment exists for&#xD;
      the associated liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the severity of the disease, with approximately 10% of affected patients developing&#xD;
      liver cirrhosis and a subgroup of those patients in need of liver transplantation, and the&#xD;
      lack of an effective treatment that addresses the toxic hepatic &quot;gain-of-function&quot; mechanism,&#xD;
      there is an urgent unmet medical need to develop a therapy that can help this particular&#xD;
      patient population.&#xD;
