  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase I/IIa, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised study designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, exploratory efficacy and exposure of LTX-109 administered topically to&#xD;
      the anterior nares in subjects with persistent carriage of S. aureus (methicillin-susceptible&#xD;
      S. aureus [MSSA] and/or methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA]).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 60 subjects will be screened to achieve 24 persistent MSSA and/or MRSA carriers&#xD;
      and 16 randomised and dosed subjects randomized 3:1, active to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinic on Day 1 for randomisation and dosing and&#xD;
      will remain at the clinic until Day 2. Following nasal and perineum swabs and a chlorhexidine&#xD;
      (Hibiscrub®) shower, the investigational medicinal product (IMP) will be applied topically to&#xD;
      both nostrils by a qualified health professional 4 times during a six hour period (every two&#xD;
      hours at 0, 2, 4 and 6 hours) on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will come back to the research clinic on Day 3, Day 4, Day 8 and Day 15 (Visits 4 to&#xD;
      7) for safety, tolerability and efficacy assessments and for blood sampling for bioanalysis.&#xD;
      On Day 5 and Day 6, subjects will take a chlorhexidine shower at home. A final end-of-study&#xD;
      visit (Visit 8) will take place on Day 22 (±3 days) or after early withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be instructed to wash the body and hair with chlorhexidine body wash and&#xD;
      shampoo at the clinic on Day 1 (prior to the first dose) and on Day 2. Prior to leaving the&#xD;
      clinic on Day 2, subjects will be provided with chlorhexidine body wash and shampoo for body&#xD;
      and hair wash at home on Day 3 (prior to Visit 4), on Day 4 (prior to Visit 5) and on Day 5&#xD;
      and Day 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject is expected to participate in the study for approximately 50 days including a 28&#xD;
      day screening period&#xD;
