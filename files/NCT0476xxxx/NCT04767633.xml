  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Before having a colonoscopy, it is necessary to clean the intestine well in order to have a&#xD;
      complete view of the intestinal mucosa. Preparations consisting of osmotic agents are used to&#xD;
      clean the intestines, which are sometimes difficult to drink. In this study we want to&#xD;
      evaluate whether the preparation, based on sodium picosulfate plus magnesium citrate (PMC),&#xD;
      is easier for the patient to take all day before the exam or half the day before and half the&#xD;
      same morning of procedure and which method of intake allows the doctor to better conduct the&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study will be to compare the efficacy, tolerability and&#xD;
      acceptability of two dosage regimens of sodium picosulfate plus magnesium citrate (PMC).&#xD;
      Effectiveness means which of the two methods of taking the preparation works best for&#xD;
      cleaning the intestine, with tolerability if one of the two methods is easier for the patient&#xD;
      and with acceptability if one of the two methods is easier than the other.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this investigator-blinded, randomized, controlled trial (RCT) will be to&#xD;
      compare the efficacy, tolerability and acceptability of two PMC dosing regimen (standard&#xD;
      regimen vs split-dose regimen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluation of adverse events;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assessment of symptoms associated to colonic lavage solutions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  monitoring the ease of taking the preparation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identification of patients' willingness to repeat the procedure;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluation of the amount of preparation voluntarily taken by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end-points will be the overall colon cleansing defined as the rate of &quot;successful&quot;&#xD;
      cleansing (excellent and good scores in the BBPS, i.e. ≥ 6 points) of the two preparation&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end-points will include: 1) the rate of adverse events, 2) the rate of specific&#xD;
&#xD;
      symptoms associated to colonic lavage solutions, 3) the rate of children who declared that&#xD;
      the intake of the solution was easy, 4) the rate of children who declared that they would be&#xD;
      willing to repeat the same preparation regimen if needed, 5) the rate of children taking an&#xD;
      amount of solution ≥ 75%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a multicenter, randomized, non-pharmacological, observer-blind, parallel group&#xD;
      study conducted in Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is considered non-pharmacological because we'll use the standard dose administered&#xD;
      with two different timing (assumption of the whole preparation on the day prior to&#xD;
      investigative procedure vs assumption of the first half of oral doses the day before&#xD;
      colonoscopy and the second one on the morning of the day of colonoscopy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients enrolled will be randomized in one of the two arms that provide the following&#xD;
      treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: they will receive PCM standard-dose which provides for the assumption of whole dose&#xD;
      of preparation on the day prior to investigative procedure; Group B: they will receive PCM&#xD;
      split-dose administered the previous day and in the morning of the day of colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of this study is expected to be 18 months from the approval of the ethical&#xD;
      committee assuming an expected enrollment duration of 16 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be assessed on the day of colonoscopy by direct questioning and by&#xD;
      telephone interview 48-96 hours after colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be all consecutive children aged 2-18 years undergoing elective&#xD;
      colonoscopy in the involved institutions with informed consent signed by the parent/&#xD;
      guardian. Exclusion criteria are: 1) requirement for urgent colonoscopy, 2) bowel&#xD;
      obstruction, 3) known or suspected hypersensitivity to the active or other ingredients, 4)&#xD;
      clinically significant electrolyte imbalance, 5) prior intestinal resection, 6) known&#xD;
      metabolic, renal and cardiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written assent from young patients and informed consent from the legal guardian and patients&#xD;
      over fourteen years will be obtained&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A (PMC standard-dose): patients will receive two oral doses of sodium picosulphate plus&#xD;
      magnesium oxide and citric acid (Picoprep), each diluted in 150 ml of water, at 17:00 and 4&#xD;
      hours later in the evening prior to the colonoscopy (¼ sachet for children &lt; 6 years, ½&#xD;
      sachet for children 6-12 years, and one sachet for children &gt;12 years). Intake of at least&#xD;
      40-50 ml/kg (maximum 2 L) of clear fluids (cold tea, gatorade etc..) will be recommended&#xD;
      after each dose. The age-adjusted dosage is dictated by the instructions of the manufacturing&#xD;
      company. No solid food intake will be allowed during the 24 hours prior to the examination&#xD;
      according to the instructions of the manufacturing company.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B (PMC split-dose): patients will receive the first oral doses of PMC diluted in 150 ml&#xD;
      of water (Picoprep; Ferring Italia, Milan, Italy) at 19:00 of the day before colonoscopy and&#xD;
      the second one at 06:00 hours on the morning of the day of colonoscopy (¼ sachet for&#xD;
&#xD;
      children &lt; 6 years, ½ sachet for children 6-12 years, and one sachet for children &gt;12 years).&#xD;
      Intake of at least 40-50 ml/kg (maximum 2 L) of clear fluids (cold tea, gatorade etc..) will&#xD;
      be recommended after each dose. The age-adjusted dosage is dictated by the instructions of&#xD;
      the manufacturing company. No solid food intake will be allowed during the 24 hours prior to&#xD;
      the examination according to the instructions of the manufacturing company.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups a nasogastric tube will be inserted if the child failed to drink the&#xD;
      prescribed amount of cleanout preparation within the first hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preparations will be dispensed by a nurse who carefully explained how the products should&#xD;
      be taken, emphasising the importance of complete intake of the solution to ensure a safe and&#xD;
      effective procedure. Moreover, each patient will be provided with dietary instructions: low&#xD;
      residue diet for 3 days before colonoscopy. During and after bowel preparation, solid food&#xD;
      will not be allowed. Clear liquid could be taken until 2 hours before the procedure. All&#xD;
      colonoscopy will be performed between 11:00 and 15:00 by two endoscopists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of bowel preparations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy. Preparation efficacy will be evaluated by the blinded endoscopist according to the&#xD;
      Boston Bowel Preparation scale (BBPS) (14) consisting of four-point scoring system applied to&#xD;
      each of the three broad regions of the colon: right colon, transverse colon, and left colon&#xD;
      In addition, overall cleansing of the colon will be scored by summing up the scores of each&#xD;
      segment. For the study, the total score ranging from 0 to 9 will be divided into four&#xD;
      different classes: excellent cleansing (total score 8-9), good cleansing (total score 6-7),&#xD;
      poor cleansing (total score 4-5) and inadequate cleansing (total score 0-3). For the primary&#xD;
      efficacy variable, excellent and good cleansing will be considered as &quot;successful&quot; and poor&#xD;
      or inadequate as &quot;failure&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According with a normal clinical practice, all examinations will be performed with a&#xD;
      pediatric colonoscope under general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety. Vital signs, complete physical examination and routine blood tests will be performed&#xD;
      at the time of patient enrolment and on the day of colonoscopy and included liver and kidney&#xD;
      function test, potassium, magnesium, sodium, chlorides and calcium. Adverse events will be&#xD;
      assessed on the day of colonoscopy by direct questioning and by telephone interview 48-96&#xD;
      hours after colonoscopy. All new symptoms will be considered to be treatment related and have&#xD;
      been included in the analysis. Any symptom that manifested following the treatment (except&#xD;
      those expected and included in the evaluation of GI- tolerability) and exacerbations of&#xD;
      preexisting symptoms will be assumed to be related to the bowel preparation regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tolerability, acceptability and compliance. On the morning of colonoscopy, immediately before&#xD;
      the procedure, a nurse questioned each patient about his/her experience by using a&#xD;
      standardized questionnaire (see below). Patients will be inquired about tolerability, need&#xD;
      for nasogastric tube placement, acceptability and compliance. The endoscopist will not be&#xD;
      allowed to take part in the questioning or to supervise the clinical interview before&#xD;
      colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tolerability assessment will be based on the recording of occurrence and severity of GI&#xD;
      symptoms such as nausea, bloating, abdominal, pain/cramps and anal discomfort. A 5-point&#xD;
      scale (1 = severely distressing, 2 = distressing, 3 = bothersome, 4 = mild and 5 = none),&#xD;
      will be used to score the tolerability (10). The need for nasogastric tube insertion will&#xD;
      also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The easiness of taking or swallowing the solution will be graded according to the following&#xD;
      scale: very severe distress = 4, severe distress = 3, moderate distress = 2, mild distress =&#xD;
      1, no distress = 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Willingness to repeat the same type of bowel preparation if necessary will also be evaluated.&#xD;
      Compliance will be scored on a 3-point scale according to the percentage of drunken solution&#xD;
      (excellent: intake of the whole solution; good: intake of at least 75% of the solution; poor:&#xD;
      intake of &lt; 75%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised computer-generated list in blocks of six will be prepared by a biostatistician&#xD;
      and eligible children were allocated to receive one of the two bowel preparations, stratified&#xD;
      by three age groups; 2-7 years, 8-13 years and 14-18 years. A clinic nurse will assign&#xD;
      treatment regimen only after written consent will be obtained by one of the investigators.&#xD;
      The cleanout regimen will be dispensed directly to the family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be observer blind: the endoscopists will not be allowed to perform any&#xD;
      activities associated with study preparation prior and after colonoscopy and will avoid any&#xD;
      discussion with the patients and the staff, which could disclose the type of bowel&#xD;
      preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on results from previous studies on bowel preparation with PMC on adults patients, a&#xD;
      success rate of about 75 % was assumed (15) difference in efficacy of 10% (80% in split-dose&#xD;
      vs. 70% in single dose) between the two groups, with power of study 80%, alpha error 0.05 and&#xD;
      confidence interval 95% calculated sample size will be 290 patients in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For univariate analysis, comparisons between groups will be performed using the Student's t&#xD;
      test, the chi-squared test, or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. The Mann - Whitney test&#xD;
      will be used to compare non-paired, nonparametric variables. Multivariate analysis will be&#xD;
      used for the primary outcome variables, in a logistic step- wise regression model. The&#xD;
      statistical analysis will be performed using absolute and relative frequency tables and&#xD;
      contingency&#xD;
&#xD;
      tables. The statistical significance will be set at p &lt; 0.05. The analysis will be conducted&#xD;
      using SPSS, release 23.0 version.&#xD;
