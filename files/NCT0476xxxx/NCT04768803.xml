  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A significantly higher proportion of patients with rare diseases (RD) with intellectual&#xD;
      disability (ID), present hyperphagia, overweight or obesity, compared to the general&#xD;
      population. Prader-Willi syndrome is the only genetic obesity identified to date associated&#xD;
      with hyperghrelinemia, while ghrelin levels are lower than in controls in other situations of&#xD;
      obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to find out whether the levels of ghrelin, which are abnormally high&#xD;
      in PWS throughout life, are also high in these RD when people have hyperphagia and/or&#xD;
      overweight.&#xD;

      A significantly higher proportion of patients with rare diseases (RD) with intellectual&#xD;
      disability (ID), present hyperphagia, overweight or obesity, compared to the general&#xD;
      population. Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) and related syndromes (PWS-like) represent the most&#xD;
      well-known causes of eating disorders with early and severe obesity. Other known RD with ID&#xD;
      have been described as being associated with eating disorders with overweight or obesity,&#xD;
      which appear later in adolescence : Angelman's syndrome (approximately 40% of patients are&#xD;
      overweight or obese, and 32% of children have hyperphagia), Fragile X syndrome (over 30% are&#xD;
      obese), Smith-Magenis syndrome (50 to 60% are obese). Prader-Willi syndrome is the only&#xD;
      genetic obesity identified to date associated with hyperghrelinemia, while ghrelin levels are&#xD;
      lower than in controls in other situations of obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to find out whether the levels of ghrelin, which are abnormally high&#xD;
      in PWS throughout life, are also high in these pathologies when people have hyperphagia&#xD;
      and/or overweight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves a single visit carried out during a routine follow-up in the CRMR, in&#xD;
      which the blood sample will allow the dosage of the ghrelin hormon. The visit will also&#xD;
      involves a data collection and some questionnaires.&#xD;
