    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the regenerative potential of Advanced&#xD;
      Platelet Rich Fibrin (A-PRF) and Bioactive Glass (Perioglas®) bone graft in the treatment of&#xD;
      intrabony defects in chronic periodontitis patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      45 sites with vertical intrabony alveolar defects will be selected. These defect sites will&#xD;
      be allocated randomly into 3 groups as Group I, Group II and Group III.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group I will be treated with open flap debridement and filled with A-PRF&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group II will be treated with open flap debridement and filled with Bioactive glass&#xD;
           (Perioglas®)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group III will be treated with open flap debridement and filled Bioactive glass&#xD;
           (Perioglas®) and A-PRF.&#xD;

    <description>After phase 1 therapy, surgical procedure would be carried out in the selected patients under aseptic conditions. Full thickness mucoperiosteal Kirkland flap would be raised on both buccal and lingual sides using periosteal elevator. Pocket lining epithelium would be removed and a thorough debridement and root planing would be done in the intrabony defect by using Gracey curettes and universal curettes. After placement of A-PRF in bony defect site the mucoperiosteal flaps would be sutured for complete soft tissue closure.</description>
