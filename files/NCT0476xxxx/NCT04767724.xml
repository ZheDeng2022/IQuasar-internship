      To investigate the effect of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) compared to the local&#xD;
      corticosteroid injection (LCI) in managing mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).&#xD;
      About 50-60 patients with mild to moderate CTS are supposed to be randomly allocated into&#xD;
      either ESWT group or LCI group. The outcomes include the visual analog scale (VAS), the&#xD;
      Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ), and nerve conduction study at baseline and at 3&#xD;
      weeks, 9 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after the treatments.&#xD;

    <description>Participants received three ESWT sessions once per week for three consecutive weeks. The probe of the ESWT machine (FT-174; Swiss Dolor Class; Switzerland) was placed perpendicularly on the patient's palm over the median nerve on the carpal tunnel after application of the ultrasound gel as a coupling agent. Afterward, the ESWT was administered with 1000 shots, 1.5 bar of pressure, and a frequency of 6 Hz</description>
