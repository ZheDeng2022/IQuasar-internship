      By observing the changes of Central venous-arterial partial pressure difference of carbon&#xD;
      dioxide [P (v-a) CO2] in liquid resuscitation during early escharectomy in patients with&#xD;
      large-scale burns, We investigate the effect of P (v-a) CO2 on postoperative tissue perfusion&#xD;
      and oxygenation in order to seek a more effective intergrated target plan of liquid&#xD;
      resuscitation for burn patients.&#xD;

      Objective: By observing the changes of Central venous-arterial partial pressure difference of&#xD;
      carbon dioxide [P (v-a) CO2] in liquid resuscitation during early escharectomy in patients&#xD;
      with large-scale burns, We investigate the effect of P (v-a) CO2 on postoperative tissue&#xD;
      perfusion and oxygenation in order to seek a more effective intergrated target plan of liquid&#xD;
      resuscitation for burn patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: a prospective observational study was conducted on 145 patients with extensive burns&#xD;
      admitted to surgical intensive care unit（SICU）of Guangzhou Red Cross hospital from January&#xD;
      2016 to December 2019. All patients received hemodynamic monitoring and goal-directed fluid&#xD;
      therapy, patients with central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2)&lt; 70% were excluded. Patients&#xD;
      were divided into the following groups according to the changing trend of Pcv-aCO2 between T&#xD;
      base (before induction) and T 0h (after surgery) : group 1 (H-H) : Pcv-aCO2≥6mmHg between T&#xD;
      base and T 0h. Group 2 (L-H) : Pcv-aco2&lt; 6mmHg at T base and≥6mmHg at T 0h; Group 3 (H-L) :&#xD;
      Pcv-aCO2≥6mmHg at T base and &lt; 6mmHg at T 0h. Group 4( L-L) : Pcv-aCO2 &lt; 6mmHg between T base&#xD;
      and T0h.Postoperative basic physiological indicators such as heart rate（HR）, blood pressure,&#xD;
      central venous pressure (CVP), cardiac output index (CI), Pcv-aCO2 and lactic acid were&#xD;
      recorded at 0 and 18 hours after surgery. Oxygen dynamic indicators such as oxygen delivery&#xD;
      index (DO2I), oxygen consumption index (VO2I), oxygen uptake rate (O2ER) and so on were&#xD;
      calculated. Pearson correlation analysis was used to evaluate the correlation between&#xD;
      Pcv-aCO2 and CI. The change of tissue perfusion and oxygenation with different levels of&#xD;
      Pcv-aCO2 after fluid resuscitation were analyzed.&#xD;

    <description>Compensatory dilatation was performed firstly and 5ml/kg crystal solution was added within 30min before induction of anesthesia.When SVV≥13%, infusion of colloidal solution 2ml/kg was performed 15-20 minutes.If the increase of SV was≥10% after the liquid impact and the SVV was still≥13%, the colloidal solution was used again for 2mL/kg and the infusion was maintained until the SVV &lt; 13%.The infusion was stopped when the SVV &lt; 10%.If the increase of SV was less than 10% or CI &lt; 2.0L/min/m2 after infusion, dobutamine was given intravenously to observe the change of SV. If the increase of SV was greater than 10%, dobutamine could be maintained and the above fluid regimen continued.If the increase of SV was less than 10% and MAP≥65mmHg, the infusion of liquid was stopped and replaced with 4ml/kg/h infusion for maintenance.If the increase of SV was less than 10% and MAP was less than 65mmHg, the infusion was suspended.</description>
