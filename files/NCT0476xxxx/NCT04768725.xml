  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the effects of dietary intervention combined with&#xD;
      physical-cognitive exergaming on cognitive performance and circulating biomarkers of obese&#xD;
      postmenopausal women. It is hypothesized that participants will demonstrate significant&#xD;
      improvement in cognitive performance and circulating biomarkers after participating in this&#xD;
      combined program compared to baseline and the dietary and control groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An association between obesity and cognitive impairment has been consistently reported. The&#xD;
      risk of having dementia in later life is about 74% higher for middle-aged obese individuals&#xD;
      than those with normal BMI. Estrogen deprivation has also been found to impair cognition.&#xD;
      Thus, obese postmenopausal women are likely to be at risk of having cognitive impairment. The&#xD;
      common recommendation for obesity management is dietary and exercise intervention. Research&#xD;
      evidence has demonstrated that either dietary intervention or moderate-vigorous intensity&#xD;
      exercise enhance cognitive function in obese adults. This study aims to examine the effects&#xD;
      of 12-week home-based dietary intervention combined with physical-cognitive exergaming on&#xD;
      cognitive performance and circulating biomarkers of obese postmenopausal women through a&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the four&#xD;
      groups: 1) dietary intervention 2) combined physical-cognitive exergaming, 3) dietary&#xD;
      intervention combined with physical-cognitive exergaming, and 4) control group. Outcome&#xD;
      measures including cognitive performance (i.e. executive function, episodic memory,&#xD;
      attention, language, and global cognition), circulating biomarkers (i.e. BDNF level,&#xD;
      metabolic parameters, inflammation markers, and adiponectin levels) as well as physical&#xD;
      performance will be determined at baseline and after 12-week intervention. Findings from this&#xD;
      study may offer a feasible and effective intervention program to improve cognitive&#xD;
      performance along with its responsible circulating biomarkers in obese postmenopausal women.&#xD;

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Time to complete Trail Making B and A will be recorded in seconds.

    <measure>change from baseline Stroop Color and Word score at 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In Stroop Color and Word test, the number of items correctly identified in 45 seconds in each condition (i.e. word, color, color-word) will be recorded. Then the predicted score will be calculated. Score will be obtained from the different between the color-word and predicted scores. Lower scores indicate greater difficulty in inhibiting interference.</description>
