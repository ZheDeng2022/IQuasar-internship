  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flaxseed and olive oil consumption have beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors.&#xD;
      Nonetheless the effects of their simultaneous consumption have not yet been studied.The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of a healthy diet containing flaxseed and&#xD;
      olive oil compared with healthy dietary advice on cardiovascular disease risk markers in&#xD;
      patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), in improving flow-mediated dilation, plasma&#xD;
      lipid profile and fatty acids composition of red blood cells.&#xD;

      A randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted in Rajaie Cardiovascular Center in&#xD;
      Tehran, Iran. After review of the inclusion and exclusion criteria and explanation of the&#xD;
      design of the study, written consent form will be completed. The participants are 50 eligible&#xD;
      coronary artery disease patients, aged 30-75 years. Intervention group will be received a&#xD;
      heart-healthy diet with a specified number of food servings from different food groups&#xD;
      (including vegetables, fruits, grains, dairy products, meats) + daily consumption of 30 grams&#xD;
      of flaxseed + 25 mL/day of refined olive oil (equivalent to 4 tablespoons; 2 tablespoons for&#xD;
      lunch and 2 tablespoons for dinner); and control group will be received recommendations for a&#xD;
      heart-healthy diet, such as those of the American Heart Association for 3 months. These&#xD;
      include eating at least 5 servings of vegetables and fruits daily, reduction in the&#xD;
      consumption of sources of saturated and trans fats by avoiding the consumption of high-fat&#xD;
      red meats and replacing them with low-fat meat or with poultry and fish, replacing low-fat&#xD;
      dairy sources with regular or high-fat ones; consumption of regular vegetable oils such as&#xD;
      canola and sunflower; reduction in salt consumption; and reduction in the consumption of&#xD;
      simple sugars, for 3 months. Flow mediated dilatation (FMD) in brachial artery via&#xD;
      ultrasonography, plasma levels of lipids and lipoproteins via enzymatic method, and fatty&#xD;
      acids composition of red blood cells via gas chromatography method were measured.&#xD;
