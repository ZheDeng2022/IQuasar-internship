      The NaSS aims to assess the extent to which the SHAKE program is implemented within Nigeria&#xD;
      by the Nigerian Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) using a type III&#xD;
      hybrid, mixed method study design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Nigerian Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) is leading&#xD;
      implementation and scale-up of a national sodium reduction program with other national,&#xD;
      state, and international agencies using the WHO's &quot;Best Buy&quot; SHAKE package (Surveillance of&#xD;
      salt intake, Harness industry, Adopt standards for labelling and marketing, Knowledge to&#xD;
      empower consumers, and Environments to promote healthy eating). SHAKE provides evidence-based&#xD;
      recommendations for population-wide sodium reduction interventions for hypertension&#xD;
      prevention and control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Nigeria Sodium Study will support this program's implementation and scale-up by&#xD;
      evaluating the extent to which the program is implemented using a type III hybrid, mixed&#xD;
      methods study design through repeated: 1) stakeholder interviews, 2) populations surveys, and&#xD;
      3) retail surveys. Implementation research methods will be used during adaptation, planning,&#xD;
      and initial implementation for baseline (Years 1-2) and of follow-up (Years 3-4 and Years&#xD;
      5-6) assessments. A dietary sources of sodium study will also be performed at baseline and&#xD;
      Years 5-6 follow-up to target/track sodium reduction efforts according to local context and&#xD;
      culture. Food retail surveys over the study period will capture novel data on packaged,&#xD;
      unpackaged, and informal restaurant/hawker food through the international FoodSwitch program,&#xD;
      which combines a consumer facing tool with crowdsourcing to better define Nigeria's food&#xD;
      supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will use the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation and Sustainment (EPIS)&#xD;
      framework throughout both phases. The formative research period will include Exploration and&#xD;
      Preparation, when investigators will perform quantitative and qualitative measures of key&#xD;
      process indicators, relevant contextual factors informed by CFIR, and relevant Proctor&#xD;
      implementation outcomes, acceptability, feasibility and appropriateness. As implementation is&#xD;
      started, investigators will use the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and&#xD;
      Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework, including implementation outcomes (feasibility, fidelity,&#xD;
      adoption, acceptability, and cost) and contextual factors associated with the Implementation&#xD;
      and Sustainment phases.&#xD;
