  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common entrapment neuropathy caused by compression of&#xD;
      the median nerve at the wrist.Clinically electroneuphysiological assessment is not accessible&#xD;
      to all clinicians. In this way ultrasounds (US) is a more accessible and economical tool and&#xD;
      many studies have reported that US has high sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of&#xD;
      CTS.Diacutaneous Fibrolysis (DF) is a physiotherapeutic technique derived from Cyriax deep&#xD;
      friction massage principles.DF technique could assist in improving changes in the connective&#xD;
      tissues adjacent to the median nerve, especially the thickness of TCL and this could be&#xD;
      reflected in a decreasing of TCL. Moreover, the neurophysiological and mechanical effect&#xD;
      described by this technique may improve the nerve compression decreasing the CSA of the&#xD;
      median nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to quantify changes in the cross-sectional area of the median&#xD;
      nerve in the carpal tunnel and the thickness of transversal carpal ligament measured by US&#xD;
      and the changes in the intensity of the numbness and the subjective assessment of clinical&#xD;
      change after DF treatment in forearm, wrist and hand area compared to placebo.&#xD;
