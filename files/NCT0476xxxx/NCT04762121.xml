  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IV placement is a common and necessary for surgical procedures. Unfortunately, pain&#xD;
      associated with needle catheterization experienced during peripheral IV placement is a source&#xD;
      anxiety and discomfort in many patients. The intensity of pain and distress caused by&#xD;
      procedures can vary from mild to moderate, but also may be severe in certain patients&#xD;
      resulting in numerous physiological, psychological, and emotional consequences. As such, the&#xD;
      investigators ultimately aim to evaluate the techniques that could make the placement of the&#xD;
      IV more comfortable.&#xD;

      As a preliminary study, the investigators are interested in conducting a prospective&#xD;
      observational study to collect baseline data to characterize and collect baseline data on&#xD;
      pain associated with needle catheterization in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many factors including size of needle, experience of the individual placing IV, previous&#xD;
      history of depression may vary the IV placement experience of a patient; however, only some&#xD;
      of these factors may directly affect the magnitude of pain experienced by a patient.&#xD;
      Currently, there is limited literature available on what factors affect the pain/satisfaction&#xD;
      patients experience with IV insertion. Soysal et al. have previously reported that depressed&#xD;
      patients reported higher severity of pain during IV catheter placement than non-depressed&#xD;
      patients in a cross-sectional, observational study (n= 925). The authors have also&#xD;
      demonstrated that age, sex, site of IV catheter insertion, use of antidepressant drugs, and&#xD;
      whether the individual placing the IV catheter is a nurse or physician do not affect the&#xD;
      magnitude of pain. Similarly, Van Loon et al have demonstrated that insertion of a smaller&#xD;
      sized peripheral intravenous catheter did not result in lower pain sensation. However, Galvin&#xD;
      et al. conducted a randomized clinical trial that demonstrated that the site of IV catheter&#xD;
      insertion makes a difference in the pain patients feel during IV catheter insertion.&#xD;
      Furthermore, no study exists that has investigated whether patients experience a different&#xD;
      magnitude of pain when different levels of physician trainees place the IV catheter. Also, no&#xD;
      study exists that compares whether peripheral IV cannulation with no pain relief method&#xD;
      versus intradermal lidocaine 1% injection versus intradermal lidocaine 2% injection versus&#xD;
      Buzzy® device affect the pain/satisfaction that patients experience with IV catheter&#xD;
      insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through the conduction of this study, the investigators hope to further evaluate which&#xD;
      factors and techniques affect the experience patients have with peripheral IV cannulation;&#xD;
      this knowledge could help the investigators figure out ways to make IV cannulation as&#xD;
      comfortable as possible for patients in the future.&#xD;
