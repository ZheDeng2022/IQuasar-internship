  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic recurrent intestinal inflammation involving the whole&#xD;
      digestive tract, with high disability rate, high surgical rate and high recurrent rate&#xD;
      postoperatively. Preventing postoperative recurrence in CD patients is an important clinical&#xD;
      problem needed urgent intervention. Azathioprine (AZA) and infliximab (IFX) effectively&#xD;
      prevent postoperative recurrence in CD patients, but the postoperative recurrence rate is&#xD;
      still as high as 41%. Oral supplement of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) owns the&#xD;
      advantages of high compliance and low economic cost. We aim to evaluate the effect of routine&#xD;
      treatment (AZA/IFX) combined with long-term dietary n-3PUFA on the prevention and treatment&#xD;
      of postoperative recurrence of CD, which help optimize the treatment strategy for the&#xD;
      prevention of postoperative recurrence.&#xD;

    <description>Ethyl polyenoate capsule is given as drug intervention. The main components are ethyl eicosapentaenoate (EPA-E) and ethyl docosahexaenoate (DHA-E), both of which will transform into ethyl eicosapentaenoate (EPA) and ethyl docosahexaenoate (DHA). Drug dose is 0.25 g EPA-E&amp;DHA-E; per capsule one at a time, Three times a day.</description>
