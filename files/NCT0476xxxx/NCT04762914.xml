  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim was to evaluate how prehabilitation (PH) can be incorporated into our colorectal&#xD;
      cancer pathway and assess its clinical benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients underwent PH (exercise, nutrition and psychological support) before resection of&#xD;
      colorectal carcinoma in a DGH over fourteen months. Patients were matched by operation, age,&#xD;
      sex and ASA to non-prehabilitation (NPH) patients using a prospectively maintained database.&#xD;
      Length of stay (LoS) and complication rate and 90-day readmission rates were compared using&#xD;
      Wilcoxon and McNemar's methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prehabilitation significantly improved peak VO2 and AT. This corresponds to a reduction in&#xD;
      predicted 30-day mortality. Despite a higher Charlson index LoS was unchanged suggesting&#xD;
      prehabilitation may permit safe resection in comorbid patients.&#xD;

        Consecutive patients over the age of 18 needing surgery were identified from clinics,&#xD;
        endoscopy or weekly multidisciplinary meetings (MDT). Patients who were clinically judged&#xD;
        to be frail or had multiple comorbidities were referred for prehabilitation prior to&#xD;
        resection. Those that underwent prehabilitation were matched using operation type, age, sex&#xD;
        and ASA with patients who did not have prehabilitation prior to resection. Surgery for all&#xD;
        patients was carried out within the context of an enhanced recovery programme.&#xD;
