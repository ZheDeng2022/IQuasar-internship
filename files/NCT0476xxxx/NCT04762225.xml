&#xD;
          1. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Written informed consent must be obtained prior to any study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Age â‰¥18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have one of the following histologically- or cytologically-confirmed,&#xD;

             disease must have progressed despite all appropriate curative or life-prolonging&#xD;
             treatments, unless they are intolerant to these therapies or have refused standard&#xD;
             treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Malignant melanoma for RPTR-168:1 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. HPV-16 E6/E7 positive tumors (Head &amp; Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma [HNSCC],&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Failure to respond to standard therapy, or for whom no appropriate therapies are&#xD;
             available (based on the judgment of the Investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. For melanoma patients, the definition of failure to respond an approved therapy&#xD;
                  for recurrent or metastatic disease is the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Tumor refractory to or progressing following prior PD-1 (programmed cell&#xD;
                       death protein 1)/PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) therapy alone or in&#xD;
                       combination with an anti-CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein&#xD;
                       4) agent unless the patient was deemed ineligible for such treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  If a subject is BRAF (v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B) V600E/K&#xD;
                       positive, they must have received an approved BRAF- targeted regimen prior&#xD;
                       to entering the study, unless the patient was deemed ineligible for such&#xD;
                       treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Prior adjuvant therapy cannot be used to define prior treatment failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. For head and neck cancer patients, the definition of failure to respond to&#xD;
                  standard therapy is tumor refractory to or progressing following approved first-&#xD;
                  and second-line therapy for metastatic or recurrent disease consisting of one or&#xD;

                       ineligible for such treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Prior adjuvant or neo-adjuvant therapy cannot be used to define prior&#xD;
                       treatment failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. For cervical cancer patients, the definition of failure to respond to an approved&#xD;
                  therapy for recurrent or metastatic disease is the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  For all patients: Tumor refractory to or progressing following prior&#xD;
                       treatment with a platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  For PD-1 expressing tumors: Tumor refractory to or progressing following&#xD;
                       prior PD-1/PD-L1 therapy alone or in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Able to provide a buccal swab to undergo human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing at a&#xD;
             central lab. The specific HLA types for inclusion in the study will be determined by&#xD;
             the Sponsor based on emerging data and will be updated on an ongoing basis. If&#xD;
             documented HLA results are available from a previous test, the patient can be enrolled&#xD;
             using these results after review and approval by the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. For patients undergoing screening to receive RPTR-168:2 therapy, patients must have&#xD;
             archival tumor tissue or be able to undergo a fresh tumor biopsy to submit tissue for&#xD;
             HPV testing, as well as profiling of DNA, RNA and proteins. HPV-16 E6/E7 positivity in&#xD;
             the patient's tumor tissue must be established using a validated clinical trial assay&#xD;
             performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)/College of American&#xD;
             Pathologists (CAP) accredited reference laboratory. If documented results of HPV-16&#xD;
             E6/E7 are available from a previous test, the patient can be enrolled using these&#xD;
             results after review and approval by the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient must have measurable disease per modified Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
             Solid Tumors (mRECIST) v 1.1 as determined by radiologic evaluations or tumor&#xD;
             assessments obtained within 2 months prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. If there are no pre-existing radiologic/tumor assessments within 2 months prior&#xD;
                  to study entry available, other evidence of measurable disease may be considered&#xD;
                  sufficient to fulfill this criterion following documented discussion with and&#xD;
                  approval from the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Please note, patients must have a radiological/tumor assessment per mRECIST v1.1&#xD;
                  within 28 days prior to receiving study therapy to serve as the patient's&#xD;
                  baseline tumor assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status â‰¤1.&#xD;

         10. Patient must be willing and able to provide a tumor tissue sample prior to the start&#xD;
             of study therapy and once during study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. For the pre-dose tumor sample, a fresh tumor biopsy obtained prior to the start&#xD;
                  of study therapy is preferred, but an archival sample (collected within â‰¤ 2&#xD;
                  months prior to the start of study therapy) may be submitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. For the on-treatment tumor sample, the patient must be willing and able to have a&#xD;
                  fresh tumor biopsy to collect tissue for submission.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Please refer to the full protocol (Section 7.2.4) for information on the collection&#xD;
             schedule and parameters. Additional details regarding tumor sample acquisition and&#xD;
             processing can be found in the study laboratory manual(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant, not&#xD;

             not pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. A male participant must agree to use contraception during the treatment period and for&#xD;
             at least 120 days after the last dose of study treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
         24. Prior therapy with PD-1/PD-L1, CTLA-4 or other immunomodulatory antibodies inhibitors&#xD;
             â‰¤2 weeks prior to the apheresis procedure.&#xD;

               1. Systemic cytotoxic agents that have major delayed toxicity, e.g. mitomycin C and&#xD;
                  nitrosoureas, â‰¤6 weeks prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Participants must have recovered from all AEs due to previous therapies to â‰¤Grade&#xD;
