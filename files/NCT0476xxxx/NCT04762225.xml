             treatments, unless they are intolerant to these therapies or have refused standard&#xD;
             treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Malignant melanoma for RPTR-168:1 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Able to provide a buccal swab to undergo human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing at a&#xD;
             central lab. The specific HLA types for inclusion in the study will be determined by&#xD;
             the Sponsor based on emerging data and will be updated on an ongoing basis. If&#xD;
             documented HLA results are available from a previous test, the patient can be enrolled&#xD;
             using these results after review and approval by the Sponsor.&#xD;

             HPV testing, as well as profiling of DNA, RNA and proteins. HPV-16 E6/E7 positivity in&#xD;
             the patient's tumor tissue must be established using a validated clinical trial assay&#xD;
             performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)/College of American&#xD;
             Pathologists (CAP) accredited reference laboratory. If documented results of HPV-16&#xD;
             E6/E7 are available from a previous test, the patient can be enrolled using these&#xD;
             results after review and approval by the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient must have measurable disease per modified Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
             Solid Tumors (mRECIST) v 1.1 as determined by radiologic evaluations or tumor&#xD;
             assessments obtained within 2 months prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. If there are no pre-existing radiologic/tumor assessments within 2 months prior&#xD;
                  to study entry available, other evidence of measurable disease may be considered&#xD;
                  sufficient to fulfill this criterion following documented discussion with and&#xD;
                  approval from the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Please note, patients must have a radiological/tumor assessment per mRECIST v1.1&#xD;
                  within 28 days prior to receiving study therapy to serve as the patient's&#xD;
                  baseline tumor assessment.&#xD;

             of study therapy and once during study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. For the pre-dose tumor sample, a fresh tumor biopsy obtained prior to the start&#xD;
                  of study therapy is preferred, but an archival sample (collected within ≤ 2&#xD;
                  months prior to the start of study therapy) may be submitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. For the on-treatment tumor sample, the patient must be willing and able to have a&#xD;
                  fresh tumor biopsy to collect tissue for submission.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Please refer to the full protocol (Section 7.2.4) for information on the collection&#xD;
             schedule and parameters. Additional details regarding tumor sample acquisition and&#xD;
             processing can be found in the study laboratory manual(s).&#xD;

             peripheral neuropathy, and ototoxicity, which are excluded if ≥ Grade 3[CTCAE v5.0])&#xD;
             due to prior cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Patients who were required to discontinue PD-1/PD-L1, CTLA-4, or other&#xD;
             immunomodulatory antibodies due to ≥Grade 3 immune-related adverse event (irAE) may be&#xD;
             included following discussion with the Sponsor.&#xD;

&#xD;
         22. Has undergone prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Patients with rapidly progressing disease that would preclude waiting 4-6 weeks after&#xD;
             apheresis to receive study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Prior therapy with PD-1/PD-L1, CTLA-4 or other immunomodulatory antibodies inhibitors&#xD;
             ≤2 weeks prior to the apheresis procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Systemic anti-cancer therapy within 5 half-lives or 2 weeks; whichever occurs first,&#xD;
             prior to the apheresis procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Systemic cytotoxic agents that have major delayed toxicity, e.g. mitomycin C and&#xD;
                  nitrosoureas, ≤6 weeks prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Participants must have recovered from all AEs due to previous therapies to ≤Grade&#xD;
                  1 or baseline. Participants with ≤Grade 2 neuropathy may be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the participant's&#xD;
