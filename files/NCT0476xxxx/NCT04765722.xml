  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cough is the most common presenting symptom to family physician. Chronic Cough affects&#xD;
      approximately 10-12% of the general population and is one of the commonest reasons for&#xD;
      referral to secondary care. Unfortunately, there are no licensed treatments for this&#xD;
      debilitating condition, which is associated with a poor quality of life, affecting the&#xD;
      social, physical and psychological well-being of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this single-centre proof-of-concept study is to investigate whether mepolizumab&#xD;
      reduces objective cough frequency in patients with eosinophilic asthma and non-asthmatic&#xD;
      eosinophilic bronchitis presenting with chronic cough. Secondary outcomes including the&#xD;
      effects on quality of life, the intensity of irritant sensations, airway hyper-reactivity and&#xD;
      inflammatory cells and their progenitors will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that in patients with asthma and non-asthmatic eosinophilic&#xD;
      bronchitis, eosinophils are involved in sensitizing airway nerves and thereby increasing&#xD;
      spontaneous objective coughs. The investigators predict that treatment with mepolizumab will&#xD;
      reduce airway eosinophilia in patients with chronic cough due to eosinophilic asthma and&#xD;
      non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, thereby causing a reduction in objective cough&#xD;
      frequency.&#xD;

      This is a 9-visit randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group Phase IV&#xD;
      study. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of mepolizumab for the&#xD;
      treatment of refractory chronic cough in patients with eosinophilic airway disease. Patients&#xD;
      will be recruited from secondary care clinics. Patient eligibility will be assessed against&#xD;
      the study inclusion/exclusion criteria and patients will undergo informed consent in the&#xD;
      research centre. Subjects who provide informed consent and are enrolled in the study will&#xD;
      undergo screening procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a Mepolizumab treatment arm and placebo arm (normal saline).&#xD;
      Fifteen subjects will be randomly assigned to the treatment arm and fifteen subjects will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the placebo arm in a 1:1 ratio. Following screening and randomization,&#xD;
      subjects will under an 12-week treatment period during which they will receive 4 doses of the&#xD;
      study drug at days 0, 28, 56, and 84. The primary study outcomes will be measured at week 14&#xD;
      week, 2 weeks following the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 1 (screening), subjects will undergo screening procedures: complete medical history,&#xD;
      physical examination, methacholine challenge, spirometry, sputum induction, and blood&#xD;
      sampling. Subjects will complete the Leicester Cough Questionnaire and modified Borg Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 2, subjects will be fitted with a 24-hour cough monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 3, 24-hour cough monitors will be removed and subjects will undergo spirometry,&#xD;
      blood sampling and sputum induction. Subjects will complete the Leicester Cough&#xD;
      Questionnaire, modified Borg Scale, and Cough Severity Visual Analogue Scale. The first dose&#xD;
      of the study drug will be administered in the clinical research facility by a study&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 4, subjects will undergo spirometry and blood sampling and complete the Leicester&#xD;
      Cough Questionnaire, modified Borg Scale, and Cough Severity Visual Analogue Scale. The&#xD;
      second dose of the study drug will be administered in the clinical research facility by a&#xD;
      study physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 5, the third dose of the study drug will be administered in the clinical research&#xD;
      facility by a study physician. Subjects will be fitted with a 24-hour cough monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 6, 24-hour cough monitors will be removed and subjects will undergo spirometry,&#xD;
      sputum induction and blood sampling and complete the Leicester Cough Questionnaire, modified&#xD;
      Borg Scale, and Cough Severity Visual Analogue Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 7, subjects will undergo spirometry and blood sampling and complete the Leicester&#xD;
      Cough Questionnaire, modified Borg Scale, and Cough Severity Visual Analogue Scale. The&#xD;
      fourth dose of the study drug will be administered in the clinical research facility by a&#xD;
      study physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 8, subjects will be fitted with a 24-hour cough monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 9, the 24-hour cough monitors will be removed and subjects will undergo spirometry,&#xD;
      methacholine challenge, sputum induction, and blood sampling. Subjects will complete the&#xD;
      Leicester Cough Questionnaire, modified Borg Scale, and Cough Severity Visual Analogue Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study procedures will be performed according to local standard operating procedures and&#xD;
      be conducted by trained and experienced staff with supervision by medical doctors. Study&#xD;
      physicians will administer all study drug injections. Safety will be assessed throughout the&#xD;
      study by monitoring for adverse events and serious adverse events.&#xD;

The study will have 2 arms, each with 15 participants, and a total of 9 visits per subject. Subjects will be screened and within 2 weeks randomized to the intervention (mepolizumab) or placebo arm. Subjects will receive the intervention over a 12 week period at visits 3, 4, 5, and 7. The primary outcome will be measured at visit 14 which will occur 2 weeks after the final intervention dose.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Subjects will be assigned to one of the two possible treatment arms generated by a computer-generated randomization schedule prepared by McMaster University, with a ratio of 1:1, mepolizumab or placebo. As there is a known imbalance in the prevalence and cough rates, the study will include sex as a randomization factor. This will mitigate the possibility of the intervention being confounded by sex differences in the 2 arms of the study. Blinded study drug supplies will be provided in sequentially numbered identical syringes in accordance with the randomization schedule and dispensed by a pharmacist who shall not be delegated any other role in the study. Subjects, investigators, research staff (with the exception of the pharmacist) and the sponsor will be masked to the treatment sequence assignment. A sealed code-break envelope for each subject containing details of the treatment allocated will be kept in a locked safe at the study site.</masking_description>

         25. Use of immunosuppressive medication (including but not limited to: methotrexate,&#xD;
             cyclosporine, azathioprine, intramuscular long-acting depot corticosteroid, oral&#xD;
             corticosteroid, or any experimental anti-inflammatory therapy) within 3 months prior&#xD;
             to the date informed consent is obtained&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. Use of any other biological within 4 months or 5 half-lives prior to randomization,&#xD;
             whichever is longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
         27. Any centrally acting medication within the last 2 weeks which in the view of the&#xD;
             investigator could influence the coughing (Any participant who is taking&#xD;
             amitriptyline, dextromethorphan, pregabalin, gabapentin or opioids will not be&#xD;
             eligible to take part in this study unless they are willing and medically able to&#xD;
             withdraw from such medication for the duration of the study. The reason for this is&#xD;
             that centrally acting medications may influence coughing rates.)&#xD;
&#xD;
         28. History of psychiatric illness, drug or alcohol abuse which may interfere in the&#xD;
             participation of the trial.&#xD;
