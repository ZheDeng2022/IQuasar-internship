  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this international, randomized, parallel arms, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial is to investigate the safety and efficacy of a combination of the two&#xD;
      Lactobacillus strains (NZ-GHMH-01) on glucose and insulin metabolism, in prediabetic&#xD;
      subjects. This trial will include prediabetic (insulin resistant) subjects with excessive&#xD;
      body weight (over-weight or obese, showing abdominal or visceral obesity) to be able to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of the probiotic NZ-GHMH-01 on glycaemic control.&#xD;
