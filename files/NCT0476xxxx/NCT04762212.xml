  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of a mobilization with movement (MWM)&#xD;
      technique performed by a physical therapist with those of a dynamic stretch with over&#xD;
      pressure on active hip flexion range of motion (ROM) in those with active hip flexion ROM&#xD;
      limitations. There is limited evidence available in the literature examining the therapeutic&#xD;
      effects of MWM at the hip, the long term effects of MWM, or whether one modality is more&#xD;
      effective than another. This study seeks to address these gaps in the literature by directly&#xD;
      comparing the results of these two manual therapy interventions on active hip flexion ROM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the effects of a therapist-performed mobilization with movement&#xD;
      (MWM) technique with those of a dynamic stretch with over pressure on active hip flexion&#xD;
      range of motion (ROM) in those with active hip flexion ROM limitations.Those individuals from&#xD;
      the University of South Carolina's Department of Physical Therapy (UofSC DPT) community who&#xD;
      are interested in becoming study participants will be identified by means of announcements&#xD;
      made in the Seminar in Physical Therapy course which is attended by all students, faculty,&#xD;
      and staff of UofSC DPT each week. Interested individuals will be provided with Cathy Arnot's&#xD;
      email address in order to schedule an evaluation session to determine whether or not they&#xD;
      meet the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria. In addition, Sarah Cooper will attend a&#xD;
      staff meeting at Vertex PT Specialists to make an announcement and provide the attendees with&#xD;
      Cathy Arnot's email for inquiries. Participants will be assigned to either the MWM group or&#xD;
      the dynamic stretch with over pressure group via blocked randomization for sex and age, with&#xD;
      at least seventeen participants being placed into each group. The MWM group participants will&#xD;
      receive a therapist-performed MWM technique and a prescription for a home exercise program&#xD;
      (HEP) consisting of a dynamic stretch with over pressure to be performed once a day over the&#xD;
      course of the following week. The dynamic stretch with over pressure group participants will&#xD;
      receive only the prescription for the HEP consisting of the dynamic stretch with over&#xD;
      pressure to be performed once a day over the following week. Measurements will be assessed at&#xD;
      four time points: Immediately before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, 24&#xD;
      hours after the intervention, and one week after the intervention.&#xD;
