  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis is the most common inflammatory disease of the central nervous system and&#xD;
      a common cause of disability in young adults. Depleting B cells from the circulation with an&#xD;
      anti-cluster of differentiation (CD) 20 antibodies has proven to be an effective strategy in&#xD;
      reducing relapses and disability in patients with the relapsing-remitting disease. However,&#xD;
      continuous and long-term depletion of B-cells can result in reduced immunoglobulin levels,&#xD;
      immunosuppression, and an increased tendency for severe infections and perhaps, even&#xD;
      malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blocking B-cell Activating Factor (BAFF) is effective for the treatment of several autoimmune&#xD;
      disorders. Belimumab, a BAFF blocking antibody, has been approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus. Belimumab has been shown to&#xD;
      have immunomodulatory properties, without resulting in overt immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that belimumab, given to patients who received a short course&#xD;
      of treatment with B-cell depleting antibody (ocrelizumab), will be safe and equally effective&#xD;
      in reducing MS disease activity (as compared to patients receiving continuous treatment with&#xD;
      ocrelizumab); while resulting in less immunosuppression, as measured by antibody response to&#xD;
      pneumococcal vaccination. Currently, available treatment strategies in relapsing MS sacrifice&#xD;
      higher efficacy for long-term safety or vice versa. The proposed strategy in this application&#xD;
      combines the long-term safety and high efficacy to treat patients with relapsing-remitting&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and, if eventually proven effective, can be adopted in a large&#xD;
      proportion of patients with this chronic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, open-labeled trial. Forty eligible participants will be randomized 1:1&#xD;
      to either receiving a form of standard of care, ocrelizumab (300 mg two infusions two weeks&#xD;
      apart at baseline and then 600 mg as a single infusion every six months) or belimumab (200 mg&#xD;
      subcutaneous (SC) weekly for 36 months) plus two courses of ocrelizumab (300 mg two infusions&#xD;
      two weeks apart at baseline and 600 mg as a single infusion six months later). Co-primary&#xD;
      outcomes of the study include pneumococcal vaccine antibody response, the return of MS&#xD;
      disease activity, and proportions of patients with adverse events and serious adverse events.&#xD;
