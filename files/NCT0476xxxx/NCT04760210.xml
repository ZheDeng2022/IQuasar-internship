      Decompression therapy is a result-oriented approach but it expensive and minimum availability&#xD;
      in Pakistan. In physical therapy, we use different exercises to solve multiple spine&#xD;
      problems. Some exercises used to treat orthogenic components such as mobilization,&#xD;
      manipulation, SNAGS, and traction. Some exercises used to treat myogenic components such as&#xD;
      muscle energy technique, neuromuscular reeducation, active isolated stretch, etc. Some&#xD;
      exercises used to treat neurogenic components such as Neurodynamics, Active release&#xD;
      technique, etc. As we know the fascia is an important component in our body most of the time&#xD;
      the fascia restriction makes the patient condition verse. A researcher introduced the systems&#xD;
      of exercise more the 35 years ago which works especially on the spine at every intervertebral&#xD;
      level including costal and pelvic articulation. These exercises are called Elongation&#xD;
      Longitudinaux Avec Decoaption Osteo-Articulaire (ELDOA) or simply Longitudinal&#xD;
      Osteo-Articular De-coaptation Stretching (LOADS). It can be described as a fascial stretch&#xD;
      that's localized tension at the level of a specific spinal segment and create decompression.&#xD;
      In which he combined improving the tone of the intrinsic muscles of the spine along with&#xD;
      reinforcing the extrinsic muscles related to the spine aim the back and stretching the&#xD;
      interlinking paraspinal muscles. ELDOA exercise is designed for every level of the spine from&#xD;
      the base of the skull to the sacroiliac joint. In each ELDOA exercise, we create fascial&#xD;
      tension above and below the joint or disc that one is trying to &quot;open up&quot; or decompress. The&#xD;
      outcomes include; Release vertebral compression, improved blood circulation, Disc&#xD;
      re-hydration, improve muscle tone, and awareness. One of my studies also proved that ELDOA&#xD;
      Exercises improve the pain and functional level in spinal disc protrusion patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is the common problem of our society, 80% of people experience back pain at&#xD;
      some stage of their life. Low Back pain lifetime prevalence is 65% to 80% and It is estimated&#xD;
      that 28% experience disabling low back pain sometime during their lives. Point prevalence&#xD;
      ranged from 12% to 33%, the 1-year prevalence ranged from 22% to 65%, and lifetime prevalence&#xD;
      ranged from 11% to 84%. Back pain peak prevalence age is 40-50, First episode of start in the&#xD;
      '20s and recurrence rates between 39-71%. Women tend to be affected more in cervical spine&#xD;
      problems than men and men tend to more affected in lumbar spine problems than women. The&#xD;
      majority (80-90%) of low back disorders occur at the L4/5 and/or L5/S1. The occupational risk&#xD;
      factor include driving (P&lt;0.001), lifting, carrying, pulling, pushing, and twisting (P&lt;0.001&#xD;
      for all variables) as well as nondriving vibrational exposure (P&lt;0.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maitland divides lumbar spine problems into two groups, in the first group the L4/5 and L5/S1&#xD;
      intervertebral discs are frequently a source of symptoms and the second group has postural,&#xD;
      muscle balance, muscle weakness, muscles spasm degenerative changes, and mechanical movement&#xD;
      disorders problems. The L5-S1 Segment is the most common site of problem in the spine because&#xD;
      this level bears more weight, Center of gravity passes directly through this vertebra,&#xD;
      transition L5 Mobile and S1 Stable, Large angle B/w L5 &amp; S1 and a great amount of movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervertebral disk makes up 1/3 of the total length of the vertebral column. The disc&#xD;
      contains 85% to 90% of water, but the amount decreases up to 65% with age. The water-binding&#xD;
      capacity of the disc decrease with age and degenerative changes begin to occur after 2nd&#xD;
      decade of life. The Facet joint carries 20-25% axial body load but this may reach 70% with&#xD;
      degeneration of the Disc. The most significant biochemical change to occur in disc&#xD;
      degeneration is the loss of proteoglycan. This loss is responsible for a fall in the osmotic&#xD;
      pressure of the disc matrix and therefore a loss of hydration. Loading may thus lead to&#xD;
      inappropriate stress concentrations along the endplate or in the annulus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT Classification of Annular Tears There are five possible severities of the radial annular&#xD;
      tear as seen on an axial CT image.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The grade 0 is a normal disc, where no contrast material injected in the center of the&#xD;
           disc has leaked from the confines of the nucleus pulposus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The grade 1 tear has leaked contrast material but only into the inner one-third of the&#xD;
           annulus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the grade 2 tear, the contrast has leaked from the nucleus into the outer two-thirds&#xD;
           of the annulus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The grade 3 tear has leaked contrast completely through all three zones of the annulus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The grade 4 tear the contrast has spread circumferentially around the disc, often&#xD;
           resembling a ship's anchor. Pathologically, this represents the merging of a&#xD;
           full-thickness radial tear with a concentric annular tear.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The grade 5 tear completely ruptured the outer layers of the disc and is leaking&#xD;
           contrast material from the disc into the epidural space. This type of tear is thought to&#xD;
           have the ability to induce a severe inflammatory reaction in the adjacent neural&#xD;
           structures. In some patients, this inflammatory process is so severe that it causes&#xD;
           painful chemical radiculopathy and sciatica without the presence of nerve root&#xD;
           compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-back pain with leg pain may be caused by a herniated intervertebral disc exerting&#xD;
      pressure on the nerve root. Most patients will respond to conservative treatment, but in&#xD;
      carefully selected patients, a surgical discectomy may provide faster relief of symptoms. The&#xD;
      Patient's history and physical examination along with MRI confirm the disc herniation&#xD;
      diagnosis. In the case of spinal disc herniation, the management is Surgical and&#xD;
      conservative. In surgery, we have percutaneous procedures such as chymopapain injections,&#xD;
      Annuloplasty, Percutaneous disc decompression, and Endoscopic percutaneous discectomy and&#xD;
      Open Surgery such as Laminectomy, Discectomy/Microdiscectomy, Artificial disc surgery, and&#xD;
      Spinal fusion. The Conservative Management includes Oral Analgesic, Gentle traction, Spinal&#xD;
      Decompression, Spinal Stabilization, Exercise, and Fascia Stretching (ELDOA).&#xD;
