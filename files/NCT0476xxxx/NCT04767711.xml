  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glucocorticoid (GC) therapy is used to treat a variety of inflammatory conditions such as&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, bronchial asthma, allergies, ankylosing&#xD;
      spondylitis and some forms of cancers. Despite the well-known side-effects, GC treatment is&#xD;
      widely used. Oral GC therapy leads to a rapid and profound effects on bone metabolism, with&#xD;
      increased osteoblast apoptosis and prolonged osteoclast survival, which increases bone&#xD;
      resorption, resulting in bone loss, and a subsequent increased fracture risk. Within days of&#xD;
      high dose oral GC, glucose tolerance decreases and bone turnover is shifted in favour of less&#xD;
      bone formation and increased bone resorption. Bone formation and bone resorption can be&#xD;
      estimated by measuring serum bone turnover markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gut microbiota is involved in regulating bone metabolism and recently it was demonstrated&#xD;
      that Lactobacillus reuteri 6475 (LR) could reduce bone loss over 12 months by half in older&#xD;
      women. In a recent experimental study, it was discovered that mice treated either with broad&#xD;
      spectrum antibiotics, eradicating gut microbiota, or with LR did not experience GC induced&#xD;
      bone loss in the spine and femur. L. reuteri has been widely studied in clinical trials and&#xD;
      has been shown to have probiotic, health-promoting effects in both adults and children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this planned randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is to investigate&#xD;
      if daily supplementation with LR, compared to placebo, can prevent the negative effects of&#xD;
      oral glucocorticoid (GC) on bone turnover and on blood glucose regulation in healthy young&#xD;
      adult men and women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If LR is able to prevent deleterious side effects, such as bone loss and impaired glucose&#xD;
      tolerance, of oral GC treatment, the probiotic could potentially be recommended and used to&#xD;
      improve health in a substantial yearly number of patients treated with GC.&#xD;

      By advertising in newspapers, in shops, health clubs, in public places and on social media&#xD;
      platforms, and by contacting interested persons (by mail and phone) identified publicly&#xD;
      available websites (e.g. www.ratsit.se), 45 young, healthy men and women will be recruited,&#xD;
      to participate in the study. Study subjects will be contacted by phone and receive more&#xD;
      information regarding the study and undergo a preliminary evaluation about eligibility to&#xD;
      participate. A detailed study information will be sent by mail to study subjects. At the&#xD;
      screening visit, participants will receive information about the study verbally, and if the&#xD;
      participant sign the informed consent form, the participant undergo a test of fasting blood&#xD;
      glucose, HbA1c, and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). A standardized self-reported&#xD;
      questionnaire will be used to collect information at the screening visit about smoking&#xD;
      habits, calcium intake, medical history, medications, previous fractures, physical activity&#xD;
      and diet habits. Eligible participants is then invited for the randomisation visit. At the&#xD;
      randomisation visit the study subjects will be asked to refrain from physical exercise, other&#xD;
      than walking, and keep an unchanged normal diet during the study period. Randomization will&#xD;
      be carried out by the supplier of LR (BioGaiaAB). The investigators will not have access to&#xD;
      the randomization code and blinding will be maintained until study end and database lock.&#xD;
      After randomization, study participants will consume either LR low dose, LR high dose or&#xD;
      placebo for 30 days. After the 14-day run-in period, all participants will start taking 25 mg&#xD;
      of oral prednisolone every morning for 7 days. At the 14-day visit, a 24-hour glucose&#xD;
      monitoring for the following 10 days will be started. At the next visit on day 16, fasting&#xD;
      blood samples will be drawn in the morning (7-9 am), feces samples provided (within 24 hours&#xD;
      of collection) and participants will start the oral GC treatment on that visit after blood&#xD;
      samples have been drawn. At the 19-, 23- and 30-day visits, blood samples will be drawn in&#xD;
      the morning (7-9 am for all visits, prior to taking the GC dose on the 19-day visit). Feces&#xD;
      samples will also be collected at these visits. Included participants will be asked to come&#xD;
      to the clinic and report compliance and possible adverse events during the duration of the&#xD;
      study and at all visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standardized questionnaire will be used to collect information at the screening visit about&#xD;
      smoking habits, calcium intake, medical history (e.g. stroke, rheumatoid arthritis and&#xD;
      diabetes), medications and previous fractures. Current physical activity and diet habits will&#xD;
      be assessed by self-reported questionnaires (IPAQ and FFQ) at baseline. Daily intake of&#xD;
      calcium will be calculated from the questionnaires about calcium-containing foods (e.g. dairy&#xD;
      products, vegetables etc). Gastrointestinal symptoms will be analysed using the GSRS&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum, plasma and stool analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum and plasma will be collected in the morning (fasting), frozen, and stored at -80° C&#xD;
      until further analyses. Samples from day 16 will be drawn prior to oral GC treatment start. A&#xD;
      maximum of 30 ml blood will be collected at each visit. Fasting blood glucose will be&#xD;
      analysed using fresh blood at screening (with the addition of HbA1c at screening), and days&#xD;
      16 (GC start), 19, 23 and 30. Serum and plasma samples will be frozen immediately and kept&#xD;
      until analysis. Analyses of serum or plasma and bone markers (osteocalcin, P1NP and CTX) will&#xD;
      be performed using commercially available immunosorbent assays. Stool samples will be&#xD;
      collected within 24 hours since produced and stored in -80oC until further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the screening visit, a morning fasting blood glucose will be measured, followed by&#xD;
      ingestion of 24 cl of glucose syrup, containing 75 grams of sugar. After 2 hours another&#xD;
      blood glucose measurement will be performed. Inclusion of the study will depend on having a&#xD;
      normal fasting blood glucose (≤6 mmol/l) and OGTT (&lt;7.8 mmol/l).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Markers of intestinal permeability and intestinal inflammation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses of markers for intestinal permeability (endotoxin analysis, PyroGeneTM Recombinant&#xD;
      Factor C Endpoint Fluorescent Assay) will be performed using a fluorescent assay at day 16,&#xD;
      day 19, and day 23. Markers of intestinal inflammation (lipocalin-2 and calprotectin) will&#xD;
      also be analyzed in feces and serum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses of gut microbiota - exploratory analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA from feces samples will be isolated using a well-validated protocol and perform PCR to&#xD;
      amplify the variable regions (V4) of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene using barcoded primers.&#xD;
      Metagenome analyses of all samples will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous glucose monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      On study day 14, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) will be started, allowing a 48-hour&#xD;
      observation period prior to commencement of oral prednisolone dosing. CGM will be used from&#xD;
      day 14 until prednisolone treatment cessation on day 23. The Dexcom G6 system will be used&#xD;
      for CGM on all participants.&#xD;
