  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The TZ-DLB trial will be a 3:2 (active:placebo) randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      Pilot trial to evaluate the tolerability of terazosin for the treatment of dementia with Lewy&#xD;
      bodies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot study to&#xD;
      assess the tolerability of terazosin (TZ) at 1 and 5 milligrams (MG) daily for patients with&#xD;
      DLB. The primary goal of this study is to assess the tolerability of TZ in patients with DLB.&#xD;
      This is a pilot study and is not powered to assess efficacy of this medication. Our hope is&#xD;
      that this study will guide future studies of this (and similar) medications for the disease&#xD;
      modification of DLB. This study is also aimed to learn more about how patients with produce&#xD;
      and use energy and if TZ can help to reverse energy deficits that appear in DLB.&#xD;
