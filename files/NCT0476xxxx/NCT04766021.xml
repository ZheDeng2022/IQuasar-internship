  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many Navy diving operations are performed in cold water. Despite technical advances to&#xD;
      improve thermal protection for cold water diving, these applications are cumbersome and do&#xD;
      not provide complete thermal protection as thermal discomfort is subjectively reported by&#xD;
      many Navy divers. Brown adipose tissue is highly thermogenic in humans. Therefore, activation&#xD;
      of brown adipose tissue might improve cold water tolerance and lower thermal discomfort&#xD;
      during cold water diving operations. Mirabegron is a beta-3-adrenergic receptor agonist that&#xD;
      is used to treat overactive bladder. Beta-3-adrenergic receptors are located on the urinary&#xD;
      bladder, gallbladder and brown adipose tissue. Recent evidence has demonstrated that acute&#xD;
      mirabegron administration increases thermogenesis for ~3 hours in humans. However, it is&#xD;
      currently not known which dose of mirabegron can increase thermogenesis for longer durations.&#xD;
      It is also not known if mirabegron administration can improve cold water tolerance and&#xD;
      thermal discomfort during cold water immersion. Finally, it is not known if mirabegron can&#xD;
      increase thermogenesis during sympathetic stimulation. This project will fill these knowledge&#xD;
      gaps by addressing these specific aims: 1) determine which dose of mirabegron administration&#xD;
      will increase thermogenesis during 6 hours of a mild cold stress challenge, 2) determine if&#xD;
      acute mirabegron administration will delay the fall in core temperature and the onset of&#xD;
      shivering during a progressive cold-water immersion challenge, and 3) compare the dose of&#xD;
      isoproterenol required to evoke a thermogenic response equal to a 15% increase above rest,&#xD;
      following ingestion of either mirabegron or a placebo. In addition to filling these knowledge&#xD;
      gaps, the activation of brown adipose tissue by mirabegron might be influenced by the gut&#xD;
      microbiome. Therefore, the association between the gut microbiome and mirabegron metabolism&#xD;
      will be explored. Collectively, these studies will show if mirabegron is a potential&#xD;
      ergogenic aid that can be used to improve cold water tolerance in Navy divers which will&#xD;
      ultimately improve the likelihood of successful missions.&#xD;
