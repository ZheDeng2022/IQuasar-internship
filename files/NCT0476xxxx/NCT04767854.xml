  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is among the most prevalent and costly diseases, with an estimate of $460&#xD;
      billion in all-cause medical costs. It causes pain and reduced physical function, and with no&#xD;
      existing cure, the recommended first-line treatment is information, exercise and weight&#xD;
      management if indicated. As the prevalence of OA is expected to increase in the coming years,&#xD;
      exploring innovative solutions to maintain economical sustainable treatment in the future&#xD;
      becomes a necessity. Telerehabilitation, technology which involves providing treatment&#xD;
      through information and communication technology, regardless of the patient's geographical&#xD;
      location, has shown its potential within cardiac, pulmonary, neurological and musculoskeletal&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual Training (VT) is a generic mobile health application used to deliver digital home&#xD;
      exercise programs with text, audio and video support. Through a novel feedback system the&#xD;
      therapist is able monitor the patients progress and pain level during exercise. This project&#xD;
      aims to investigate, through a randomized controlled trial (RCT), whether the use of the&#xD;
      VT-app is as effective as supervised exercise therapy in improving pain, physical function&#xD;
      and disease activity in patients with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators want to investigate if the use of the app is more cost effective than&#xD;
      supervised exercise therapy, whether the use increases adherence with first line treatment,&#xD;
      and whether there are certain characteristics of the patients responding to the intervention.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a two-armed non-inferiority randomized controlled trial (RCT) situated in the&#xD;
      primary care setting in Norway. Participants diagnosed with hip and/or knee OA will be&#xD;
      randomized to either exercise therapy via app or usual care. Patients aged 18 years and older&#xD;
      presenting with activity-related hip and/or knee pain/complaints and clinical signs and&#xD;
      symptoms corresponding to hip and/or knee OA seeking treatment at physiotherapist working in&#xD;
      private practice, will be included if eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is exercise therapy, delivered through a mobile health application (Virtual Training),&#xD;
           as effective as supervised exercise therapy in patients with hip and/or knee OA,&#xD;
           measured by number of patients classified as responders according to the OMERACT-OARSI&#xD;
           responder criteria?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is exercise therapy delivered through Virtual Training more cost-effective regarding&#xD;
           health care and medication use than supervised exercise therapy for patients with hip&#xD;
           and/or knee OA?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Will patients with hip and/or knee OA, using Virtual Training, be more adherent to&#xD;
           exercise during the intervention period compared to patients undergoing supervised&#xD;
           exercise therapy, and are there any demographic or clinical factors characterizing the&#xD;
           OMERACT-OARSI responding patients using Virtual Training?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis by comparing the&#xD;
      proportion of responders at 6 weeks and 3 months post-intervention according to the&#xD;
      OMERACT-OARSI responder criteria in the intervention and the control group using logistic&#xD;
      regression analysis. Per-protocol analyses will also be conducted. Difference in secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will be assessed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) on the post-intervention&#xD;
      values, with baseline values as covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-effectiveness will be evaluated assessing the difference in health care and medication&#xD;
      use and quality of life during 3-month follow-up, reporting the incremental&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) reflecting the between-group difference in incremental cost&#xD;
      per adjusted life years (QALYs). Between-group difference in adherence to exercise will be&#xD;
      assessed using linear regression, while patient characteristics in the intervention group&#xD;
      will be assessed using logistic regression. Additional analyses assessing associations&#xD;
      between physical activity, efficacy, barriers for exercise and OA-related questions will also&#xD;
      be assessed in secondary analyses.&#xD;

    <description>After a clinical examination by the physiotherapist, all patients will receive a 1-2-hour group session of patient education according to guidelines.&#xD;
The intervention group will receive an individually tailored exercise program through the Virtual Training mobile health application. After each exercise the patient score his/her execution of the exercise on a Likert-scale of 1 to 5, judging their effort from very poor to very good. After the session, patients rate their pain on a Numeric Rating Scale from 0 to 10. The patients in the intervention group will be instructed to exercise 3 times per week for 6 weeks. If the patients want to exercise more than 3 times per week, the exercise program will be available in the app once every day.</description>
