      The aim of this study is to assess the trend of clinicopathological features and treatment&#xD;
      modalities in patients with thyroid cancer (TC) in the largest oncology center in the United&#xD;
      Arab Emirates (UAE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was conducted in Tawam hospital (TWM), which provides tertiary care services to&#xD;
      patients in the UAE. It is the only center delivering radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy and&#xD;
      radiotherapy in Al Ain city. Most TC patients are followed in designated TC clinics within&#xD;
      the endocrinology division or less commonly through other clinics (surgery, radiation, or&#xD;
      medical oncology). The hospital runs monthly multidisciplinary team-based discussions on&#xD;
      patients with TC, wherein decisions regarding RAI treatment and dose selection are determined&#xD;
      jointly by nuclear medicine physicians and endocrinologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We retrospectively evaluated all patients with TC presenting to TWM during the period of&#xD;
      September 2008 and December 2018. The beginning of data collection (September 2008) reflects&#xD;
      the inception time of electronic medical records (EMRs) use in the hospital. Cases of TC were&#xD;
      extracted from the EMRs using the International Classification of Disease 9 &amp; 10 codes (193 &amp;&#xD;
      c73). Other variables were demographic information, year of diagnosis, type of TC,&#xD;
      histopathological subtype, lymph node (LN) involvement, type of thyroid surgery, use of RAI&#xD;
      treatment, and radiation therapy. The extent of surgery, the exact details of histopathology,&#xD;
      and the RAI dose were retrieved from the respective specialty reports. Tumor staging was&#xD;
      reported according to the 8th edition of the American joint committee on cancer (AJCC)/TNM&#xD;
      staging system [16]. Those with incorrect pathological diagnosis, incomplete data, or&#xD;
      noninvasive follicular type PTC were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data were extracted using Microsoft Excel 2015 and imported into Stata 16.0 for&#xD;
      statistical analysis. Continuous variables were described using means and standard deviations&#xD;
      (Â±SD). Categorical variables were described as frequency distributions. Variables of clinical&#xD;
      features and management were cross tabulated with the year of diagnosis and exact logistic&#xD;
      and ordinal logistic regressions were performed to analyze the annual trend in features and&#xD;
      management of TC as appropriate. The results of relative trend were reported as odds ratio&#xD;
      (OR) with an overall ptrend. The OR=1 indicated no change over years, OR &lt;1 indicated a&#xD;
      decline, while OR &gt;1 indicated an increase over years. Simple and multiple logistic&#xD;
      regression analysis were performed to assess the unadjusted and adjusted association of&#xD;
      management of TC (RAI, surgical management) with age, gender, nationality, year of diagnosis,&#xD;
      tumor subtype, and other co-variates. The results of simple and multiple logistic regression&#xD;
      were reported as odd ratios (OR) and adjusted odds ratios (AOR) respectively with their&#xD;
      corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) and p-values.&#xD;
