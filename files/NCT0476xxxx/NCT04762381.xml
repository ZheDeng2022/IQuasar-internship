  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Robotic-assisted hysterectomy is an alternative to laparoscopic surgery as part of a minimal&#xD;
      invasive regimen. Several treatment strategies are followed to improve the overall outcome&#xD;
      and minimize surgical stress. Glucocorticoids provide significant analgesic and antiemetic&#xD;
      effects but its role in a fast-track, multi-modal setting is not settled when discharge is&#xD;
      planned within 24-36 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate in a randomized trial the effect of a single dose of 24 mg&#xD;
      dexamethasone on women undergoing robotic-assisted hysterectomy with regard to surgical&#xD;
      stress measured by c-reactive protein as primary outcome and, further, other stress markers&#xD;
      like white blood cells, Il-6, cortisol, and creatinine kinase. The postoperative recovery&#xD;
      will be registered in validated charts and questionnaires for pain and analgesic use, quality&#xD;
      of recovery, incontinence, sexual and work life. Furthermore, in a sub-analysis,&#xD;
      transcriptional profiling will be applied to explore, which parts of the innate and cellular&#xD;
      immune system is activated to explore the mechanisms of surgical stress response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that women undergoing robotic hysterectomy would benefit from peroperative&#xD;
      glucocorticoid treatment on important life qualities like pain, fatigue, freedom of&#xD;
      medications and resuming work and sexual activities. Further, future adjuvant peroperative&#xD;
      regimens may be able to target the stress response in a more appropriate way&#xD;

      Background Robotic operations in gynecology is one of the fastest growing fields in applied&#xD;
      robotic technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Denmark 4000 hysterectomies are performed each year on benign indications and minimal&#xD;
      invasive techniques has risen from 35 to 80%. These operations consist of vaginal,&#xD;
      laparoscopic assisted und the latest robotic assisted hysterectomy. The robotic surgical&#xD;
      system DaVinci was introduced in 2000 and, by 2016, 3803 robot units were established all&#xD;
      over the world and 644 of these were in Europe. Hysterectomy and prostate operations are the&#xD;
      most common robotic assisted operations as an alternative to conventional laparoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Robotic surgery on benign indications in gynecology is still a discussion on the cost vs.&#xD;
      benefit due to increased cost and lack of evidence on superiority in surgical outcome&#xD;
      compared to conventional laparoscopy. For minimal invasive surgery is but a part of a complex&#xD;
      series of treatment in a strategy, the so-called multi-modal regimen (1-7,16). By this, the&#xD;
      day of discharge has dramatically decreased without compromising safety during surgery and&#xD;
      postoperative recovery. However, not all single elements are proven for efficacy, let alone&#xD;
      the specific targets for effect (16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further improve the overall outcome of surgery the surgical stress response are&#xD;
      investigated, which includes inflammatory components and are of importance of postoperative&#xD;
      pain and recovery (8,9,16). Here amongst others, glucocorticoids have proven to relieve pain&#xD;
      in a number of procedures, applied in general surgery on colon, gallbladder, and breast, in&#xD;
      orthopedic surgery on knee and breast surgery, and in gynecology, too, in laparoscopic&#xD;
      hysterectomy (1-10,15,16). The dose of steroid to provide significant analgesic effect is, at&#xD;
      least, dexamethasone of 0.1-0.2 mg/kg or 15 mg, which is substantiated in some reduction in&#xD;
      inflammatory response (7,15,16). Glucocorticoids are known for analgesic, opioid-sparing and&#xD;
      antiemetic effects but procedure-specific outcome are lacking. Similarly, the specific&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and sites of surgical stress-related responses are not well elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The PhD study evaluate the effects of a single dose of steroid on acute postoperative&#xD;
      stress response and pain after hysterectomy. The evaluation is on clinical relevant outcome&#xD;
      that directly benefit the patients. We will measure surgical stress by c-reactive protein and&#xD;
      other inflammatory markers based on transcriptional profiling, register pain and medication&#xD;
      needed during hospital stay and after discharge, and when work and sexual function could be&#xD;
      resumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome The primary endpoint is reduction of postoperative c-reactive protein (crp) after&#xD;
      robotic hysterectomy as an objective measurement of the stress amelioration by the given&#xD;
      steroid. The rise postoperatively will be ascertained by two baseline measurements and every&#xD;
      4-6 hours after operation as long as the women is not discharged. The crp is not expected to&#xD;
      be dependent on each operation team eagerness to perform well or the postoperative care to&#xD;
      reach certain standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As secondary outcome we register pain scores from baseline to 24 h and later on, the&#xD;
      postoperative analgesics medication from baseline to discharge and later on, quality of&#xD;
      recovery (QoR-15D) in the latest 24 hours (12). Further, after discharge incontinence&#xD;
      (ICIQ-UI), start of sexual life (PISQ-12/31), inflammatory markers, and resumption to&#xD;
      recreational and work life will be ascertained in a diary. The baseline and early acute&#xD;
      postoperative pain scores (visual analog scale, VAS) at rest and at movement (0-4 h&#xD;
      postoperatively), late acute postoperative pain scores (VAS) at rest and at movement (24 h&#xD;
      postoperatively); and cumulative opioid consumption (up to 24 h) will be registered. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be analyzed for white blood cells, Il-6, cortisol, and creatinine kinase and a&#xD;
      part will be stored for analysis of the cellular inflammatory systems by NanoString to&#xD;
      explore the innate system and cellular activation (19,20). NanoString has the capacity to&#xD;
      demonstrate activation of immune-related genes in the bloodstream during inflammatory&#xD;
      induction and highlight an exciting role of immune competent cell in linking peripheral&#xD;
      inflammation with immune activation and possibly anti-nociception. NanoString methodology&#xD;
      investigates gene expression and currently quantifies the expression of 770 genes by&#xD;
      determining the amount of messenger RNA (mRNA). mRNA is the end-product of gene transcription&#xD;
      and, therefore, allows the study of gene up-regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring cycles and levels of rest and activity will be done by an actigraph in a&#xD;
      non-invasive method (13,14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Women undergoing robotic hysterectomy would benefit from peroperative&#xD;
      glucocorticoid treatment on important life qualities like pain, fatigue, freedom of&#xD;
      medications and resuming work and sexual activities. Biological substrates such as&#xD;
      inflammatory markers will be explored as underlying mechanism behind surgical stress response&#xD;
      in order to direct perioperative medical interventions (19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives and impact The randomized design will evaluate the effects of the single dose&#xD;
      dexamethasone on the highest level of evidence. The anti-emetic effects of steroid are&#xD;
      already incorporated in several guidelines on perioperative care; however, this study could&#xD;
      further enhance our knowledge on minimal invasive surgery and optimize the treatment for&#xD;
      surgical stress. The stress response in humans have evolved over millennia and is embedded in&#xD;
      our genes but has no natural association with modern days surgery and may be ill placed and&#xD;
      timely inadequate for recovery. The exploratory study may help identify pathways and specific&#xD;
      mechanism in surgical stress that can be targeted in future to enhance women's recovery after&#xD;
      surgery. The perspective is in further studies to target these specific sites in the immune&#xD;
      activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PhD study in robotic hysterectomy will include a randomized trial with a single dose&#xD;
      intravenously of 24 mg dexamethasone (Dexavit®) corresponding to 128 mg methyl prednisolone&#xD;
      (Solumedrol®). The robotic hysterectomy is performed with the Intuitive surgical Da Vinci Xi&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization will be performed in Redcap and data stored the same place under each&#xD;
      patient cpr.-no. but in a separate section. A person not involved in the project in any other&#xD;
      form will perform the randomization. The patient will then receive the dose of either steroid&#xD;
      or placebo saline intravenously, blinded to the patient and operation team (gynecology,&#xD;
      operation ward and anesthesiology). The applicant PhD student will later enter the data in&#xD;
      Redcap unknowing to the randomization results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women in the department operated by with a robotic assisted hysterectomy will be&#xD;
      monitored and fill out a diary with validated questionnaires (names of quest.) to streamline&#xD;
      the information gathering in a high flow work place and not to discriminate those outside of&#xD;
      the project. These data will be presented as the drop-out analysis to evaluate the external&#xD;
      validity of the trial. The flow of data collection is displayed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated to be 49 women included in each arm on the primary outcome of&#xD;
      c-reactive protein rising to the level of 40 mg/l with an expected reduction of 10 % a with a&#xD;
      standard deviation of 7 calculated by https://clincalc.com/stats/samplesize.aspx (1,17,18).&#xD;
      This may seem a parsimonious reduction but in practical terms, it translates to more than&#xD;
      halving the need of opioids early and late postoperatively (2). On the assumption of&#xD;
      incomplete data in less than 10 % of cases, 50 women in each group with complete data will be&#xD;
      included. Robotic hysterectomy is a standard procedure in our department with about 80-90&#xD;
      hysterectomies each year, so we expect the study inclusion to last 1½-2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Analysis are performed on the intention-to-treat principle with women on current&#xD;
      use of analgesics as a subgroup analysis. The statistics will be unpaired and paired analysis&#xD;
      (2-ways ANOVA) including relevant co-variates. Regression analysis will be performed with the&#xD;
      primary outcome as dependent variable and the secondary outcomes and anthropometrics as&#xD;
      dependent variable.&#xD;
