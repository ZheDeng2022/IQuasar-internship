  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MaaT013 showed interesting results in steroids and ruxolitinib-resistant aGVHD patients with&#xD;
      gut involvement (55% ORR at D28) and 47% and 39% OS at 6 and 12 months respectively (Malard&#xD;
      2020), therefore warrant being tested as salvage therapy in steroid and JAK&#xD;
      inhibitors-resistant GI-aGvHD patients. Given the absence of an approved 3rd line strategy or&#xD;
      2nd line strategy in ruxolitinib intolerant patients and the extremely poor prognosis of&#xD;
      these patients, who are mostly left with no viable therapeutic option, a single-arm&#xD;
      open-label design was proposed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standard first-line therapy for the treatment of acute GVHD involves corticosteroids, usually&#xD;
      methyl-prednisolone at a dose of 2 mg/kg per day (Martin PJ R. J., 2012; Van Lint MT, 1998).&#xD;
      Despite initial responses (around 60%), fewer than half of patients have durable complete&#xD;
      responses, and those patients who do not respond or progress after an initial response have&#xD;
      high mortality (Weisdorf D, 1990; Alousi AM, 2009; Bolanos-Meade J, 2014). Moreover,&#xD;
      prolonged high-dose corticosteroids (CS) exposure is associated with deleterious&#xD;
      complications and long-term morbidity (Mohty M, 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons, there is great interest in identifying effective therapies for&#xD;
      corticosteroid-resistant aGvHD and improve outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, ruxolitinib (Jakafi®), which has an Orphan Drug status in the USA, was granted an&#xD;
      approval on 24 May 2019 from the FDA based on study INCB 18424-271 (NCT02953678). This&#xD;
      open-label, single-arm study enrolled 72 grade 2-4 SR-aGvHD patients who were treated with 5&#xD;
      mg (possibly increased to 10mg) ruxolitinib b.d. Of the 72 patients, 49 were included in the&#xD;
      efficacy evaluation that led the FDA to grant market authorization. Of these 49 patients,&#xD;
      Overall Response Rate (ORR - Complete + Very Good Partial + Partial Responses) after 28 days&#xD;
      was 100%, 40.7% and 44.4% for patients with Grade 2, Grade 3, and Grade 4 aGVHD respectively.&#xD;
      The overall survival (OS) estimate at 6 months was 51.0% for the entire cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The more recent REACH2 phase 3 randomized trial (NCT02913261) investigating ruxolitinib&#xD;
      versus best available therapy in patients with corticosteroid-refractory acute GVHD has&#xD;
      further established the role of ruxolitinib in the treatment of corticosteroid-refractory&#xD;
      acute GvHD. The ORR at day 28 was higher in the ruxolitinib than in the control group (62%&#xD;
      versus 39%; odds ratio, 2.64; 95%CI, 1.65-4.22; P&lt;0.001). Similarly, the durable overall&#xD;
      response at day 56 was higher in the ruxolitinib than in the control group (40% versus 22%;&#xD;
      odds ratio, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.43-3.94; P&lt;0.001) (Zeiser R, 2020) In the REACH1 and REACH2&#xD;
      trials, 45% and 38% of patients, failed to respond to ruxolitinib at day 28, respectively.&#xD;
      Moreover, in the REACH2 trial, the overall response at day 56 after initiation of therapy&#xD;
      decreased from 62.3% at D28 after initiation of therapy to 39.4% at D56, suggesting a clear&#xD;
      unmet medical need for those patients who failed to respond at D28, or worsened afterwards&#xD;
      (Zeiser R. 2020). More importantly, results from the REACH1 trial showed only a 22%&#xD;
      probability of survival at 2 months in ruxolitinib-non responder patients (Jagasia 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MaaT013 is made of allogeneic, full-ecosystem pooled biotherapeutic intestinal microbiota&#xD;
      manufactured by MaaT Pharma in Lyon, France, according to GMP requirements. The intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota material in its natural environment is derived from healthy, strictly-vetted and&#xD;
      selected donors, following the European consensus recommendations (Cammarota 2016) with the&#xD;
      purpose of minimizing the risk associated with fecal material transplants (FMT) for clinical&#xD;
      research. Thus, prior to donation, donors undergo a thorough medical evaluation and&#xD;
      laboratory screening including SARS-CoV-2 detection, to avoid any known contamination risk.&#xD;
      MaaT013 is administered as an enema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MaaT013 showed interesting results in steroids and ruxolitinib-resistant aGVHD patients with&#xD;
      gut involvement (55% ORR at D28) and 47% and 39% OS at 6 and 12 months respectively (Malard&#xD;
      2020), therefore warrant being tested as salvage therapy in steroid and JAK&#xD;
      inhibitors-resistant GI-aGvHD patients. Given the absence of an approved 3rd line strategy or&#xD;
      2nd line strategy in ruxolitinib intolerant patients and the extremely poor prognosis of&#xD;
      these patients, who are mostly left with no viable therapeutic option, a single-arm&#xD;
      open-label design was proposed.&#xD;
