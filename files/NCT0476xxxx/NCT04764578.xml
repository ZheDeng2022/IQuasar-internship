      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The prevalence of sexual dysfunction after upper extremity function in adults (&gt;18yo) is&#xD;
           higher than the general population in the early post-operative period (3mo) and at 1&#xD;
           year post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Null: Adult patients (&lt;18 yo) with isolated upper extremity trauma do not experience&#xD;
           sexual dysfunction more than the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Study Question&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) What is the prevalence of sexual dysfunction after upper extremity trauma (fracture, soft&#xD;
      tissue disruption, neurovascular injury, and completion amputation) in adult patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Study Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Are there patient or injury factors that can predict sexual dysfunction?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do certain fractures cause more sexual dysfunction than others?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Can we accurately predict which patients may experience sexual dysfunction post-injury?&#xD;

      Enrollment Visit Following the consent process, patient demographics, injury information, and&#xD;
      baseline pre-trauma sexual function will be documented as part of the patient's baseline&#xD;
      assessment. Participants will be asked to complete the study survey which will combine 1&#xD;
      question (Item 21 Sexual Dysfunction) from the Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH)&#xD;
      and the 5 question, Likert-like, Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX)7,8 . Depending on the&#xD;
      participant's response to survey item 1, they may or may not be asked to complete the&#xD;
      remaining 5 questions. As part of routine care in the Department of Orthopaedics, patients&#xD;
      being seen in the Hand &amp; Upper Extremity outpatient clinics are asked to complete the&#xD;
      following surveys: QuickDASH, SANE, PROMIS Physical Function CAT and PROMIS Anxiety CAT. The&#xD;
      study will access/utilize the responses to these routine care patient reported outcomes to&#xD;
      correlate to our study survey responses. This routine care PRO data will be stored in the&#xD;
      electronic health record. Project team members listed as Key Study Personnel with existing&#xD;
      electronic health record (EHR) system access rights may be granted use of REDCap Clinical&#xD;
      Data Interoperability Services (CDIS) tools. These tools are designed to enable transfer of&#xD;
      relevant study-related data from the Vanderbilt Research Derivative and/or directly from the&#xD;
      EHR into REDCap. If KSP are unable to transfer data using CDIS, it will be manually entered&#xD;
      into the REDCap database. If, for some reason, the participant does not complete the routine&#xD;
      care PROs at their enrollment visit, we will ask them to complete the surveys as part of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Visits Participants will be asked to complete the same study survey at their 3&#xD;
      month, 6 month and 12 month follow-up visits. The study will access/utilize the routine care&#xD;
      PRO responses (QuickDASH, SANE, PROMIS Physical Function CAT and PROMIS Anxiety CAT) at these&#xD;
      visits, also. If, for some reason, the participant does not complete the routine care PROs at&#xD;
      their follow-up visit, we will ask them to complete the surveys as part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant does not have a routine care appointment scheduled at the follow-up visit&#xD;
      time points, misses a routine care follow-up appointment or the study staff are not available&#xD;
      to collect data at these follow-up appointments, the research coordinator will attempt to&#xD;
      contact the patient by phone, mail or electronically using REDCap, to obtain the outcomes&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
