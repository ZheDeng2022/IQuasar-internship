    <textblock>
      The HEAVEN criteria were found valid to predict difficult airways during preclinical&#xD;
      emergency intubations in a retrospective study. The acronym stands for Hypoxemia, Extremes of&#xD;
      size, Anatomic abnormalities, Vomit/blood/fluid, Exsanguination/anaemia, and Neck mobility&#xD;
      issues. This is a monocentric prospective observational study to assess the validity of the&#xD;
      HEAVEN criteria in the in-hospital setting at a level I adult and pediatric emergency&#xD;
      university-based hospital.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emergency intubations are prone to present a difficult airway. A difficult airway can lead to&#xD;
      prolonged intubation time and to hypoxemia in situations where oxygenation is not possible&#xD;
      that can finally result in hypoxic cardiac arrest and irreversible brain damage caused by&#xD;
      hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tools to predict difficult airways are rather poor concerning specificity and sensitivity. A&#xD;
      score to predict difficult airway developed in the pre-clinical setting are the HEAVEN&#xD;
      criteria. The acronym HEAVEN stands for: Hypoxemia, Extremes of size, Anatomic abnormalities,&#xD;
      Vomit/blood/fluid, Exsanguination/anaemia, and Neck mobility issues and does not need&#xD;
      patients' cooperation. It has been recently validated in the pre-clinical emergency setting&#xD;
      and was found to be useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aim is to evaluate if the HEAVEN criteria are suitable to be used to predict&#xD;
      difficult airway in in-hospital emergency intubation to finally increase patients' safety&#xD;
      during rapid sequence induction (RSI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective observational single-centre study in emergency intubation will consecutively&#xD;
      recruit all patients of all ages who need RSI due to their medical condition performed by the&#xD;
      staff of the Department of Anaesthesiology and Pain Medicine at the Bern University Hospital.&#xD;
      We will record data that are gathered during routine patient care and stored primarily in the&#xD;
      departmental anaesthesia information systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to validate if the HEAVEN criteria, an existing prehospital&#xD;
      difficult airway prediction tool, is able to predict airways difficulties during RSI in the&#xD;
      clinical in-hospital setting. The secondary objective is, to assess the subcomponent of the&#xD;
      HEAVEN criteria and if differences and adaptations are needed comparing it to the prehospital&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
