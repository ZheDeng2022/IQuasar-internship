  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the advent of immunotherapy, standard first-line treatment for patients with renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma is now an association with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. In this context, the&#xD;
      association axitinib plus pembrolizumab has already been evaluated in several studies with&#xD;
      positive results for Progression Free survival, Overall survival and Complete response. The&#xD;
      combo received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use,&#xD;
      and the European Commission approves the extension of Marketing Authorization in first line&#xD;
      for metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a context of treatment with a new association, it is important to manage the toxicities&#xD;
      closely in order to allow the patients to have an optimal treatment. The underlying&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the use of new information and communication technologies could improve&#xD;
      clinical patient management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we wish assess the impact of monitoring via the web application KidneyPRO on&#xD;
      the quality of life of patients with the new combination of treatment axitinib/pembrolizumab&#xD;
      for a renal cell carcinoma in first line.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic or locally advanced clear cell renal carcinomas (RCC) are treated with targeted&#xD;
      therapies (inhibitors of tyrosine kinases) and immune check-points inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In first line many combos are tested. Association of TKI-PD L1-inhibitor is one option.&#xD;
      Axitinib-Pembrolizumab showed very high response rate and progression free survival compared&#xD;
      to Sunitinib but immunotherapies have a specific adverse event profile. Actually, there is no&#xD;
      standardized follow-up for this type of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to develop new strategies that reduce the resources used while improving the&#xD;
      performance of this surveillance for the benefit of patients, to improve the comfort of&#xD;
      patients, to improve the compliance and to optimise the dose of treatment received, in a&#xD;
      course of care reworked by maintaining a continuous contact not demanding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In collaboration with the Scientific Research National Center, the theory of chaos and its&#xD;
      derivatives was applied to cancer and a web-application was developed on these concepts to&#xD;
      remotely analyze the dynamics of the symptoms felt by the patient and early detect a&#xD;
      recurrence or a complication of his cancer. Clinical symptoms are self-assessed by patients&#xD;
      once a week, transcribed on their smartphone or computer through the Internet application.&#xD;
      Relevant clinical events are detected using data processing algorithms, combining the&#xD;
      dynamics of the various reported symptoms. In this case, an alert message is sent to the&#xD;
      health care team. The referring oncologist is thus warned early. He can then make a telephone&#xD;
      call to the patient about the reality of the medical alert and summon him for a check-up or&#xD;
      any other complementary examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Applied to lung cancer, this application is a tried-and-tested solution with a phase III&#xD;
      clinical trial. The main criteria was overall survival. The monitoring of these patients with&#xD;
      the web-application and with a number of scanners reduced by 50% compared to the reference&#xD;
      arm, made it possible to diagnose relapses earlier, to treat them under better conditions&#xD;
      and, above all, to improve statistically significant overall survival (a gain in overall&#xD;
      survival of 26% at 1 year (in patients intending to treat): 49% in the standard arm versus&#xD;
      75% in the experimental arm: p = 0.0025. This profit persists with 2 years of decline (a&#xD;
      median gain in overall survival of 7.6 months, p=0.0312).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This concept was confirmed in the NCT0578006 study published by Basch et al. Basch used a&#xD;
      similar application during chemotherapy treatment in 766 cancer patients. The web-application&#xD;
      has improved overall survival by 5 months (Hazard ratio: 0.83).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This web-application provided a statistical improvement in the quality of life for lung&#xD;
      cancer, access to new therapeutic lines (74% versus 33%, p &lt;0.001) and optimally with&#xD;
      treatments delivered at therapeutic doses (in 76% versus 34%) and faster access to supportive&#xD;
      care for a clear improvement in the general condition of patients (77 versus 33%, p &lt;0.001).&#xD;
      The key for these patients who experienced many treatment toxicities was to use a better&#xD;
      method of active follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A real-time survey of quality of life of Renal Cell Cancer patients receiving&#xD;
      Axitinib/Pembrolizumab is an objective that has never been evaluated. This study will allow&#xD;
      to generate data in patients who were not included in the phase III study (KEYNOTE 426):&#xD;
      Performance Status =2, with central nervous system metastasis and with renal insufficiency.&#xD;
      Personalized monitoring of these patients with the web-application KidneyPRO is even more&#xD;
      relevant because the aim would be to quickly provide care adapted to adverse events,&#xD;
      supportive care in case of loss of activity…&#xD;
&#xD;
      The web-application KidneyPRO investigated has been developed for this purpose.&#xD;
