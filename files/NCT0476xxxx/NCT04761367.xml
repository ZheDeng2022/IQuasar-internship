      Randomized controlled trial. Patients will be enrolled at the moment of the pre-surgery&#xD;
      assessment after verifying the inclusion/exclusion criteria and signing written informed&#xD;
      consent. After surgical treatment (THR or TKR) and subsequent rehabilitation treatment (which&#xD;
      usually lasts 3-4 months) patients will be contacted and the persistence of&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria verified again. For each type of surgical procedure (i.e. THR or&#xD;
      TKR) those, with confirmed inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to the IG or the CG.&#xD;
      The IG will participate in a 6-month exercise program based on the PAIR exercise protocol and&#xD;
      will receive educational sessions and material on the importance of maintaining an active&#xD;
      life style after THR or TKR. The CG will receive only educational sessions and material on&#xD;
      the importance of maintaining an active life style after THR or TKR. Participants of both IG&#xD;
      and CG will be assessed at the moment of randomization (post-surgery baseline) and,&#xD;
      subsequently, after 3 and 6 months.&#xD;

      The present study is carried out within the project &quot;Physical ActIvity after hip and knee&#xD;
      Replacement&quot; (PAIR) and funded within the Erasmus Plus Sport program (Grant Agreement&#xD;
      613008-EPP-1-2019-1-IT-SPO-SCP). It is aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of an&#xD;
      exercise program specifically designed for improving physical function and QoL in people who&#xD;
      had undergone THR or TKR for primary osteoarthritis after completing the surgical and&#xD;
      rehabilitative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to compare modifications of QoL measured with the&#xD;
      Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) induced in the intervention groups (IG) by the PAIR exercise&#xD;
      program versus a control groups (CG) who will undergo usual care. SF-36 is one of the most&#xD;
      widely used questionnaire to measure the health related QoL (HRQoL) in total hip and total&#xD;
      knee arthroplasty patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are to investigate differences between IG and CG on&#xD;
      domains which are considered to be determinants of QoL:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hip- and knee-related impairments and functional limitations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Harris Hip Score (HHS), American Knee Society scoring (KSS),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual analog scale (VAS) to evaluate pain, High-Activity Arthroplasty Score (HAAS),&#xD;
           ---Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Index (WOMAC),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Score (HOOS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hip- and knee-related functional status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time Up and GO (TUG),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single Stance test,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The 30-second Chair-Stand Test (30s-CST),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hand Grip test, Maximal strength of the lower limb,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hip and knee joints mobility (by goniometry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Life style The ultimate goal of the PAIR exercise program is to increase physical activity in&#xD;
      a sedentary population. The exercise program, through its beneficial effects on health, is&#xD;
      expected to generate a virtuous circle promoting a more active life-style. For this domain 2&#xD;
      instruments will be used: Recent Physical Activity Questionnaire (RPAQ) and PAIR&#xD;
      questionnaire for patients' attitudes toward physical (instrument generated within the PAIR&#xD;
      project).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: Adverse clinical events (ACEs) occurred to the participants both inside and outside&#xD;
      gym classes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence: adherence of each subjects to the exercise program will be monitored in the IG.&#xD;
      The adherence will be measured as percent of exercise sessions actually performed/total&#xD;
      number of scheduled exercise sessions. Other factors considered to influence the adherence to&#xD;
      an exercise program will be also recorded (age, gender, comorbidity, BMI, educational level,&#xD;
      marital status, working activity, and home gym-distance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' satisfaction Satisfaction of PAIR exercise program is a very important domain&#xD;
      since influence adherence. It will be verified by asking few questions with structured&#xD;
      responses based on a 7-point Likert scale, to get participants' opinion about the PAIR&#xD;
      exercise program.&#xD;
