  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The DISCO App is designed to improve, during the interaction, patient active participation&#xD;
      and patient-initiated oncologist treatment cost discussions, and, in the short term,&#xD;
      patient's treatment cost knowledge, self-efficacy for managing both cost and physician&#xD;
      interactions, referrals, perceived financial toxicity (i.e., distress and material hardship);&#xD;
      in turn, these will affect longer-term outcomes of financial toxicity and adherence.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This work is based on the core scientific premise - that increasing patient active&#xD;
      participation and the frequency and quality of treatment cost discussions will decrease the&#xD;
      short- and longer-term burdens of financial toxicity through their influence on self-efficacy&#xD;
      for managing treatment cost. The focus is on patient self-efficacy for managing treatment&#xD;
      cost because it is expected that improved treatment cost education and patient-oncologist&#xD;
      treatment cost discussions prompted by the DISCO App will directly improve the self-efficacy&#xD;
      needed for patients to proactively manage treatment costs, thus reducing the material and&#xD;
      psychological burden of financial toxicity. The DISCO App is not designed to increase&#xD;
      patients' ability to pay or reduce the cost of treatment, but it may benefit patients by&#xD;
      increasing: their knowledge of treatment costs, their self-efficacy for managing cost, and&#xD;
      the likelihood they receive financial and psychological assistance and support. This research&#xD;
      is significant because, if successful, reducing the material and psychological burden of&#xD;
      financial toxicity will improve the quality of care and work toward achieving health equity.&#xD;
      The DISCO App has already been tested for its feasibility and acceptability. The DISCO App&#xD;
      will now be tested for its effectiveness in a diverse population of people with solid tumors&#xD;
      treated with IV and oral chemotherapies.&#xD;
