      Intranasal (IN) naloxone is available as 2 mg or 4 mg dose with the indication to&#xD;
      re-administer additional doses every 2 to 3 minutes (using alternating nostrils) if needed&#xD;
      until emergency medical assistance arrives. The 4 mg dose is distributed in packages of two&#xD;
      nasal sprays (1 dose per nasal spray), but additional doses can be administered if needed and&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the pharmacokinetics of IN naloxone have been determined following administration of a&#xD;
      4 mg dose in each nostril concurrently, the pharmacokinetics have not been determined&#xD;
      following multiple doses when there is a 2-3 minute delay between doses and when doses are&#xD;
      re-administered to the same nostril.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtaining data with repeat dosing will inform if and how fast naloxone plasma concentrations&#xD;
      can be reached to be able to reverse highly-potent opioid overdoses. This study will be a&#xD;
      randomized, unblinded, three-way crossover study to determine naloxone plasma concentration&#xD;
      after administration of multiple doses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Four 4 mg IN naloxone doses (1 dose every 2.5 minutes) B. Four 4 mg IN naloxone doses (2&#xD;
      doses every 2.5 minutes) C. Two 4 mg IN naloxone doses (1 dose every 2.5 minutes)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Naloxone, a fast-acting mu-opioid antagonist, is a treatment commonly used in reversing&#xD;
      opioid overdose. Naloxone is available in multiple formulations, including for injection&#xD;
      intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously, and more recently as a spray administered&#xD;
      intranasally (IN). The IN naloxone formulation, which was approved in 2015, is of particular&#xD;
      interest as there is a need for naloxone formulations for community use by caregivers and&#xD;
      first responders/law enforcement who do not have medical training. It is critical to&#xD;
      administer naloxone as quickly as possible to prevent irreversible brain damage and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER),&#xD;
      Division of Applied Regulatory Science (DARS) has conducted modeling and simulation,&#xD;
      evaluating how many doses of IN naloxone may be needed to reverse opioid-induced respiratory&#xD;
      depression from fentanyl and fentanyl derivates under a range of overdose scenarios. These&#xD;
      analyses have suggested that more than two doses of IN naloxone are sometimes required to&#xD;
      reverse the effects of highly potent opioids (e.g., certain fentanyl derivatives). Experience&#xD;
      with intranasal formulations for other products has shown that repeat administration of doses&#xD;
      given in close proximity to the same nostril can influence drug exposure due to run-off from&#xD;
      the application site, limited absorption, or other factors. While the pharmacokinetics of IN&#xD;
      naloxone have been determined following administration of a 4 mg dose in each nostril&#xD;
      concurrently, the pharmacokinetics have not been determined following multiple doses&#xD;
      according to the FDA product label:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administer a single spray intranasally into one nostril.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administer additional doses using a new nasal spray with each dose, if the patient does&#xD;
           not respond or responds and then relapses into respiratory depression, additional doses&#xD;
           may be given every 2 to 3 minutes until emergency medical assistance arrives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This involves a 2-3 minute delay between each dose and re-administering to a previously dosed&#xD;
      nostril starting with the 3rd dose, which may result in a less than dose-proportional&#xD;
      increase in naloxone plasma concentration and/or delayed increase in naloxone exposure&#xD;
      compared to the first 2 doses. Obtaining data with repeat dosing will inform if and how fast&#xD;
      naloxone plasma concentrations can be reached to be able to reverse highly-potent opioid&#xD;
      overdoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a randomized, unblinded, three-way crossover study to determine naloxone&#xD;
      plasma concentration after administration of multiple doses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Four 4 mg IN naloxone doses (1 dose every 2.5 minutes) B. Four 4 mg IN naloxone doses (2&#xD;
      doses every 2.5 minutes) C. Two 4 mg IN naloxone doses (1 dose every 2.5 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above 3 treatments will be evaluated in a randomized order over 3 treatment periods.&#xD;
      Healthy subjects will be randomized to one of six treatment sequences (i.e., ABC, ACB, BAC,&#xD;
      BCA, CAB, CBA). Subjects will report to the study site for screening from Days -28 to -2 and&#xD;
      then will return to the site on Day -1 for baseline assessments and check-in. After check-in&#xD;
      (Day -1), subjects will receive dosing for the 3 respective treatment periods on Days 1, 4&#xD;
      and 7. There will be two days of washout between each treatment period. Participants will be&#xD;
      confined in the study clinic from Day -1 until the morning of Day 8. On dosing days, dosing&#xD;
      will occur as per the treatment description and PK assessments will occur at 16 different&#xD;
      time points.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has a deviated septum or previous nasal surgeries or need to use another nasal&#xD;
             spray product during study that would impact administration of the intranasal drug.&#xD;

             NSAIDs and excluding oral contraceptives and acetaminophen) within 14 days or 5&#xD;
             half-lives (whichever is longer) or complementary and alternative medicines within 28&#xD;
             days before the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject is currently participating in another clinical study of an investigational&#xD;
             drug or has been dosed with any investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives&#xD;
             (whichever is longer) of the compound.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has used nicotine-containing products (e.g., cigarettes, cigars, chewing&#xD;
             tobacco, snuff) within 6 weeks of Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject has consumed alcohol, xanthine containing products (e.g., tea, coffee, cola),&#xD;
             caffeine, grapefruit, or grapefruit juice within 24 h of check-in. Subjects must&#xD;
             refrain from ingesting these throughout the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Subject has any signs or symptoms that are consistent with COVID-19 per CDC&#xD;
             recommendations. These include subjects with fever or chills, cough, shortness of&#xD;
             breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of&#xD;
             taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, or diarrhea&#xD;
             may have COVID-19. In addition, the subject has any other findings suggestive of&#xD;
             COVID-19 risk in the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
