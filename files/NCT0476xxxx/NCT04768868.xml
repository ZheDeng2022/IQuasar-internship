  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is A Phase 1, Open-Label, Multi-Center, Dose Escalation and Expansion Study to Evaluate&#xD;
      Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Anti-Tumor Activity of the WEE1 Inhibitor IMP7068&#xD;
      Monotherapy in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include a dose-escalation stage and a dose-expansion stage. The&#xD;
      dose-escalation stage is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and select&#xD;
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of IMP7068 monotherapy. The dose-expansion stage will be&#xD;
      conducted with RP2D to further evaluate the preliminary anti-tumor activity, safety and&#xD;
      tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of approximately 150 patients will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 50 patients will be enrolled into Part 1 dose escalation of IMP7068&#xD;
      monotherapy. A total of 100 patients each with advanced solid tumor will be evaluated in Part&#xD;
      2 dose-expansion of IMP7068 monotherapy.&#xD;

Dose Schedule: IMP7068 administered QD on Days 1-3, Days 8-10 and Days 15-17 on a 21-day cycle.&#xD;
The other Dose Schedules may be explored according to SMC decision.&#xD;
The dose-expansion stage will commence after the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) is determined during the dose-escalation stage. Approximately100 patients each with advanced solid tumor who has exhausted available treatment options with respective biomarker(s) determined by central laboratory will be evaluated.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient must voluntarily participate in this clinical study. Be willing and able&#xD;
