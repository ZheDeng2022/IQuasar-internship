    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study of 100 patients undergoing liver transplantation at&#xD;
      a single centre. Thrombin generation and kinetics will be assessed using a novel&#xD;
      point-of-care device, and compared to conventional measures of hemostasis as well as&#xD;
      viscoelastic tests to pinpoint specific coagulation deficits and identify potential&#xD;
      therapeutic targets. The clinical course of patients will be followed for major bleeding and&#xD;
      transfusion outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Liver transplantation is the only curative option for end stage liver disease, but is&#xD;
      associated with high morbidity and mortality. End stage liver disease is known to be&#xD;
      accompanied by dysregulated coagulation, which is further exacerbated in the immediate&#xD;
      perioperative period by transplantation, leading to both coagulopathic bleeding and&#xD;
      thrombosis. Altered thrombin generation is thought to play a key role in the predisposition&#xD;
      of these patients for both severe coagulopathic hemorrhage and life-threatening&#xD;
      thromboembolic complications. Despite this, thrombin generation during the immediate&#xD;
      transplant period in patients with end-stage liver disease is poorly characterized, in part&#xD;
      because it is not well reflected by conventional measures of coagulation. This study aims to&#xD;
      characterize changes in thrombin generation capacity pre, intra- and post-transplant&#xD;
      utilizing a novel point-of-care thrombin generation assay. Other specific aims of the study&#xD;
      are to identify risk factors for patients with impaired thrombin generation and will assess&#xD;
      the association of impaired thrombin generation with overall clinical bleeding risk. The&#xD;
      overarching goal of this work is to develop a point-of-care-testing guided algorithm&#xD;
      addressing dysregulated thrombin formation that improves coagulation management without&#xD;
      increasing the risk of thromboembolic complications. Ultimately, this line of research will&#xD;
      improve the outcomes of liver transplantation.&#xD;
