  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the impact of a probiotic formulation on subjective&#xD;
      sleep patterns. It is hypothesized that participants given the probiotics will improve their&#xD;
      sleep patterns compared to participants receiving placebo.&#xD;

      Participants with symptoms of insomnia and work-related stress will be recruited to&#xD;
      participate in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind interventional study for&#xD;
      approximately 15 since the signature of the informed consent. Participants will first be seen&#xD;
      at the Screening visit when they will be administered several questionnaires to determine&#xD;
      eligibility (assessing symptoms of insomnia, work-related stress, psychological distress and&#xD;
      other sleep disorders). Participants will receive a 2-week sleep journal and an actigraphy to&#xD;
      record their sleep patterns. At visit 2 returning participants will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      probiotics or placebo for the following 12 weeks. During this visit, participants will be&#xD;
      administered questionnaires assessing sleep quality, work-related productivity, quality of&#xD;
      life, and mood. Participants will also be asked to bring to site a stool sample and saliva&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to return at 6 weeks for visit 3. During this visit participants&#xD;
      will be administered questionnaires (insomnia, sleep quality, work-related stress and&#xD;
      productivity, quality of life, mood and psychological distress).&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will also bring two saliva samples. Two weeks prior to visit 4, participants will be&#xD;
      asked to complete another sleep journal and be dispensed another actigraphy which shall be&#xD;
      returned at visit 4. Lastly, participants will return on for visit 4 at week 12 in which the&#xD;
      same questionnaires as visit 3 will be administered. Participants will also be asked to bring&#xD;
      to site another stool sample and two saliva samples.&#xD;
