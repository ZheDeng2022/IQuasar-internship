  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospital centralization effect is reported to lower complications and mortality especially&#xD;
      for high risk and complex general surgery operations, including colorectal surgery. However,&#xD;
      no linear relation between volume and outcome has been demonstrated. Aim of the study was to&#xD;
      evaluate the increased surgical volume effect on early outcomes of patient undergoing&#xD;
      restorative anterior rectal resection (ARR).&#xD;

    <description>In November 2016, the decision to centralize rectal cancer patients to only one surgical unit was taken, with only two surgeons performing the procedures. Furthermore, a close collaboration with local Gastroenterology Units and General Practiotioners was started in order to increase colorectal cancer case referral to our unit. At the same time, we decided to promote the use of laparoscopy and to implement ERAS protocol in our colorectal surgery practice.</description>

        The study involved all consecutive eligible patients undergoing elective restorative&#xD;
        anterior rectal resection (ARR) for rectal cancer between November 2016 and December 2020&#xD;
        in our Minimally Invasive Surgery Unit of Tor Vergata University Hospital unit (Group A).&#xD;
        Outcomes for Group A were compared with an historical control group, consisting of all&#xD;
        consecutive patients undergoing ARR in the same hospital between January 2006 and October&#xD;
        2016 (Group B).&#xD;
