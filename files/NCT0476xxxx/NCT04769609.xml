  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various treatment protocols of peri-implantitis involving surgical therapies with open flap&#xD;
      debridement procedures, resective or reconstructive modalities have been documented to&#xD;
      achieve variable success. Surgical non-reconstructive approaches have been suggested to have&#xD;
      limited effectiveness in terms of the resolution of inflammation in the long term. Therefore,&#xD;
      much more interest has been intensified regarding the efficacy of biomaterials used in&#xD;
      reconstructive approaches. The aim of this study was to investigate the 3-year&#xD;
      clinical/radiographic outcomes of reconstructive surgical therapy of peri-implantitis using a&#xD;
      bone substitute combined with two different bioresorbable barrier membranes, either collagen&#xD;
      membrane (CM) or concentrated growth factor (CGF). A total of 52 patients who had at least&#xD;
      one implant diagnosed with peri-implantitis and needed to be scheduled for reconstructive&#xD;
      therapy of a peri-implant infrabony defect were included. Peri-implantitis case was defined&#xD;
      as increased probing depth (PD) compared to previous examinations with bleeding on probing&#xD;
      (BOP) and/or suppuration and radiographic evidence of peri-implant bone loss beyond crestal&#xD;
      bone level changes resulting from initial bone remodeling. The patients were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive a bone substitute filling in combination with either CM or CGF. Intrabony&#xD;
      components were filled with a bone substitute (BioOss spongiosa granules; Geistlich,&#xD;
      Wolhusen, Switzerland) and covered with a CM (Bio-Guide, Geistlich Biomaterials) or CGF&#xD;
      membrane. The plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), BOP, PD, clinical attachment level&#xD;
      (CAL), mucosal recession (MR) and radiographic vertical defect depth (VDD) values were&#xD;
      evaluated at 1 and 3 years postoperatively.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peri-implantitis is a plaque-associated pathological disease affecting the soft and/or hard&#xD;
      tissues surrounding a dental implant and clinically characterized by bleeding on probing&#xD;
      (BOP) and/or suppuration (Supp), increased probing depths (PDs) and/or mucosal marginal&#xD;
      recessions (MRs) in addition to radiographic marginal bone loss (MBL) compared to previous&#xD;
      examinations. Considering the increasing numbers of patients undergoing restorative treatment&#xD;
      through dental implants and the corresponding increase in the prevalence of peri-implantitis,&#xD;
      it is imperative to perform effective treatment methods for the management of these&#xD;
      conditions. On the basis of evidence, the most reliable and predictable treatment of&#xD;
      peri-implantitis has not yet been described, moreover, if the disease is left untreated, it&#xD;
      progresses in a non-linear accelerating manner. Hence, peri-implantitis has been considered&#xD;
      to be a major, unpredictable and growing problem for clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various treatment protocols of this challenging problem involving non-surgical approaches and&#xD;
      surgical therapies with open flap debridement procedures, resective surgeries, or&#xD;
      reconstructive modalities, which include the use of bone substitutes with or without a&#xD;
      membrane, decontamination methods of implant surfaces, antimicrobial prescriptions whether to&#xD;
      use submerged or non-submerged techniques, have been proposed. Although non-surgical&#xD;
      interventions have been reported to be effective in reducing BOP and PDs in peri-implantitis&#xD;
      sites, these therapies have appeared to be unpredictable for the management of&#xD;
      peri-implantitis, especially in most severe cases. As another treatment option, surgical&#xD;
      non-reconstructive approaches, i.e. open flap debridement and surface decontamination alone,&#xD;
      have been suggested to have limited effectiveness in terms of the resolution of inflammation&#xD;
      for the long-term outcomes. Therefore, much more interest has been intensified regarding the&#xD;
      efficacy of biomaterials used in reconstructive approaches. Several surgical augmentative&#xD;
      therapy studies, including the use of bone substitutes with or without barrier membranes have&#xD;
      demonstrated significant clinical and radiographic improvements for at least 3 years,&#xD;
      especially in well-contained (three- or four-wall) intrabony defects. A systematic review&#xD;
      evaluating long-term outcomes of reconstructive therapy for the management of&#xD;
      peri-implantitis showed a mean PD reduction of 3 mm and a radiographic gain of 2.4 mm in bone&#xD;
      level. However, as indicated by the last EFP Workshop, no evidence to support the superiority&#xD;
      of a specific material, product or membrane in terms of long-term clinical outcomes of a&#xD;
      reconstructive approach has been found. It has been strictly recommended that identification&#xD;
      of peri-implantitis therapy success and disease resolution in the long-term management are&#xD;
      required to allow adequate assessment of stable treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of many studies indicating that growth factors have provided to transiently stimulate&#xD;
      cells locally, accelerate angiogenesis, promote proliferation, differentiation, and&#xD;
      regeneration, the additional use of them in the management of peri-implantitis has been&#xD;
      proposed to improve the clinical outcomes and enhance soft and hard tissue regeneration. A&#xD;
      recent systematic review and meta-analysis has been suggested that growth factors might be&#xD;
      associated with better outcomes with regard to PD and BOP, whereas, they did not reveal&#xD;
      statistically significant evidence for yielding additional benefits in the treatment of&#xD;
      peri-implantitis. A randomized clinical trial (RCT) on the reconstructive surgical treatment&#xD;
      of peri-implantitis evaluating concentrated growth factor (CGF) used as a bioresorbable&#xD;
      barrier membrane in combination with a bone substitute, was performed recently by our study&#xD;
      group and demonstrated significant improvements in both clinical and radiographic assessments&#xD;
      at 1-year follow-up. Nevertheless, there is scarce information in the literature regarding&#xD;
      the predictability and long-term stability of autologous growth factors in peri-implantitis&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is, therefore, the aim of this study to investigate the 3-year clinical/radiographic&#xD;
      outcomes of reconstructive surgical therapy of peri-implantitis using a bone substitute&#xD;
      combined with two different bioresorbable barrier membranes, either collagen membrane (CM) or&#xD;
      CGF, and moreover, to identify prognostic indicators influencing the long-term reconstructive&#xD;
      surgical treatment outcome using a multilevel statistical model.&#xD;
