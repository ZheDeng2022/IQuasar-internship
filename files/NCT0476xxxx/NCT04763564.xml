  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis(IPAA; pouch) due to refractory inflammatory&#xD;
      bowel disease and increased bowel frequency in the absence of significant pouch inflammation&#xD;
      will be randomized to liraglutide or placebo in a prospective cross over study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, double-blind, 2-period, placebo- controlled, crossover proof of concept study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten patients with increased bowel frequency defined as bowel frequency &gt; 8 bowel movements in&#xD;
      24 hours on at least 4 of 7 days/week and presence of high bowel frequency &gt; 4 weeks despite&#xD;
      adequate therapy for acute pouchitis or Crohn's like disease of the pouch will be randomized&#xD;
      to either liraglutide or placebo treatment for 6 weeks (Period 1). Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to 1 of 2 treatment sequences, liraglutide-placebo or placebo-liraglutide, and&#xD;
      receive either liraglutide or volume-matched placebo. After a wash-out period of at least 5&#xD;
      days (the half-life of liraglutide is 11-12 hours, thus the minimal washout period of 5 days&#xD;
      is equal to 10 half-life's) patients will be crossed over to the other treatment arm (Period&#xD;
      2). Since high bowel frequency can result in significant malaise and dehydration, patients&#xD;
      not responding to the respective therapies in period 1 may be crossed over after 4 weeks of&#xD;
      therapy or in period 2 can be terminated early at week 4. The rationale behind the early&#xD;
      termination is based on 2 open-label cohorts reporting the efficacy of liraglutide or&#xD;
      exenatide in patients with high output ileostomies (the patient group the most comparable to&#xD;
      the pouch patient population). Glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist therapy even&#xD;
      at the lowest dose showed an almost immediate effect reducing the ostomy output after 1-3&#xD;
      days in most patients.Thus, patients not responding to a 4-week therapy with a GLP-1receptor&#xD;
      agonist are highly unlikely to respond if the therapy would be continued.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Mean 7-Day Bowel Frequency By 30%</measure>
    <time_frame>week 4, week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of patients with a 30% reduction of the mean 7-day bowel frequency at week 4 and week 10 compared to baseline (baseline is defined as the mean 7-day bowel frequency in a 7-day period during the screening period before week 0).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the 7 Day Mean Number of Day and Night Bowel Frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The bowel frequency during the day and night will be recorded on a daily basis. Change in the number of the 7 days mean number of bowel movements during day (from getting up until bedtime) and during night (during sleep) comparing baseline to week 1, week 2, week 3 and week 4 during active treatment with liraglutide or placebo in period 1 or in period 2 (week 7, 8, 9 and 10).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinical Modified Pouch Disease Activity Index (mPDAI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical mPDAI will be measured at baseline, week 4, and week 10. The clinical mPDAI is a composite score of stool frequency, presence of rectal bleeding, fecal urgency/abdominal cramps or fever. The clinical mPDAI score ranges from 0 to 6. Values &lt; 3 are considered as remission, whereas symptoms ≥ 3 are considered as having active pouchitis.</description>

    <description>Treatment will be initiated at 0.6 mg per day for one week. The patient will be instructed to increase the dose to 1.2/day and 1.8 mg /day in week 2 and in week 3, respectively. From week 3 after the start of the drug until week 6 the patient will apply 1.8 mg/day liraglutide. In case of intolerance (e.g. occurrence of refractory nausea) at a higher dose (e.g. 1.8 mg daily, the highest dose in this trial) liraglutide can be reduced to the previous level.</description>
