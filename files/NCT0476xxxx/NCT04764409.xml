  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the structure of malignant liver lesions, two main groups are distinguished - primary&#xD;
      liver cancer and metastatic liver damage. The five-year survival rate of patients with&#xD;
      malignant liver tumors does not exceed 6%. The main and radical method of treatment today is&#xD;
      liver resection. However, surgical treatment is possible only in 10-25% of patients. At the&#xD;
      same time, recurrence of malignant tumors is observed in 60-80% of cases within five years&#xD;
      after surgery, and the number of candidates for repeated liver resection does not exceed 10%.&#xD;
      The high toxicity of systemic chemotherapy limits its use in this group of patients. In this&#xD;
      connection, minimally invasive and at the same time effective methods of local treatment of&#xD;
      malignant liver tumors have been introduced into clinical practice. These methods include:&#xD;
      hepatic artery chemoinfusion, chemoembolization and oil chemoembolization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, a large world experience has already been accumulated in the application of the&#xD;
      above methods of treatment. However, any, even minimally invasive, surgical manipulation can&#xD;
      be associated with the development of complications of varying severity. If complications&#xD;
      arise, there is a risk of interruption of palliative care, which entails a significant&#xD;
      reduction in life expectancy. According to domestic and foreign literature, the occurrence of&#xD;
      complications after intra-arterial chemoembolization occurs in 0.4-10% of patients, and after&#xD;
      intra-arterial chemoinfusion - in 5-30% of patients. In the overwhelming majority of&#xD;
      scientific works, the description of the complications that have arisen is reduced to listing&#xD;
      the latter. Currently, in the Russian and foreign scientific literature there is no&#xD;
      systematization of complications, there is no single clinical classification, algorithms for&#xD;
      the prevention and treatment of complications arising after local intravascular methods of&#xD;
      treatment of patients with malignant liver tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study and systematization of complications arising after intra-arterial chemoembolization&#xD;
      and chemoinfusion of the hepatic artery in patients with malignant liver tumors will make it&#xD;
      possible to create prevention and treatment algorithms. Thus, it will help prevent&#xD;
      interruption of palliative care and increase the life expectancy of this cohort of patients.&#xD;
