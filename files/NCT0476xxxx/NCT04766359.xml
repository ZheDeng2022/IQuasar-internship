    <textblock>
      This trial is a prospective, parallel controlled, randomized, open, multi-center phase III&#xD;
      clinical trial. The trial will enroll 364 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma who are&#xD;
      staged T1-2N0-1M0 (except T1N0M0) (UICC 8th edition) . This experiment was participated by&#xD;
      multiple centers of Nanjing Gulou Hospital, Jiangsu Provincial People's Hospital, Jiangsu&#xD;
      Cancer Hospital, Nanjing Military Region General Hospital, Jiangsu Provincial Hospital of&#xD;
      Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Zhongda Hospital. Each center competes for admission of&#xD;
      cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be randomly assigned (using the random number table method according to the&#xD;
      order of entry) to the experimental group to receive albumin-bound paclitaxel combined with&#xD;
      IMRT concurrent radiotherapy, or the control group to receive cisplatin combined with IMRT&#xD;
      concurrent radiotherapy.&#xD;

    <description>Nasopharyngeal + neck MRI and nasopharyngoscopy: the nasopharyngeal mass disappeared; the nasopharyngeal mucosa was smooth and no lesions were seen on the nasopharyngoscope. The tumor is clinically considered to have completely subsided. Neck MRI showed complete regression of cervical lymph nodes, or combined with clinical findings that the lymph node lesions completely resolved.</description>
