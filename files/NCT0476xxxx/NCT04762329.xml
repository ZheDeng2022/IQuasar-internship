    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this Early Adoption project is to gather evidence for how Managing&#xD;
      My Pain Program (MMP), a novel digital pain management application can enable better care at&#xD;
      home for chronic pain sufferers in the province of Ontario, Canada across 4 sites in urban,&#xD;
      community, and rural settings&#xD;

      Chronic pain imposes a large burden on individuals and society. A patient-centric digital&#xD;
      chronic pain management application, Managing My Pain Program (MMP) that incorporates&#xD;
      validated questionnaires can be used to enhance communication between providers and patients&#xD;
      and promote self-management to evaluate the extent of patient engagement with the app when&#xD;
      used in clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives for this project is to evaluate the engagement in patients using MMP, and&#xD;
      to assess improvements in clinical outcomes directly relevant for pain management, as&#xD;
      measured by clinically-validated tools.&#xD;
