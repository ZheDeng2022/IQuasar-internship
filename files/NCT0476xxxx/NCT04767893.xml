    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate sepsis biomarkers as soluble triggering receptor expressed on&#xD;
      myeloid cells 1 (sTREM-1) and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (sUPAR) in&#xD;
      diagnosis of sepsis in comparison to the traditional blood culture and C-reactive protein&#xD;
      (CRP) and to evaluate the prognostic value of these biomarkers in comparison to sequential&#xD;
      organ failure assessment score (SOFA score), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation&#xD;
      II ( APACHI score), 28 day mortality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is usually diagnosed in patients have clinically suspected infections with systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) manifestations. Patients with SIRS as those with trauma&#xD;
      or stroke have the same classic infection signs such as fever and elevated leukocytic count,&#xD;
      as long as the microbiological diagnosis is the ultimate diagnostic method, but it has poor&#xD;
      sensitivity with delayed results. New biomarkers such as sTREM-1 and sUPAR can be used for&#xD;
      rapid diagnosis of sepsis and differentiating it from non infectious inflammatory syndromes.&#xD;
      Also these soluble biomarkers can be used for predicting the prognosis of sepsis patients&#xD;
