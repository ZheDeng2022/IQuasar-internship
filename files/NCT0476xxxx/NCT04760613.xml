  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept trial is designed to compare effects&#xD;
      of oral CBD 600mg to placebo (PCB) in 40 outpatients with chronic spinal radiculopathies&#xD;
      (without co-occurring Opioid Use Disorder), maintained on stable moderate to high-dose opioid&#xD;
      analgesics for a minimum of 3-months, and motivated to decrease their opioid analgesic&#xD;
      maintenance dose. The trial duration will be 6-months (from the point of randomization) and&#xD;
      will include a 4-month treatment period (following randomization) of daily CBD 600mg vs&#xD;
      placebo, followed by 2 months off of study medication or placebo. Safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      CBD will be assessed throughout the trial. The primary efficacy outcome is change in opioid&#xD;
      maintenance dose from baseline to end of the treatment period at 16-weeks&#xD;
      post-randomization/initiation of treatment with a Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM)&#xD;
      statistical analysis performed to assess between group treatment effects of CBD relative to&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Score on PROMIS Anxiety Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS Anxiety Short Form consists of 8 statements describing feelings associated with pain. Each statement is answered on a scale of 1 (never) to 5 (always). The total range of score is 8-40, with a higher score indicating a higher feeling of anxiety.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Score on Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>PCS consists of 13 statements describing different thoughts and feelings that may be associated with pain. The degree to which one has these thoughts and feelings when experiencing pain is indicated on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 4 (all the time). The total range of score is 0-52, with a higher score indicating more frequent negative thoughts.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>BPI - Short Form is a self-administered questionnaire. It evaluates:&#xD;
Pain intensity: 4 questions answered on a likert scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine). Total range of score is 0-40, where a higher score indicates more intense pain.&#xD;
Pain-related interference: 7 categories answered on a likert scale of 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes). Total range of score is 0-70, where a higher score indicates more pain-related interference.</description>
