      Objective To evaluate change in same-day pulmonary function testing in pediatric patients&#xD;
      receiving OMT compared to those receiving usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods For this study, we selected patients utilizing the following inclusion criteria: 1)&#xD;
      ages 7-18 years, 2) a diagnosis of asthma, 3) patients receiving care at a primary care-based&#xD;
      asthma clinic, and 4) those patients who had baseline spirometry. Selected patients were then&#xD;
      randomized to either an OMT or a control group. We excluded patients who were experiencing an&#xD;
      acute asthma exacerbation. Patients in the OMT group were treated with rib raising and&#xD;
      suboccipital release, in addition to standard asthma care, while control group patients&#xD;
      received standard care only. A second PFT was performed on both groups at the end of the&#xD;
      visit. OMT was performed by multiple osteopathic pediatric residents who were specifically&#xD;
      trained for the purposes of this study. Change in spirometry results (FVC, FEV1, FVC/FEV1,&#xD;
      and FEF 25-75%) were then compared.&#xD;

      NOTE: The OMTs were done either by our OMM attending at that time (Dr. Wolf) or by residents&#xD;
      trained by her for this study (Drs. Jones, Pe, Bryant and Regan,)&#xD;
