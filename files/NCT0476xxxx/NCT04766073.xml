  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last decade we have been exposed to the complication of a caesarean section called a&#xD;
      &quot;niche&quot;. A niche is an anaerobic defect in the location of the cesarean section, which&#xD;
      represents the discontinuity of the endometrium and myometrium. A niche is usually diagnosed&#xD;
      by ultrasound, and can also be diagnosed by hysterosalpingogram or hysteroscopy. In the&#xD;
      presence of a niche women suffer more frequently from irregular bleeding, dysmenorrhea,&#xD;
      chronic pelvic pain, and dyspareunia. We believe that a combination of tissue ischemia and&#xD;
      thinning of the scar tissue that forms, causes a niche to form. Large randomized studies&#xD;
      regarding the preferred surgical technique in cesarean section, including various methods of&#xD;
      incision closure have found that there is no single method that is obviously superior.&#xD;
      However, these studies did not examine niche formation as a complication of cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will examine whether a unique incision closure method reduces post-cesarean&#xD;
      niche formation.&#xD;
