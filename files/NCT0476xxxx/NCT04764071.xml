  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal stones are one of the most common urological problems and there are multiple methods&#xD;
      for their management such as percutaneous nephrolithotomy, mini and ultra-mini percutaneous&#xD;
      nephrolithotomy, flexible ureteroscopy and laser lithotripsy, and extracorporeal shock wave&#xD;
      lithotripsy. percutaneous nephrolithotomy is the treatment of choice for the management of&#xD;
      renal calculi, in spite of the increasing stone clearance rate, the complication rate of this&#xD;
      procedure is relatively higher.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nephrolithiasis is a major worldwide source of morbidity, constituting a common urological&#xD;
      disease affecting 10-15% of the world population. Consistent technical advancements provide&#xD;
      surgeons and patients with several options for the treatment of renal calculi, including&#xD;
      extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), retrograde&#xD;
      intrarenal surgery (RIRS), and conventional open surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is generally considered a gold standard in renal stones&#xD;
      particularly larger than 2cm or lower calyceal larger than 1cm offering high stone-free rates&#xD;
      after the first treatment as compared to the other minimal invasive lithotripsy techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PCNL)is a procedure to remove kidney stones from the kidney&#xD;
      through a small incision in the skin and it was initially described in the literature by&#xD;
      Fernström and Johansson in 1976. Traditionally, the prone position was considered the only&#xD;
      position to obtain renal access for PCNL. In 1987, Valdivia Urìa presented the supine PCNL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCNL is also recommended in the case of smaller stones in patients with contraindications for&#xD;
      shockwave lithotripsy (SWL), such as shockwave resistant stones and anatomical malformations,&#xD;
      or when a patient elects PCNL as a procedure of higher efficacy. However, serious&#xD;
      complications although rare should be expected following this percutaneous procedure as,&#xD;
      Perioperative bleeding, urine leakage from nephrocutaneous tract, pelvicalyceal system&#xD;
      injury, pain.( Kyriazis et al 2015) colon injury, hydrothorax, pneumothorax, prolonged leak,&#xD;
      sepsis, ureteral stone, vascular injury and acute loss of kidney, all are individually&#xD;
      confronted complications after PCNL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCNL techniques include: standard PCNL (S-PCNL), mini-PCNL (also called miniperc),&#xD;
      ultra-mini-PCNL (UM-PCNL) and the recently introduced micro-PCNL. One of the most important&#xD;
      differences between the various PCNL techniques is the size of renal access, which&#xD;
      contributes to the broad spectrum of complications and outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>Patients are positioned in the lithotomy position and a 6F ureteral catheter is placed and the bladder is drained with a 16F urethral Foley catheter. After ureteral catheterization, patients are placed in the prone position, and percutaneous access of the desired calyx is achieved under fluoroscopic guidance with the use of an 18-gauge needle and a guidewire passage. Tract dilation is accomplished by using Amplatz dilators up to 30F. Pneumatic lithotripter is used for fragmentation and stone removal is accomplished with retrieval graspers through a rigid 22F nephroscope. An 18-24 F nephrostomy tube is placed at the end of the operation.</description>

Tract dilation is accomplished by using Amplatz dilators up to 12-14 F fascial dilator was used to dilate the nephrostomy tract to pass the 13 F semi-rigid plastic sheath. Then, a 9.5-F, rigid ureteroscope (KARL STORZ Medical Instruments) was introduced to the sheath. The renal stones were broken into pieces using holmium laser lithotripsy. Finally, the ureteroscope and sheath were removed and the tract site was packed for 2-3 min. then placement of double J stent will be done according to the decision of the operating surgeon for 3 to 4 weeks.</description>
