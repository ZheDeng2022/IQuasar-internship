  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized controlled trial the investigators will determine whether a mobile health&#xD;
      intervention can increase physical activity levels in AYA cancer survivors over a one year&#xD;
      period. The investigators will recruit 320 cancer survivors in Alberta who were diagnosed&#xD;
      with a first cancer between the ages of 15 to 39 years and are within one year of treatment&#xD;
      completion. Participants will be randomized into either the control group (educational&#xD;
      information) or the intervention group (educational information; personalized physical&#xD;
      activity plan; activity tracker watch; access to a private, online survivor community;&#xD;
      motivational text messages and check-in calls/e-mails). All participants will complete&#xD;
      fitness testing and questionnaires at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. A final measurement&#xD;
      at 24 months will test long-term effectiveness.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need for adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer research because the number of&#xD;
      new cancers in young people is increasing and the survivor population is growing.&#xD;
      Interventions that try to reduce problems that affect people after cancer are particularly&#xD;
      important since its treatments can have negative effects on survivors' physical and mental&#xD;
      health even decades after diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the many positive effects of physical activity (e.g. improved fitness and quality of&#xD;
      life), the study aims to encourage AYA cancer survivors to be more physically active as they&#xD;
      shift from treatment to survivorship care. The main goal of this study is to see if a&#xD;
      home-based, mobile health (mHealth) physical activity intervention can increase physical&#xD;
      activity levels by at least 90 minutes/week compared to baseline in AYA cancer survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a two-center randomized controlled trial of 320 AYA cancer&#xD;
      survivors. Participants (N=320) will be Albertan residents, diagnosed with a first cancer&#xD;
      between the ages of 15 and 39 years, and within one year of cancer treatment completion. At&#xD;
      the start of the study, participants will complete fitness testing and questionnaires.&#xD;
      Participants will then be randomly put into either a control or intervention group. The&#xD;
      control group will receive educational information only. The intervention group will also&#xD;
      receive a personalized physical activity plan, an activity tracker watch, access to a&#xD;
      private, online survivor community, motivational text messages and check-in calls/e-mails.&#xD;
      Fitness testing and questionnaires will be repeated at 6 and 12 months to see if the&#xD;
      intervention increased physical activity levels and improved health outcomes among the&#xD;
      participants in the intervention group compared to controls. A final measurement at 24 months&#xD;
      will test long-term use.&#xD;
