  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common hereditary retinal disorder (accounts for 20% of&#xD;
      children attending blind schools in Pakistan) which causes degeneration of rod and cone&#xD;
      photoreceptors. Rods and cones largely depend on the retinal pigment epithelium for their&#xD;
      proper functioning. Various growth factors and their receptors are present in retinal&#xD;
      epithelium and a number of genes are responsible for the production of these growth factors.&#xD;
      Genetic mutation in any of these genes causes retinal degeneration by progressive loss of&#xD;
      retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors. The disease initially starts with night&#xD;
      blindness and leads to the loss of central vision and eventually total blindness. To date,&#xD;
      there is no definitive cure for patients suffering from RP. Recently, stem cell based&#xD;
      therapies have shown great promise for the management of RP. It is well documented that&#xD;
      umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells (UMSCs) have the ability to release various&#xD;
      paracrine and immunomodulatory factors that are similar to those synthesized by retinal&#xD;
      pigment epithelium. Multiple routes including systemic (intravenous) and localized&#xD;
      (subretinal, intravitreal, suprachoroidal and sub-tenon) have been employed to administer&#xD;
      UMSCs for the management of RP. It is important to note that deep sub-tenon region (space&#xD;
      between the sclera and the conjunctiva) acts as both natural culture medium for cells and as&#xD;
      immune privileged site because of avascularity of the region. It has been reported that the&#xD;
      injection of UMSCs in sub-tenon space of human subjects have improved the visual acuity even&#xD;
      after 1 year post-injection. In addition, the injection of UMSCs in suprachoroidal space&#xD;
      enhances the entry of growth factors released by the cells into choroidal flow and maintain&#xD;
      the constant growth factors secretion to the choroidal and retinal tissues. Limoli and&#xD;
      colleagues were the first to report the suprachoroidal administration of cells being the safe&#xD;
      mode of cell delivery with no complications. The present study is aimed to investigate the&#xD;
      safety and therapeutic efficacy of UMSC injection employing two different routes (sub-tenon&#xD;
      injection versus suprachoroidal injection) for the treatment of RP in human subjects.&#xD;

      Isolation and characterization of human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells&#xD;
      (UMSCs): The culturing and characterization of UMSCs will be performed as documented by Ali&#xD;
      and colleagues. Briefly, human umbilical cord tissues along with informed consent forms will&#xD;
      be collected from COVID-19- and hepatitis B, C virus-negative women with healthy pregnancies&#xD;
      during the Cesarean Section surgery after completion of gestation period. The umbilical cord&#xD;
      tissue will be transported in sterile 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing&#xD;
      penicillin and streptomycin on ice. In the biosafety cabinet, the cord will be washed with&#xD;
      4-5 changes of sterile 1x PBS and placed in a Petri plate with 15ml PBS. The cord will then&#xD;
      gently scrap with a surgical blade to remove any dead cells. A 9 cm umbilical cord will be&#xD;
      cut into three equal pieces and wash thoroughly to remove blood clots, umbilical cord&#xD;
      arteries, and veins. Segments will be washed three times with PBS and minced. The minced&#xD;
      pieces will be incubated in 17.5ml of collagenase solution (201 U/ml collagenase type I in&#xD;
      serum-free DMEM-HG) in a 50ml conical tube for ~3 hrs in an incubator at 5% CO2, 95% humidity&#xD;
      at 37oC. After ~3 hrs, the digested lysate will be passed through strainer and will be&#xD;
      diluted three times with 1x PBS. Following centrifugation, the cells will be seeded into two&#xD;
      T-25cm2 flasks and will be placed in an incubator at 5% CO2, 95% humidity at 37o C. The&#xD;
      flasks will be fed with fresh media (DMEM-HG supplemented with 20% FBS and 1% antibiotic&#xD;
      solution) every third day. At around day 18, cells will reach up to 85% confluency and will&#xD;
      be transferred in two T-75cm2 flasks with media replaced at alternate days. UMSCs at P3 will&#xD;
      be characterized using different specific antibodies. Cells at P3 will be employed for&#xD;
      injection in RP patients.&#xD;
