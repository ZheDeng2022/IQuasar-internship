    <textblock>
      Participants will completed a 5 minute warm-up on a stationary bike. Next, participants will&#xD;
      perform 3 practice trials of the double leg jump landing (DJL) test off of a 30 cm box. In&#xD;
      order for the trial to count the participants need to maintain their landing posture for at&#xD;
      least 2 seconds, if they are unable to do so the trial will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of three practice trials of the DJL test, the first taping condition&#xD;
      will be applied. Each participant will receive 3 taping conditions to the dominant leg, a&#xD;
      gluteus medius facilitation (GM), a spiral technique (ST), and no tape (NT). The order of&#xD;
      conditions will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of a no tape condition will act a control for both the jumping protocol and the&#xD;
      Y-balance test. For this condition, no tape or intervention of any kind will be applied to&#xD;
      the subject before completing either tasks. Regardless of the order of randomly assigned&#xD;
      taping condition, the participant will rest 10 minutes in a non-weight bearing position&#xD;
      before completing a round of testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 10-minute rest, 3D motion analysis sensors will be placed on the participant to&#xD;
      assess hip internal rotation and knee valgus in the frontal plane. After the sensors are&#xD;
      applied, the first follow-up Y Balance Test will be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will complete the Y Balance Test 3 times, once for each condition. For the&#xD;
      trial to count, the reach foot is not permitted to touch the floor and the hands have to&#xD;
      remain stationary on the pelvis. If the participant fails to meet the testing criteria, the&#xD;
      trial will be repeated. At the end of the trial, each testing direction distance will be&#xD;
      written down and a mean score will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the first Y balance test, three DJL tests will be performed, each separated by a&#xD;
      60-second rest period. Once the participant completes 3 approved trials, the first taping&#xD;
      condition will be removed and the procedure will be repeated for the second and third taping&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The facilitative gluteus medius application was applied from origin to insertion of the&#xD;
      muscle, as specified by Dr. Kase (2013). The subject was positioned in side-lying with the&#xD;
      dominant leg facing up. The CKTP cut a Y-strip of Kinesio® Tex Classic Tape the same distance&#xD;
      from the participant's ASIS to the greater trochanter of the femur. The tape was anchored at&#xD;
      the ASIS with no tension followed by the participant moving into approximately 90° hip&#xD;
      flexion, adduction, and internal rotation. Then, each tail of the Y-strip was applied at 25%&#xD;
      tension towards the greater trochanter where it was anchored again with no tension. Following&#xD;
      application, the participant was instructed to remain in a position of comfort for 10 minutes&#xD;
      before continuing with the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second taping condition utilized is a spiral technique (ST), applied with Kinesio® Tex&#xD;
      Performance Plus Tape. Participant positioning included standing in an open-packed,&#xD;
      double-leg stance with feet approximately hip width apart. The CKTP anchored an I-strip of&#xD;
      tape with no tension on the participant's medial aspect of the middle, tibia. With a&#xD;
      stabilizing hand on the anchor, the practitioner pulled the tape with 75-100% tension and&#xD;
      applied towards the lateral aspect of the tibiofemoral joint, Once the tape moved to the&#xD;
      posterior side of the knee, the CKTP reduced the tension to 0% over the popliteal fossa so as&#xD;
      to reduce skin tearing and provide another mechanism for pulling the knee out of valgum. When&#xD;
      the tape crossed diagonally over the popliteal fossa, the CKTP again employed at 75-100%&#xD;
      tension from the medial femoral condyle to the vastus lateralis. The tape was then secured to&#xD;
      the posterior thigh with an anchor at 0% tension. Thus, the tape created a spiral shape up&#xD;
      the participants' leg. Again, the subject was directed to rest comfortably in a non-weight&#xD;
      bearing position for 10 minutes.&#xD;
