  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a common mental disorder and is together with anxiety the global leading cause&#xD;
      of all non-fatal burden of disease. Currently supported treatment for depression is&#xD;
      antidepressant medication and different psychotherapeutic interventions. Many patients&#xD;
      experience, however, adverse effects of antidepressant medication, while at the same time the&#xD;
      access to psychotherapeutic interventions are limited. This is particularly the case for&#xD;
      patients suffering from moderate depression. Many patients who suffer from depression turn to&#xD;
      complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), and among those therapies often spiritual&#xD;
      healing. There is some evidence that consulting a spiritual healer can be beneficial for&#xD;
      patients suffer from depression, and that spiritual healing is associated with low risk. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is therefor to conduct a pilot RCT (spiritual healing as addition to&#xD;
      usual care versus usual care alone) in preparation of a larger trial in adults with moderate&#xD;
      depression to examine feasibility and individuals' experience of spiritual healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two parallel groups. A total of&#xD;
      28 adult patients with moderate depression according to the M.I.N.I. PLUS DSM-V criteria will&#xD;
      be randomized to spiritual healing in addition to usual care intervention (n=14) or usual&#xD;
      care alone (n=14). Ten treatment sessions (lasting 45-60 minutes each) of spiritual healing&#xD;
      will be administered as an adjunct to usual care and compared to usual care alone. Reduction&#xD;
      in depression symptoms will be measured with Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Montgomery&#xD;
      and Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) collected at baseline, week 8 and 16, in addition&#xD;
      to BDI measurement collected 6 and 12 months after inclusion in the study. To investigate&#xD;
      participants' experience with spiritual healing, a qualitative study will be included using a&#xD;
      phenomenological hermeneutical method and semi-structured interviews.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background Depression is a common mental disorder and is together with anxiety the global&#xD;
      leading cause of all non-fatal burden of disease. The core symptoms of depression are lowered&#xD;
      mood, discouragement, loss of sense and meaning in life, lack of interest in other people and&#xD;
      ordinary duties, and lack of energy and appetite. In addition, often diminished self-esteem,&#xD;
      self-reproach and a feeling of guilt. These symptoms may vary in intensity and duration.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, around half of people with depression worldwide do not receive treatment. Most&#xD;
      mental disorders emerge before the age of 30, and lack of treatment might contribute to&#xD;
      disability for many crucial years of an individual's life. In Norway, the 12 months&#xD;
      prevalence and lifetime prevalence of depression is 10% and 20% respectably, higher in women&#xD;
      than in men. Depression has been identified as a strong predictor for use of complementary&#xD;
      and alternative medicine (CAM). A recent Norwegian study demonstrates that only 10.9% of&#xD;
      those with moderate depression and/or anxiety visited psychiatric outpatient services while&#xD;
      17.6 % visited a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) provider. This fact&#xD;
      demonstrates that people with depression might be willing to seek help also from less&#xD;
      established sources, such as CAM providers. Thus, it is possible that different CAM&#xD;
      modalities may serve as a substitute or an alternative when access to&#xD;
      psychologist/psychiatric services is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional medicine classifies depression as a mood disorder that manifests itself across a&#xD;
      wide range of disease/symptom severity. Depression can be classified as mild, moderate or&#xD;
      severe. Symptoms must have been persistent for at least two weeks and not be related to other&#xD;
      medical or psychiatric diagnoses, or be due to substances. The World Health Organization&#xD;
      ranks the social costs of depression as the 4th highest of all diseases. Furthermore, by 2020&#xD;
      current trends indicate that depression will represent the highest cost to society of any&#xD;
      disease. Clearly, prevention, early diagnosis and intervention of depression have huge social&#xD;
      significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors&#xD;
      (SSRIs) have recently been shown to have best effect on severe depression, and no effect&#xD;
      beyond placebo for mild and moderate depression. At the same time, SSRIs can be associated&#xD;
      with serious adverse effects, and are associated with a higher vulnerability to develop a&#xD;
      depressive episode later in life. Thus, one of the most common treatment options for&#xD;
      depression has been documented to be of little or no help beyond placebo for moderate&#xD;
      depression while at the same time possibly inducing serious adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Norwegian minister of health, Bent Høye, has taken the patients' request for an improved&#xD;
      treatment situation seriously, and sent a letter to the five regional health authorities in&#xD;
      which he wrote: &quot;Many patients in psychological health care do not want to be treated with&#xD;
      medication. These patients must be heard and taken seriously. Patients cannot be forced to&#xD;
      take medication as long as necessary care and treatment can be provided otherwise&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or structured psychological therapy should always be&#xD;
      offered patients who do not receive, or do not want pharmaceutical antidepressant treatment.&#xD;
      However, the waiting list for such treatments is often long due to the lack of competent&#xD;
      professionals (psychologists and psychiatrist), especially in rural communities, but also at&#xD;
      the district psychiatric centers are there long waiting lists for such treatments. These&#xD;
      centers have to prioritize patients with major depression, meaning that patients with&#xD;
      moderate depression have even less access to CBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spiritual healing for depression. Spiritual healing is one of the most frequently used CAM&#xD;
      modalities in Norway. It is understood as an energy based therapeutic approach to healing. A&#xD;
      spiritual healer uses the hands to balance and harmonies the body and thereby place the&#xD;
      client in a position to self-heal. The healing treatment focuses on the whole person&#xD;
      (physically, psychologically and emotionally) as well as the environment around the patient.&#xD;
      Scientific evidence indicates that users typically praise CAM treatment for offering symptoms&#xD;
      relief, reduce side effects of conventional treatment, enhancing their ability to cope&#xD;
      physiologically and emotionally, providing an alternative to pharmaceuticals, and offering a&#xD;
      close patient-practitioner relationship during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is some evidence that spiritual healing can be beneficial for patients suffer from&#xD;
      depression and spiritual healing is associated with low risk. In a preliminary study&#xD;
      conducted by this current research group, a mean decrease in depression score of 3.1 points&#xD;
      (range 0-4) on a 7 point scale was found (n=9). The symptom was rated on a scale from 0-6&#xD;
      where 0 was &quot;as good as it could be &quot;and 6 was &quot;as bad as it could be&quot; (MYMOP scale). Only&#xD;
      one patient reported no change in depression symptoms after healing treatment. None of the&#xD;
      patients experienced worsening of depression symptoms during the healing treatment while the&#xD;
      majority (n=5) had a reduction of 4 points. More research is however needed to confirm these&#xD;
      findings and to identify modifications needed in the design of a larger RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The objectives of this study are to conduct a pilot RCT (spiritual healing as&#xD;
      addition to usual care versus usual care alone) in preparation of a larger trial in adults&#xD;
      with moderate depression, and further to examine the feasibility of the study design and the&#xD;
      participants experience of spiritual healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Pilot RCT with two parallel groups. A total of 28 individuals with moderate&#xD;
      depression will be randomized to a spiritual healing intervention as an adjunct to usual care&#xD;
      (n=14) or to usual care alone (control) (n=14). In the current study the entire spiritual&#xD;
      healing package understood as everything a healer does in a consultation (visiting a healer)&#xD;
      will be studied, including the use of hands to balance and harmonies the body and sometimes&#xD;
      life style advice. Included in the treatment is the interaction between the patient and the&#xD;
      therapist. A positive interaction between the patient and the therapist (alliance) is&#xD;
      necessary for the patient to feel free to verbally express painful present and past&#xD;
      experiences that may be related to the patient's psychological complaints (e.g., pragmatic&#xD;
      research approach).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent, randomization, control group, allocation concealment: Before the&#xD;
      randomization procedures starts, the participants who meet the inclusion criteria and have&#xD;
      agreed to participate, read and sign the informed consent after the physician have informed&#xD;
      that the participants can withdraw from the study for no reason. The physicians (Arendal and&#xD;
      Oslo) will execute the randomisation by drawing sealed opaque envelopes with numbers&#xD;
      consecutively from one to 28. Each new patient enrolled in the study will receive the next&#xD;
      consecutive envelope, which will be opened after the patient has ended the consultation by&#xD;
      the physician, whereas the information about assignment will be known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomisation system with variable block sizes of between two and six will be used, in&#xD;
      order to eliminate confounders of a personnel or structural nature, thus balancing group&#xD;
      allocation throughout the study period. Within each block, an equal number of patients will&#xD;
      be randomly allocated to either an intervention group with spiritual healing and to usual&#xD;
      care, or a control group with usual care alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-study procedures Patients seeking care for mood related symptoms in Arendal or Oslo will&#xD;
      be asked by the physician to participate in the study and screened for possible enrolment.&#xD;
      The staff will be oriented about the study procedures and trained before start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spiritual healing The spiritual healing will be based on an assessment of the total health&#xD;
      situation of the individual patient. Spiritual healing will mainly consist of a treatment&#xD;
      where the healers hold their hands for some time at different parts of the patient's body,&#xD;
      known as &quot;power points&quot;, outside the patients clothing. The consultation might also include&#xD;
      possible life-style advice. This can necessarily lead to slightly different treatment given&#xD;
      to each patient. The treatments will, however last for 45-60 minutes each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Torunn Anthonsen (Arendal) and Annett Furuseth (Oslo) will perform the healing treatments.&#xD;
      The healers are are trained as healers and member of Norwegian healers association (Norges&#xD;
      Healerforbund). The healers have worked full time as spiritual healers for more than 5 years.&#xD;
      As members of Norwegian healers association, the healers have liability insurance in case of&#xD;
      occurrence of harmful events of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual care Throughout the 16-week intervention period, all participants will be advised to&#xD;
      follow the treatment plan given by the physician in Arendal and Oslo. This may include&#xD;
      consultation with their physician including life style advices, referral to a psychologist/&#xD;
      psychiatric consultations, anti-depressive medication, and sick leave.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation The study nurse (NAFKAM) will inquire with regard to completeness of&#xD;
      prescribed treatment at week 2 and latest at week 16. The patient will also be asked whether&#xD;
      he/she has used any other kind of medication, in particular antidepressant medication,&#xD;
      visited another health care providers and/or received any other treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention, all patients, stepwise description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with mood related symptoms who attend the practice of the study physicians in&#xD;
      Arendal and Oslo will be asked to participate in a diagnostic interview (conducted by the&#xD;
      physician). If the patients meet the inclusion criteria for moderate depression, a treatment&#xD;
      plan will be made before randomization to one of the two study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients diagnosed with moderate depression according to the M.I.N.I. PLUS DSM-V criteria&#xD;
      will be presented to the study and invited to participate until n=28 have accepted the&#xD;
      invitation and signed a written consent to participate in the study. 14 participants will be&#xD;
      included in Arendal and 14 in in Oslo, (n=7) individuals in intervention group and (n=7) in&#xD;
      the control group The physician complete the MADRS baseline questionnaire and the patient&#xD;
      complete the BDI baseline questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study nurse (NAFKAM) will then formally include the patient according to the randomisation&#xD;
      system with the next envelope in the row.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included patients will be randomized to spiritual healing plus usual care (intervention&#xD;
      group) or usual care alone (control group) Both patients in the intervention group and in the&#xD;
      control group are urged to follow the treatment recommendations given by the physician (for&#xD;
      example anti-depressant medication or consultations with a psychologist/psychiatrist).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Intervention for the intervention group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assignment to healing: Name, e-mail address and phone-number of the patients randomized to&#xD;
      the intervention group will be delivered (by SMS or email) to the spiritual healer by the&#xD;
      research nurse directly after the randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spiritual healer will contact the patient as soon as possible after the healer have&#xD;
      received the name and phone-number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the intervention group will get an appointment for healing treatment,&#xD;
      and will undergo the first healing session within 2 weeks after inrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be offered 10 healing sessions. The last follow-up healing treatment session&#xD;
      must be completed by the end of week 16 of the study (the day of the first healing session is&#xD;
      defined as week 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
      At week 8 and 16, the participants and the study physician will complete the BDI and MADR&#xD;
      questionnaire. In addition will the participants be asked about adverse effects as part of&#xD;
      their form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four months after the study inclusion, interviews will be conducted with participants in both&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study nurse (NAFKAM) will contact the participants after 6 and 12 months, and remind the&#xD;
      participants to complete the BDI questionnaire (follow-up data). The questionnaire will be&#xD;
      forwarded to the participants and will be returned by mail in a pre-payed envelope (figure&#xD;
      1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal and loss to follow-up If a patient chooses to withdraw before week 16, all data&#xD;
      collected will be permanently deleted. If the patient is lost to follow-up, data collected up&#xD;
      to the day of drop out will be used for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Differences in BDI and Madras score between groups as well as adverse&#xD;
      effects will be described descriptively only, due to the pilot nature of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative analysis The qualitative data, will be analyzed using a descriptive qualitative&#xD;
      content analysis. Knowledge and understanding of the phenomena under study will be provided&#xD;
      through a systematic classification process of coding and identifying themes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size No sample size calculation is needed for a pilot RCT. A study size of 14&#xD;
      participants in each group is chosen to generate sufficient interviews (saturation on that&#xD;
      point is assumed) for the qualitative study. The findings of this pilot study will be used to&#xD;
      calculate the sample size in a potential future RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data handling management All patient data and the index that links trial numbers with&#xD;
      individual participants will be kept under lock, and the key will be in the possession of&#xD;
      NAFKAM. Trial number alone will identify all data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coding and punching Data entry will be undertaken at NAFKAM. Responsible for coding and&#xD;
      punching is Agnete Kristoffersen. All data will be read twice to ensure against random bias&#xD;
      in the coding and punching process. Trine Stub will be responsible for obtaining and analyze&#xD;
      the qualitative data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Data analysis will be done utilizing the IBM statistical package SPSS&#xD;
      (http://www.spss.com).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and safety monitoring A steering group will be responsible for quality control and meet&#xD;
      on a regular basis throughout the study period. The Steering Group will be convened as an&#xD;
      emergency in the event of serious adverse effects associated with the trial to decide on&#xD;
      appropriate action to prevent recurrence. Regular meetings will concern any reported adverse&#xD;
      effects, protocol violation, the recruitment rate, and any practical issues concerning local&#xD;
      coordination and the therapists as well as any issues raised by participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and patient safety The patients will be informed about the study through a pamphlet as&#xD;
      well as verbally by the study nurse, and, if willing to participate, asked to give a written&#xD;
      informed consent. All patients will follow usual care regardless of healing treatment and&#xD;
      adverse events will be recorded at each treatment session. No systematic studies have been&#xD;
      published on adverse effects of spiritual healing for depression, however, previous research&#xD;
      has demonstrated that spiritual healing is associated with low risk. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in accordance with the Helsinki declaration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics&#xD;
      (REK 2019/63692). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.&#xD;
