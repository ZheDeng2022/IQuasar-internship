  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the use of a circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assay, ie,&#xD;
      a &quot;liquid biopsy,&quot; as a tool to identify triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients who&#xD;
      will or will not experience benefit from treatment with capecitabine. Participants will be&#xD;
      monitored for changes in ctDNA in the blood over time received during capecitabine treatment.&#xD;
      Results of ctDNA analysis will be correlated to genetic characteristics of individual tumors.&#xD;
      This may inform future clinical trials in which patients could receive a different treatment&#xD;
      than capecitabine to reduce their risk of breast cancer relapse.&#xD;

      The Primary Objective is to characterize the circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) profile of&#xD;
      triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in participants with residual disease after standard&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) receiving standard-of-care adjuvant capecitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Secondary Objectives are to correlate ctDNA levels with genomic features and survival.&#xD;

    <description>In participants with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who have received standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), levels of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) will be assessed at baseline and after 6 months of standard adjuvant capecitabine treatment. The outcome will be reported as the number of participants who are:&#xD;
ctDNA+ (ctDNA-positive) at baseline and at 6 months.&#xD;
ctDNA+ at baseline but ctDNA- (ctDNA-negative) at 6 months.&#xD;
ctDNA- at baseline and at 6 months.&#xD;
ctDNA- at baseline but ctDNA+ at 6 months.&#xD;
The outcome is a number without dispersion.</description>
