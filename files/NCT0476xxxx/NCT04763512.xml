    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, prospective, randomized, open-label, controlled trial of 200 infants&#xD;
      42±7 days of age. Subjects will be randomized to one of two open label feeding intervention&#xD;
      group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intact Cow's Milk Protein Formula Group (CMFG) (n = 100) or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Partially Hydrolysed Whey Formula Group (pHFG) (n = 100).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) affects 15 - 30% of children. Approximately 45% of these cases have an&#xD;
      onset within the first 6 months of life and 60% develop within the first year (Bieber 2010).&#xD;
      Besides environmental factors, the aetiology of AD has been found to be associated with&#xD;
      genetic variants involved in skin barrier function defect and inflammation, leading to dry&#xD;
      skin with increases in susceptibility to environmental exposures (Bieber 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partially hydrolysed cow's milk (whey) protein infant formula (pHF) has been shown to be&#xD;
      effective in prevention of AD, both among at-risk and healthy infants (Exl, Deland et al.&#xD;
      2000, von Berg, Koletzko et al. 2003, Jingrana and Dunjina 2015). However, to date there are&#xD;
      no published pediatric data to document the relationship between partially hydrolysed protein&#xD;
      formulas and skin barrier function, specifically evaluating the effect of pHF on&#xD;
      Trans-epidermal Water Loss (TEWL) among infants. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect on skin barrier function as measured by TEWL and we hypothesize that infants consuming&#xD;
      partially hydrolysed starter formula will have lower TEWL when compared infants consuming&#xD;
      intact cow's milk protein starter formula.&#xD;
