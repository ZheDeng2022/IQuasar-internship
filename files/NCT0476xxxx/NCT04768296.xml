    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess efficacy, safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of Berzosertib in combination with Topotecan in participants with&#xD;
      relapsed, platinum-resistant small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). This study will be conducted in&#xD;
      two parts: safety run-in part and main part. The safety run-in part will be conducted in&#xD;
      Japan.&#xD;
