  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this monocentric, prospective study is to measure the impact of the&#xD;
      implementation of a robotic social telepresence tool, during three months at home, on the&#xD;
      feeling of loneliness and social isolation of the elderly&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This non-interventional and prospective study offers elderly people living at home the&#xD;
      opportunity to host a social telepresence robot, for a period of three months, with the aim&#xD;
      of maintaining a link with those around them and discovering activities offered by&#xD;
      professionals (cooking, yoga, visiting virtual museum, etc.) via a networking platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of questionnaires and score calculations, assessing their feeling of&#xD;
      loneliness and how they accept the robot in their home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be interviewed one week before the robot arrives at their home, at the start of&#xD;
      the study (when the robot arrives).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up is carried out by a neuropsychologist at 6, 12 and 24 weeks of presence at&#xD;
      home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data measuring loneliness and social isolation, memory, patient interaction with the robot,&#xD;
      their quality of life as well as their emotions will be collected using questionnaires.&#xD;
