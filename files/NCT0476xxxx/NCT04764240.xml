  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data were collected on a large multi-institution dataset consisting of ESCC patients who&#xD;
      underwent surgery between January 2003 and December 2013 at ten institutions in the People's&#xD;
      Republic of China. The datasets were approved for research by the institutional review board&#xD;
      of each participating center. Prior to surgery, all patients received computerised tomography&#xD;
      (CT) of the chest and abdomen and EUS as part of their routine staging workup. Patients&#xD;
      received whole body FDG-PET to eliminate the possibility of distant metastases if the&#xD;
      attending physician considered it was necessary. All patients in the dataset received a&#xD;
      surgical R0 resection; patients who received an R1 or R2 resection were excluded. Notably,&#xD;
      there is nothing approaching a consensus on the extent of lymph node dissection for ESCC&#xD;
      patients. Patients who received neoadjuvant therapy were excluded due to the influence of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy on lymph node status and pathologic T stage. The primary endpoints were&#xD;
      overall survival (OS), which was defined as the time between surgical resection and death&#xD;
      from any cause, and cancer-specific survival (CSS), defined as the time from surgical&#xD;
      resection to death caused by ESCC. After receiving esophagectomy, patients were followed up&#xD;
      by clinical examination every three months for the first year, every three to six months for&#xD;
      the second year, and every six to twelve months from then on.&#xD;
