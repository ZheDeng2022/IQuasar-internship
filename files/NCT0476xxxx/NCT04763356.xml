  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized trial designed to investigate a new care model for patients&#xD;
      who suffer from nerve damage from chemotherapy called chemotherapy induced peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy (CIPN). All participants in the study will report their CIPN symptoms daily using&#xD;
      a website, app or phone for 12 weeks. In one group the data will be collected and&#xD;
      participants will be encouraged to reach out to their treating doctors for uncontrolled&#xD;
      symptoms. These participants' doctors can prescribe any treatment they feel is appropriate.&#xD;
      In the second group, if the symptoms are moderate to severe they will receive a phone call&#xD;
      from a nurse practitioner immediately. That nurse practitioner will determine the correct&#xD;
      CIPN treatment using a algorithm and prescribe it. The study will track the severity of&#xD;
      symptoms over time as well as looking at the impact on treatments for CIPN (medications and&#xD;
      referrals).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single blinded (outcome assessor) randomized controlled trial of a CIPN&#xD;
      care model that pairs a personalized suite of remote symptom monitoring technologies with&#xD;
      triggered real time responses from a nurse practitioner (NP) equipped to enact algorithmic&#xD;
      guideline based CIPN treatment in response to poorly controlled symptoms. The study will&#xD;
      enroll adult cancer patients who recently completed a course of a taxane or platinum-based&#xD;
      agent and have been diagnosed with CIPN. Participants will log neuropathy symptoms daily for&#xD;
      a one week run-in period using a remote symptom monitoring technology described below.&#xD;
      Participants who have at least 1 day with any symptom that is moderate or greater in severity&#xD;
      on the NTSS6 will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Usual Care (UC) or Symptom Care at Home&#xD;
      with Nurse Practitioner follow up (SCH-NP). Those not meeting severity criteria will be&#xD;
      excluded but can be rescreened 6 weeks later. Both groups will log symptoms daily and receive&#xD;
      either UC or SCH-NP care for the 12 week study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UC group will report daily neuropathy symptoms via the web, app or automated phone system&#xD;
      and will receive usual care for CIPN symptoms from their existing treatment team. The SCH-NP&#xD;
      group will report symptoms similarly but moderate to severe symptoms will trigger a call back&#xD;
      from a nurse practitioner who can provide treatment based on standardized algorithmic CIPN&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In person study visits will take place at baseline and 6 and 12 weeks after randomization.&#xD;
      CIPN specific QoL and disability measures, validated CIPN sign scales and detailed&#xD;
      information on opioids, neuropathic pain medications and other CIPN treatments will be&#xD;
      collected at each visit.&#xD;

    <description>The UC group (control) models the current standard of care model. The NTSS-6 will be completed daily by participants using the SCH system. The results will not be reported to their oncology team. Participants will be counseled at study entry to contact their treating care team to manage CIPN symptoms. They will also receive a reminder to do so at the end of each reporting session. UC participants will attend all regular visits with these providers and can receive any type of treatment for their CIPN symptoms. There are no limitations on the therapies that can be prescribed, or the means by which the clinical team communicates with the participant. Treating physicians will be provided with links to the current ASCP and NCCN guidelines but will not be provided with the algorithm as this group is meant to reflect current standard medical practice.</description>

Participants recording symptoms between 12 am-3 pm will receive a NP call back by 5pm and those between 3pm-12 am will be called the following day. The NP will follow a standardized script to elicit details about the CIPN symptoms and recommend and prescribe CIPN treatment per the treatment algorithm.</description>
