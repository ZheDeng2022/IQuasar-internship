  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coagulopathy, bleeding, and transfusion are common in cardiac surgical patients. Our&#xD;
      collaborator has developed a novel point of care device that can be used to assess thrombin&#xD;
      generation in real-time in cardiac surgical patients. The investigators will measure thrombin&#xD;
      generation using our novel device and compare it to standard methods, while examining the&#xD;
      association of thrombin parameters with bleeding and other clinical outcomes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational cohort study of 200 cardiac surgical patients. Thrombin&#xD;
      generation via our novel point of care thrombin generation assay as well as calibrated&#xD;
      automated thrombography will be measured at four time points: (1) before surgery; (2) before&#xD;
      CPB initiation; (3) post-CPB after reversal of heparin; (4) and after chest closure before&#xD;
      leaving the operating room. Clinicians will remain blinded to the measures. Recruitment will&#xD;
      continue until the investigators enroll 50 patients with significant impaired thrombin&#xD;
      generation capacity (&gt;50% drop from baseline) and 50 patients who receive hemostatic&#xD;
      therapies. Patients will be followed for 12 hours postoperatively to assess for bleeding&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
