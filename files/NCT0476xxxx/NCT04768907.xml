      MaaT013 is still in clinical development phase and is not approved yet for marketing in any&#xD;
      region. During the development program, MaaT Pharma has undertaken initial development with&#xD;
      closely related product candidates, leading to the Phase II HERACLES study in which MaaT013&#xD;
      preliminary safety and efficacy were assessed in the context of steroid-resistant,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal aGraft versus Host Disease (SR-GI-aGvHD). In addition, a pivotal Phase III&#xD;
      study (ARES trial) is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of medical options in patients with gastrointestinal acute GvHD refractory to&#xD;
      multiple lines of treatment, this early access program has been implemented.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease (aGvHD) is a serious and life-threatening disease that arises&#xD;
      as a complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). At the&#xD;
      onset of aGvHD, skin is the most frequently affected region (80% of patients) while GI tract&#xD;
      or liver are involved in about 50% of patients (Martin 1990). aGvHD symptoms for the lower GI&#xD;
      tract include watery diarrhea (≥500 mL), severe abdominal pain or bloody diarrhea (Ferrara&#xD;
      2009). While the incidence of severe GI-aGvHD has slightly decreased during the past decade,&#xD;
      treatment remains unsuccessful in most cases (Gooley 2010, Castilla Llorente 2014), with a&#xD;
      2-months overall survival (OS) rate of 22% in steroid non-responsive or steroid refractory&#xD;
      (SR) patients, non-responders to ruxolitinib (Jagasia 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MaaT013 (pooled allogeneic fecal microbiota) is a live biotherapeutic product being developed&#xD;
      by MaaT Pharma (Lyon, France) for the treatment of steroid-resistant, gastrointestinal aGvHD&#xD;
      (SR-GI-aGvHD) adult patients with refractory, not eligible or who have failed second-line&#xD;
      systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MaaT013 is still in clinical development phase and is not approved yet for marketing in any&#xD;
      region. During the development program, MaaT Pharma has undertaken initial development with&#xD;
      closely related product candidates, leading to the Phase II HERACLES study in which MaaT013&#xD;
      preliminary safety and efficacy were assessed in the context of SR-GI-aGvHD. In addition, a&#xD;
      pivotal Phase III study (ARES trial) is planned&#xD;
