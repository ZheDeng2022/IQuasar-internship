  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The decision to use standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) versus mini-percutaneous&#xD;
      nephrolithotomy (MIP) has been a subject of much debate in the urological community. The&#xD;
      investigators propose a randomized controlled trial to compare the operative outcomes and&#xD;
      complications of mini-percutaneous nephrolithotomy (mini-PCNL) versus standard PCNL for renal&#xD;
      stones. The results of this study will help guide the decision making regarding these two&#xD;
      procedures in the US population and provide further insight into the utility and safety of&#xD;
      these procedures. A cost analysis will be performed, and it is hypothesized that the reusable&#xD;
      components of the Storz MIP set will result in lower costs of the mini-PCNL procedure&#xD;
      compared to standard PCNL.&#xD;

      Presurgical management will follow the standard of care and patients with active urinary&#xD;
      tract infections will be treated prior to kidney stone surgery. After the informed consent&#xD;
      process, the subject will be asked to complete the Wisconsin Stone Quality of Life Index&#xD;
      (WISQOL), an externally validated and internally consistent questionnaire designed&#xD;
      specifically for kidney stones patients. All patients should receive a computerized&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scan prior to their procedure as standard of care for assessment of stone&#xD;
      burden and access planning. This preoperative imaging will be assessed and scored using the&#xD;
      standardized STONE scoring system, which has been validated for predicting treatment success&#xD;
      and perioperative complications following PCNL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to their procedure patients will be randomized to receive one of the two interventions&#xD;
      outlined above, only study subjects will be blinded to the randomization. Randomization will&#xD;
      be conducted centrally for each site to ensure balance of PCNL and mini-PCNL using the&#xD;
      CCF-Redcap randomization module to ensure proper randomization between sites. Randomization&#xD;
      can occur at any time after enrollment prior to surgery. Study subjects will be selected from&#xD;
      a patient pool where PCNL or mini-PCNL would be considered equally viable alternative&#xD;
      Standard of Care procedures for treatment of kidney stone disease, with neither procedure&#xD;
      presenting any benefit over the other. The randomization of procedure for this pool of study&#xD;
      subjects was to guarantee that an equal number of both procedures were performed in the trial&#xD;
      throughout all centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients choosing to participate in this research study will not be informed of which&#xD;
      procedure they received to minimize any bias regarding postoperative pain and quality of life&#xD;
      scores. No changes to the disclosure process will be made for any other variations or&#xD;
      complications during their procedure outside of the research study interventions. Due to the&#xD;
      time between the initial surgical procedure and postoperative follow-up visit there is a risk&#xD;
      of unintentional unblinding by other providers involved with the care of study patients and&#xD;
      access to their medical records. As such patients will be asked at the time of their&#xD;
      follow-up visit if they remained blinded to their procedure type. Whenever possible patients&#xD;
      should remain blinded but unblinding is not an exclusion criterion as the primary endpoint,&#xD;
      change in hemoglobin, should not be affected by this knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pre-operative complete blood count and basic metabolic panel will be obtained. Two&#xD;
      endoscopic stone procedure types will be investigated in this study. The first, a standard&#xD;
      percutaneous nephrolithotomy (sPCNL)- performed using a 30 Fr access sheath following balloon&#xD;
      dilation. The second, a mini percutaneous nephrolithotomy (mPCNL)- performed using an 18 Fr&#xD;
      access sheath following either balloon dilation or dilation using a single step metal&#xD;
      dilator. Both procedures will be performed under general anesthesia with the patient in prone&#xD;
      position. Access technique (triangulation method, ultrasound guided, or endoscopically&#xD;
      guided) will be at the discretion of the attending surgeon. Stone lithotripter type&#xD;
      (pneumatic, ultrasonic, or laser) and retrieval method (basket, forceps) will similarly be at&#xD;
      the discretion of the urologist. Placement of ureteral stents will be left up to the&#xD;
      discretion of the surgeon. Placement of nephrostomy tubes will be recorded as a protocol&#xD;
      deviation and the indication for placement recorded. Whenever possible a single access tract&#xD;
      will be used for the procedure and if multiple access sites are required it will be recorded&#xD;
      as a protocol deviation. Following completion of the procedure and closure of the access&#xD;
      tract, pressure will be applied to the surgical site for one minute. Patients with plans for&#xD;
      a staged bilateral PCNL should only be enrolled for their first operation and should complete&#xD;
      the quality-of-life questionnaire and imaging requirements described below prior to their&#xD;
      second procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal pelvis pressure monitoring is not part of the standard of care and is included as an&#xD;
      outcome for research purposes only. There is no additional risk to the patient when&#xD;
      monitoring this pressure and patients will be informed of this during the informed consent&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a flexible cystoscope, a 5 Fr open-ended ureteral catheter will be positioned in the&#xD;
      ureteropelvic junction for recording renal pelvis pressures. Following placement, the&#xD;
      catheter will be secured and attached to arterial line pressure transducer positioned at the&#xD;
      level of the kidney and connected to an invasive blood pressure (IBP) port. The arterial line&#xD;
      pressure transducer will be fixed to IV pole at the level of the kidney and adjusted during&#xD;
      the case if the patient bed is repositioned during the case. Transducer tubing should be&#xD;
      flushed with normal saline to remove any air and pressure should be zeroed without any&#xD;
      pressure being applied to the surgical site. Pressure monitoring and zeroing should be&#xD;
      established after obtaining access but prior to active stone fragmentation or extraction and&#xD;
      continue until closure of the access tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous data monitoring and recording will be achieved via attaching the IBP port either&#xD;
      on a portable vital signs monitor or the main anesthesia monitoring system. Data points&#xD;
      should be recorded continuously whenever possible. Data will be either extracted manually&#xD;
      from the portable monitor or automatically through the anesthesia monitoring system. Analysis&#xD;
      of these data points to determine the mean RPP, time above &gt;30mmHg, and maximum RPP can be&#xD;
      conducted at the individual sites and included as part of their data set transfer or&#xD;
      deidentified data sets can be sent to CCF for analysis of those endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operatively, patients will be admitted to the hospital and monitored per usual clinical&#xD;
      procedure. A complete blood count will be obtained on postoperative day 0, preferably in&#xD;
      recovery, and on postoperative day 1. A basic metabolic panel will also be obtained prior to&#xD;
      discharge. Further laboratory tests will be dictated by the patients' clinical status and&#xD;
      length of stay. If patient length of stay exceeds one day the final complete blood count&#xD;
      prior to discharge will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along with their standard postoperative day 1 labs, an additional red topped tube (4-10ml)&#xD;
      for IL-6 and procalcitonin will also be collected. This sample will need to be processed with&#xD;
      several hours of collection using a centrifuge and the serum aliquots placed in cryovials&#xD;
      prior to freezing. Individual research sites will be responsible for the lab draw, centrifuge&#xD;
      process, freezing, and shipping of IL-6 and procalcitonin serum samples. These may be stored&#xD;
      on site and shipped in bulk periodically or upon conclusion of patient enrollment per the&#xD;
      preference of the study coordinator at each site. All these samples will be analyzed in bulk&#xD;
      at the conclusion of the recruitment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since higher irrigating pressures during PCNL have been linked to higher rates of the&#xD;
      systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) this will also be included as a secondary endpoint. The&#xD;
      criteria for SIRS will be defined as any two of the following conditions: heart rate &gt;90&#xD;
      beats per minute, respiratory rate &gt;20 respirations per minute, serum white blood cell count&#xD;
      greater than 12,000/high power field or less than 4,000/high power field and temperature&#xD;
      &gt;38.0 ⁰C or &lt;36.0 ⁰C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative complications will be classified using the Clavien-Dindo system which has been&#xD;
      modified for use following percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Standard of care procedures will be&#xD;
      followed for patients requiring postoperative blood transfusions. Postoperative pain&#xD;
      management will be left up to the discretion of the attending surgeon. The patient will be&#xD;
      discharged from the hospital per the usual clinical protocols with a planned clinic visit&#xD;
      between 4 and 6 weeks after surgery. In the interval following surgery readmissions, ED&#xD;
      visits, and reoperations for study patients should be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the standard of care for PCNL patients, both a renal ultrasound and a kidney,&#xD;
      ureter, and bladder x-ray study obtained between 4 and 6 weeks postoperatively. Imaging will&#xD;
      be reviewed by a blinded radiologist for assessment of stone free rate, defined as no visible&#xD;
      stone fragments on either imaging set. Any discrepancies between ultrasound and x-ray&#xD;
      modalities will be resolved with a follow-up CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient receives a postoperative CT scan for another indication, this scan will take the&#xD;
      place of the KUB and U/S for determining stone free rate. Additional data points such as&#xD;
      parenchymal thickness at target calyx will for also be assessed for swelling/fluid&#xD;
      accumulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WISQL questionnaire, the same administered following initial consent, will be given at&#xD;
      the 4-6 week follow-up visit to track any differences in quality of life between the two&#xD;
      procedures. The WISQOL questionnaire specifically asks for the patients to provide answer&#xD;
      statements that reflect their quality of life over the past four weeks. For the purposes of&#xD;
      the second instance of the questionnaire, study subjects will be instructed to answer with&#xD;
      respect to their symptoms since their procedure, to encompass patients who may have their&#xD;
      follow-up visit scheduled more than four weeks from their procedure date.&#xD;
