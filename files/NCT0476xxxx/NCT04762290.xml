  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Motor impairments are prominent in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other&#xD;
      neurodevelopment disorders, and these impairments often impact the individual's ability to&#xD;
      engage in organized physical activity programs (OPA). While many studies have identified&#xD;
      dance and creative movement to be retrospectively and anecdotally therapeutic, there remains&#xD;
      a paucity of literature regarding outcomes associated with these programs, and specifically,&#xD;
      their impact on (1) perceived and objective gross and fine motor skills, (2) perceived&#xD;
      ability to succeed in related or divergent goals or tasks, (3) quality of life for affected&#xD;
      individuals and their caregivers. (4) adaptive function, (5) social communication&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study explores the impact of organized dance and creative movement classes on children&#xD;
      with neurodevelopmental disorders (ages 4-17) and their caregivers. Participants will&#xD;
      complete a set of surveys and assessments designed to measure the above metrics (labeled 1,&#xD;
      2, and 3) at their first study visit. This initial assessment is expected to take place&#xD;
      within two weeks prior to beginning the intervention (either a wait period or a series of&#xD;
      1-hour dance classes, which children will attend weekly for 10 weeks). The second and final&#xD;
      study visit will consist of a similar set of surveys and assessments designed to measure the&#xD;
      same metrics within the two weeks following completion of the dance class series.&#xD;
      Participants who have completed the wait period at this point will then begin their set of 10&#xD;
      weekly dance classes. Expected duration of participation in the study is no longer than 14&#xD;
      weeks in total.&#xD;

    <description>A measure of social communication and autism traits. Higher scores indicate a worse outcome. A total T-score of 76 or higher is considered severe and strongly associated with a clinical diagnosis of Autistic Disorder. T-scores of 66 through 75 are interpreted as indicating Moderate deficiencies in reciprocal social behavior that are clinically significant and lead to substantial interference in everyday social interactions. T-scores of 60 to 65 are in the Mild range and indicate mild to moderate deficits in social interaction.T scores of 59 and below are considered to be within typical limits and generally not associated with clinically significant ASD</description>
