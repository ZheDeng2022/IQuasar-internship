      The investigators conducted a randomized controlled study to test the utility of a brief&#xD;
      video-based intervention to: 1) reduce stigma towards depression, and 2) increase&#xD;
      treatment-seeking intentions among adolescents.&#xD;

      Young people present with the higher prevalence of mental health disorders compared to&#xD;
      individuals at any other age, with up to 20% of adolescents likely to experience mental&#xD;
      health disorders. Around 50% of mental health conditions start before the age of 14 and the&#xD;
      onset of 75% of cases is before the age of 18. Depression is the most common diagnosis and&#xD;
      epidemiological studies suggest that at any one time 8% to 10% of adolescents have severe&#xD;
      depression. This means that the major burden of assessing and managing adolescent depression&#xD;
      falls on primary care practitioners. Depression is a principal cause of illness and&#xD;
      disability in teenagers, and suicide is the third most common cause of death among older&#xD;
      adolescents. Mental health problems can significantly affect the development of children and&#xD;
      young people having an enduring impact on their health and social functioning in adulthood.&#xD;
      However, 75% of adolescents with mental health problems are not in contact with mental health&#xD;
      services,8 and the primary reason for the reluctance to seek help is stigma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stigma refers to negative beliefs and stereotypes held toward a specific group of people and&#xD;
      adversely affects people with mental illness. Public stigma refers to negative attitudes and&#xD;
      beliefs that motivate individuals to fear, reject, avoid, and discriminate against people&#xD;
      with mental illness. Individuals with mental illness expect to face prejudice and&#xD;
      discrimination (anticipated stigma) and internalize public stereotypes of people with mental&#xD;
      illness (self-stigma). Adolescents are particularly aware of how others perceive them and&#xD;
      care greatly about what their peers think of them. Public stigma toward youngsters with&#xD;
      mental illness has been identified as a barrier to seeking help; therefore, reducing public&#xD;
      stigma among young people at risk for or even experiencing depression could enhance their&#xD;
      receptivity to seeking help or treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Applying strategies to reduce stigma towards mental health care among adolescents with high&#xD;
      levels of depression may prevent worsening of symptoms, ameliorate impaired functioning, and&#xD;
      reduce risks for long-term psychiatric illness. Among possible strategies, studies19 have&#xD;
      shown that social contact is the most effective type of intervention to reduce stigmatizing&#xD;
      attitudes. Social contact involves interpersonal contact with members of the stigmatized&#xD;
      group: members of the general public who meet and interact with individuals who suffer from&#xD;
      depression are likely to lessen their stigma. Corrigan identified the most important&#xD;
      ingredients of contact-based programs: an empowered presenter with lived experience who&#xD;
      attains his/her goals (e.g., &quot;I was able to fight the depression and go back to school&quot;).&#xD;
      Although direct, in-person social contact, as well as indirect, video-based social contact&#xD;
      have effectively improved attitudes toward mental issues and care, the latter can be&#xD;
      implemented on a larger scale, use minimal resources and be easily disseminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to: (1) examine adolescents' stigma-related attitudes towards&#xD;
      depression; and (2) test the utility of a brief video-based intervention in reducing stigma&#xD;
      towards depression and increasing help-seeking intentions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to randomly assign 1,000 individuals aged 14-18 in to either: (a)&#xD;
      brief video-based intervention 1 ('Video 1'); (b) brief video-based intervention 2 ('Video&#xD;
      2'); or (c) no intervention video control arm ('Control'). The intervention videos will focus&#xD;
      on empowered presenters with depression. The presenters will be 16-year-old adolescent&#xD;
      professional actors, one of them is a boy (Video 1), one is a girl (Video 2). They each will&#xD;
      share his/her personal story regarding depression and describe how social support from&#xD;
      family, friends, and professionals have helped them overcome their symptoms and recover. The&#xD;
      third group will watch a same length video with unrelated contents. Assessments will occur at&#xD;
      baseline and at post-intervention and will tap into demographic identifiers and attitudes&#xD;
      around stigma and help-seeking questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actors will be hired through the Child Study Center, and / or through the Standardized&#xD;
      Patient Program of Teaching and Learning Center, Yale School of Medicine. Actors will be&#xD;
      compensated and follow standardized patient best practices, including those specifically&#xD;
      pertaining to under-age actors.&#xD;

    <description>Level of stigma towards depression measured by the 9-item Depression Stigma Scale (DSS). This is a 9-item self report questionnaire to measure the personal stigma towards depression. It has 5-point Likert scale tanging from strongly disagree (1) and strongly agree (5). It had test-retest reliability of 0.71 and internal consistency of 0.76 (Griffiths KM et al. 2004)</description>

    <description>The General Help-Seeking Questionnaire (GHSQ) has been developed to measure help-seeking intentions from different sources (friend, parent, mental health professional, and others) and is divided into personal-emotional problems and suicidal thoughts. The instrument consists of 10 items repeated twice for each part, measured with a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (extremely unlikely) to 7 (extremely likely). One question is stated as &quot;I would not seek help from anyone&quot; and is reverse scored. Higher scores on this scale indicate more help-seeking. The GHSQ has shown good psychometric properties: Cronbach's alpha = 0.70, and test-retest of 0.86 for personal-emotional problems, and Cronbach's alpha = 0.83, and test-retest of 0.88 for suicidal thoughts (Wilson CJ et al. 2008)</description>
