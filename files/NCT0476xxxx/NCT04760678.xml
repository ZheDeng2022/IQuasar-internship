  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a bi-centric prospective observational cohort study of adults and children presenting&#xD;
      to the emergency room or outpatient department with community febrile illness (with or&#xD;
      without signs of focalization) in 2 clinical sites (hospitals) in the DRC. The study will&#xD;
      describe the epidemiology, clinical aspects, severity, management and outcome of febrile&#xD;
      illnesses using data collected during routine diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be followed for 21 days. The follow-up will include&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily visits for hospitalized patients,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Telephone calls (or study center visit or home visit) on days 7, 14 and 21 for&#xD;
           outpatients and discharged patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been amended (EC UZA approval in June 2021) to perform a set of laboratory&#xD;
      analyses in the partners institutions and at the ITM. We aim as a new primary objective at&#xD;
      describing the profile of different biomarkers (C-reactive protein and white blood cell count&#xD;
      with differentiation) in participants enrolled with febrile illness, and as secondary&#xD;
      objectives to correlate them with outcome (assessed at day 21) and with several etiological&#xD;
      diagnoses, especially malaria (as assessed by rapid diagnostic test and blood smear). The&#xD;
      purpose is to investigate the potential diagnostic and prognostic value of these biomarkers&#xD;
      which are increasingly available at the point-of-care.&#xD;
