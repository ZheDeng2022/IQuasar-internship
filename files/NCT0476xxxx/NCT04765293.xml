    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to examine the effect of GRAVITY system therapy on chronic&#xD;
      disc-related pain in lumbar spine. Investigators made a hypothesis that patients who&#xD;
      regularly perform core strengthening exercises based on gravity system will decrease pain and&#xD;
      disability, and increase muscle strength in higher extent comparing to control group, that&#xD;
      receive passive physical therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GRAVITY therapy group had therapy twice a week for 4 weeks for 40 minutes that made 2x40 minx&#xD;
      4 weeks=320 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical control group had standard, two weeks ambulant, every day, physical therapy&#xD;
      sessions, 5 times a week 30 min, that is 10 sessions 30 min x10=300 min. So the total amount&#xD;
      of treatment was comparable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in both groups completed the study. Investigators used the Oswestry&#xD;
      Disability Index (ODI) to determine the disability level of patient with low back pain (Shah&#xD;
      et al, 2016), and VAS scale (visual analogue scale) (0-10) to measure pain intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next stage of examination was the lumbopelvic complex stability test. The test comprised&#xD;
      of several activities which had to be performed without lifting the lumbar region. The more&#xD;
      difficult activity a patient was able to perform, the higher was assessed their muscle&#xD;
      strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients were examined twice:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. before starting the therapy cycle,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. and after the therapy. They were informed about the aim of the study, the study course&#xD;
           and the possible risks. The participation in the study was voluntary and anonymous. The&#xD;
           patients signed informed consent to participate in the study. The next step was the&#xD;
           lumbopelvic complex stability test. Patients took it in lying position. The therapist&#xD;
           placed their hand under the patient's lumbar region, with the patient's spinous&#xD;
           processes resting on second do fifth metacarpal heads. Then, the therapist instructed&#xD;
           the patient on the type of movement the patient was supposed to perform. The patient's&#xD;
           task was to perform the task without lifting the lumbar region off the therapists'&#xD;
           fingers. If the task was performed correctly, the next level task ensued. If the patient&#xD;
           lifted their lumbar region, it meant that they did not have enough muscle strength for&#xD;
           that level. The test was to be performed without pain, and if the patient felt pain, the&#xD;
           test was discontinued and the patient was assigned muscle strength from the level&#xD;
           without pain syndromes. Each correctly performed task translated into a given level of&#xD;
           muscle strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level 0.3 - lying on the back with the limbs flexed at the hips and knees. The patient drew&#xD;
      the knee to the chest, then returned to the starting position. Level 0.4 - lying on the back,&#xD;
      the patient held flexed leg with their arms at their chest, and then drew the other leg.&#xD;
      Level 0.5 - the same exercise as in position 0.4, yet without stabilizing the leg with the&#xD;
      arms. Level 1a - one leg flexed at the hip and the knee, the other leg was lying extended and&#xD;
      then it was raised upwards, extended. Then, the patient swapped legs and repeated the task.&#xD;
      Level 1b - patient position as in 1a, yet the extended leg was brought up to the flexed leg.&#xD;
      Then the patient swapped legs and repeated the exercise. Level 2 - one leg was flexed at 90°&#xD;
      at the hip and at the knee, the other leg was extended. The patient extended the flexed leg,&#xD;
      sliding the heel on the ground. After the knee was fully extended, the leg returned to the&#xD;
      starting position. Then the patient swapped legs. Level 3 - the patient flexed first one leg&#xD;
      and then the other leg to 90°, and then extended first one leg and then the other leg and&#xD;
      slid them out on the ground. After the knee was fully extended, the limb returned to the&#xD;
      starting position. Level 4 - both legs were extended on the ground, then the patient flexed&#xD;
      both limbs sliding their heel on the ground, and then lifted then, flexing the leg at the hip&#xD;
      to 90° and returned to starting position. Level 5 - starting position as in level 4, the&#xD;
      patient flexed legs at the hip and the knee and drew them to the chest, then the patient&#xD;
      extended both legs simultaneously at the hip and the knee, thus returning to the starting&#xD;
      position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy GRAVITY® system exercise is conducted on a machine. The tasks were non-weight&#xD;
      bearing, and the only external load was the body mass of the trainee. The degree of unloading&#xD;
      (the level of exercise) was chosen depending on the patient's body mass, their current health&#xD;
      and the difficulty of the exercise. The machine allowed for exercising any chosen muscle&#xD;
      group at chosen setting of the bench, platform and ropes. GRAVITY® system exercise aimed at&#xD;
      general posture improvement and at strengthening the desired movement path, along with&#xD;
      strengthening the deep spinal and abdominal muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The training sessions started with manometer exercise - the manometer was placed under the&#xD;
      lumbar region of the spine. As the patient exhaled and tensed their abdominal muscles,&#xD;
      manometer membrane was pumped to 40 mmHg. This provided non-invasive biofeedback, making the&#xD;
      patients aware if their deep smooth muscles maintained the desired tension. The patients were&#xD;
      to conduct all exercises (knee bends on a sloping bench, lower limb abduction, upper and&#xD;
      lower body exercise) while simultaneously maintaining abdominal muscles tension on the level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, the patients conducted their training designed accordingly to their individual needs.&#xD;
      The most common exercise set was the following: moving their arms from behind the head in the&#xD;
      lying on the back position (2x12 repetitions), abductions to 90° in the lying position (3&#xD;
      sets of 10 repetitions for both the right and the left side), adduction of both arms in the&#xD;
      sitting position facing the machine (2x12), pulling the bench (2x12), abdominal oblique&#xD;
      muscle tension (2x10) (fig. 2), rotating the trunk in sitting position (2x10 on the right and&#xD;
      on the left sides), plank (2x30s), knees to chest (2x10), heels-up on the platform (3x15 left&#xD;
      leg, right leg, both feet), steps forward (2x10 right leg and left leg). While exercising,&#xD;
      the patients were to maintain the right body posture actively by tensing their abdominal&#xD;
      muscles. Each exercise could be performed in several variations, such as: both limbs working&#xD;
      out simultaneously, or single limb workout, or increasing the level through making the&#xD;
      exercise easier or more difficult to perform. At the end of each training session patients&#xD;
      stretched individual muscle groups (e.g. posterior thigh muscles, quadriceps femoris muscle,&#xD;
      and triceps surae muscle) or they used rollers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the clinical control group, the patients had physical therapy such as: laser therapy,&#xD;
      cryotherapy, magnetotherpy, interference currents. They had therapy every day for the period&#xD;
      of two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups had different blinded clinicians supervising therapy. Another specialist&#xD;
      collected and analysed the treatment results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from both groups did not received any other simultaneous treatments (e.g.,&#xD;
      pharmacological or psychological).&#xD;
