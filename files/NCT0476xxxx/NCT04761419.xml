    <textblock>
      An observational cohort study to show the effect of parents' presence beside their infants,&#xD;
      skin-to-skin contact (SCC), participation in infant care, or any interaction with their&#xD;
      infants on parents' and infants' short- and long-term outcomes. Investigators create a&#xD;
      hypothesis that longer parents' presence, SCC, participation in infant care, and any&#xD;
      interaction with their infants affect outcomes of infants and parents by preventing parents'&#xD;
      depression and promoting parent-infant bonding and, in addition, by shortening the length of&#xD;
      stay, promoting growth, promoting establishment breastfeeding, and improving developmental&#xD;
      outcomes. Parents are asked to make a record of the length of their presence, SCC,&#xD;
      participation in infant care, and any interaction with their infants, which are quantitative&#xD;
      measurements of family centered care (FCC). Investigators also collect the data related to&#xD;
      the background information of the family, delivery, the clinical course of infants, and the&#xD;
      outcome measures of the infants and parents. No intervention is included in this research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study setting is a level IV neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at Nagano Children's&#xD;
      Hospital in Nagano, Japan. Eligible infants are those who are born at 34 weeks of gestation&#xD;
      or earlier from Japanese parents in Nagano Children's Hospital and need admission into NICU&#xD;
      in the same hospital. Infants are excluded from this study if they have any major anomalies&#xD;
      including suspicion of chromosomal disorder on admission, if at least one parent is Not&#xD;
      Japanese, or if they do not survive until discharge home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes are the EPDS and Japanese version of Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale&#xD;
      (MIBS-J) of the parents. The secondary outcomes are the followings; (1) length of stay&#xD;
      (days), (2) physical measurements at 36 weeks (g or cm) and growth rate from birth to&#xD;
      discharge home (g or cm /d), (3) breastmilk-feeding (exclusive, partial, or no breast milk)&#xD;
      and the frequency of breastfeeding directly from breast at 36 weeks PMA and at discharge&#xD;
      (average frequency per day), and for the infants whose birth weight &lt;1500g only, (4)&#xD;
      developmental quotient (DQ) at 6 and 18 months of corrected age, and 3 years old assessed by&#xD;
      Kyoto Scale of Psychological Development (KSPD).&#xD;

      &lt;Ethical considerations&gt; This research protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of&#xD;
      Nagano Children's Hospital before this research is being conducted. Recruitment is undertaken&#xD;
      by the neonatologists in the unit. They provide written and oral information about the study&#xD;
      when they explain infants' condition to their parents at admission. The parents are given&#xD;
      sufficient time to consider their participation. The informed consent will be asked within 7&#xD;
      days from the birth, otherwise the infant will be excluded from this study. At least one of&#xD;
      the parents should sign the informed consent before enrolment. At the time of agreement,&#xD;
      investigators give the infant an anonymous number to protect personal information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt; Power calculation &gt; The sample size should be decided by the number of parents as the&#xD;
      primary outcomes are for parents. Investigators plan to include 110 couples or families; the&#xD;
      power calculation showed that investigators could detect a 2.5 difference in the mean&#xD;
      Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score of longer and shorter presence groups (with&#xD;
      power 0.8 and alfa 0.05) with this number of parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Measures and data collection&gt; Diary record Parents make a record on daily diary from the&#xD;
      next day of agreement to one day before discharge. Parents make a record about duration of&#xD;
      these four topics; presence, skin-to-skin contact (SCC), participation in infant care, and&#xD;
      any other interaction with their infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Care taking&quot; includes the followings; breast feeding, bottle feeding, milking, tube&#xD;
           feeding, changing diaper, wiping body, bathing, and any other essential care for baby.&#xD;
           However, any care taking during &quot;SCC&quot; mustn't included in this section.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Other interaction with baby&quot; includes the followings; hugging, holding, touching,&#xD;
           watching, talking, reading books, playing, making something or writing diary for baby,&#xD;
           and any other approaches for baby. However, any interaction given during &quot;SCC&quot; or &quot;care&#xD;
           taking&quot; mustn't included in this section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators use the modified Parent-Infant Closeness Diary. The original diary includes&#xD;
      three items for each mother and father; presence, holding and SCC. Investigators have changed&#xD;
      these items into our own settings as above and changed the used language into Japanese.&#xD;
      Investigators already have got the permission from the developers of this diary. This diary&#xD;
      has one day per page including all the four topics for both parents. Mother and father&#xD;
      respectively draw a line on the blank of specific items they do. They should fill all the&#xD;
      corresponding blanks when they do things for multiple babies. The start and the end times&#xD;
      should be put in 5-minute increments. The validity of Parent-Infant Closeness Diary has&#xD;
      already been proven.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perinatal Data Collection Perinatal information of the infant includes sex, gestational age,&#xD;
      birth weight, height, head circumference, mode of delivery, parity and plurality of mother,&#xD;
      and Apgar score at 1, 5, and 10 minutes. Investigators will also find out if the infant meets&#xD;
      the criteria for small for gestational age (SGA), which is defined as both birth weight and&#xD;
      height are &lt;10th percentile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perinatal information of the family members includes the first meeting days with the infant&#xD;
      and the first SCC days, for mother and father respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background information of the family includes family composition, presence of mother's&#xD;
      supporter, the number of siblings living with parents, and required time from home to the&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background information of the parents includes the age, the educational background, the&#xD;
      smoking history at pregnant, occupation and parental leave, history of depression or any&#xD;
      other mental health problem before and during pregnancy and the history of medication for&#xD;
      that disease, and the degree of social support, which is measured by the Multidimensional&#xD;
      Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) as mentioned below. These are risk factors of&#xD;
      postpartum depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short version of Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support in Japanese (MSPSS-Js)&#xD;
      The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) is widely used self-report&#xD;
      measure of subjectively assessed social support. There have been several modifications for&#xD;
      MSPSS and now it consists of 12 questions with 7-point rating scale ranging from very&#xD;
      strongly disagree (1) to very strongly agree (7) for each question. There is Japanese version&#xD;
      of MSPSS (MSPSS-J), whose reliability and validity have proven. Investigators use short&#xD;
      version of MSPSS-J (MSPSS-Js), which consists of only 7 questions with 7-point rating scale&#xD;
      ranging from 1 to 7 and has high correlation with full version. The total score varies from&#xD;
      minimum 7 to maximum 49, and higher scores indicates to have better social support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection of the clinical course The information of the clinical course includes days&#xD;
      of invasive ventilation, days of non-invasive ventilation, days of any respiratory support&#xD;
      including oxygen, the history of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) operation, the history of&#xD;
      surgical treatment of abdomen, age of full feeding (the amount of enteral nutrition&#xD;
      &gt;=100ml/kg/day), the history and the degree of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and the&#xD;
      history of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) and discharge Investigators measure the weight&#xD;
      (g), height (cm), head circumference(cm), the frequency of breast feeding (per day), and the&#xD;
      type of nutrition (exclusive, partial, or no breast milk) at 36 weeks PMA and when the infant&#xD;
      discharges home or leaves our NICU to another hospital or ward to prepare for discharge.&#xD;
      Investigators also calculate the length of hospital stay (days) and the growth rate of&#xD;
      physical measurements between the time of admission and discharge. If the infant leaves our&#xD;
      NICU before 36 weeks PMA, investigators use the data at that point as an evaluation at 36&#xD;
      weeks PMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Japanese version of Mother-to-Infant&#xD;
      Bonding Scale (MIBS-J) for mother and father All mothers and fathers of the infants enrolled&#xD;
      in this research undergo the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Japanese version&#xD;
      of Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale (MIBS-J) at least twice. Almost all mothers who deliver in&#xD;
      Nagano Children's Hospital usually undergo the EPDS and MIBS-J at 2 and 4 weeks postpartum at&#xD;
      the maternity outpatient clinic. Investigators additionally carry out the EPDS and MIBS-J for&#xD;
      fathers in NICU once within a month postpartum, and for both fathers and mothers at discharge&#xD;
      of their infant for the purpose of this research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EPDS is a screening method for mothers to detect postpartum depressive symptoms. It&#xD;
      comprises 10 self-report items, each of which is scored on a four-point scale (0-3). The&#xD;
      total score varies from minimum 0 to maximum 30, and higher scores indicates to have more&#xD;
      depressive symptoms. Investigators use Japanese version of the EPDS, whose reliability and&#xD;
      validity have already proven. The cutoff score for Japanese people to indicate probable major&#xD;
      postpartum depression should be eight and nine, which is lower than that usually used in&#xD;
      western countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale (MIBS) is an assessment method for the feelings of a mother&#xD;
      towards her new infant, but investigators use Japanese version of MIBS (MIBS-J), whose&#xD;
      reliability and validity have already proven. MIBS comprises eight self-report items, but&#xD;
      MIBS-J have ten self-report items, each of which is scored on a four-point scale (0-3). The&#xD;
      total score varies from minimum 0 to maximum 30, and higher scores indicate a problematic&#xD;
      bonding between a mother and her infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main risk factors of mothers' postpartum depression are prenatal depression and anxiety,&#xD;
      previous depression or other mental problems, lower income and occupational status,&#xD;
      multiparity, presence of other children, poor marital relationship or without partner, lack&#xD;
      of social support, stressful life events, negative image toward pregnancy, and experiences of&#xD;
      early mother-infant separation. In addition, the risk factors vary depending on when to&#xD;
      evaluate postpartum depression. The depression scores in mothers and fathers of preterm&#xD;
      infants is at its highest just after delivery and will reduce over time, which shows&#xD;
      different change compared with term birth. This is why investigators have to adjust these&#xD;
      confounding factors when investigators evaluate the EPDS and MIBS-J of the parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term developmental assessment after discharge (birth weight &lt;1500g) The development of&#xD;
      the infants whose birth weight &lt;1500g are assessed by Kyoto Scale of Psychological&#xD;
      Development (KSPD) at 6 and 18 months of corrected age, and 3 years old at the outpatient&#xD;
      clinic of Nagano Children's Hospital. KSPD is one of the assessment methods to evaluate&#xD;
      developmental quotient and it is known to be well correlated with Bayley III. KSPD consists&#xD;
      of three subscales: Cognitive-Adaptive, Language-Social, and Postural-Motor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Outcomes&gt; The primary outcomes are the EPDS and Japanese version of Mother-to-Infant Bonding&#xD;
      Scale (MIBS-J) of the parents. Investigators hypothesize that longer parents' presence&#xD;
      decreases the EPDS score and MIBS-J score. Investigators will divide mothers and fathers into&#xD;
      two groups respectively (longer and shorter presence groups) based on the distribution of the&#xD;
      time of parents' presence, and compare the difference of the mean EPDS score and MIBS-J score&#xD;
      between these two groups at each point in time measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes are the followings; (1) length of stay (days), (2) physical&#xD;
      measurements at 36 weeks (g or cm) and growth rate from birth to discharge home (g or cm /d),&#xD;
      (3) breastmilk-feeding (exclusive, partial, or no breast milk) and the frequency of&#xD;
      breastfeeding directly from breast at 36 weeks PMA and at discharge (average frequency per&#xD;
      day), and for the infants whose birth weight &lt;1500g only, (4) developmental quotient (DQ) at&#xD;
      6 and 18 months of corrected age, and 3 years old assessed by KSPD. Investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that longer parents' presence, SCC, participation in infant care, or any interaction with&#xD;
      infant improve these outcomes. Investigators will divide mothers and fathers into two groups&#xD;
      respectively (longer and shorter presence groups, SCC, participation in infant care, or any&#xD;
      interaction with infant) as mentioned above and compare the difference of these outcomes&#xD;
      between these two groups. In addition, investigators also correct the data from the diary as&#xD;
      the followings; presence of at least one of their parents, SCC with at least one of their&#xD;
      parents, participation of at least one of their parents in infant care, and any interaction&#xD;
      with at least one of their parents, and consider the outcomes in the same manner.&#xD;
      Investigators will also consider (5) the difference of the mean EPDS score and MIBS-J score&#xD;
      between longer and shorter SCC, participation in infant care, or any interaction with infant&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Statistical analysis&gt; As a statistical analysis, investigators will use a mixed effect model&#xD;
      for the EPDS score and MIBS-J score, a linear regression model for other continuous variables&#xD;
      (length of stay, physical measurements, growth rate, the frequency of breastfeeding and DQ),&#xD;
      and a logistic regression model for binary variable (type of nutrition). Potential&#xD;
      confounders will be adjusted.&#xD;
