  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Genoss® DCB by&#xD;
      demonstrating non-inferiority in patients with in-stent restenosis (ISR) compared with a&#xD;
      product of the same category (Sequent® Please NEO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental group was treated with Genoss® DCB, and the control group was treated with&#xD;
      SeQuent® Please NEO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the end point of 9 months after procedure was used as the main endpoint to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of Paclitaxel coated PTCA balloon catheter. The safety of the catheter&#xD;
      was evaluated by cardiovascular adverse events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a randomized controlled trials to compare with the same-category medical device (Sequent®&#xD;
      Please NEO), 224 patients with in-stent restenosis (ISR) were recruited from a total of 13&#xD;
      institutions, and the enrolled subjects were 1: 1 through randomization. The ratio was&#xD;
      assigned to the test group(Genoss® DCB) and the control group(SeQuent® Please NEO), and each&#xD;
      of the test or control devices was assigned to receive the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were followed up 30 days, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year and 2 years after&#xD;
      procedure, and angiographic follow-up was performed 9 months after procedure.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The target lesions were ostial, pontine and bifurcated lesions with branch diameter ≥&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Three vessel disease requiring treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
