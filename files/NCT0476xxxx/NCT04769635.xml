  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All patients are newly diagnosed Obstructive Sleep Apnea patients performing full night&#xD;
      polysmnographic sleep study, whose echocardiographic findings elucidate presence of pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension(PH). These patients seemed to have PH if mPAP ≥25 mmHg . All studied patients&#xD;
      were received CPAP therapy with average cumulative adherence ⩾4 h/day of &gt;70% nights [380]&#xD;
      obtained from device download with AHI&lt;5 /hr&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was performed initially to diagnose pulmonary hypertension and repeated after three months&#xD;
      of CPAP therapy as a follow up . All enrolled patients were subjected to trans-thoracic&#xD;
      echocardiography using Ultrasound system (Vivid I, GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK), with&#xD;
      a 2.5 MHz transducer. Certain measurements were then used to calculate mPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were considered to have PH if mPAP ≥25 mmHg, and were classified into mild (20-40&#xD;
      mmHg), moderate (41-55 mmHg), and severe (&gt;55 mmHg) degrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence of PH is found by Doppler echocardiography showing an elevated right ventricular&#xD;
      systolic pressure (RVSP).&#xD;
