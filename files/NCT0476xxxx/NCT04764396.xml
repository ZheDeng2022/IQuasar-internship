  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized study that will enroll patients scheduled for an endoscopic biopsy of a&#xD;
      pancreas lesion to be in the heparin or saline group during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of blood contamination, heparin priming of&#xD;
      the fine needle biopsies, and pass number on tumor tissue quality in fine needle biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis for this study is that fine needle biopsy tissue quality of pancreatic masses&#xD;
      decreases with increasing pass number due to blood contamination; this blood contamination&#xD;
      can be ameliorated with priming of the needle with an anticoagulant such as heparin.&#xD;

    <description>The needle will be flushed with 1 milliliter (mL) of heparin (100 USP/mL) and then flushed with air. The first two passes will be collected for clinical purposes and sent to pathology per standard clinical procedures. Pass 3 will be obtained for research purposes and placed in a separate formalin jar for research. Between passes (after pass 1 and 2) after tissue is extracted from the needle, the needle will be flushed with 1 mL of heparin (100 USP/mL) and flushed with air before next pass is made.</description>
