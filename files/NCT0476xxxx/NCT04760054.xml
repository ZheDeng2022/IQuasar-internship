  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' study is designed to test whether brief exposure to a martial arts-based&#xD;
      intervention (a coordinative, partnered training exercise known as &quot;Hubod&quot;), can improve&#xD;
      cognitive function to a greater degree than aerobic exercise of a similar intensity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This three-arm randomized controlled trial will compare the effects of a martial arts&#xD;
      intervention vs. aerobic exercise vs. an attentional (non-exercise) control condition. The&#xD;
      martial arts intervention will consist of a partnered, coordinated sensitivity exercise drawn&#xD;
      from south-east Asian martial arts, known as Hubod (also spelt hubud and hubad). Participants&#xD;
      will be trained in the fundamental movements of Hubod. Participants will also have the&#xD;
      history, cultural significance, risks and purpose of Hubod explained to them throughout the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aerobic exercise comparator group will use a stationary bicycle to match the duration and&#xD;
      exercise intensity of the martial arts intervention group, under the supervision of trained&#xD;
      research assistants. Participants will also receive information on aerobic exercise and the&#xD;
      Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the Videos Control group will watch educational videos on martial arts,&#xD;
      physical fitness and exercise for the same duration as the intervention and exercise&#xD;
      comparison groups. All participants, regardless of group, will be assessed for martial arts&#xD;
      and exercise experience once at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be tested for cognitive performance change. Baseline and follow-up&#xD;
      computerized cognitive testing will take place at a specified testing facility and&#xD;
      psychosocial questionnaires will be delivered remotely via a Qualtrics-powered survey. After&#xD;
      baseline testing, participants will attend 5 sessions, approximately 30 minutes each.&#xD;
      Follow-up testing will be administered more than 48 hours post-intervention to minimize&#xD;
      established acute adaptive responses to exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize the martial arts training intervention group will exhibit a&#xD;
      greater increase in performance of cognitive tasks when compared less complex movement&#xD;
      patterns involved in the aerobic exercise group or videos control group.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Digit Symbol Substitution task</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be assessed at baseline and in the week immediately following the two-week intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>Processing speed and working memory cognitive task using numbers and symbols. Participants will be presented with multiple rows of symbols, each one corresponding to a number on a 1-9 scale and they will have two minutes to correctly match (in sequential order) as many symbols to their numbers as possible. Performance is computed by adding the number of symbols correctly-matched within the allotted time.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Matrix Reasoning Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be assessed at baseline and in the week immediately following the two-week intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be required to identify patterns among objects in an incomplete, 3x3 matrix, according to row and column, and to select the correct object that completes the remaining empty box from a list of potential objects. Performance will be assessed from the number of correct responses within the allotted time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trail-Making Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be assessed at baseline and in the week immediately following the two-week intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>The trail-making test is a global cognition and spatial awareness assessment involving two parts. Respondents must complete each part as quickly as possible using a single, continuous pencil-drawn line. For Trails part A, the numbers 1-26 are randomly arranged on a sheet of paper and respondents are required to connect the numbers, in order, using a single pencil line. The pencil is not allowed to leave the paper until the task is complete. The same is true for Trails part B, but the sequence is now numero-alphabetic (1, A, 2, B, 3, C and so on). The task is complete when the participant reaches the end of the sequence. Performance will be measured by how long it takes the participant to complete parts A and B.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Flanker Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be assessed at baseline and in the week immediately following the two-week intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>The Flanker task paradigm assesses inhibition control. The task utilizes pictures and symbols and is delivered using an iPad. Participants will be required to correctly identify, as fast as possible, the direction a central arrow among a set of surrounding arrows that are pointing in either congruent or incongruent directions. Performance will be assessed using average reaction time responses and accuracy across the congruent and incongruent trials. Inhibition percent interference will be calculated using the formula ((incongruent reaction time - congruent reaction time)/congruent reaction time) * 100.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Multidimensional Outcomes Expectations for Exercise Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be assessed at baseline and in the week immediately following the two-week intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>The Multidimensional Outcome Expectancies for Exercise Scale (MOEES; Wójcicki, White, &amp; McAuley, 2009) is a 15-item questionnaire that has three subscales: physical outcome expectancies, social outcome expectancies, and self-evaluative outcome expectancies. The MOEES assesses an individual's beliefs or expectations about the benefits of regular exercise. Each question is based on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Each subscale is scored by summing the total items, with higher scores being indicative of higher outcome expectations for exercise.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Exercise Motivations Inventory-2</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be assessed at baseline and in the week immediately following the two-week intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>The Exercise Motivations Inventory-2 will be used to assess the type of reasons one has for participating in an exercise program (and their relative strength). Only subscales with items involving appearance, strength/endurance, nimbleness and positive health will be used. Composite scores will be computed for each subscale by summing and averaging responses.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>State Trait Anxiety Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will complete this questionnaire immediately prior and immediately following each of the five intervention training sessions.</time_frame>
    <description>Trait anxiety, or one's disposition to respond with anxiety to situations perceived as threatening will be assessed with the State Train Anxiety Inventory. It comprises 20 items (11 direct worded and 9 reverse worded), and respondents answer according to how they generally feel; responses are provided on a frequency scale ranging from 1 (almost never) to 4 (almost always). Composite scores are computed by summing and averaging items.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Hospitalized Anxiety and Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be assessed at baseline and in the week immediately following the two-week intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>The established Hospitalized Anxiety and Depression scale consists of 14 questions, and utilizes a 0 to 3-point Likert scale. Oddly numbered questions comprise the Anxiety subscale and evenly numbered questions comprise the Depression subscale. Six items are reversely coded. The sum of item scores in these questions are the final outcome scores per subscale, with 0-7 considered normal, 8-10 considered borderline abnormal and 11-21 considered abnormal.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Activity Self Regulation Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be assessed at baseline and in the week immediately following the two-week intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>A 12-item questionnaire will be used to assess one's usage of self-regulatory strategies that promote physical activity including cognitive and behavioral strategies. Items are scored 1 (Never) to 5 (Very often). Our prior work has determined that this scale is not uni-dimensional across samples. We will therefore use an empirically-driven factor analysis to determine the best set of items to include in the mean composite.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Self-efficacy for overcoming barriers to exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be assessed at baseline and in the week immediately following the two-week intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>A 13-item questionnaire will be used to assess self-efficacy specific to possible barriers affecting exercise adherence. All items will be answered on a 0-100% Likert scale in increments of 10%. Prior research suggests that this may not be a uni-dimensional scale and therefore a composite will be based on a 4-item composite. These four items best reflect participants' confidence to self-regulate in the face of actual barriers, including exercising regularly in the face of bad weather, while on vacation, without encouragement, and when under personal stress. These four items will be averaged to generate our main outcome of interest, and the remaining nine items will be assessed for exploratory purposes.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Martial arts experience</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be assessed once, at baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>A novel questionnaire will assess prior martial arts experience. For example, &quot;Do you have any experience with martial arts or combat training? This includes any combat training as part of military or police service.&quot; Individual item averages and frequencies will be used to describe the sample.</description>
