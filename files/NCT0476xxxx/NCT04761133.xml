      The antiseptic povidone-iodine can safely be instilled into the pleural for the purpose of&#xD;
      pleurodesis. Pleural irrigation with antiseptics is used in adults with open drainage for&#xD;
      chronic empyema and has been described in the acute management of paediatric pleural&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the safety and usefulness of povidone-iodine pleural irrigation&#xD;
      in 15 eligible patients recruited to the Pleural Infection Cohort Study (PICS) with acute&#xD;
      pleural infection. A matched control group will be used and will be composed of 15 patients&#xD;
      previously recruited to PICS without receiving povidone-iodine pleural irrigation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pleural infection is a condition that requires hospitalization for management and is&#xD;
      associated with significant in-hospital morbidity and mortality. Predictors of poor outcome&#xD;
      include advancing age, poor nutrition, hospital-acquired infection and impaired renal&#xD;
      function. Medical management is centred on appropriate antibiotic treatment and fluid&#xD;
      drainage usually by the means of an intercostal tube. Up to 30% of patients fail medical&#xD;
      treatment and referred for surgery. A recent systematic review of adults patient with pleural&#xD;
      infection has shown that the demographics of patients with pleural infection are different in&#xD;
      patients from high-income vs lower income countries; the latter being of younger age and&#xD;
      lower comorbidity burden. However, the results of the review did not show significant&#xD;
      differences in patient outcomes. The same systematic review pointed to the need for more data&#xD;
      from patients residing in lower income countries given that the majority of data is&#xD;
      contributed by studies from higher income countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This platform study aims to prospectively investigate the incidence of pleural infection in a&#xD;
      large tertiary centre gathering demographic and clinical data about patients recruited. In&#xD;
      addition, the study will examine the different treatment offered and how this related to&#xD;
      in-hospital outcomes (length of hospital stay, rate of referral to surgery and mortality).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be designed as a modified trial within cohort (TwiC) study. PICS will&#xD;
      primarily aim to recruit patients prospectively to gather clinical and demographic data on&#xD;
      patients admitted with pleural infection in addition to clinical data on tests performed and&#xD;
      treatments received as part of the standard care. The in-patient outcomes will be recorded at&#xD;
      the time of discharge data or death, whichever is earlier. Within the TWIC design, PICS will&#xD;
      be a platform for recruiting patients to interventional trials for eligible patients within&#xD;
      the cohort. As a planned sub-study, pleural antiseptics will be trialed within a subset of&#xD;
      patients enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antiseptic povidone-iodine can safely be instilled into the pleural for the purpose of&#xD;
      pleurodesis. Pleural irrigation with antiseptics is used in adults with open drainage for&#xD;
      chronic empyema and has been described in the acute management of paediatric pleural&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This sub-study will investigate the safety and usefulness of povidone-iodine pleural&#xD;
      irrigation in 15 eligible adult patients recruited to PICS with acute pleural infection. A&#xD;
      matched control group will be used and will be composed of 15 patients previously recruited&#xD;
      to PICS without receiving povidone-iodine pleural irrigation.&#xD;
