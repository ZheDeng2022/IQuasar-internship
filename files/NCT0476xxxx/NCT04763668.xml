  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has been recently linked to increased risk for&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and its risk&#xD;
      factor, hypertension, are very high in African communities especially in the working age&#xD;
      group which also happens to have the bulk of young female adults in the reproductive age.&#xD;
      Hypertension in African children is becoming a real cause for concern though its etiology&#xD;
      remains elusive. Thanks to antiretroviral therapy (ART) use, many more infected persons live&#xD;
      long enough to reproduce, consequently, an increasing number of children are being born to&#xD;
      mothers who are infected with HIV. Could it be that in utero exposure of these children to&#xD;
      HIV/ART contribute in programming them for increased risk for cardiovascular diseases thus&#xD;
      making them more vulnerable to hypertension in childhood and adulthood? This study is aimed&#xD;
      at exploring the possible association of in utero exposure to the HIV/ART environment and an&#xD;
      increased risk for cardiovascular disease.&#xD;

      I. Sample size calculation The number of participants required to show statistical&#xD;
      significance is based on previously published studies in which vascular function was assessed&#xD;
      in HIV patients (Agu et al., 2019). An error probability (α) of 0.05, and power (1- β) of&#xD;
      0.80 and an average effect size (d) of 0.5 were used to calculate the sample size (n= 64&#xD;
      persons). Assuming a 25% drop out rate, we will use N = (64 + (64*25)/100) = 80 mothers/group&#xD;
      to ensure that we will have enough sample size/group to show statistical significance. Total&#xD;
      number of participating mothers will therefore be 160 (80 cases and 80 controls) and their&#xD;
      offspring - 160.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Ethical approval Ethical consent and permission to carry out the research project will be&#xD;
      obtained from the Faculty of Health Sciences Research and Ethics Committee (HRSEC) at Walter&#xD;
      Sisulu University (WSU). The purpose of the study will be explained to women attending the&#xD;
      antenatal clinic in the Umtata General and Nelson Mandela Academic Hospitals, Mthatha,&#xD;
      Eastern Cape Province. Pregnant women who will be willing to participate will be required to&#xD;
      sign informed consent forms to participate in the study and to allow their children to&#xD;
      participate in the study from birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Study design A prospective case control study design will be used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Selection criteria Sub-Saharan women with singleton uncomplicated 11-14 week old&#xD;
      pregnancies, be HIV positive for the case group and HIV negative for the control group.&#xD;
      Pregnant women with type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes, renal and cardiovascular diseases&#xD;
      or any critical health condition will be excluded from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Experimental Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work Package 1 (Pregnant women):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three antenatal visits will be recorded for this study - These visits will be done during the&#xD;
      first, second and third trimesters of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information and parameters will be assessed during each antenatal visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline information: Maternal demographic, obstetric and family history of&#xD;
           cardiovascular diseases during the first visit using a questionnaire - once off at the&#xD;
           start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Anthropometric measurements: Height and weight will be determined as per recommendations&#xD;
           of the NHANES, 2009 recommendations. BMI will be calculated using the formula&#xD;
           weight/(height (m) x height (m)).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Blood pressure measurements: Office blood pressure will be measured as described by&#xD;
           Muntner et al., (2019) in triplicates at three minutes intervals after 10 minutes of&#xD;
           rest in the seated position. This will be followed by 24 h ambulatory blood pressure&#xD;
           measurement for determination of day time/night time blood pressure and dipping&#xD;
           phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Placental morphometry, architecture and vascularization: Uterine arteries, umbilical&#xD;
           artery and middle cerebral artery and uterine artery mean pulsating index will be&#xD;
           determined by ultrasound. Foetal cerebroplacental ratio will be calculated when&#xD;
           possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Endothelial function tests: Carotid intima media thickness, pulse wave velocity and flow&#xD;
           mediated slowing and retinal artery assessment will be measured using ultrasonography&#xD;
           and Vicorder (Ellins, 2017). Retinal microvasculature will be studied to determine&#xD;
           endothelial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Markers of endothelial function: Endocan, asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA) and nitric&#xD;
           oxide (NO) will be assayed using ELISA kits as per manufacturers' instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Markers of oxidative stress: Lipid peroxidation, total antioxidant capacity and&#xD;
           8-hydoxyl-2-deoxyguanine (8-OHdG) will be determined using ELISA kits as per&#xD;
           manufacturer's protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Lipid profile indices: Total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL cholesterol and HDL&#xD;
           cholesterol, and oxidized LDL-cholesterol will be measured as per manufacturer's&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Insulin Resistance: Fasting glucose, glycated haemoglobin and insulin concentrations&#xD;
           will be determined using kits as per manufacturer's methods. The HOMA-IR formula will be&#xD;
           used to calculate insulin resistance from fast glucose and insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Renal function indices: glomerular filtration rate (GFR), creatinine and albumin will be&#xD;
           determined and albumin to creatinine ratio computed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work Package 2 (Neonates):&#xD;
&#xD;
      During delivery, cord blood will be collected for assessment of markers of oxidative stress&#xD;
      and endothelial function and epigenetic markers in the foetus. The following data will be&#xD;
      collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Anthropometric measurements: The weight, length, cranial circumference of the child will&#xD;
           be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood pressure measurements: Casual blood pressure will be measured by oscillometry&#xD;
           using disposable arm-size appropriate cuffs. Blood pressure will be measure in&#xD;
           triplicates with five minutes intervals at least one hour after baby's meal and when&#xD;
           baby is sleeping (Samantha et al, 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Markers of endothelial function: Endocan, asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA) and nitric&#xD;
           oxide (NO) will be assayed using ELISA kits as per manufacturers' instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Markers of oxidative stress: Lipid peroxidation, total antioxidant capacity and&#xD;
           8-hydoxyl-2-deoxyguanine (8-OHdG) will be determined using ELISA kits as per&#xD;
           manufacturer's protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Lipid profile indices: Total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL cholesterol and HDL&#xD;
           cholesterol, and oxidized LDL-cholesterol will be measured as per manufacturers&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Insulin Resistance: cord blood glucose and insulin concentrations will be determined as&#xD;
           per manufacturer's methods. The HOMA-IR formula will be used to calculate insulin&#xD;
           resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Renal function indices: glomerular filtration rate (GFR), creatinine and albumin will be&#xD;
           determined. The Albumin to creatinine ratio will also be determined.&#xD;

           histone H3K9 using Elisa kit as per manufacturer's methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work Package 3 (Mothers at 3 months post-natal follow-up)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers will followed up three months after delivery. During this visit no blood nor will&#xD;
      urine samples be collected from the mothers. Urine samples will be collected from babies for&#xD;
      measurement of CVD risk makers. The following data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Anthropometric measurements: Height and weight will be determined as per recommendations&#xD;
           of the NHANES, 2009 recommendations. BMI will be calculated using the formula&#xD;
           weight/(height (m) x height (m)) for both mother and baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood pressure measurements: Office blood pressure will be measured as described by&#xD;
           Puntner et al., (2019) in triplicates at three minutes intervals after 10 minutes of&#xD;
           rest in the seated position. This will be followed by 24 h ambulatory blood pressure&#xD;
           measurement for determination of day time/night time blood pressure and dipping&#xD;
           phenotype - mother&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Blood pressure will be measured in the baby in the supine position.&#xD;
&#xD;
