    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, 2-arm, Phrase 2, superiority and multicenter study.&#xD;
      HER2-positive breast cancer patients with active refractory brain metastases are included.&#xD;
      There will be two group: Group A (Trastuzumab, Taxanes and Pertuzumab) and Group B&#xD;
      (Trastuzumab, Taxanes and TKIs). The primary outcome is objective response rate (ORR).&#xD;

    <description>PFS is defined as time from randomization to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
Progression of disease was determined if at least 1 of the following criteria applied:&#xD;
At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters (SoD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest SoD recorded since the treatment started, together with an absolute increase in the SoD of at least 5 mm&#xD;
Appearance of 1 or more new lesions&#xD;

    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as time from randomization to death for any cause. If there is no death reported for a subject before the date cutoff for OS analysis, OS will be censored at the last contact date at which the subject is known to be alive.&#xD;
For patients who had not died up to the cut-off date, the date they were last known to be alive was derived from the patient status records, the trial completion record, radiological imaging assessments, the study treatment termination record, and the randomization date.</description>
