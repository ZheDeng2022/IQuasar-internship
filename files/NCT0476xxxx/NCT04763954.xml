      The aim of the study is to investigate the efficiency of a therapeutic online game, with and&#xD;
      without coaching, in training emotional abilities of students.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized control trial with three groups. We will perform measurements&#xD;
      before the intervention, after the intervention and at one month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be students and will be randomized into three groups using a randomization&#xD;
      program. The first group will be the gaming with coaching group, the second group will bw the&#xD;
      gaming without coaching group and the third group will be the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements will be performed before receiving the game, after the intervention and at one&#xD;
      month follow-up. We will measure depression, anxiety, stress and well-being as primary&#xD;
      outcomes, solution focus orientation as secondary outcome and rational and irrational&#xD;
      cognitions as mechanism outcome. All questionnaires will be completed online in a Google&#xD;
      Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will consist of the Rethink game. Rethink is a therapeutic game developed&#xD;
      and tested to improve emotional abilities in children. Participants in our study will test&#xD;
      two levels of Rethink as well as a trial version of the game. Each level of the game is&#xD;
      focused on a component:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level 1: recognition of emotions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level 2: relaxation and mindfulness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level 3: rational and irrational cognitions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level 4:changing the cognitions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level 5: problem-solving&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level 6: positive emotions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level 7: summary of previous aqusitions&#xD;
