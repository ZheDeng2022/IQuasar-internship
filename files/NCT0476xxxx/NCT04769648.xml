  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study seeks to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Pro-ocular™1% topical gel in&#xD;
      patients with ocular Graft-versus-Host Disease who wear scleral lenses daily. This&#xD;
      vehicle-controlled trial will evaluate the investigational drug's effect on signs and&#xD;
      symptoms of ocular Graft-versus-Host Disease and on the hours of daily comfortable and&#xD;
      serviceable scleral lens wear.&#xD;

      This Phase 2/3 placebo-controlled clinical study of Safety and Efficacy of Pro-ocular™ 1% in&#xD;
      Daily Scleral Lens Wearing Patients with Ocular Graft-versus-Host Disease (oGvHD) will&#xD;
      evaluate the the investigational drug's effect on signs and symptoms of oGvHD and&#xD;
      subject-reported hours of duration of comfortable and serviceable scleral lens wear time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 38 subjects. In the first 12 weeks, subjects will be randomized 1:1&#xD;
      active to placebo. At week 12, placebo subjects will cross-over to active drug treatment. At&#xD;
      week 24, all subjects can opt into an open label phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinic visits will occur at weeks 0, 12 and 24 with remote telephone assessments at weeks&#xD;
      6 and 18. For subjects who opt into the open-label phase, in-clinic visits will occur at&#xD;
      weeks 36 and 52.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety monitoring for adverse events will be performed at all onsite and remote visits.&#xD;
