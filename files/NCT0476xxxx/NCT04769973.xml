      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with Parkinson's (PwP) have many symptoms including tremor, stiffness, slow movements,&#xD;
      constipation, urinary incontinence and mental health issues. They are often older and have&#xD;
      other long-term health conditions. PwP need to do many things to look after their health&#xD;
      including manage multiple medications, attend healthcare appointments and lifestyle changes&#xD;
      such as improving diet and exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effort of looking after their health and its impact on them is termed 'treatment burden'.&#xD;
      Some PwP need help from their family or friends (caregiver) to complete these tasks.&#xD;
      Caregivers may also experience treatment burden themselves when caring for someone with&#xD;
      Parkinson's. People's ability to manage treatment burden is termed 'capacity' and is&#xD;
      influenced by physical, mental, social and economic factors. People are overburdened when the&#xD;
      workload of looking after their health exceeds their capacity. This can lead to poor&#xD;
      adherence with treatment, poor quality of life and worse health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To understand the factors that influence treatment burden and capacity in PwP and caregivers&#xD;
      of PwP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews with PwP and caregivers will identify factors that influence treatment burden and&#xD;
      capacity. These factors will be explored further in a national survey for PwP and caregivers&#xD;
      through Parkinson's UK. The investigators will form focus groups with PwP, caregivers,&#xD;
      voluntary sector representatives, healthcare professionals, policy makers and managers&#xD;
      through Parkinson's Excellence Networks to discuss and prioritise recommendations for change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will disseminate recommendations of ways to reduce treatment burden and&#xD;
      improve future experiences of PwP and caregivers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a mixed-methods study that will be conducted over three work packages as described&#xD;
      below and will be completed in 24 months. The investigators will have patient and public&#xD;
      involvement throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work Package 1 - Interviews:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will interview 15-20 PwP and 15-20 caregivers (face-to-face, telephone or&#xD;
      video calls) recruited from Parkinson's clinics in Hampshire and Dorset to identify factors&#xD;
      that influence treatment burden and capacity among PwP and caregivers of PwP. Participants&#xD;
      will be eligible to take part in the study if they have a diagnosis of Parkinson's or is a&#xD;
      caregiver for someone with Parkinson's, and able to give informed consent. The investigators&#xD;
      will use purposive sampling to include both genders, a range of ages, severity of Parkinson's&#xD;
      and caregiver relationships. Potential eligible participants will be identified by the&#xD;
      clinical team. Written consent will be obtained prior to each interview. Interviews will be&#xD;
      audio-recorded and transcribed. The investigators will take an inductive approach to identify&#xD;
      emerging themes until no new information arises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work Package 2 - National Survey:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from the interviews will then inform the development of a national survey for PwP and&#xD;
      caregivers. The national survey will for the first time quantify treatment burden using the&#xD;
      Multimorbidity Treatment Burden Questionnaire (MTBQ) and capture aspects of capacity such as&#xD;
      severity and duration of Parkinson's, social and economic resources, medications, frailty and&#xD;
      health literacy. Participants with mild, moderate and severe Parkinson's will be recruited&#xD;
      with agreed support from Parkinson's UK and from Parkinson's clinics. Participants will be&#xD;
      eligible to take part in the study if they have a diagnosis of Parkinson's or is a caregiver&#xD;
      for someone with Parkinson's, and able to give informed consent. Each participant will be&#xD;
      able to complete a separate survey online or on paper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect the following data from participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sociodemographic data: age, sex, ethnicity, cohabitation status, living situation,&#xD;
           presence of caregiver, employment status, education level, access and ability to drive,&#xD;
           access to information technology&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Multimorbidity Treatment Burden Questionnaire (MTBQ&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Information about Parkinson's including: - i) Year of diagnosis ii) Self-reported&#xD;
           Parkinson's severity (Hoehn and Yahr)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Other health conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Single-item health literacy score&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Medications use and frequency&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Healthcare use of the person with Parkinson's in the last 12 months e.g. primary,&#xD;
           secondary and urgent care&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Assessment of frailty with PRISMA-7: a brief 7-item self-reported questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Quality of Life Measures with the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12v2)&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. A single question to consider the overall effort of looking after health&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also collect data regarding non-motor symptoms from PwP using the&#xD;
      Parkinson's Disease Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect the following data from caregivers of PwP: -&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Information about the Parkinson's of the person they care for including: - i) Issues&#xD;
           with memory, mood and hallucinations ii) Awareness of deterioration from the person with&#xD;
           Parkinson's&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Zarit Burden Interview: a 12-item scale that assesses the caregiver burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work Package 3 - Focus groups and Dissemination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working with Wessex Parkinson's Excellence Network, the investigators will hold two to four&#xD;
      focus groups with key stakeholders including PwP, caregivers, voluntary sector&#xD;
      representatives, healthcare professionals, policy makers and managers. Participants will be&#xD;
      recruited from each local area (Hampshire and Dorset) through Parkinson's clinics, support&#xD;
      groups and local services depending on the findings from the interviews and surveys. Each&#xD;
      focus group will have 6-10 participants and will be moderated by a member of the research&#xD;
      team. Written consent will be obtained from each participant prior to the focus group. Focus&#xD;
      groups will be conducted either face-to-face at a neutral location or conducted via video&#xD;
      call. Each focus groups will be audio-recorded using a digital recorder with consent and&#xD;
      transcribed for further data analysis. The focus groups will discuss the overall study&#xD;
      findings and aim to develop and prioritise recommendations of ways to reduce treatment burden&#xD;
      and enhance capacity among PwP and their caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will then hold a dissemination event to share the outcomes with people&#xD;
      affected by Parkinson's with support from Parkinson's UK and the Academic Health Science&#xD;
      Networks. The investigators will work closely with Parkinson's UK Excellence Networks to&#xD;
      share knowledge and implement changes that improve treatment burden and enhance capacity&#xD;
      among PwP and caregivers. The findings will be disseminated through publications in&#xD;
      peer-reviewed journals and presentations at regional and national conferences.&#xD;
