      This project formally test an individual, telephone-based version of the All Nations Breath&#xD;
      of Life smoking cessation program (tANBL) for American Indians (AI) for efficacy versus an&#xD;
      untailored comparison program (CP). The primary outcome is 7-day point prevalence abstinence&#xD;
      from smoking cigarettes at 6 months post-baseline. Secondarily, the study examines continuous&#xD;
      abstinence and reduction in smoking at both 6 and 12 months post-baseline, as well as&#xD;
      demographic predictors of cessation and/or reduction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study uses a Bayesian Adaptive Design to examine efficacy of tANBL versus a non-tailored&#xD;
      comparison program (CP). All participants will be offered individual telephone counseling,&#xD;
      motivational text messaging, educational materials, and the choice of taking pharmacotherapy&#xD;
      (must be obtained by participant). Participants in tANBL will receive the culturally tailored&#xD;
      versions of all aspects of the program; participants in CP will receive non-tailored&#xD;
      versions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone All Nations Breath of Life (tANBL) Intervention Components&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary components of tANBL and modifications from the original program are described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual Sessions: The primary component of tANBL will be a series of individual support&#xD;
      sessions, led by an AI facilitator. Community members will be trained in cessation support&#xD;
      and counseling. All sessions begin with discussion of individual experiences. All&#xD;
      facilitators can be given an extension on the study team's toll-free line, which can be used&#xD;
      from any computer. Facilitators will track calls, who participates, how long they last, and&#xD;
      recordings (for supervision and training). Facilitators will, in part, use Motivational&#xD;
      Interviewing (MI), which has been found effective among AI, enhances motivation for change,&#xD;
      and is based on the assumption that many with addictions are not ready to change. The goal is&#xD;
      to increase motivation through discrepancy between current behavior and goals/values. The&#xD;
      study team developed culturally sensitive counseling scripts to explore positive and negative&#xD;
      aspects of, participants' motivation and confidence for quitting smoking, the pros and cons,&#xD;
      and plans for change. Participants are asked to identify their values and explore connections&#xD;
      between smoking and their ability to live out their values. Participants who score lower on&#xD;
      motivation and confidence at each session will be given more Motivational Interviewing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Text Messaging: Between phone calls, participants receive motivational culturally tailored&#xD;
      text messaging, including messages about why smoking is detrimental to health, respecting the&#xD;
      sacred nature of tobacco, simple motivational messages to continue trying to quit or stay&#xD;
      quit, etc., based on the educational curriculum. The study team has a database of&#xD;
      motivational messages developed during the pilot of tANBL; the team will develop and add more&#xD;
      messages throughout program implementation to keep messaging relevant and fresh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Educational Curriculum: The tANBL curriculum includes 11 brochures and combines the latest&#xD;
      cessation methods with culturally specific elements, including substantial information about&#xD;
      tobacco as a sacred plant for many, though not all, AI tribes, historical trauma, and&#xD;
      medical/research mistrust issues, among other topics. Participants have stressed that&#xD;
      cultural issues must be ingrained in the program, not given &quot;lip service&quot; with pictures of AI&#xD;
      on otherwise &quot;white&quot; materials. Current materials were created by the study team, community&#xD;
      advisors, partner organizations, and previous ANBL participants, then sent to an AI graphic&#xD;
      artist for layout. Educational materials for this project will be given to participants in&#xD;
      paper form based on preferences of pilot participants. Materials are available electronically&#xD;
      if a participant wishes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacotherapy: Current treatment guidelines suggest pharmacotherapy be offered to all&#xD;
      smokers trying to quit; participants have choice of pharmacotherapy, including varenicline,&#xD;
      bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT, patches, gum, or lozenges), a combination, or&#xD;
      none, as current best practices suggest. The team considered providing pharmacotherapy as a&#xD;
      part of the study, as investigators have done in some previous ANBL studies. However, after&#xD;
      discussions with community partners (particularly tribal partners), the team learned that&#xD;
      there was a preference for a more real-world scenario where participants can choose to&#xD;
      purchase nicotine replacement therapy or see a personal physician for a prescription.&#xD;
      Previous ANBL participants have also stated that they would have been able to obtain&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy without the study and that provision of it was not a determining factor in&#xD;
      taking it. After those discussions, investigators decided to not provide free pharmacotherapy&#xD;
      to pilot tANBL participants. Participants were instead given the choice to purchase nicotine&#xD;
      replacement therapy or obtain a prescription from personal physicians. Facilitators still&#xD;
      discussed all of the available options and allowed participants to ask questions of both&#xD;
      facilitators and the study physician to allow for an informed decision. Based on feedback&#xD;
      from pilot participants, this was an appropriate approach and will be continued for the&#xD;
      efficacy test of tANBL. Investigators will track use of the different types of&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy and will examine how it affects quit rates. Facilitators will ask&#xD;
      participants who choose not to use any pharmacotherapy about reasons for the choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-Tailored Comparison Program (CP) Intervention Components&#xD;
&#xD;
      To best test tANBL, we use similar components to the intervention for the CP:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual Telephone Sessions: CP arm participants will receive weekly phone calls from&#xD;
      non-AI facilitators who will go over similar information using non-tailored materials from&#xD;
      the American Cancer Society, through the web portal. Facilitators will not discuss&#xD;
      traditional tobacco, historical trauma, or other AI specific topics. They will talk less&#xD;
      about social support, as is more common in non-tailored programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Text Messaging: CP arm participants will receive non-tailored text messaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Educational Curriculum: Non-tailored educational brochures will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacotherapy: All participants will be provided with education about pharmacotherapy.&#xD;
