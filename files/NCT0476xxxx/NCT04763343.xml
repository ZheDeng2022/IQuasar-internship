  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ketamine, an NMDA antagonist, has been shown to have rapid anti- suicidal effects. However,&#xD;
      its safety and efficacy and special populations has not been investigated and documented.&#xD;
      Several reports in adults suggest rapid decrease of suicidal ideation. In the last decade&#xD;
      there is an alarming increase of the number of suicide attempts in patients ages 15-24.&#xD;
      Suicide is the second leading cause of death in this population. Patients with previous&#xD;
      history of suicide attempt, are even in a higher risk category. The present study focus in&#xD;
      this high risk group of suicide attempters. This will be a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      enrolling 140 youth between the ages 15- 24 after a suicide attempt; patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive Ketamine 0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes or normal saline. Patients will&#xD;
      receive all Ketamine or placebo infusions while admitted in the Inpatient Psychiatry Service.&#xD;
      Patients will receive up to 6 ketamine or placebo infusions until, for 3 consecutive&#xD;
      sessions, they have a clinician rated Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI) score of&lt;4, and &gt;50%&#xD;
      decrease from baseline, and clinical assessment of patient not being suicidal, or they have&#xD;
      been discharged from the inpatient unit. Patients will participate in weekly sessions of&#xD;
      Collaborative Assessment for the management of Suicidality (CAMS), from the first week of the&#xD;
      study while admitted to the hospital and will continue it on a weekly basis post-discharge&#xD;
      until, as an outpatient, they have a clinician rated Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI) score&#xD;
      of&lt;4, and &gt;50% decrease from baseline, and clinical assessment of patient not being suicidal,&#xD;
      for at least 3 consecutive sessions of CAMS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15-24 year-olds and accounts for 13% of all&#xD;
      adolescent deaths annually. According to the CDC, the suicide rate for 10-24 year-olds&#xD;
      increased in the last decade, with the suicide rate for 10-14 year-olds, 15-18 year-olds, and&#xD;
      20-24 year-olds increasing 177%, 76%, and 36%, respectfully. There is a critical need to&#xD;
      develop fast and effective treatment in this highest-risk age group. Therefore, there is an&#xD;
      urgent need to develop rapid, safe and feasible treatment to decrease suicidality in youth&#xD;
      admitted to inpatient psychiatry after a serious suicidal attempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal seeks to address this critical clinical gap by conducting an inpatient trial of&#xD;
      treatment with ketamine vs placebo (saline) for rapid reversal of patients' suicidal state.&#xD;
      Furthermore, this study will also test whether ketamine facilitates the effectiveness of&#xD;
      collaborative psychotherapy for an enduring anti-suicidal response. One hundred and forty&#xD;
      subjects who are medically stable admitted to inpatient psychiatry after a serious suicide&#xD;
      attempt (defined as any act of self-harm with an intent to die) with continued suicidal&#xD;
      ideation will be included in the study. After initial assessment, in conjunction with an&#xD;
      anesthesiologist for any contraindication of using ketamine, patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either ketamine infusion 0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes or saline. Ketamine or saline&#xD;
      infusions on alternate days over two weeks will be given until subject reports no suicidal&#xD;
      ideation for three consecutive sessions, or a maximum administration of six infusions is&#xD;
      reached, or until they are discharged from the hospital. Concurrently, weekly sessions of&#xD;
      CAMS will be started and continued as an outpatient after the patient is discharged until the&#xD;
      subject also reports no suicidal ideation as an outpatient for three consecutive sessions.&#xD;
      Monthly assessments for suicidal ideation, attempts and readmissions will be conducted as an&#xD;
      outpatient for 3 months.&#xD;

    <description>Remission of suicide symptoms will be defined by a 50% or greater reduction in the clinician-rated baseline Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI) score, and SSI score less than the score of 4. SSI scores can range from 0 to 38, and a higher score indicates increased severity of suicidal ideation.
