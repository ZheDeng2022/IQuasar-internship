  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is classically described as an abrupt or rapidly reversible&#xD;
      reduction in the excretion of nitrogenous waste products, including urea, nitrogen and&#xD;
      creatinine. Acute kidney injury definition emphasizes on the filtration function of the&#xD;
      kidney, a measure that is unique and easily and routinely measured .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute kidney injury is associated with significantly increased resource utilization and&#xD;
      health care costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) after non cardiac surgery are a leading cause of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. The reported incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction (POMI)&#xD;
      among patients undergoing non cardiac surgery is between 3% and 6%.&#xD;
