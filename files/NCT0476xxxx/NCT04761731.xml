      This study's objective is to evaluate the incidence rate of acute rejection reactions after&#xD;
      24 weeks treatment with ADVAGRAF® following 3 months treatment with tacrolimus in new liver&#xD;
      transplant recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment conversion will take place from twice daily tacrolimus to once daily tacrolimus&#xD;
      (ADVAGRAF) 3 months after transplant in new liver transplant recipients.&#xD;

      This is single center,open-label study with ADVAGRAF® Primary endpoint is Incidence rate of&#xD;
      biopsy confirmed acute rejection reactions within 24 weeks following conversion+ Incidence&#xD;
      rate of acute rejection reactions (%) = number of subjects with at least one acute rejection&#xD;
      reaction 1)/total number of subjects in the relevant analysis set * 100 Only those acute&#xD;
      rejection reactions confirmed by biopsy will be acceptable as acute rejection reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration method is following The total daily dose of tacrolimus will be converted to&#xD;
      1:1 (mg:mg) and the total daily dose of ADVAGRAF® will be administered only once daily in the&#xD;
      morning, starting from Day 1 (at least one hour before breakfast or 2 to 3 hours after&#xD;
      breakfast).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose adjustment after conversion On Day 1, the total dose will be converted to 1:1. It&#xD;
           is recommended to check the blood concentration of tacrolimus at each visit and adjust&#xD;
           the dose to achieve the blood concentration maintaining at 5~8ng/ml for 0 to 3 months&#xD;
           and then at 5ng/ml or below for 3 to 6 months of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of treatment The investigational product will be administered for 24 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>The survival rate of transplant organs is determined by the loss of transplant organs in the 24th week. Transplant organ loss is defined as re-transplant surgery or death. The date of the transplant's disappearance is the first time one of these events has occurred.</description>
