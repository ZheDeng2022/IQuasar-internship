  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various studies have shown that gastric sonography can reliably provide information on both&#xD;
      qualitative (nature of content) and quantitative (volume) aspects of gastric content. A&#xD;
      recent study has suggested that a minimum of 33 scans is needed to achieve a 95% success rate&#xD;
      in the qualitative assessment of gastric ultrasound. However, as the risk and severity of&#xD;
      aspiration are also influenced by gastric volume, further study concerning quantitative&#xD;
      assessment is warranted.&#xD;

      This study are conducted to affirm the feasibility of ultrasound for the qualitative&#xD;
      assessment of gastric content, and determine the reliability of this novel tool in gastric&#xD;
      volume measurements when performed by novice gastric sonographers. Two novels in gastric&#xD;
      ultrasound learn from online materials, including educational videos and picture library&#xD;
      through www.gastricultrasound.org and www.usra.ca. 1-hour lecture with discussion and 1-hour&#xD;
      interactive hands-on with expert in gastric ultrasound. Then the novels were tested for the&#xD;
      accuracy and reliability of their skills from 50 volunteers gastric ultrasound assessment.&#xD;

    <description>For the qualitative assessment, every participant was scanned once by both examiners. Each scan session lasted no longer than 5 minutes to mitigate the confounding effect of gastric emptying time.&#xD;
For the quantitative assessment, the participants were put in a right lateral decubitus position and the antral cross-sectional area (CSA) is measured in the sagittal plane.</description>
