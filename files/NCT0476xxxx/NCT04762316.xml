      Pregnenolone &amp; Pyridoxal Phosphate (PP6) for treating uterine fibroids in women pregnancy to&#xD;

      Uterine fibroids are a very common finding in women pregnancy of reproductive age, fibroids&#xD;
      fast grow in the first trimester pregnancy. PP6 against the rapid growth of fibroids under&#xD;
      the influence of hormones during pregnancy. Use to PP6 think about regulating stable&#xD;
      Oestrogen level and to dissolve fibroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a substantial insight into the pathogenesis of disease, with a clear path toward&#xD;
      clinical application, or which would lead to a substantial advance and perfect in management&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Uterine fibroids are a very common finding in women's pregnancy of reproductive age fibroids&#xD;
      fast grow in the first-trimester pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically has shown that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uterine fibroids are associated with heavy or prolonged menstrual periods, abnormal&#xD;
           bleeding between menstrual periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fibroids are associated with increased rates of spontaneous miscarriage, premature&#xD;
           birth, placenta ablation, malpresentation, labor dysfunction, cesarean section, and&#xD;
           postpartum hemorrhage, pain is the most common complication of fibroids uterus during&#xD;
           pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use the composition that has a sufficient Pregnenolone and combined with Coenzyme&#xD;
           Pyridoxal Phosphate, this preparation will soften uterine fibroids and disappear&#xD;
           fibroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnenolone is produced in the adrenal glands and the central nervous system. Pregnenolone&#xD;
      is synthesized from Cholesterol and it is the precursor of Progesterone, Estrogen, and&#xD;
      dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). In some people Pregnenolone will decrease with age, which will&#xD;
      lead to an imbalance between Progesterone, Estrogen, according to research, this imbalance is&#xD;
      the cause of abnormal growth of the uterine muscle fibers cells that produce multiple&#xD;
      fibroids in the womb. Supplementation Pregnenolone is necessary for women of childbearing and&#xD;
      reproductive age, overtime tracking pregnant women but there were fibroids from before&#xD;
      pregnancy these fibroids will develop very quickly to stun the fetus many problems in&#xD;
      pregnancy, and childbirth, the risk of miscarriage, preterm delivery,...The new drug will&#xD;
      maintain a sufficient amount of Pregnenolone natural is the essence from Dioscorea persimilis&#xD;
      prain &amp; burkill and associated with a necessary element is Coenzyme Pyridoxal Phosphate.&#xD;
      Compound presence in the body will curb the development exceed of the muscle fibers uterus,&#xD;
      the muscle fibers in the fibroids will soften, spread out, and disappear fibroids. The uterus&#xD;
      returns to its normal state, the fetus will develop naturally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research results&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 40 weeks of ultrasound examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  100% of women using PP6 drug have the disappearance of fibroids, only the image of&#xD;
                uterine muscle is thicker than usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  100% of women who received PP6 placebo did not experience any beneficial progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Through study completion, an average of 40 weeks&#xD;
