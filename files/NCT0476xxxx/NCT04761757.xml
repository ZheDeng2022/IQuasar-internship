    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Antidepressant Decision Aid for Major&#xD;
      Depressive Disorder is feasible and effective in involving patients in the decision-making&#xD;
      process when initiating pharmacotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To examine the ability of the patient decision aid to enhance shared decision making and&#xD;
      preparedness to make decisions pertaining to antidepressant therapy. The research team has&#xD;
      systematically developed an Antidepressant Decision Aid for Major depressive disorder&#xD;
      patients (ADAM) according to the International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS) and&#xD;
      the Ottawa Decision Support Framework. This is a posttest-only study with nonequivalent&#xD;
      groups to evaluate the effect of the antidepressant decision aid on patient and physician&#xD;
      perception of shared decision making as well as patient preparedness for making&#xD;
      pharmacotherapeutic decisions compared usual care.&#xD;

    <measure>Shared Decision Making_Patient Perspective</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the clinical encounter</time_frame>
    <description>The patient version of the Shared Decision Making scale (SDM-Q-9) measures the extent to which patients are involved in the decision-making process from the patient's perspective. It consists of nine items rated on a six-point Likert-type scale from&quot;completely disagree=&quot; to&quot;completely agree=&quot;. Adding the score of all the items leads to a raw total between 0 and 45. Multiplying the raw score by 20/9 provides a transformed score ranging from 0 to 100, higher scores indicate a greater extent of SDM.</description>

    <time_frame>Immediately after the clinical encounter</time_frame>
    <description>The patient version of the Preparation for Decision-Making Scale (PDMS) assesses the patient's perception of how the PDA helped them recognize that a decision needs to be made, preparing them to communicate with their practitioner and promote patient involvement in the decision-making process. Higher scores indicate a higher perceived level of preparation for decision making.</description>
