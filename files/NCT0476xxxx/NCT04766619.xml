  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate two interventions designed to make medication prescribing safer,&#xD;
      OptimiseRx and PINCER, which are being used in general practices across England. The findings&#xD;
      from the evaluation will be used to generate recommendations as to how these interventions&#xD;
      can be used sustainably in the long-term.&#xD;

      This study has been designed to evaluate and gain an understanding of the 'real world'&#xD;
      implementation, fidelity and medium and longer-term embedding and sustainability of two&#xD;
      prescribing safety interventions: the computerised decision support (CDS) tool - Optimize Rx,&#xD;
      and PINCER (pharmacist-led information technology intervention for reducing clinically&#xD;
      important errors in medication management). The longitudinal process evaluation will involve&#xD;
      observations, interviews, focus groups and questionnaires. The consolidated learning&#xD;
      exercise, which aims to inform long-term, sustainable intervention use will involve a&#xD;
      documentary analysis, interviews, focus groups, development workshops and a synthesis of the&#xD;
      evaluation results.&#xD;

    <description>Semi-structured interviews, focus groups and a questionnaire survey will be conducted to evaluate the contextual factors that influence the nature and extent of translation, implementation and sustained use of the PINCER intervention and prescribing safety indicator (PSI) functions, in particular, across different Academic Health Science Networks (AHSNs) and CCGs over prolonged time periods.</description>
