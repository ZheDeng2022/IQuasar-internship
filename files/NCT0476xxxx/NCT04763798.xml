  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Muscle stretching is a technique widely used in the clinical practice of&#xD;
      physiotherapy and in the field of sports. In the bibliography we find a multitude of&#xD;
      stretches and procedures described, some of them being similar to neurodynamic tests, which&#xD;
      could direct their effect to a neural and not a musculoskeletal structure. The structural&#xD;
      differentiation manoeuvre has been shown to be able to discriminate the increase in tension&#xD;
      on the nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the short-term efficacy on ischiosural muscle elongation of three&#xD;
      modalities of ischiosural stretching according to neural or muscular involvement, in subjects&#xD;
      without previous pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Cross sectional study. Methods: A randomised, blinded, assessor-blinded clinical&#xD;
      trial was performed. According to the sample size calculation, a total of 35 subjects will be&#xD;
      recruited from the International University of Catalonia. Each subject will undergo three&#xD;
      hamstring stretching techniques on their dominant leg, Straight-leg-raise (SLR), Passive knee&#xD;
      extension (PKE) and Maximun hip flexion (MHF) with an interval of one week on the dominant&#xD;
      leg. Muscle elongation in each stretching modality will be assessed with the modified black&#xD;
      saver sit and reach test and whether the technique generates a neural or musculoskeletal&#xD;
      response when performing the structural differentiation manoeuvre.&#xD;

    <measure>Modified back-saver sit-and-reach test</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 3 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>subjects will perform a single-leg sit-and-reach on a bench. The untested leg will be placed on the floor with knee at approximately 90º. A measuring tape will be placed on the bench. Subjects aligned the sole of the foot of the tested leg with the 50-cm mark on the measuring tape. Thereafter, subjects will be asked to reach forward as far as possible while maintaining the knees, arms, and fingers fully extended, and keep in the two hands on tip of each other and palms down</description>

    <measure>Distal sensation</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 3 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Passive ankle dorsiflexion was performed as distal sensation manoeuvre at the final position of all stretching modalities. Subjects were asked to indicate if the sensation during the stretching was modified during the ankle dorsiflexion (neural response) or was the same (musculoskeletal response)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Force intensity applyed</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 3 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The intensity of the force applied during each stretching modality was measured by a manual dynamometer (MicroFET2, Hoggan Scientific, Salt Lake City, Utah). The dynamometer was applied on the distal leg, proximal to the ankle joint. The physiotherapist performed the stretching until a marked resistance was felt and then, the force was registered.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived sensation</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 3 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>After the stretching application, all subjects were asked about their perceived sensation. They were asked about the intensity of the tension sensation during the technique. A numeric scale, ranging from 0 (&quot;no tension&quot;) to 10 (&quot;worst tension imaginable&quot;) was used to indicate the intensity of tension sensation during the stretching technique.</description>

    <description>The stretched lower limb was on a mobile support and the contralateral limb was stabilized with a belt on the bench. For the SLR, the knee was kept in full extension and then, hip flexion was performed until a marked resistance. All stretching modalities were applied until a marked resistance was felt by the physical therapist (end-feel) or until the point of maximal tolerance referred by subjects.The stretch lasted 30 seconds followed by 15 seconds rest period and the procedure was repeated 5 times. Each stretching was applied for 5 minutes</description>
