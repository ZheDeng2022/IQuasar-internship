  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, single-arm study in a real-world setting of healthy&#xD;
      Chinese toddlers provided with new toddler milk for a total of 4 weeks (28 days).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The new toddler milk contains prebiotic and an optimized fat blend of bovine milk fat,&#xD;
      vegetable fats, and a LC-PUFA oil mixture (providing DHA and ARA). The prebiotic and bovine&#xD;
      milk fat-based blend have shown to be able to improve digestive comfort and milk taste.&#xD;
      Physiological factors such as physical discomfort has been shown to be associated with&#xD;
      negative emotionality and temperament (Putnam 2012). Therefore, the investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that by improving digestive comfort, they are able to influence child temperament, happiness,&#xD;
      and other behavioral characteristics.&#xD;
