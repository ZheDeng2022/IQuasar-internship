  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity affects 3%-4% of the pediatric population and leads to cardiac mortality during adult&#xD;
      life. Bariatric surgery is the best treatment for weight loss and preventing obesity&#xD;
      associated comorbidities in adults, but its applications and safety are yet to be defined for&#xD;
      adolescents.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since 2008, in France, certain university hospitals have been eligible to perform bariatric&#xD;
      surgery for adolescents. It was therfore possible to define its feasibility, potential&#xD;
      complications and specific indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This led to recommandations published by Health Authorities (HAS) in 2016. However, it seems&#xD;
      imperative to continue monitoring these patients in order to improve their management,&#xD;
      especially as the use of these surgical techniques becomes increasingly widespread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Angers University Hospital is one of the leading hospitals when it comes bariatric&#xD;
      surgery for adolescents through its use of gastric bands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this protocol is to update data on how effective this surgery is on weight loss&#xD;
      and obesity-associated comorbidities, and to monitor medical, psychological and surgical&#xD;
      complications associated with this treatment.&#xD;
