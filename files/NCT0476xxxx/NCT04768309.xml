  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic renal failure (CKD) affects 3 million people in France and is characterized by the&#xD;
      accumulation of uremic toxins (UTs) such as p-cresyl sulfate (PCS) and indoxyl sulfate (IS)&#xD;
      which participate in cardiovascular complications and disturbance of the carbohydrate&#xD;
      metabolism associated with CKD. These UTs are not eliminated by dialysis due to their high&#xD;
      affinity for albumin and alternative strategies to dialysis must be developed to decrease the&#xD;
      production of TUs in patients not yet in dialysis. The dysregulation of the intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota observed during CKD increases the generation of UTs in the intestine, by the&#xD;
      transformation of amino acids derived from proteins (such as tyrosine and tryptophan&#xD;
      transformed respectively into PCS and, IS). Thus, modulation of the intestinal microbiota&#xD;
      seems to be an attractive target for reducing the production of UTs and the comorbidities&#xD;
      associated with CKD. Some studies have demonstrated the potential interest of probiotics in&#xD;
      lowering the plasma concentration of UTs, but the effects remain unclear. In order to test&#xD;
      the interest of probiotics during CKD, the investigators have, in collaboration with the&#xD;
      Nestlé laboratory and the ProDigest platform, the possibility of testing probiotics using a&#xD;
      human intestine simulator before the investigation of experimental and human models. For this&#xD;
      the investigators would need a collection of fresh stools. The fresh stools will be instilled&#xD;
      in artificial intestine to test the efficacy of selected probiotics on UTs production.&#xD;
