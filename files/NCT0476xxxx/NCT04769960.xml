    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Our first aim is to assess the safety of imaging patients with breast tissue expanders in the MRI. Among the 24 MRI scans, if we can successfully complete at least 20, meaning that there are no issues of burning, heating, or pain in the region of the breast tissue expander that prevents the completion of the MRI, then we will declare the imaging safe and worthy of further investigation.</description>

    <description>MRI scans will be performed on a 1.5T MRI scanner. Department of Radiology MRI SafetyGuidelines will be followed except regarding breast tissue expanders. Conventional MRIstudies will be performed using the standard of care clinical sequences.</description>

    <description>Participants will fill out questionnaires before, immediately after, and approximately 3 months following the MRI examination +/- 1 month to evaluate for any pain or perceived changes with the breast tissue expander. The first questionnaire will obtain background participants information as well as establish a baseline pain level, the second questionnaire will evaluate any changes in pain after undergoing the MRI examination, and the last questionnaire will evaluate long term changes in pain.</description>

        Potential research subjects will be identified by a member of the patient's treatment team,&#xD;
        the protocol investigator, or research team at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center&#xD;
        (MSKCC). If the investigator is a member of the treatment team, s/he will screen their&#xD;
        patient's medical records for suitable research study participants and discuss the study&#xD;
        and their potential for enrolling in the research study. Potential subjects contacted by&#xD;
        their treating physician will be referred to the investigator/research staff of the study.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Patients with breast tissue expanders that require an MRI for clinical purposes are&#xD;
        eligible for this study. Patients must provide an implant card or surgical report indicated&#xD;
        the exact make and model of their implanted tissue expander. Breast tissue expanders marked&#xD;
        as &quot;MRI unsafe&quot; will be allowed with exceptions as described in the Participant exclusion&#xD;
        criteria. While all types of MRI will be included in this study, including breast MRI, we&#xD;
        anticipate that most of the MRI examinations ordered will evaluate the brain or spine for&#xD;
        detecting or following metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient â‰¥ 18 years old on day of signing informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a breast tissue expander implanted &gt; 28 days ago&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must provide an implant card or surgical report indicated the exact make and&#xD;
             model of their implanted tissue expander&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with AeroForm Tissue Expanders (manufactured by AirXpanders)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anyone who would normally be excluded from undergoing an MRI examination as per the&#xD;
             Memorial Hospital for Cancer and Allied Diseases screening policy in the MRI Safety&#xD;
             Policy (https://one.mskcc.org/sites/pub/ehs/Policies/ECSE-2009.pdf), aside from having&#xD;
             a breast tissue expander&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are reportedly pregnant, who have a positive urine or serum pregnancy&#xD;
             test at the time of imaging, or for which pregnancy cannot be ruled out.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are unable to tolerate, comply or complete the MRI exam due to&#xD;
             claustrophobia, anxiety, known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder, age, frailty,&#xD;
             or medical instability.&#xD;
