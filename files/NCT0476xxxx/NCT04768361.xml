  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to compare, in individuals who meet the diagnostic criteria for&#xD;
      major depression, the effects of Behavioral Activation (BA) strictly behavioral with a BA&#xD;
      protocol that includes mindfulness practices. The secondary objectives are: a) to verify if&#xD;
      the changes in the level of depressive symptoms found after the treatment will be kept during&#xD;
      the follow-up in both groups; b) evaluate the possible moderating role of baseline depression&#xD;
      levels on the effectiveness of interventions; c) evaluate relapse rates after treatment; and&#xD;
      d) test a BA protocol as a single treatment. The primary hypothesis is that BA protocol with&#xD;
      mindfulness practices is superior to BA without mindfulness practices.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Depression, according to the Word Health Organization, is the leading cause of disability in&#xD;
      the world, often leading to a decrease in productivity and the departure from work&#xD;
      activities, which generates economic impacts to the own health system. Between 2005 and 2015,&#xD;
      an increase of almost 20% was identified in cases of depression worldwide. The impact of the&#xD;
      disease on the world economy between 2011 and 2030 is expected at US $ 5,36 billion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral Activation (BA) and interventions with mindfulness are recognized as effective for&#xD;
      depression. On the other hand, as currently the BA is complemented with strategies of the&#xD;
      Third Generation Therapies, including mindfulness, no study has compared a protocol strictly&#xD;
      behavioral with any treatment and there is also insufficient data to affirm if the BA has&#xD;
      better benefits than interventions that include or are based on mindfulness or vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is is to compare, in individuals who meet the diagnostic criteria for&#xD;
      major depression, the effects of BA strictly behavioral with a BA protocol that includes&#xD;
      mindfulness practices. The two intervention are face to face, in group (8 weeks), by a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT). Our main hypothesis is that la intervencion BA with&#xD;
      mindfulness practices will be more efficacious to improve the symptomatology depressive,&#xD;
      compared to a group with only BA the end of treatment. 150 participants diagnosed with&#xD;
      depression will participate in the RCT.&#xD;

    <description>Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II): instrument of 21 fragmented items that assesses levels of depressive symptoms in adolescents and adults. Each statement is followed by four options that correspond to a number (0, 1, 2 and 3) so that the participant responds according to the option that best describes how they felt in the last two weeks, including the day of the application of the instrument. The score ranges from 0 to 63. The internal consistency (α) and the correlation (p) found in the original study was .93 and an investigation conducted in Spain the value of Alpha was .89.</description>
