  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether a kind of brain stimulation called anodal&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) can be combined with perceptual learning to&#xD;
      improve the ability of people with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or juvenile macular&#xD;
      degeneration (JMD) to read words presented to them on a computer screen better than if&#xD;
      perceptual learning alone were used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, secondary measures of visual acuity will also be examined to determine whether&#xD;
      brain stimulation can allow patients to resolve finer details of an image. The proposed&#xD;
      treatment is the application of a-tDCS onto the participant's head, with brain stimulation&#xD;
      aimed at Primary Visual Cortex toward the occipital pole, while patients undergo six separate&#xD;
      sessions of training. The investigators will test the ability of participants to read words&#xD;
      before the start of the training sessions (pre test) and after the completion of all training&#xD;
      sessions (post test). This is a between-subjects design, and half of the participants will&#xD;
      receive true stimulation, and the other half will receive sham stimulation. The difference&#xD;
      between the pre and post tests when receiving active stimulation will be compared to the&#xD;
      difference when receiving sham stimulation, because the sham stimulation is not expected to&#xD;
      influence reading beyond a placebo. The aim of the study is to examine the potential of&#xD;
      concurrent brain stimulation and perceptual learning as an effective treatment for macular&#xD;
      degeneration that may be used in conjunction with more traditional eye-based interventions.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the brain stimulation will enable higher performance in&#xD;
      the reading task after and secondary measures after perceptual training due to an increase in&#xD;
      the cortical excitability of the stimulated brain cells.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be carried out in Ontario, Canada (University of Waterloo) and Hong Kong (The&#xD;
      Hong Kong Polytechnic University). There are two conditions: Active brain stimulation +&#xD;
      perceptual training and sham/placebo brain stimulation + perceptual training. This study uses&#xD;
      a between-subjects design, such that half of all participants will be placed in the active&#xD;
      stimulation group and half will be placed in the sham group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from university-affiliated clinics and local clinical&#xD;
      practices. Following full informed consent, participants will complete baseline testing and&#xD;
      clinical testing to confirm that they meet eligibility criteria including: a diagnosis of&#xD;
      macular degeneration without any additional eye disease, impaired vision but with enough&#xD;
      visual acuity that the computer monitor can still present readable word, and no&#xD;
      contraindications for brain stimulation interventions. Eligible participants will then be&#xD;
      randomized to either receiving the active stimulation during perceptual training or the&#xD;
      placebo stimulation during perceptual training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is verbal reading accuracy for sentences presented on a computer&#xD;
      screen following a Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) task in which a single word is&#xD;
      presented on the screen at a time. Participants will freely observe the words and will&#xD;
      indicate the words on the screen verbally. The secondary outcome measures are contrast&#xD;
      sensitivity and crowded and uncrowded visual acuity as measured by Freiburg Visual Acuity &amp;&#xD;
      Contrast Test (FrACT) using the Landolt C stimulus. The &quot;C&quot;'s gap will be oriented randomly,&#xD;
      and the participant will indicate the orientation of the stimulus. Crowded visual acuity will&#xD;
      be assessed with Landolt C surrounded by a solid ring, while uncrowded visual acuity will be&#xD;
      assessed with the Landolt C alone. The Test of contrast sensitivity will measure the amount&#xD;
      of contrast required relative to the background to identify the orientation of the &quot;C&quot;. The&#xD;
      Hong Kong Polytechnic University has an additional set of secondary outcome measures of&#xD;
      temporal and spatial visual span. Temporal visual span will be assessed using Chinese&#xD;
      trigrams presented horizontally or vertically at the centre for a range of presentation&#xD;
      times. Spatial visual span will be assessed using Chinese trigrams presented horizontally or&#xD;
      vertically at different character positions for a fixed presentation time. Participants will&#xD;
      be asked to recognize all three characters in a correct order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of 9 sessions plus 1 additional session particularly for Hong Kong&#xD;
      Polytechnic University&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 0: This session only applies for The Hong Kong Polytechnic university, that&#xD;
      horizontal and vertical temporal and spatial visual span will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 1: The first session will include the clinical evaluation. In addition, the pre tests&#xD;
      of all outcome measures will be collected (RSVP performance, crowded and uncrowded visual&#xD;
      acuity, contrast sensitivity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sessions 2-7: Brain stimulation sessions. Participants will undergo roughly 1 hour of&#xD;
      perceptual training, performing the RSVP task. The first 25 minutes of this training will&#xD;
      include either sham or active brain stimulation. A given participant will receive the same&#xD;
      kind of stimulation for all 6 training sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 8: No brain stimulation will occur. Post test outcome measures will be collected&#xD;
      (RSVP performance, crowded and uncrowded visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, horizontal and&#xD;
      vertical temporal and spatial visual span).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 9: 30 day follow up. 30 days after the final training session, participants will&#xD;
      again perform the outcome measures without brain stimulation to determine the long term&#xD;
      benefit of the perceptual training + brain stimulation.&#xD;
