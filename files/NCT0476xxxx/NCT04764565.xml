    <textblock>
      While Nuun Instant is commercially available and has received positive reviews from athletes,&#xD;
      there have been no studies to date to evaluate the impact of this product on hydration&#xD;
      status. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the impact of Nuun Instant&#xD;
      powder and new product under development called Nuun Electrolyte on hydration status in young&#xD;
      and active men and women. We will follow a similar approach as used by Maughan and colleagues&#xD;
      (2016) to measure the fluid balance (the difference between the amount of water consumed and&#xD;
      passed as urine) and beverage hydration index (the relative amount of urine passed after&#xD;
      consumption of a drink compared to water), while also measuring plasma volume using the&#xD;
      method of Dill and Costill (1974).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Maintaining adequate hydration is essential to optimal health and athletic performance. When&#xD;
      individuals exercise (in particular in a warm environment), they can lose excessive amounts&#xD;
      of fluids through sweating, along with necessary electrolytes (e.g., sodium, potassium,&#xD;
      chloride). With dehydration, individuals may feel sluggish and can experience impaired&#xD;
      physical performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many attempts have been made to improve and measure the hydration status of active&#xD;
      individuals. This typically involves the ingestion of fluids leading up to activity&#xD;
      (typically plain water), as well as the ingestion of fluids during the activity itself&#xD;
      (water, along with a diluted carbohydrate/electrolyte beverage). This approach seems to work&#xD;
      well; however, some debate remains over what the best fluid is to consume, in particular&#xD;
      related to the macronutrient type and the specific electrolyte mix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Related to the above, it is well-accepted that electrolyte replenishment is of importance,&#xD;
      both during and following exercise-to aid in rehydration for subsequent bouts. Electrolytes&#xD;
      (sodium in particular) have been used for decades to aid athlete hydration and this has led&#xD;
      to the development of various sport drinks-which also include small amounts of carbohydrate&#xD;
      (e.g., Gatorade, Powerade). However, one problem with moderate to high carbohydrate ingestion&#xD;
      is that some individuals experience gastrointestinal (GI) upset following carbohydrate&#xD;
      ingestion before and during an event, despite very good physical performance outcomes. Due to&#xD;
      this GI upset, some individuals (in particular recreationally active individuals who are not&#xD;
      competing at high levels) rely on water alone or a very low concentrated carbohydrate&#xD;
      beverage, and seek a method to ingest the lost electrolytes as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The solution to the above issues for many athletes is the use of powder &quot;stick packs&quot; that&#xD;
      can be carried in bags and pockets, and simply dumped into a water bottle when needed,&#xD;
      shaken, and consumed. They are easy to transport and provide the needed carbohydrate, as well&#xD;
      as electrolytes to replace those that are lost through intense and/or long duration exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We recently completed a study of Nuun electrolyte tablets, which provide 2 grams of&#xD;
      carbohydrate per serving and a combination of electrolytes, provided at a relatively low&#xD;
      percentage of the Daily Value (DV). The DV tells us how much a particular nutrient in a&#xD;
      serving of a food product contributes to a daily diet, based on a standard 2000 calorie diet.&#xD;
      Nuun tablets contain: calcium (13mg, 1%DV), sodium (300mg, 13%DV), potassium (150mg, 3%DV),&#xD;
      magnesium (25mg, 6%DV), and chloride (40mg, 2%DV). Our results indicated improved hydration&#xD;
      (based on urine output and the calculated hydration index) when subjects consumed the Nuun&#xD;
      tablets mixed into 1 liter of water, as compared to water alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nuun Instant is a new product that is similar to the Nuun tablets, but is formulated for&#xD;
      those who may experience a significant electrolyte loss and is higher in carbohydrate as&#xD;
      well. Specifically, the Nuun Instant product contains (per 11 gram serving) the following: 7&#xD;
      grams of carbohydrate, calcium (20mg, 2%DV), sodium (520mg, 23%DV), potassium (385mg, 8%DV),&#xD;
      magnesium (8mg, 2%DV), chloride (250mg, 10%DV), and 100% of vitamin C (90mg) and B12 (2.4&#xD;
      mcg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nuun Electrolytes is a new product in development that is similar to the Nuun tablets, but&#xD;
      with an adjusted formula. Nuun Electrolytes consist of Citric Acid, Dextrose, Sodium&#xD;
      Bicarbonate, Potassium Bicarbonate, Sodium Carbonate, Natural Flavors, Potassium Chloride,&#xD;
      Malic Acid, Magnesium Carbonate, Calcium Carbonate, Stevia Leaf Extract, Beet Powder Color,&#xD;
      Safflower Oil. Nuun electrolytes contains (per tablet) the following: 3 grams of&#xD;
      carbohydrate, calcium (15 mg, 1%DV), sodium (200 mg, 9%DV), potassium (125mg, 3%DV),&#xD;
      magnesium (15mg, 4%DV), and chloride (75mg, 3%DV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While Nuun Instant is commercially available and has received positive reviews from athletes,&#xD;
      there have been no studies to date to evaluate the impact of this product or Nuun Electrolyte&#xD;
      on hydration status. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the impact of Nuun&#xD;
      Instant powder and Nuun Electrolyte tablets on hydration status in young and active men and&#xD;
      women. We will follow a similar approach as used by Maughan and colleagues (2016) to measure&#xD;
      the fluid balance (the difference between the amount of water consumed and passed as urine)&#xD;
      and beverage hydration index (the relative amount of urine passed after consumption of a&#xD;
      drink compared to water), while also measuring plasma volume using the method of Dill and&#xD;
      Costill (1974).&#xD;
