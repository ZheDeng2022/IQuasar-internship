  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to assess clinically and biochemically the effect of intrapocket application&#xD;
      of tea tree oil (TTO) gel adjunctive to SRP in the management of stage 2(moderate)&#xD;
      periodontitis and to correlate the biochemical levels with clinical response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, controlled clinical trial included thirty patients with stage 2 periodontitis.&#xD;
      They were equally divided into two groups: Group 1 (control group) treated with scaling and&#xD;
      root planning (SRP) alone and Group 2 (test group) managed by SRP and locally delivered 5%&#xD;
      tea tree oil (TTO) gel.&#xD;

    <measure>Bleeding on probing</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Bleeding on probing was assessed at tested sites with graduated William's probe graduated in 1 mm increment, within 15 seconds after probing, using a dichotomous scoring system (+ and -) for presence or absence, respectively.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Biochemical assessment of inlammation</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This involved determination of the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) levels of matrix metalloproteinase 8 (MPP-8). A GCF sample was taken from the area showing the deepest pocket depth around the treated area.The samples were diluted in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) up to 1 mL. After waiting for 15 min, the paper points were removed, and 500 μL were centrifuged at 400 g for 4 min, then frozen at -20°C pending MMP-8 analysis using Human Matrix metalloproteinase 8/Neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) ELISA Kit according to the manufacturer instructions.</description>
