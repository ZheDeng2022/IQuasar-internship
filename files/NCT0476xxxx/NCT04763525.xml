  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study explored the effects of the implementation of the Pythagorean Self&#xD;
      Awareness Intervention (PSAI) on the dynamics of stress-related aging factors of immune cells&#xD;
      in healthy volunteers and a cohort patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus . The primary aim&#xD;
      was to evaluate the effectiveness of PSAI on two key biomarkers of biological age, telomere&#xD;
      length and proteasome levels, indicative of the crosstalk between cellular oxidative status&#xD;
      and replicative potential, with respect to metabolic, hormonal and mental status changes.&#xD;
      Secondary aims of this study included reduction of depression, perceived stress, anxiety and&#xD;
      the establishment of lifestyle changes to enhance the quality of everyday life, including&#xD;
      better quality of sleep, eating behaviours and an overall healthier status.&#xD;

      Study design This non randomized non blinded parallel trial was conducted at the Laiko&#xD;
      Hospital of Athens, Diabetes Centre, First Department of Propaedeutic Internal Medicine of&#xD;
      Attica, Greece, from 4.10.2018 to 26.11.2019. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics&#xD;
      Committee of the Laiko Hospital (protocol number 5134/5-4-19) and was in accordance with the&#xD;
      declaration of Helsinki. All participants were enlisted in the study only after being fully&#xD;
      informed by the researcher about the aims and procedures of the research and submitting&#xD;
      written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Patients eligible for the above mentioned criteria were randomized in two groups:&#xD;
      the group of healthy adult volunteers, and adults with type 2 diabetes who attended the&#xD;
      outpatient diabetes clinic. This study was non-blinded, as patients and researchers were&#xD;
      aware of the group assignment.&#xD;

    <description>The PSAI is a mental, stress-management technique that promotes self-awareness, cognitive reconstruction and self-improvement based on the Golden Verses moral framework of the ancient Greek philosopher Pythagoras. The individual must practice the technique twice daily( at bed-time and in the morning, every day, at home) and through a 3-stage internal dialogue (recall of daily events, inspection of related thoughts and emotions and self-appraisal)is encouraged to detect wrong choices and unhealthy behaviours and initiate self-correction towards a healthier lifestyle.</description>
