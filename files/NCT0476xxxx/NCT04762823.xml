  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) affects approximately 1 million people in the US, with annual health&#xD;
      care costs approaching $11 billion. PD results from a loss of dopamine-producing cells in the&#xD;
      brain. This decrease in dopamine is associated with shaking, stiffness, slowness,&#xD;
      balance/walking problems, thinking, and fatigue which severely impair activities of daily&#xD;
      living. Current medical and surgical treatments for PD are either only mildly effective,&#xD;
      expensive, or associated with a variety of side-effects. Therefore, the development of&#xD;
      practical and effective therapies would have significant benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can influence how the brain works. A review of&#xD;
      studies concluded that, overall, tDCS improves walking and balance in people with PD (PwPD).&#xD;
      However, these studies had mixed results. For example, most have stimulated the frontal brain&#xD;
      areas and all have used intensities of 2 mA (milliamperes; a measure of electrical current&#xD;
      strength) or less. However, given the vital role of the cerebellum in walking and balance,&#xD;
      and in PD impairments, the cerebellum may represent a more effective brain target. A recent&#xD;
      review of studies also recommended performing investigations of higher intensity tDCS&#xD;
      (greater than 2 mA), to potentially increase stimulation efficacy. No study has investigated&#xD;
      the effects of multiple sessions of cerebellar tDCS on gait and balance in PwPD and none have&#xD;
      used tDCS intensities greater than 2 mA. Therefore, there is a critical need to determine if&#xD;
      repeated sessions of cerebellar tDCS might improve walking and balance in the short- and&#xD;
      long-term.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Movement Disorder Society version of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPRDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The scale includes four parts that assess activities of daily living (Parts I and II), a motor exam (Part III), and medication-related motor complications (Part IV). For all parts, a higher number indicates more disability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A nine-item questionnaire asking subjects to rate the severity of their perceived fatigue on a 1-7 point Likert scale (a higher number means more subjective fatigue).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A 20-item scale evaluating five dimensions of fatigue rated on a 1-5 point Likert scale (positively phrase items reverse scored; a higher number means more fatigue).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>30-meter walk test, single-task (30mWT-ST; 2 trials)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects walk at their usual/comfortable speed; walking characteristics and the time taken to complete the task are the primary outcomes (more time = worse performance)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>30-meter walk test, dual-task (30mWT-DT; 2 trials)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Same as 30mWT-ST, except the subjects perform a secondary/cognitive task during the walking. The secondary task will involve serially subtracting 7 from a randomly selected starting number (100, 125, 150, 200; won't repeat a starting number within a given session). Changes in task performance between single- and dual-task conditions represent dual-task interference.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>6-minute walk test (6MWT; 1 trial)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects walk back and forth between two markers spaced 30 m apart at the usual speed. The total distance walked is the primary outcome (longer distance walked is an analog for less fatigue).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>9-hole peg test (9-HPT; two trials with each hand)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects are instructed to pick up the pegs from a shallow cup one at a time, place them in the holes, and then immediately take the pegs back out of the holes one at a time. Time to put the pegs in and take them out again is recorded (more time = worse performance).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Reaction time test (simple and choice; 1 trial each)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Simple: A white box is displayed on a computer screen. When a black X appears in the white box, the subjects need to press the computer space bar as quickly as possible. Several trials with random inter-stimulus-intervals are presented. Choice: Four white boxes are displayed on the screen. When a black X appears in one of the boxes, the subjects need to press the appropriate key (z = left-most box, x = second from left, comma (,) = third from left, and period (.) = right-most) as quickly as possible. The average reaction time is recorded (more time = worse performance).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test (1 trial)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>On each trial, a central directional target (arrow) is flanked by similar stimuli on the left and right (five total arrows). The task is to indicate the direction of the central stimulus (i.e., the third arrow). On congruent trials, the flanker arrows face the same direction as the target. On incongruent trials, they face the opposite direction. Time to react to the different conditions is recorded (more time = worse performance).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Trail Making Test A and B (TMT A/B; 1 trial each)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Both parts consist of 25 circles (Part A: numbered 1 - 15; Part B: numbers and letters 1- 13 and A - L). The subject draws lines connecting the numbers in ascending order (Part A: 1-2-3-4-5 etc.) and then in alternating-ascending order (Part B; e.g., 1-A-2-B-3-C, etc.) as quickly and as accurately as possible without lifting the pen/pencil off the paper. Time to complete the &quot;trail&quot; is recorded (more time = worse performance).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale (BBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>14-item scale rated on a 0 - 4 Likert scale that assesses balance performance in several dynamic and static conditions (lower score = worse balance).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Static Posturography.</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>1) stand on a firm surface (directly on a force platform) for 1 minute with eyes open (balance characteristics [95% confidence interval of the total 2D area explored, the center of pressure movement velocity in forward/backward and left/right directions] are the primary outcomes), 2) stand on a foam surface (6 cm foam pad placed on top of force platform) for 1 minute with eyes open (the same balance characteristics as above are the primary outcomes).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brain activity PET Imaging with [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, up to 12 months</time_frame>
