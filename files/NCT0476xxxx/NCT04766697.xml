  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Synergistic interactions among substance abuse, violence, and HIV/AIDS, dubbed the SAVA&#xD;
      syndemic, are highly linked to HIV acquisition among African Americans. Given limited&#xD;
      literature and development of interventions for HIV-negative but high-risk heterosexual AA&#xD;
      couples, there is a need for SAVA risk-reduction development tailored to this population.&#xD;
      Phase 1 consisted of qualitative interviews with 16 couples who met study criteria to gather&#xD;
      input and information to adapt an 8-session couple-based SAVA syndemic informed risk&#xD;
      reduction intervention for HIV-negative, AA heterosexual couples who reported intimate&#xD;
      partner violence (IPV) and substance abuse. Phase 2 is the focus of this trial and will&#xD;
      consist of delivery of the intervention to 20 couples who meet study inclusion criteria to&#xD;
      test the adapted intervention. Given the disproportionate impact of HIV on AAs, this study&#xD;
      addresses a key gap in literature by testing the first SAVA informed risk-reduction&#xD;
      intervention for high-risk, HIV-negative, heterosexual AA couples.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Synergistic interactions between substance use, violence, and HIV/AIDS (SAVA syndemic) are&#xD;
      closely linked with HIV acquisition among African Americans (AAs). However, no interventions&#xD;
      have been developed to address SAVA syndemic risk-reduction for HIV-negative but high-risk&#xD;
      heterosexual AA couples. This application builds on a qualitative study that was conducted&#xD;
      during phase 1 of a NIDA-funded project. In phase 1, the investigators finalized and tested&#xD;
      our recruitment protocol and conducted qualitative interviews with 16 couples who met study&#xD;
      criteria. This application focused on phase 2 of the funded study. As part of this study the&#xD;
      investigators will test an adapted 8-session couple-based SAVA syndemic informed&#xD;
      risk-reduction intervention for HIV-negative, AA heterosexual couples who report intimate&#xD;
      partner violence (IPV), and substance use. For this purpose, the investigators deliver the&#xD;
      intervention to 20 couples who meet study inclusion criteria to test the adapted&#xD;
      intervention. The intervention will be delivered online (via zoom) to individual couples.&#xD;
      These couples will be recruited through social media (Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter) and&#xD;
      advertising through local community-based organizations. The investigators will also inform&#xD;
      the couples who participated in phase 1 qualitative interviews about the opportunity to&#xD;
      participate in phase 2. Those who express an interest in participating in phase 2 will have&#xD;
      to complete screening again to make sure they are eligible for the present study. This&#xD;
      research will be done as part of a grant proposal funded by NIDA. Given the disproportionate&#xD;
      impact of HIV on AAs, this study addresses a key gap in literature by testing the first SAVA&#xD;
      informed risk-reduction intervention for high-risk, HIV-negative, heterosexual AA couples.&#xD;
