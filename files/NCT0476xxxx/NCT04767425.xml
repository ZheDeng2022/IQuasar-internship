    <textblock>
      This is non comparative prospective interventional study with some areas for observational&#xD;
      research to implement based image guided adaptive cervical cancer brachytherapy ( BT )&#xD;
      combined with Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy ( IMRT ) / Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (&#xD;
      VMAT) external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) ± chemotherapy (ChT) , and to take advantage of its&#xD;
      full potential.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Eligible patients will receive both external beam radiotherapy ( EBRT) and concomitant&#xD;
           chemotherapy and brachytherapy ( BT). Summation of EBRT and BT doses will be performed&#xD;
           by calculation of a biologically equivalent dose in 2 Gy per fraction (EQD2) using the&#xD;
           linear-quadratic model with α/β = 10 Gy for tumor effects and α/β = 3 Gy for late normal&#xD;
           tissue damage. The repair half time is assumed to be 1.5 hrs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EBRT will be delivered as IMRT/VMAT with daily cone beam Computed Tomography ( CT )&#xD;
           Image Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT) in 25 fractions with 1.8 Gy to a total dose of 45 Gy&#xD;
           given in 5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3D image-based cervical cancer brachytherapy will be delivered as 4 sessions x 7 Gy High&#xD;
           Dose Rate (HDR) brachytherapy , with ''Pre-radiotherapy Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI&#xD;
           ) examination'' to provide sufficient information about tumor extent in three dimension&#xD;
           (3D) at the time of diagnosis and ''BT MRI examination'' is alse needed to provide&#xD;
           sufficient information about tumor/target extent at the time of brachytherapy with the&#xD;
           applicators in place .&#xD;
&#xD;
      For EBRT ; Using the cumulative Dose-volume histograms ( DVH ) to ensure that minimum dose to&#xD;
      the target 95%, maximum dose limited to 107%, also, the dose to the organ at risk will be&#xD;
      kept to the minimum according to the Radiation therapy oncology group ( RTOG )&#xD;
      recommendation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For BT ; Dose volume adaptation will be performed with the aim of dose escalation in large&#xD;
      tumors (prescribed D90 &gt; 85 Gy , Dose volume constraints (D2cc) were 70-75 Gy for rectum and&#xD;
      sigmoid and 90 Gy for bladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differential DVH, the dose standard deviations will be used to asses dose homogeneity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conformity index and dose gradient measure will be calculated . Collection of data : Data&#xD;
      will be collected by doctor himself in Excel sheet . Statistics : numerical Data will be&#xD;
      reported with mean , median , standard deviation &amp; variance and represented with suitable&#xD;
      graph like histograms and frequency polygon . Discrete data will be analyzed with suitable&#xD;
      tests like Chi-square test &amp; fisher's exact test and will represented with suitable graph&#xD;
      like pie graph .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inferential statistics will be reported with 95 confidence interval &amp; A P-value &lt;0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered as statistically significant .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival analysis will be analyzed using the actuarial Kaplan Meier method , time will be&#xD;
      calculated with date of diagnosis .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from patients who had not reached the endpoint at the time of last follow -up will be&#xD;
      treated as censored observations&#xD;
