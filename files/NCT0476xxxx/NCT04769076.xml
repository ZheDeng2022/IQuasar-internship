      This trial is a prospective, open, single-arm phase II clinical trial. The trial will enroll&#xD;
      40 patients with nasopharyngeal cancer stage III-IVA (UICC 8th edition). Subjects will&#xD;
      receive paclitaxel (albumin-bound) combined with cisplatin and PD-1 inhibitor (sintilimab)&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy and radical concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy.&#xD;
