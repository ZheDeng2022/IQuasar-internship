  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spatial repellents are chemical-based devices that when placed in a room, make that room&#xD;
      non-conducive for mosquitoes. These tools can be used to help in the fight against vector&#xD;
      borne diseases such as malaria and dengue. However, their efficacy in reducing mosquito&#xD;
      biting and therefore malaria transmission has never been evaluated in Africa. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of a spatial repellent in reducing mosquito biting on human beings and&#xD;
      measure the impact any reduced biting will have on malaria transmission. The investigators&#xD;
      will recruit and follow-up 6,120 children between 6 months and &lt;10 years of age in Busia&#xD;
      County to determine how many times they will be infected with malaria in villages where the&#xD;
      investigators will have distributed spatial repellents and compare the rate of infection to&#xD;
      villages where the investigators will not have distributed the repellent devices.&#xD;
      Additionally, the investigators will measure whether the distribution of spatial repellents&#xD;
      in one village will drive mosquitoes to their neighboring houses thereby increasing malaria&#xD;
      transmission in those areas. The children participating in the study will be divided into 3&#xD;
      groups (cohorts). The first group will be followed up during the first 4 months before any&#xD;
      intervention is distributed and the purpose here will be to determine that the villages are&#xD;
      comparable. After this, the investigators will recruit the next group of participants and&#xD;
      follow them up for 1 year and repeat this again for another year. During the follow-up, the&#xD;
      children will be asked to come to the health facility where they will be tested for malaria&#xD;
      using RDT or blood slide for microscopy. Every two weeks, a member of the study team will&#xD;
      come to the participant's house and ask them if they had any history of fever. If the&#xD;
      participants had fever, they will be tested for malaria. All children who turn out to be&#xD;
      positive for malaria by RDT will be treated free of charge. At the same time, the&#xD;
      investigators shall also perform mosquito collections to determine the impact of spatial&#xD;
      repellents on the density of Anopheles mosquitoes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spatial repellents have been widely used for the prevention of mosquito bites but their&#xD;
      protective efficacy (PE) in reducing mosquito-borne diseases has never been evaluated in&#xD;
      Africa. To address this knowledge gap, western Kenya was selected as a site to estimate the&#xD;
      impact of a transfluthrin-based spatial repellent (SR) on malaria-related outcomes in Busia&#xD;
      County, where baseline malaria transmission ranges from 2.5 to 4.1 new infections per person&#xD;
      per year. A total of 6,120 children between 6 months and &lt;10 years of age will be enrolled&#xD;
      for active case detection and active infection detection from 60 clusters (30 intervention&#xD;
      and 30 control) in three separate cohorts (baseline, cohort 1 and cohort 2). The baseline&#xD;
      cohort (2,040 subjects) will be followed for four months prior to placement of the SR&#xD;
      intervention. After the implementation of the SR, a cohort of participants (cohort 1 with&#xD;
      2,040 subjects) will be enrolled and followed for 12 months. The last cohort of children&#xD;
      (cohort 2 with 2,040 subjects) will be enrolled at end of follow up of cohort 1 and followed&#xD;
      for 12 months. Further, each of cohort 1 and cohort 2 followed with intervention will be&#xD;
      split into two subgroups, one subgroup (1,680 subjects total across two arms) residing in&#xD;
      'core zones' of each cluster to estimate the direct effect of the SR and a second group&#xD;
      (2,400 subjects total across two arms) residing in cluster 'buffer zones' to estimate the&#xD;
      degree of diversion (or mass effect) of mosquitoes and malaria transmission from persons&#xD;
      protected by the SR to persons who are unprotected. The baseline, cohort 1 and cohort 2&#xD;
      populations will be followed once every two weeks with finger prick blood samples taken once&#xD;
      every 4 weeks to test for malaria or whenever a participant reports a recent (within 48&#xD;
      hours) history of fever. The incidence of malaria in the baseline cohort will be used to&#xD;
      validate underlying assumptions prior to intervention. The incidence of malaria in each&#xD;
      cohort followed with intervention will be estimated and compared to determine the benefit of&#xD;
      using an SR in an area with high, year-round transmission of malaria. Monthly collections of&#xD;
      mosquitoes using CDC light traps will be conducted to determine if there are entomological&#xD;
      correlates of SR efficacy that may be useful for the evaluation of new SR products. Quarterly&#xD;
      human landing catches will be done to assess the behavioral effects of the SR. The primary&#xD;
      hypothesis on PE against the first-time malaria infection will be estimated by comparing the&#xD;
      hazard rates of first-time malaria infection between SR and placebo upon the completion of&#xD;
      the study in the ITT population.&#xD;
