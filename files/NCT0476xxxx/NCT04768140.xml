      In this study, it is investigated that whether Bobath approach is superior to conventional&#xD;
      physiotherapy in terms of improving hemiplegic shoulder pain, spasticity and upper extremity&#xD;
      functionality in stroke patients.&#xD;

      Objective: This study aims to determine the effect of Bobath approach on hemiplegic shoulder&#xD;
      pain, spasticity and upper extremity functionality in stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods: For this prospective, randomized, controlled and single-blind trial, 30&#xD;
      stroke patients aged 40-65 years with hemiplegic shoulder pain were included. Patients were&#xD;
      divided into two groups and randomized into these groups. Only conventional physiotherapy was&#xD;
      applied to the control group, whereas both conventional physiotherapy and Bobath exercises&#xD;
      were also applied to the experimental group. Visual analog scale (horizontal) for shoulder&#xD;
      pain, modified Ashworth scale for spasticity and Fugl-Meyer assessment of the upper extremity&#xD;
      for functionality were used for both pre-test and post-test.&#xD;
