  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study to compare the outcomes of mini punch grafting in patients with resistant stable&#xD;
      non-segmental vitiligo already on narrowband ultraviolet B and receiving either no additional&#xD;
      medication , systemic mini pulse (high and low dose) steroids, topical superpotent steroids&#xD;
      once every other day , or daily tacrolimus ointment .in terms of the extent of repigmentation&#xD;
      , frequency of reactivation and side effects.&#xD;

      Vitiligo, a depigmenting skin disorder, is characterized by the selective loss of&#xD;
      melanocytes, which in turn leads to pigment dilution or loss in the affected areas of the&#xD;
      skin. Vitiligo reportedly affects 0.5% to 2% of the world's population, without a clear&#xD;
      preference for race or sex. Vitiligo is clinically classified into two main clinical&#xD;
      patterns: nonsegmental and segmental. Dermoscopy facilitates the diagnosis of vitiligo .and&#xD;
      can be used to assess the evolution of the stage of the disease (stability, progression,&#xD;
      repigmentation) as well as the response to treatment. Stability of vitiligo refers to the&#xD;
      arrest of disease activity, in terms of the absence of new lesions, no extension of&#xD;
      pre-existing lesions, and an absence of Koebner's phenomenon among other features. The&#xD;
      duration of stability is a matter of debate, ranging from as little as six months to as long&#xD;
      as two years Recent studies have indicated that skin lesions observed in vitiligo tend to&#xD;
      recur in the same places where they were found before treatment. This phenomenon is explained&#xD;
      by the presence of a recently described subset of memory T cells known as cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation( CD8 + )resident memory T cells (TRM) in lesional vitiligo patient skin and a&#xD;
      role in disease maintenance and relapse following treatment has been suggested. Thus, the use&#xD;
      of immunosuppressants/modulators could ameliorate their activity hence playing a role in&#xD;
      stabilizing or treating the disease. . They could also improve the results of surgical&#xD;
      options utilized in stable vitiligo refractory to medical treatments including tissue grafts&#xD;
      (full-thickness punch, split-thickness, and suction blister grafts), cellular grafts&#xD;
      (autologous melanocyte cultures and non-cultured epidermal cellular grafts. In addition to&#xD;
      cultured epidermal suspensions and hair follicle transplantation These immune-modulators&#xD;
      include: systemic and topical corticosteroids, a topical calcineurin inhibitor, and&#xD;
      phototherapy&#xD;
