  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospecrtive study including 20-30 randomized patients treated by open repair because of an&#xD;
      TAAA larger than 55 mm During the surgery, a heart lung machine is applied for distal&#xD;
      perfusion during aortic cross clamping to enable distal organ perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless an intensive inflammatory reaction is a well known effect after reperfusion,&#xD;
      leading to a uncontrolled inflammation during th first days after surgery. This may be&#xD;
      associated to bad outcome and decreased survival rates. By the application of a&#xD;
      intraoperative cytokine and DAMP filter this negative ffect could be reduced, resulting in a&#xD;
      better outcome after surgery.&#xD;
