  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study aims to prove that the efficacy of non digestible carbohydrates&#xD;
      supplementation (daily dose of 20 grams consumed twice a day for 12 weeks) on the regulation&#xD;
      of glucose homeostasis is superior than placebo in prediabetic subjects.&#xD;
