      Background and Introduction Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) is an evidenced based&#xD;
      psychotherapy for PTSD. It is considered a first line treatment and has ample evidence&#xD;
      supporting it's effectiveness (ISTSS and VA/DOD clinical practice guidelines). This therapy&#xD;
      is manualized and a framework is provided to ensure consistent delivery. Additionally, the VA&#xD;
      Office of Mental Health Operations sponsors training and dissemination of CPT throughout the&#xD;
      VA system and the PI of this study is a trainer and consultant of this therapy. Flexibility&#xD;
      exists in the protocol and CPT can be delivered in unorthodox modalities such as telehealth&#xD;
      (Moreland et al, 2015) and on compressed time schedules (Held et al, 2020; Bryan et al,&#xD;
      2018). While the literature supports the effectiveness of these interventions in unique&#xD;
      settings, no known studies have looked at outcome data of real-world outpatient clinics. The&#xD;
      PTSD Clinical Team provides CPT as part of it's standard care with a variety of adaptations.&#xD;
      The team practices measurement based care and routinely collects self-report symptom&#xD;
      inventories to track patient progress. This study aims to use data collected as part of&#xD;
      standard care in this clinic to evaluate the effectiveness of these treatment adaptations in&#xD;
      this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose and Objectives The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of how CPT for PTSD&#xD;
      is delivered. Initial areas of review will include in person vs. telehealth delivery and&#xD;
      timing (daily vs. weekly).&#xD;
