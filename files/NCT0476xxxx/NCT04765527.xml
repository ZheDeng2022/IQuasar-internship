    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the effect of using a turmeric-based supplement for&#xD;
      2-weeks on muscle damage and soreness that occur in the body after 90-minutes of exercise.&#xD;
      Participants will first come to the human performance lab (HPL) for orientation and pre-study&#xD;
      fitness tests including muscular fitness and body composition. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to turmeric or placebo groups, and take 2 tablets of the supplements each day for&#xD;
      the first two weeks. Participants will report back to the HPL on a Monday to engage in weight&#xD;
      lifting and calisthenics for 90 minutes. Fitness tests (vertical jump, bench press, leg-back&#xD;
      lift for strength, 30-second cycling sprint test) and blood samples will be given and&#xD;
      collected before and after this exercise session. Participants will then come back to the HPL&#xD;
      each morning, Tuesday through Friday, in the early morning to provide blood samples and&#xD;
      retake the fitness tests. This study will entail seven HPL visits over a 3-week period.&#xD;

      Orientation, Supplementation, and Basic Study Procedures (Visit #1): Participants will first&#xD;
      come to the Human Performance Lab (600 Laureate Way, North Carolina Research Campus,&#xD;
      Kannapolis, NC) for an orientation to study procedures. This will include a review of the&#xD;
      consent form, completion of basic questionnaires, and an introduction to the eccentric muscle&#xD;
      exercise bout and the strength/power performance testing protocol (about 1.5 hours) (visit&#xD;
      #1). This will be followed by another lab session for pre-study measurements and sample&#xD;
      collection (visit #2). Participants will be randomized to turmeric or placebo groups, and&#xD;
      provided a 2-weeks supply of supplements (in supplement trays). Participants will consume 2&#xD;
      tablets each day in the morning just prior to breakfast. The supplement and placebo tablets&#xD;
      will look the same. The supplements will have codes. Participants and the staff will not know&#xD;
      what are in the tablets until the study is over. The supplement is called &quot;Turmeric Strength&#xD;
      for Joint&quot; and is sold by the study sponsor (MegaFood). For purposes of this study, the&#xD;
      supplement will be called &quot;turmeric&quot;. The ingredients are healthy and include turmeric root&#xD;
      extract, black pepper extract, boswellia gum resin extract, devil's claw root extract, and&#xD;
      ginger root. The turmeric supplement provides a minimum of 300 mg curcumin. Compliance to the&#xD;
      supplement plan will be checked weekly through email correspondence from the Research&#xD;
      Manager. A 3-day food record will be collected during the end of the 2-week supplementation&#xD;
      period to assess the participants' background diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 5 other lab visits during a one-week period starting on a Monday&#xD;
      (visit #3), with morning visits at about 7:00 am on Tuesday through Friday (visits 4-7). At&#xD;
      each of the 7 lab visits, participants will come to the lab at 7:00 am not having consumed&#xD;
      food or beverages (other than water) for at least the previous 9 hours, and having abstained&#xD;
      from vigorous exercise for at least the previous 24-48 hours. The Monday session will take&#xD;
      about 2.5 hours (7:00 to 9:30 am), and the Tuesday through Friday sessions will take about&#xD;
      30-45 minutes each. The total amount of time participants will be asked to volunteer for this&#xD;
      study is about 8-9 hours at the performance lab. Seven blood samples will be collected and&#xD;
      analyzed for various measures of muscle damage, inflammation, and oxidative stress. After&#xD;
      each of the blood draws, participants will complete the Profile of Mood States (POMS)&#xD;
      questionnaire to gauge mood, energy, and vitality. Participants will also provide a delayed&#xD;
      onset of muscle soreness (DOMS) rating. Two urine samples will be collected (before and after&#xD;
      the 2-week supplementary period) and analyzed for key metabolic markers of turmeric&#xD;
      ingestion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Testing (Visit #2) Participants will come to the lab at 7:00 am in an overnight&#xD;
      fasted state dressed in exercise clothes. Participants will provide a blood sample. A trained&#xD;
      phlebotomist will collect a maximum of 35 ml blood (a little over 2 tablespoons).&#xD;
      Participants will also provide a spot urine sample in a private location in the restroom.&#xD;
      Participants will collect a mid-stream urine sample in a disposable urine cup. Height, body&#xD;
      weight, and body composition will be measured in a private section of the lab. Bioelectrical&#xD;
      impedance (BIA) using the seca BIA scale will be used to assess body composition (i.e., the&#xD;
      percent of body weight that is fat tissue) and body weight. Participants will remove shoes&#xD;
      and socks and stand with bare feet on the seca scale for about 7-10 seconds while grasping&#xD;
      side rails with their hands. Percent body fat will also be measured using the BodPod.&#xD;
      Participants will sit inside the BodPod with a tight-fitting swim suit for about 10 minutes&#xD;
      while body fat is calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Profile of Mood States (POMS) (short version, 40 items) is a rating scale to assess&#xD;
      &quot;right now&quot; mood states, energy, and vitality. Participants will also provide a rating of&#xD;
      delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS) using a 1-10 scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will perform some light exercises to warm up, followed by four muscle function&#xD;
      tests: vertical jump, bench press, leg-back strength, and anaerobic power through the&#xD;
      30-second Wingate test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Vertical jump: Participants will first stand erect with the feet flat on the floor and&#xD;
           reach as high as possible with both arms and hands (standing reach height). Participants&#xD;
           will then squat down and jump as high as possible with one arm and hand, and tap the&#xD;
           measuring device on the Vertec vertical jump apparatus (jump height). This will be&#xD;
           repeated three times, with the best score recorded as the difference between the jump&#xD;
           and standing reach heights.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Bench press to exhaustion: Participants will lie down supine on a bench, and with&#xD;
           spotters standing on either side attempt to bench press a weighted bar equal to 50%&#xD;
           (females) or 75% (males) body weight as many times as possible (to a metronome set at 60&#xD;
           beats/min or 30 lifts/min). The bar must touch a foam block on the chest lightly in the&#xD;
           down position, and the arms must be straight in the up position.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Leg-Back Strength: Leg/lower back strength will be assessed with a dynamometer. With the&#xD;
           legs slightly bent at the knee, participants will grasp a bar attached via a chain and a&#xD;
           force measuring device with straight arms, and then lift up with maximal effort for&#xD;
           several seconds. This will measure the isometric strength of both legs and back, and&#xD;
           will be repeated three times.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 30-Second Wingate Cycling Test: The Lode cycle ergometer will be adjusted to body weight&#xD;
           (7 watts per kilogram), and then participants will sprint cycle at maximal speed for 30&#xD;
           seconds. The peak power and average power will be recorded and adjusted to body mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing Sequence, Day of Eccentric Muscle Exercise (Monday, Visit #3) and 4-Days Recovery&#xD;
      (Tuesday through Friday) (Visits #4-7):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will come to the lab at 7:00 am in an overnight fasted state (i.e., no food or&#xD;
      beverages other than water for at least the previous 9 hours). Participants will be weighed&#xD;
      and then provide a blood sample. A spot urine sample will be collected on Monday.&#xD;
      Participants will then complete the POMS questionnaire, and give a DOMS rating. The&#xD;
      supplements will be consumed with water. Participants will perform some light exercises to&#xD;
      warm up, followed by the four muscle function tests: vertical jump, bench press, leg-back&#xD;
      strength, and anaerobic power through the 30-second Wingate test. Participants will take&#xD;
      these performance tests before and after the 90-minute eccentric muscle exercise bout, and&#xD;
      each of the following four mornings at the performance lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After taking the four performance tests, participants will engage in 90-minutes of eccentric&#xD;
      exercise that include 16 movements (calisthenics, resistance exercise, jumps, 2-3 sets, with&#xD;
      rest intervals).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately following exercise, participants will provide a blood sample, complete the POMS&#xD;
      questionnaire, and provide a DOMS muscle soreness rating. Participants will then take the&#xD;
      four muscle function tests. Participants will return at 7:00 am in an overnight fasted state&#xD;
      four days in a row (Tuesday through Friday) after Monday's eccentric exercise bout, and&#xD;
      provide a blood sample, complete the POMS, provide DOMS ratings, and follow this with&#xD;
      ingestion of the supplements. Following ingestion of the supplements, participants will take&#xD;
      the four muscle function tests. During this week of testing and recovery, participants will&#xD;
      engage in normal training and diet habits.&#xD;
