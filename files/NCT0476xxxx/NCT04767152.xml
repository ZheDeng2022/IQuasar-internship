  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is aimed at assessing changes in the brain of patients from 6 to 18 years old with&#xD;
      a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia during chemotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia receive long-term combined chemotherapy treatment,&#xD;
      one of the main part of this treatment is methotrexate. Methotrexate can cause acute,&#xD;
      subacute, and long-term neurotoxicity. Clinical symptoms of neurotoxicity, such as seizures,&#xD;
      aphasia, are often associated with leukoencephalopathy. However, leukoencephalopathy may&#xD;
      develop asymptomatically in children receiving methotrexate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of chemotherapy on the neurological status of patients is widely covered in the&#xD;
      literature. There are very few studies devoted to the quantitative assessment of MRI&#xD;
      parameters, especially in children. MRI is a non-invasive method that does not harm the&#xD;
      patient and can be used to assess absolutely all structures of the brain.&#xD;
