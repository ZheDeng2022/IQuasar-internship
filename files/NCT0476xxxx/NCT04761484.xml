  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm infants are at risk of hypothermia following delivery and in the first few hours of&#xD;
      life. Hypothermia in extremely low birth weight infants' is an independent risk factor for&#xD;
      death. These infants' are at additional risk of hypothermia when they undergo procedures such&#xD;
      as central catheter insertion following admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators think that in extremely preterm infants, placing a peripheral intravenous&#xD;
      cannula on admission to the NICU, instead of umbilical catheters (UVC and/or UAC), will&#xD;
      increase the proportion of infants with a rectal temperature in the normal range at 2 hours&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothermia is an independent risk factor for death in preterm newborns.(1) Despite measures&#xD;
      to improve temperature in preterm newborns in the delivery room (DR), hypothermia on&#xD;
      admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at NMH is common. In a cohort of infants&#xD;
      &lt; 32 weeks' gestation born at NMH in 2019, 54% of infants had a rectal temperature &lt; 36.5 oC&#xD;
      on admission to the NICU.(2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many preterm infants have procedures performed soon after admission to the NICU; in 2019, 98%&#xD;
      of infants born before 29 weeks' gestation at NMH had an umbilical venous catheter inserted.&#xD;
      This may/often involve(s) prolonged periods of handling and potential exposure to cold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators prospectively studied a cohort of 26 infants &lt; 32 weeks who had invasive&#xD;
      procedures within 3 hours of birth performed in the NICU at NMH between November 2018 and&#xD;
      June 2019. Almost three-quarters [19/26 (73%)] had an abnormal temperature at the beginning&#xD;
      of the procedure; and 17/26 (65%) had an abnormal temperature at the end of the procedure.&#xD;
      Only 3 (11%) infants maintained a normal temperature throughout the procedure. Perhaps more&#xD;
      concerning is the severity of the hypothermia observed; 13 (50%) infants had a temperature &lt;&#xD;
      36.0oC before and 11 (42%) after the procedure. The median duration of procedure was 53 (37,&#xD;
      73) minutes.(3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators think that in extremely preterm infants, placing a peripheral intravenous&#xD;
      cannula on admission to the NICU, instead of umbilical catheters (UVC and/or UAC), will&#xD;
      increase the proportion of infants with a rectal temperature in the normal range at 2 hours&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;
