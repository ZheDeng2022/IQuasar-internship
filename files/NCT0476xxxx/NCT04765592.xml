  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of surgically induced de novo aortic dissection converted to open-heart surgery or secondary intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days, 6 months, and 12 months after operation</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of surgically induced de novo aortic dissection converted to open-heart surgery or secondary intervention 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months after operation.Whether or not the patient experienced surgically induced de novo aortic dissection converted to open-heart surgery or secondary intervention will be determined.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of major adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days post operation</time_frame>
    <description>Refers to all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or respiratory failure occurring within 30 days after surgery. More specifically, myocardial infarction refers to a drastic reduction or complete interruption of the coronary blood supply due to coronary artery disease, resulting in severe and prolonged acute ischemia of the corresponding myocardium, leading to necrosis of cardiomyocytes. Ischemic stroke refers to the result of necrosis of brain tissue caused by narrowing or occlusion of the arteries supplying blood to the brain or insufficient blood supply to the brain. Respiratory failure is defined as a state resulting in significantly prolonged intubation, tracheotomy, deterioration of lung function, or other fatal outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of aortic aneurysm-related mortality</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post operation</time_frame>
    <description>Refers to mortality caused by a ruptured aortic aneurysm or endovascular interventional treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of severe adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days, 6 months, and 12 months after operation</time_frame>
    <description>Refers to an event that occurs during the clinical trial that results in mortality or serious deterioration in patient health, including a fatal illness or injury, a permanent defect in body structure or body function, or an event that requires medical or surgical intervention to avoid one or more permanent defects in body structure or body function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of device-related adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days, 6 months, and 12 months after operation</time_frame>
    <description>Device-related adverse events refer to an adverse medical event related to the use of a device that occurs during the clinical trial. However, a distinction should be made with respect to normal postoperative stress response, such as fever and chest and back discomfort, which, in the judgment of the investigator, need not be recorded as an adverse event. Recording of device-related adverse events will be applicable for conditions that are deemed by the investigator to be definitely related, possibly related, or of indeterminate relationship, to the test device.</description>
