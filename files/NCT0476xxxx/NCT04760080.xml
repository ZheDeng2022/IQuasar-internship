  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a BRAF mutated melanoma are usually treated in France by a first line of&#xD;
      immunotherapy followed by a second line that combines a BRAF inhibitor (dabrafenib,&#xD;
      vemurafenib, encorafenib) and a MEK inhibitor (trametinib, cobimetinib, binimetinib).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination dabrafenib/trametinib is initially very efficient but it is unfortunately&#xD;
      limited because acquired resistances usually occur after a year of treatment. Patients who&#xD;
      become resistant to dabrafenib/trametinib and immunotherapy, unfortunately do not have an&#xD;
      approved effective treatment at their disposal. They usually receive a palliative&#xD;
      chemotherapy by dacarbazine or fotemustine, and they have a mean overall survival that is&#xD;
      less than three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activation of autophagy in presence of BRAF and MEK inhibitors is a known mechanism of&#xD;
      resistance to BRAF/MEK inhibitors. Hydroxychloroquine is an autophagy inhibitor and it has&#xD;
      been suggested in vitro that it could decrease resistance to BRAF/MEK inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the positive results in 2018 of a phase I/II study in the USA that showed the&#xD;
      efficacy and the absence of toxicity of the association of Dabrafenib, Trametinib and&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine when used as a first line treatement, we proposed to our patients who had&#xD;
      become resistant to the dabrafenib/trametinib combination, to pursue their treatment beyond&#xD;
      progression and to receive in addition hydroxychloroquine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prescription was initiated in patients for whom no further therapeutic options were&#xD;
      available, after validation by a multidisciplinary tumor board. All patients were informed&#xD;
      that the combination dabrafenib/trametinib/hydroxychloroquine was not approved by a&#xD;
      regulatory agency.&#xD;
