  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beyond EV-B, there are clinical observations to implicate other viruses in birth defects,&#xD;
      including CHD. Since the Rubella epidemic of 1960s', however, viruses have received little&#xD;
      attention and certainly no comprehensive study, especially using next generation sequencing&#xD;
      (NGS), has been undertaken in this context. The current pandemic as well as those caused by&#xD;
      Zika, influenza, Ebola and Lassa Fever (among many) have shown pregnant women and their baby&#xD;
      are at high risk. Therefore, an open-minded approach is warranted when considering the role&#xD;
      of maternal viral infections in CHD. Even less is known about maternal immune response, such&#xD;
      as antibody production, to these viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's goal is to answer the above gaps in knowledge. The investigators propose&#xD;
      to do that using two different approaches; one retrospective (analysis of samples in two&#xD;
      existing, large biorepositories) and the other prospective. The investigator's have created a&#xD;
      multi-disciplinary team to bring together the needed expertise from individuals who have&#xD;
      overlapping and vested interest in this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's specific aim is to examine the diversity of the gut virome in non-pregnant&#xD;
      and pregnant women with and without diabetes, with special emphasis on known cardiotropic&#xD;
      viruses (those with tropism for cardiac tissues). This study is seen by the investigator's as&#xD;
      the first step prior to a larger prospective multi-institutional study to specifically assess&#xD;
      the linkage between the maternal virome and CHD pathogenesis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine prevalence in non-pregnant women (i) the investigators will perform PCR analysis&#xD;
      of stool and blood from a prospective cohort of 225 women with diabetes (and 225 without) and&#xD;
      sequence the amplicons, and (ii) perform ELISA (IgM and IgG) analysis of sera collected&#xD;
      concurrently. They will assay IgM/IgG positive samples for neutralizing antibodies. To&#xD;
      determine prevalence in pregnant women (i) the investigators will perform PCR analysis of 1st&#xD;
      trimester stool and blood from a prospective cohort of 450 women with diabetes (and 450&#xD;
      without diabetes) and sequence the amplicons, and (ii) perform ELISA (IgM and IgG) analysis&#xD;
      of sera collected at 1st and 2nd or 3rd trimester. They will assay IgM/IgG positive samples&#xD;
      for neutralizing antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also perform a comprehensive virome analysis using metagenomic shotgun&#xD;
      sequencing with ViroCap enrichment, a method developed by co-PI, on 1st trimester stool&#xD;
      samples from a subset (~4-500) of women (both EVB positive and negative) enrolled in Aim 1.&#xD;
      The investigators will complement this data with VirScan® analysis of blood collected from&#xD;
      the same women at 1st and 2nd/3rd trimester. VirScan® is a revolutionary new technique for&#xD;
      comprehensive profiling of sera for antibodies against ~400 species and strains of pathogenic&#xD;
      viruses.&#xD;

    <description>Determine the prevalence of EVB among women with or without diabetes. For this aim, the investigators will use PCR analysis of stool and blood to detect EVB and ELISA (IgM and IgG) of blood to detect anti-EVB antibodies in samples collected from pregnant and non-pregnant women (with or without diabetes) at multiple time points. The investigators will also sequence the PCR amplicons and carry out antibody neutralization assays of IgM/IgG positive samples to identify the specific EVB. The non-pregnant cohort will consist of 225 women with diabetes (and 225 without) sampled at 3-month intervals over 1 years. The pregnant cohort will consist of 450 women with diabetes (and 450 without) with sampling at 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimesters.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiotropic Virus Detection</measure>
    <time_frame>6 years</time_frame>
    <description>Determine the burden of other pathogenic human viruses in pregnant women with diabetes. Beyond EVB, other viruses could (and likely do) cause CHD. Further, while PCR is quite sensitive for detection of nucleic acid sequences of interest, its results are primer dependent. Therefore, in this aim, the investigators will perform a comprehensive virome analysis (the viral component of the microbiome) using metagenomic shotgun sequencing with ViroCap enrichment, a method developed by a co-PI of this proposal, on 1st trimester stool samples from a subset (~4-500) of women (both EVB positive and negative) enrolled in Aim 1. The investigators will complement this data with VirScan® (version 3) analysis of blood collected from the same women at 1st and 2nd/3rd trimester. VirScan® is a revolutionary new technique for comprehensive profiling of sera for antibodies against ~400 species and strains of pathogenic human viruses.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maternal Immune Response</measure>
    <time_frame>6 years</time_frame>
    <description>Determine the extent of correlation between EVB and other viruses with CHD. Because CHD cannot typically be diagnosed until 20-24 weeks gestation and the investigators are prospectively enrolling participants at 6-14 weeks, they will not know which participants will develop CHD during the enrolled pregnancies. The investigators anticipate ~40-50 CHD-affected pregnancies. If not done in Aim 2, the investigators will carry out virome (blood and stool) and VirScan® (blood) analysis of 1st trimester samples from these women.</description>
