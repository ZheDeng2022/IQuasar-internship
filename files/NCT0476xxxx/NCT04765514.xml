  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the optimal treatment regimen for elderly Glioblastoma (GBM) patients with poor&#xD;
      performance status (PS) is unknown. Based on data for elderly GBM patients and the limited&#xD;
      data for patients with poor PS, hypofractionated RT or a short course of Temozolomide (TMZ)&#xD;
      may provide survival benefit without the added toxicity and inconvenience of a more&#xD;
      protracted treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, treatment with RT or TMZ monotherapy on the basis of methylated O6 - methyl&#xD;
      guanine - DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status, followed by the&#xD;
      alternative therapy at progression, may provide a safe and effective treatment regimen for&#xD;
      patients with poor PS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this trial is that in elderly GBM patients with poor performance status&#xD;
      (age ≥ 65 years and KPS 50-70), a biomarker-guided approach to therapy results in&#xD;
      non-inferior overall survival compared to combined TMZ/RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, biomarker-guided therapy will consist of TMZ monotherapy for patients with a&#xD;
      methylated MGMT promoter, and hypofractionated RT (40 Gy in 15 fractions) for patients with a&#xD;
      non-methylated MGMT promoter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that biomarker-guided therapy will result in non-inferior progression-free&#xD;
      survival, reduced toxicity and increased cost-effectiveness compared to combined&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To compare overall survival of standard vs biomarker-guided therapy in elderly and frail&#xD;
      patients with newly diagnosed GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate progression-free survival following treatment in both arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate adverse events according to CTCAE criteria in both arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate health-related quality-of-life as assessed by MMSE and EORTC&#xD;
           QLQ-C30/QLQ-BN20 questionnaires in both arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate cost-effectiveness of standard vs biomarker-guided therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to two treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio. Standard Arm: TMZ with&#xD;
      concurrent RT (combined modality arm) Patients will receive 15 days of TMZ daily with&#xD;
      concurrent RT. TMZ will be delivered at a dose of 75 mg/m2, given daily with RT. TMZ will be&#xD;
      administered 1 hour before each session of RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a 4-week break, patients will receive six cycles of adjuvant TMZ according to the&#xD;
      standard 5-day schedule (days 1-5) every 28 days, up to 6 cycles as tolerated by the patient.&#xD;
      The dose will be 150 mg/m2 for the first cycle and increased to 200 mg/m2 beginning with the&#xD;
      second cycle, so long as there are no hematologic adverse events, intractable nausea or&#xD;
      fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Arm: Biomarker based treatment MGMT (+): TMZ monotherapy Patients will&#xD;
      receive TMZ at a dose of 75 mg/m2 daily for 15 days on weekdays (Monday through Friday). This&#xD;
      will be followed by six cycles of TMZ according to the standard 5-day schedule (days 1-5)&#xD;
      every 28 days. The dose will be 150 mg/m2 for the first cycle and increased to 200 mg/m2&#xD;
      beginning with the second cycle, so long as there are no hematologic adverse events. Dose&#xD;
      will be determined using the body surface area (BSA) calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MGMT methylation (-): No TMZ will be given. Participants will receive radiation treatment&#xD;
      with 40Gy / 15 fractions over a period of 21 days (3 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon treatment completion, participants will be followed by every 3 months for 2 years and&#xD;
      every 6 months for years 3-5. Response and progression will be evaluated using the new&#xD;
      international criteria proposed by the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology working group&#xD;
      (RANO).&#xD;
