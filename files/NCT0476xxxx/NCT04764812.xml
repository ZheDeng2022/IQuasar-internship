  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuromuscular diseases caused by disruption of the normal conduction relationship between&#xD;
      nerve system, neuromuscular junction, and muscles cause scoliosis as a secondary deformity.&#xD;
      Neuromuscular scoliosis progresses due to muscle weakness and characteristic features of&#xD;
      disease. The risk of complications associated with increased progression. Morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality caused by scoliosis in neuromuscular diseases can be reduced by increasing the&#xD;
      knowledge and awareness of the caregivers and physiotherapists. In this study, it was aimed&#xD;
      to determine the risk of neuromuscular scoliosis and the factors which can cause in children&#xD;
      with disabilities. It is also aimed to reveal inferences related to education levels,&#xD;
      awareness of caregivers and professionals working in this field to determine cases with a&#xD;
      high risk of scoliosis. Thus, it is expected to leading future research to develop preventive&#xD;
      treatment approaches. For this purpose, 288 children who are diagnosed with the neuromuscular&#xD;
      disease between 3-18 years of age, attending Rehabilitation Center in Istanbul and willing to&#xD;
      participate in the research permitted by their caregiver will be included in this study.&#xD;
      Cerebral Palsy Follow-Up Program (CPUP), Parents and Professionals Awareness Questionnaire&#xD;
      related to Neuromuscular Scoliosis which is prepared by researchers, Early Onset Scoliosis 24&#xD;
      Questionnaire, Scoliosis Research Society 22 Questionnaire to assess QoL, demographic and&#xD;
      clinical data also will collect for all sample. Patients will be examined for musculoskeletal&#xD;
      system, scoliosis analysis will be performed radiologically. Data obtained to determine the&#xD;
      problems, risk factors, and awareness of the caregivers and physiotherapists will be analyzed&#xD;
      statistically.&#xD;

    <measure>Early Onset Scoliosis 24 Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The EOSQ-24 represents a subjective, parent-based, and self-report questionnaire. It includes 11 separate items in 24 questions. The domains are general health, pain, pulmonary function, mobility, physical function, daily living, fatigue, emotion, parental burden, financial burden, and satisfaction. Each question rated using a 5-point Likert scale. Total score obtain by adding domains. Higher scores indicates better qualitiy of life.</description>

    <measure>Scoliosis Research Society 22 Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>SRS-22 questionnaire was developed by SRS to evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) and the Turkish version was validated in 2005. The SRS-22 questionnaire consists of 22 items Likert type scale that allows scoring between 1-5 for each question. SRS-22 has five domains including function, pain, mental health, self-image and satisfaction. Subgroups can be evaluated separately, or the total score is obtained by summing up the scores from all questions. The total score of each section ranges from 5 to 25, only the section evaluating satisfaction from the treatment is in the range of 2-10. Scoring is obtained by dividing the total score of each section by the number of questions in that section. Higher scores indicate better quality of life.</description>
