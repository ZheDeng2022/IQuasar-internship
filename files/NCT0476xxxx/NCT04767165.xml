  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is aimed at assessing changes in the bone marrow of patients from 6 to 18 years old&#xD;
      with a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia during chemotherapy. Patients of the same&#xD;
      age without hematological diseases will be recruited as a control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ratio of fat to water in the bone marrow depends on the cellularity of the bone marrow.&#xD;
      In addition to the water/fat ratio in bone marrow there are also other parameters for&#xD;
      quantitative MRI assessment. These include the apparent diffusion coefficient (ACD), the T1&#xD;
      relaxation time, mapping of the macromolecular proton fraction. The undoubted advantage of&#xD;
      MRI is its non-invasiveness and the ability to assess any localization of the bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI may become a new non-invasive method for assessing the ratio of fat to cells in the bone&#xD;
      marrow in children with hematological malignancies, which can help in making a diagnosis and&#xD;
      monitoring the response to therapy.&#xD;
