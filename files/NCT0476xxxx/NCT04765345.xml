      The overall goal of this project, co-funded by the Foundation Fighting Blindness and the&#xD;
      USHER 1F Collaborative is to characterize the natural history of disease progression in&#xD;
      patients with PCDH15 mutations in order to accelerate the development of outcome measures for&#xD;
      clinical trials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This natural history study of patients with PCDH15 disease-causing variants will accelerate&#xD;
      the development of outcome measures for clinical trials. Sensitive, reliable outcome measures&#xD;
      of retinal degeneration will greatly facilitate development of treatments for retinitis&#xD;
      pigmentosa due to PCDH15 disease-causing variants. Together these approaches are expected to&#xD;
      have an impact on understanding PCDH15 related retinal degeneration, developing experimental&#xD;
      treatment protocols, and assessing their effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals and expected impact of this natural history study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describe the natural history of retinal degeneration in patients with biallelic&#xD;
           disease-causing variants in the PCDH15 gene&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Contribute to the identification of sensitive structural and functional outcome measures&#xD;
           to use for future multicenter clinical trials in PCDH15 related retinal degeneration&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Contribute to the identification of populations for future clinical trials of&#xD;
           investigative treatments for PCDH15 related retinal degeneration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of the natural history study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Characterize the natural history of retinal degeneration associated with biallelic&#xD;
           pathogenic mutations in the PCDH15gene over 4 years, as measured using functional,&#xD;
           structural, and patient-reported outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Explore whether structural outcome measures can be validated as surrogates for&#xD;
           functional outcomes in individuals with biallelic pathogenic mutations in the PCDH15&#xD;
           gene&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Explore possible risk factors (genotype, phenotype, environmental, and comorbidities)&#xD;
           for progression of the outcome measures at 4 years in individuals with biallelic&#xD;
           pathogenic mutations in the PCDH15 gene&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Explore variability and symmetry of left and right eye outcomes over 4 years in&#xD;
           individuals with biallelic pathogenic mutations in the PCDH15 gene&#xD;
