  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Telemedicine for diabetic patients is currently based simply on remotely monitoring capillary&#xD;
      blood glucose levels. This experimental approach remains limited to insulin-treated diabetic&#xD;
      patients with sufficient motivation and ability to use connected devices and only considers&#xD;
      one aspect of the care required by diabetic patients. So far, telemedicine has not offered a&#xD;
      more global approach to the therapeutic support of patients. This failing leads to recurrent&#xD;
      hospitalizations for acute metabolic events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of an individualized care pathway based on a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary tele-medical network on a territorial scale. This pathway will include a&#xD;
      base program with follow-up that can be adapted and revised thanks to the regular use of&#xD;
      collaborative tele-expertise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possibility of monthly multidiciplinary meetings via Tele-expertise between the different&#xD;
      diabetes centers of the hospital groups would help to define and implement an individualized&#xD;
      care pathway for diabetic patients hospitalized on a recurring basis (≥2&#xD;
      hospitalizations/year), which would be defined collegially during the multidiciplinary&#xD;
      meetings .&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes control, assessed on the level of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), improves&#xD;
      complications such as microangiopathy. To reduce cardiovascular disease, better global&#xD;
      management including an individualized care pathway is required. Inadequate care results in a&#xD;
      high rate of re-hospitalizations during the year (approximately 15 to 20% of all diabetic&#xD;
      patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, the only contribution of telemedicine in the context of diabetes has been the&#xD;
      teletransmission of data from electronic monitoring logs, including insulin doses and&#xD;
      capillary blood glucose measurements, to platforms accessible to healthcare teams (physicians&#xD;
      and non-medical staff). Remote monitoring according to these methods can lead to asynchronous&#xD;
      therapeutic proposals whose effectiveness on HbA1c levels has already been demonstrated and&#xD;
      the contribution of telemonitoring has also already been validated on the improvement of&#xD;
      certain cardiovascular risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, this experimental approach remains limited to insulin-treated diabetic patients with&#xD;
      sufficient capacity and motivation to use connected devices. It only considers one component&#xD;
      of the care required by patients with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now, telemedicine has not proposed a global approach to the therapeutic accompaniment&#xD;
      of diabetic patients. Thus, recurrent hospitalizations for acute metabolic events&#xD;
      (ketoacidosis, severe hypoglycemia) or complications related to diabetes (severe foot wounds,&#xD;
      cardiovascular accidents, visual or renal alterations) are frequently observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ambition of our project is therefore to demonstrate the feasibility of setting up an&#xD;
      individualized care pathway that can be supported by a multidisciplinary tele-medical network&#xD;
      on a regional level. This pathway will include a basic program and a follow-up which can be&#xD;
      adapted and revised through regular use of collaborative tele-expertise.&#xD;

    <description>After the intial pre-inclusion visit, 30 days before inclusion, a multidiciplinary tele-expertise meeting will be held to decide which patients are eligible for inclusion in the individualized care pathway. The aim is to demonstrate the feasibility of telemedicine through collaborative tele-expertise for the collegial definition of an individualized care pathway, in the context of diabetic patients with unscheduled hospitalization, iteratively over the year (≥ 2/year). The feasibility will be assessed by the number of inclusions and the number of patients included who have had at least 3 of the 4 planned follow-up visits.</description>

    <description>This research aims to demonstrate the feasibility of telemedicine through collaborative tele-expertise for the collegial definition of an individualized care pathway, in the context of diabetic patients with unscheduled hospitalizations repeated throughout the year (≥ 2/year). The feasibility will be assessed by the number of patients who have had at least 3 of the 4 planned follow-up visits, that is to say, who are eligible for the individualized care pathway.</description>

    <description>Implementation of an individualized care pathway defined in concertation with a multidisciplinary tele-expertise meeting held every 3 months for one year. These multidisciplinary tele-expertise meetings will be held between each of the normal routine consultations which are part of the normal, basic diabetic program which includes a consultation with a dietitian, monitoring by a state-registered nurse and treatment prescribed by the patient's general practitioner (with or without a consultation with the clinical pharmacist).</description>
