  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute cholecystitis or pancreatitis due to gallstones benefit from emergency&#xD;
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Patients with emergency LC show improvement in their&#xD;
      quality of life within one month compared to those treated. Delayed LC (after the acute phase&#xD;
      has passed and recovered) and less time to work. This strategy reduces the risk of repeated&#xD;
      admissions with more pain or pancreatitis. There are many studies on the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      Elective LC and Transversus Abdominis Plan (TAP) Block on pain. However, a prospective study&#xD;
      on the reduction of postoperative pain with emergency LC and TAP Block has not been carried&#xD;
      out until now. This study will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the TAP Block in&#xD;
      patients undergoing emergency LC.&#xD;

      Patients to be included in the study will be selected from the group between the ages of 18&#xD;
      and 70 who apply to general surgery and emergency outpatient clinics, depending on patient&#xD;
      approval. All patients will be informed about the surgery and procedures to be performed.&#xD;
      Patients who agree to participate in the study will be included in the study. The study will&#xD;
      be carried out by 2 surgeons with 5 years of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) experience.&#xD;
      Adult patients presenting with acute cholecystitis who underwent emergency LC by one of the&#xD;
      two surgeons will be included in the study. These two surgeons will be responsible for&#xD;
      participant registration. Patients with fever greater than 3.37.2 ℃, including 1) a diagnosis&#xD;
      of acute cholecystitis confirmed by hepatobiliary ultrasound, 2) a high leukocyte count (&gt; 7&#xD;
      × 109 / L), will be included in the study. Patients undergoing elective laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy (E-LC) and patients who are converted to an open procedure will be excluded&#xD;
      from the study. Patients will be divided into two groups. In Group A, patients with emergency&#xD;
      LC will be administered intravenously 1 gr vial of paracetemol in 30 minutes during the&#xD;
      awakening phase. In Group B, the lateral part of the latissumus dorsi muscle attaches to the&#xD;
      external lip of the iliac crest, behind the middle axillary line and the end is directed&#xD;
      towards the cranial, firstly the external oblique muscle and fascia, then the internal&#xD;
      oblique muscle and fascia, and after hydrodissection with saline physiological. 15-20 ml of&#xD;
      local anesthetic agent (Bupivacaine 0.5%) will be injected bilaterally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy will be applied in two groups. Nasogastric tube will be&#xD;
      inserted after intubation in both groups and will be removed at the end of the operation.&#xD;
      Age, height, weight, ASA score, body mass index, duration of surgery, complications,&#xD;
      comorbidities, fever, leukocyte, CRP levels, ALT, AST, GGT, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin&#xD;
      values will be recorded. Pulse, heart rate, systolic and diastolic pressures, Oxygen&#xD;
      saturation (with a palimeter) will be recorded during surgery in both groups. VAS and VRS&#xD;
      pain scoring will be done after surgery. VAS (Visuale analogue score) 0-10 cm and VRS (no&#xD;
      pain in cough (score = 0); pain in cough, not in deep breathing (score = 1); pain in deep&#xD;
      breathing, but not at rest (score = 2); at rest pain will be evaluated as mild (score = 3);&#xD;
      pain at rest, severe (score = 4)). Evaluations will be made statistically between the two&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
