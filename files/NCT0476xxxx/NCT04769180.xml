    <textblock>
      Non Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS), or, better, Non Celiac Wheat Sensitivity (NCWS), since&#xD;
      it is not known the real pathogenetic component(s) of grain, is a syndrome characterized by a&#xD;
      cohort of symptoms, both gastrointestinal and extraintestinal, related to the ingestion of&#xD;
      gluten/wheat-containing food in subjects who are not affected by celiac disease (CD) or wheat&#xD;
      allergy. In particular, the possibility of extraintestinal manifestations in this condition&#xD;
      has been suggested by some reports. In most cases, they are characterized by vague symptoms,&#xD;
      such as headache, 'foggy mind', fatigue, joint and muscle pain, leg or arm numbness (i.e.,&#xD;
      fibromyalgia-like symptoms), even if more specific complaints have been described. A possible&#xD;
      neurological involvement has been underlined by NCWS association with gluten encephalopathy,&#xD;
      gluten ataxia, and gluten peripheric neuropathy. NCWS patients may show even psychiatric&#xD;
      diseases, such as anxiety, depression, and psychosis. Other described extraintestinal&#xD;
      manifestations are dermatitis, (eczema or skin rash), gynecological disorders, and anemia. In&#xD;
      addition, the association of NCWS with autoimmune diseases, such as autoimmune thyroiditis,&#xD;
      and presence of anti-nuclear or other autoantibodies has been demonstrated, suggesting that,&#xD;
      similarly to CD, NCWS might be considered as an immune system-related disease, and this&#xD;
      aspect should be of relevance. In conclusion, the novelty of this matter has generated an&#xD;
      expansion of literature data about the clinical features of the disease, with the unavoidable&#xD;
      consequence that some reports are often based on low levels of evidence. The aims of the&#xD;
      present study were to: a) retrospectively evaluate the prevalence and kind of extraintestinal&#xD;
      symptoms in a large cohort of NCWS patients; b) to research for a possible relationship&#xD;
      between the clinical, serological, genetic and histological characteristics of the NCWS&#xD;
      patients and the number and kind of extraintestinal manifestations. As control groups, the&#xD;
      researchers used CD and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) patients unrelated to NCWS or other&#xD;
      food allergies/intolerances.&#xD;

      Non Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS), or, better, Non Celiac Wheat Sensitivity (NCWS), since&#xD;
      it is not known the real pathogenetic component(s) of grain, is a syndrome characterized by a&#xD;
      cohort of symptoms, both gastrointestinal and extraintestinal, related to the ingestion of&#xD;
      gluten/wheat-containing food in subjects who are not affected by celiac disease (CD) or wheat&#xD;
      allergy. In detail, NCWS is distinguished by symptoms that typically take place soon after&#xD;
      gluten/wheat ingestion, withdraw with gluten/wheat exclusion, and relapse following&#xD;
      gluten/wheat challenge (i.e., double-blinded placebo-controlled, DBPC, gluten/wheat&#xD;
      challenge, used for diagnostic purpose) within hours or days. The gastrointestinal clinical&#xD;
      picture of NCWS is a combination of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like manifestations, such&#xD;
      as abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, or constipation, or alternation of diarrhea and&#xD;
      constipation, and dyspepsia like-symptoms, such as postprandial heaviness, early satiety, and&#xD;
      epigastric pain or burning. However, the possibility of extraintestinal manifestations in&#xD;
      this condition has been suggested by some reports. In most cases, they are characterized by&#xD;
      vague symptoms, such as headache, 'foggy mind', fatigue, joint and muscle pain, leg or arm&#xD;
      numbness (i.e., fibromyalgia-like symptoms), even if more specific complaints have been&#xD;
      described. A possible neurological involvement has been underlined by NCWS association with&#xD;
      gluten encephalopathy, gluten ataxia, and gluten peripheric neuropathy. NCWS patients may&#xD;
      show even psychiatric diseases, such as anxiety, depression, and psychosis. Other described&#xD;
      extraintestinal manifestations are dermatitis, (eczema or skin rash), gynecological&#xD;
      disorders, and anemia. In addition, the association of NCWS with autoimmune diseases, such as&#xD;
      autoimmune thyroiditis, and presence of anti-nuclear or other autoantibodies has been&#xD;
      demonstrated, suggesting that, similarly to CD, NCWS might be considered as an immune&#xD;
      system-related disease, and this aspect should be of relevance. In conclusion, the novelty of&#xD;
      this matter has generated an expansion of literature data about the clinical features of the&#xD;
      disease, with the unavoidable consequence that some reports are often based on low levels of&#xD;
      evidence. Therefore, only studies performed on large samples, with the inclusion of control&#xD;
      groups, may be able to clearly establish whether the large information from the literature&#xD;
      regarding extraintestinal NCWS manifestations could be supported by evidence-based&#xD;
      agreements. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to: a) retrospectively evaluate the&#xD;
      prevalence and kind of extraintestinal symptoms in a large cohort of NCWS patients, diagnosed&#xD;
      by DBPC gluten/wheat challenge; b) to research for a possible relationship between the&#xD;
      clinical, serological, genetic and histological characteristics of the NCWS patients and the&#xD;
      number and kind of extraintestinal manifestations. As control groups, the researchers used CD&#xD;
      and IBS patients unrelated to NCWS or other food allergies/intolerances.&#xD;

        NCWS Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        NCWS was diagnosed after CD or WA had been ruled out in all the studied patients according&#xD;
        to the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (1) negative serum assays for serum CD-anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG)&#xD;
             immunoglobulin (Ig) A and anti-deamidated gliadin peptide (anti-DGP) IgG antibodies;&#xD;
             (2) absence of intestinal villous atrophy, documented in all the patients carrying the&#xD;
             DQ2 and/or the DQ8 HLA haplotypes (thus irrespective of CD-specific serum antibody&#xD;
             negativity), evaluated when patients had a minimum intake of 100 g of wheat daily&#xD;
             since at least 2 weeks; (3) negative IgE-mediated immune-allergy tests to wheat (skin&#xD;
             prick tests and/or specific serum IgE detection); (4) resolution of symptoms on a&#xD;
             standard elimination diet, without wheat, cow's milk, yeast, and other food(s) causing&#xD;
             self-reported symptoms, followed by symptom reappearance on a DBPC wheat challenge.&#xD;
             Additional inclusion criteria were: age older than 18 years, follow-up duration longer&#xD;
             than 12 months after the initial diagnosis, and at least 2 outpatient visits during&#xD;
             the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NCWS Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (1) positive anti-endomysial antibodies (EmA) in the culture medium of the duodenal&#xD;
             biopsies, also in the case of normal villi/crypts ratio in the duodenal mucosa; (2)&#xD;
             self-exclusion of wheat from the diet and refusal to reintroduce it before entering&#xD;
             the study; (3) other previously diagnosed gastrointestinal disorders; (4) nervous&#xD;
             system disease and/or major psychiatric disorder; (5) physical impairment limiting&#xD;
             physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        CD Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (1) positive serum anti-tTG and EmA IgA and IgG antibodies; (2) presence of intestinal&#xD;
             villous atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        CD Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (1) self-exclusion of wheat from the diet and refusal to reintroduce it before&#xD;
             entering the study; (2) other previously diagnosed gastrointestinal disorders; (3)&#xD;
             nervous system disease and/or major psychiatric disorder; (4) physical impairment&#xD;
             limiting physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        IBS Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  IBS diagnosis was made in accordance with the Rome IV criteria. None of these patients&#xD;
             improved on the same standard elimination diet followed by the patients with NCWS for&#xD;
             4 weeks, thus confirming that the IBS diagnosis was unrelated to NCWS or other food&#xD;
             allergies/intolerances. The patients kept a food diary during the elimination diet&#xD;
             period to monitor their adherence to the diet; patients who did not strictly adhere to&#xD;
             the elimination diet were not included in this study group. In patients with a&#xD;
             diarrhea-predominant IBS presentation, the exclusion of other diagnoses was based on&#xD;
             the assays recently suggested by the American Gastroenterology Association&#xD;
&#xD;
        IBS Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (1) self-exclusion of wheat from the diet and refusal to reintroduce it before&#xD;
             entering the study; (2) other previously diagnosed gastrointestinal disorders; (3)&#xD;
             nervous system disease and/or major psychiatric disorder; (4) physical impairment&#xD;
             limiting physical activity.&#xD;
