  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The multiple baseline single subject design study with replication across three participants&#xD;
      in a public-school setting. The 15-week independent variable will be a direct service&#xD;
      occupational therapy intervention, combined with teacher consultations, based on the STAR&#xD;
      (Sensory Therapies and Research) Frame of Reference. Frequently measured dependent variables,&#xD;
      as the main determinants of change resulting from the intervention, will be student's&#xD;
      video-recorded performance in the areas of functional regulation and active participation in&#xD;
      the classroom, as rated by a trained observer. Findings of the single subject study will be&#xD;
      corroborated via semi-structured interviews with the student participants and their teachers,&#xD;
      administration of systematic assessments and Goal Attainment Scaling.&#xD;

    <measure>Repeated Dependent Variable Measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>5-7 weeks of Baseline and 15 weeks of intervention for a total of up to 22 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Repeated dependent variable measurement will be based on weekly video recorded samples of functional regulation and active participation behaviors in the classroom rated by a trained observer. Each student participant will be videotaped while in the general education classroom for 10 minutes once per week.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavior Assessment System for Children-3 (BASC-3)</measure>
    <time_frame>During first week of baseline and again within a week of completion of 15 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Behavior Assessment System for Children -3, as a teacher rating scale, is a tool that measures the student's adaptive and problem behaviors in the school setting. Scores will not be compared but general clinical categories that can be rated as normal, at risk or clinically significant.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Child Occupational Profile (SCOPE)</measure>
    <time_frame>During first week of baseline and again within a week of completion of 15 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Child Occupational Profile is a 25-item word-based occupation-focused assessment that measures components based on the Model of Human Occupation (MOHO) and was designed to provide a broad overview of a child's occupational participation. Total scores will be between 0 and 57. A higher score will be better, indicating better function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>During first week of baseline and again within a week of completion of 15 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A therapist who is using the Goal Attainment Scaling method with a student needs to both accurately predict the level of performance at the end of an identified period of time and decide upon what performance will look like in scaled intervals above and below the expected level of goal attainment. The teacher and occupational therapist then will develop the goal attainment follow-up guide in which expected level of achievement for each goal is scaled as zero, and achievement above and below is scaled from -2 to +2, to measure progress following intervention. 0 is expected performance and +2 is much more than expected.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Semi-structured interview with teacher</measure>
    <time_frame>Within a week of completing 15 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant's main classroom teachers will be interviewed in a semi-structured format to determine gains in perceived competency for supporting the students with sensory processing challenges following the last session of intervention.</description>

    <measure>Semi-structured interview with student</measure>

    <description>Each student participant will have the opportunity to comment on his or her lived experience in a semi-structured interview following the last session of the intervention.</description>
