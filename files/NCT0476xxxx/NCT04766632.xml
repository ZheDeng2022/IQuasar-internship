  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-grade gliomas represent 60 to 70% of adult glial tumors and are highly aggressive with&#xD;
      average survival from 12 to 15 months for glioblastomas (WHO grade IV gliomas) and from 2 to&#xD;
      more than 5 years for WHO grade III gliomas. The treatment of initial stage high-grade&#xD;
      gliomas is made with the most complete excision surgery possible followed by adjuvant&#xD;
      radiochemotherapy or an exclusive radiochemotherapy if excision is impossible. Most often,&#xD;
      these treatments are followed by adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of recurrence is most often re-irradiation according to stereotaxic modalities.&#xD;
      Determination of the volumes to be irradiated conditions effectiveness and tolerance in the&#xD;
      planning of these treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The definition of Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) is based on enhancing - T1 magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) after gadolinium injection. A margin of 1-2 mm is applied to define the PTV&#xD;
      (Planning Target Volume) or irradiated volume, approximately equal to the GTV-MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amino acid PET-CT (Positon Emission Tomography with Computed Tomography) could be an&#xD;
      interesting alternative to tumor delineation because its results, do not depend on the&#xD;
      rupture of the blood-brain barrier. Several studies have used amino acid PET in the planning&#xD;
      of radiotherapy treatment for high-grade gliomas, but without a well-conducted prospective&#xD;
      study. In the recurrent high-grade glioma population, no studies have been performed with&#xD;
      18F-DOPA.( 6-fluoro-[18F]-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine) The question therefore relates to the&#xD;
      interest of cerebral 18F-DOPA PET-CT to improve the delineation of the volumes to be&#xD;
      re-irradiated, during the recurrence of high-grade gliomas, and on the optimal methodology&#xD;
      for determining GTV- PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare GTV-TEP and GTV-MRI volumes with each other, and the r-GTV, volume corresponding&#xD;
      to the relapse objectified on the follow-up MRI, the analysis will be based on 3 parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DICE index, similarity index between 2 volumes,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contoured Common Volume (VCC), intersection of 2 volumes between them,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional Contoured Volume (VSC), total volume delineated with imaging minus the common&#xD;
           volume between 2 imageries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, within the rGTV relapse volume, it's important to know whether VSC of 18F-DOPA PET-CT&#xD;
      is significant compared to that of MRI and would thus allow better definition of the volumes&#xD;
      to be irradiated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of contrast enhancement in enhancing -T1 MRI, due to the rupture of the blood-brain&#xD;
      barrier may underestimate the volume to be irradiated. The natural course of these gliomas&#xD;
      after first irradiation is a second relapse within 12 months with, in 40% of cases, relapses&#xD;
      outside the initial radiation field.&#xD;
&#xD;
