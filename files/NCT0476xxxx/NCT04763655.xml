  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed study, we will utilize resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) and structural&#xD;
      MRI-based electrical field modeling to study the effect of electroconvulsive therapy on human&#xD;
      neural circuitry. Our study will recruit patients who are beginning treatment with bilateral&#xD;
      electroconvulsive therapy (N=75). Our design will be longitudinal we will follow patients up&#xD;
      until their 8th week electroconvulsive therapy clinically. The primary measure of interest&#xD;
      will be the slope of clinical change estimated with mixed effect modeling (see Approach).&#xD;
      Secondary measures will be the cognitive performance change between baseline and the 8th week&#xD;
      electroconvulsive therapy time point.&#xD;

    <measure>Rate of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>We will measure Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale weekly for 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome measure that we are interested in is the rate of change of the clinical response measured by the BPRS. To model the slope of change, we will use hierarchical linear modeling. Assuming linear improvement over time, the individual symptom trajectories may be modeled as Yij = β0j - β1j Xij + εij, where Y is the outcome measure (e.g. BPRS) at time i for patient j. β0j is the intercept and β1j is the slope for patient j, X.j is a vector of time predictor (in days from the start of the treatment), while ε is the error term (normally distributed with zero mean and unknown variance). In a second level analysis, we will extend to include sample averages of intercept and slope. In the second level analysis therefore we will estimate (1) β0j = μ0 + S0j and (2) β1j = μ1 + S1j, where S0j is the random intercept, and S1j is the random slope in patient j (the deviations from the group mean). The measure of primary interest in this study will be S1j.</description>
