      A parallel, single-blinded, multi-centre randomized controlled trial conducted at the South&#xD;
      Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI) and the Mary Mackillop Institute&#xD;
      for Health Research (MMIHR; Australian Catholic University), by researchers from the&#xD;
      University of Adelaide, Australian Catholic University and La Trobe University.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a parallel groups design, a total of 268 individuals will be recruited across both sites.&#xD;
      After a 2-week baseline period, and a baseline metabolic visit, participants will be&#xD;
      randomized into one of two groups (TRE, time-restricted eating; CP, current practice&#xD;
      guidelines). All participants will receive five (5) telehealth consultations at baseline,&#xD;
      week 2, 4, 8 and 12, the content of which will be based around their randomized condition.&#xD;
      They will undergo metabolic testing on two (2) further occasions (4 months, 12 months) over a&#xD;
      12-month period to assess the changes in primary and secondary outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>The TRE group will be instructed to follow TRE (9 h/day) every day for 12 months with no other dietary instructions or advice provided. The TRE group will attend the same consult schedule as the CP group, but consultations will focus on timing of dietary intake and strategies to promote adherence. No dietary guidance regarding quantity or quality will be provided. Participants will be able to self-select the precise 9-h schedule that will best suit their lifestyles, with the caveat that the latest time of eating will be set at 7:00 pm. Outside of the elected eating window, participants will be allowed to consume water and black coffee and/or tea.</description>

    <description>This group is designed to act as a comparator using 'standard care' in dietetics practice. Dietary advice provided to this participant group will be performed by Accredited Practicing Dietitians (APDs) in line with evidence-based guidelines, specifically the T2DM best-practice guidelines plus Australian Dietary Guidelines (i.e. Australian Guide to Healthy Eating) to improve diet quality, and strategies to promote adherence. No specific advice will be provided regarding time of day to start and finish eating and/or drinking (since this information is not outlined in current practice guidelines).</description>
