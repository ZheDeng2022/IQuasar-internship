  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S) characterizes a range of negative health and&#xD;
      performance outcomes that result from chronically low energy availability. RED-S concerns&#xD;
      high performance junior and senior athletes across Canada and has a prevalence rate of 3-60%.&#xD;
      Our ability to assess and diagnose RED-S remains poor. Accordingly, we aim to create the best&#xD;
      parameters to diagnose and manage RED-S; along with information of the prevalence and&#xD;
      severity across Canada and globally. These outcomes are expected to have a significant&#xD;
      positive impact on the health and performance of Canadian athletes in preparation for the&#xD;
      Olympic Games in 2022 and beyond.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim is to improve our understanding of the prevalence and symptoms of RED-S in&#xD;
      international and Canadian athletes and para-athletes, along with developing screening tools&#xD;
      and treatment protocols to manage RED-S in order to improve athlete health, availability and&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the prevalence of self-reported RED-S health outcomes in international and&#xD;
           Canadian elite female and male athletes and para-athletes as well as recreational&#xD;
           athletes (Study A);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the prevalence and severity of measured standard/basic RED-S health outcomes&#xD;
           including biomarkers and potential longitudinal (6-mo) tracking of outcomes across the&#xD;
           Canadian Olympic and Paralympic Sport Institute Network (COPSI) (Study B);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Implement a more advanced assessment, using novel RED-S assessment parameters in a&#xD;
           smaller cohort of key athletes, including potential longitudinal tracking over a 6-mo&#xD;
           period (Study C);&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assess longitudinal changes and the treatment of RED-S symptoms across a 6-month&#xD;
           follow-up period in a small cohort of elite Canadian athletes willing to partake in an&#xD;
           'holistic' RED-S treatment intervention arm (Study D);&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Utilize the data created from Studies A,B,C,and D to develop and validate potentially&#xD;
           novel RED-S assessment parameters in order to further validate the 'new' IOC RED-S&#xD;
           clinical assessment tool (CAT) version 2 to aid in the diagnosis of RED-S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be the first to systematically assess the prevalence and severity of outcomes&#xD;
      of RED-S in a large group of international and Canadian athletes and para-athletes (A), and&#xD;
      within the COPSI network (B,C), utilising physiological and performance tests and training&#xD;
      metrics for a more holistic assessment of potential outcomes (B,C,). This study will also aim&#xD;
      to strengthen the literature regarding to the time-course of changes in these outcomes&#xD;
      (B,C,D) and the efficacy of a simple nutritional intervention arm on these changes (D).&#xD;
      Finally, this multicentre project will be the largest to date in Canada and globally, and the&#xD;
      first to produce data on the prevalence of RED-S within the COPSI network (across A,B,C,D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study including online survey and physiological testing with&#xD;
      potential for follow-up in a subset of athletes. A separate study arm (study D) will be an&#xD;
      intervention arm with follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will be a combination of basic statistics such as t-tests and ANOVA's, as well as&#xD;
      more advanced statistical modelling (e.g. stepwise regression modelling, with first&#xD;
      identifying collinearity among independent variables via the implementation of variance&#xD;
      inflation factors (VIFs)) as well as questionnaire-based statistics and potentially principal&#xD;
      components analysis (PCA) will be implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiological data will be plotted against survey data to create links between RED-S symptoms&#xD;
      among various athlete groups (female vs male, able bodied vs disabled, sports groups, age&#xD;
      categories, etc.)&#xD;
