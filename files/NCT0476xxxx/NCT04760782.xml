  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study with a historical control group involving patients &gt;=50&#xD;
      years-old with an acute (&lt;3 weeks) Anderson &amp; D'Alonzo type II dens fractures identified on&#xD;
      cervical spine CT scan. This will be a pilot efficacy trial to compare treatment of odontoid&#xD;
      fractures with 8 weeks of treatment with a PTH analog (abaloparatide) + hard collar&#xD;
      immobilization in comparison to historical treatment with hard collar immobilization alone.&#xD;

      Treatment subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified and recruited when presenting with acute fracture to our medical&#xD;
      center. Under routine care at our center, all cervical spine fractures are evaluated, either&#xD;
      in person or via tele-consult for remotes sites, by a fellowship trained Orthopedic or&#xD;
      Neurosurgical Spine surgeon at the time of injury/hospitalization. If deemed amenable to&#xD;
      non-operative treatment, that patient is then referred to the spine fracture clinic for&#xD;
      serial clinical and radiographic follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be introduced to the patient by a PI-delegated provider from the study team&#xD;
      either during hospitalization or at their first visit to the spine fracture clinic -&#xD;
      typically within 2 weeks of injury. Informed consent for this study may thus be obtained at&#xD;
      one of two locations: (1) A majority (~75%) of these patients are admitted to the hospital;&#xD;
      these patients will be introduced to the study by a PI-delegated provider who is key&#xD;
      personnel on the study team, and may be consented while in the hospital. (2) Other patients&#xD;
      may be identified and recruited from our Orthopedic Spine Fracture clinic, which is the&#xD;
      referral repository for all non-operatively managed spine fractures within our health system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with acute Anderson &amp; D'Alonzo type II dens fractures, +/- C1 ring injury,&#xD;
      identified on cervical CT scan, and recommended for non-operative treatment will be recruited&#xD;
      for enrollment in the study. Acuity of the fracture will be determined by radiographic&#xD;
      appearance, pain, and mechanism. Type II fractures are defined as involving the waist of the&#xD;
      dens. For the purposes of this study, they will be defined as fractures meeting all of the&#xD;
      following criteria: &lt;25% of unilateral C2 superior articular process involvement and &lt;2 mm&#xD;
      extension caudally into the body of the dens. Fractures with bilateral superior articular&#xD;
      facet involvement or extension beyond 2 mm into the body will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient consents to participation in the study, baseline labs will be drawn. Patients&#xD;
      will consult with an endocrinologist from the study team who will review labs and confirm&#xD;
      their eligibility for the study. Lab values obtained during the screening process could&#xD;
      exclude patients include an elevated PTH or hypercalcemia. Given the medical complexity,&#xD;
      there will not be hard cutoff values for the labs but rather eligibility to participate will&#xD;
      be left to the clinical judgement of our endocrinology investigator (fellowship-trained&#xD;
      endocrinologist who is key personnel on the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will receive standard treatment of 12(+/-1) weeks of rigid hard collar&#xD;
      immobilization, as well as an 8-week course of 80 mcg abaloparatide during this time. Drug&#xD;
      will be initiated as soon after the injury as possible, and at the latest 4 weeks from injury&#xD;
      which will allow for completion of 8 weeks of drug administration during the period of hard&#xD;
      collar immobilization. Teaching on drug administration will be provided for enrolled patients&#xD;
      and their caregiver, if applicable, by designated study personnel prior to drug initiation -&#xD;
      either while inpatient, or at the outpatient endocrinology clinic visit. Treatment subjects&#xD;
      will otherwise receive the routine care that was provided to historical controls in terms of&#xD;
      length of hard collar immobilization spine fracture clinic follow-up and radiographic&#xD;
      evaluation. Treatment subjects will be followed with weekly phone calls by clinical personnel&#xD;
      on the study team for the duration of the 8-week treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be followed at the spine fracture clinic according to our usual&#xD;
      protocol every 4 weeks +/- 1 week (from the date of injury) out to 12 weeks. All patients&#xD;
      will fill out VAS Neck and Neck Disability Index (NDI) physical function questionnaires at&#xD;
      each clinic visit. Pain medication usage (MME) will be collected at each clinic visit. The&#xD;
      study will provide oral vitamin D supplementation if baseline labs are &lt; 30 mcg/dL. If&#xD;
      patients are currently on vitamin D, then they will continue and their current dose may be&#xD;
      modified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEXA scans will be obtained for all participants to assess baseline bone density. If a&#xD;
      patient has had a DEXA scan for routine care within the 12 months prior to consent, that scan&#xD;
      will be used as the baseline test and a separate test for research will not be ordered. If&#xD;
      needed, baseline DEXA will need to be completed within 1 month of starting study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All radiographs for treatment subjects will be obtained as part of routine care. These&#xD;
      include AP/Lateral at each of the 4 (+/-1) week and 8 (+/-1) week clinic visits, and&#xD;
      AP/Lat/Flex/Ext at the 12 (+/-1) week clinic visits. Final (12 +/-1 week) flexion/extension&#xD;
      radiographs will be evaluated for translational motion at the fracture site measured at the&#xD;
      posterior cortex of the dens and evaluated by the following criteria: None, Minimal (&lt;2 mm),&#xD;
      Moderate (2-4 mm), Mobile (&gt;4 mm). A non-contrast cervical spine CT scan at will be obtained&#xD;
      for research purposes at UVMMC at the 12 (+/-1) week time point. Final fracture&#xD;
      characteristics (obliquity, angulation, displacement) will be documented based on the 12-week&#xD;
      CT scan. Amount of fracture healing will be assessed on CT by a radiologist by the following&#xD;
      method: 1 mm coronal and sagittal sections across the fracture will be individually analyzed.&#xD;
      The radiologist will reconstruct the CT scan to true orthogonal coronal and sagittal images.&#xD;
      Each slice will be analyzed for the width of bridging bone as a percentage of the width of&#xD;
      the facture line. The sum total of the widths of bridging bone, divided by the sum total of&#xD;
      the fracture widths will be expressed as a percentage of total healing for that patient. This&#xD;
      absolute % of bridging bone will be the primary outcome. Fracture characteristics (obliquity,&#xD;
      angulation, displacement, comminution) on the injury CT scan will be documented for later&#xD;
      post-hoc analysis. Additionally, we will also compare our study group results to the union&#xD;
      rates documented in the existing literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our historical control group will be comprised of patients with type II odontoid fractures&#xD;
      (defined above) who were previously treated in our spine fracture clinic. Patients will have&#xD;
      been injured within the past three years, have completed 12+/-1 weeks of hard collar&#xD;
      immobilization, and available to return for follow-up imaging. Potentially eligible&#xD;
      historical controls will be identified by database query and chart/radiographs review of&#xD;
      patients from the fracture clinic. These patients will be contacted initially via letter or&#xD;
      email from a provider in the fracture clinic who helps to oversee it, with phone follow-up by&#xD;
      designated research personnel. If patients are interested in study participation, written&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained in person at UVMMC by designated research personnel. After&#xD;
      consent, control subjects will then complete a CT scan of the cervical spine for comparison&#xD;
      to those from our study group. If a 4-view cervical XR was not obtained at their final spine&#xD;
      fracture visit after injury (approximately 12 weeks after injury) as part of their routine&#xD;
      care, a 4-view cervical XR will be obtained for the study. Additionally, they control&#xD;
      subjects will complete VAS Neck and NDI physical function questionnaires.&#xD;
