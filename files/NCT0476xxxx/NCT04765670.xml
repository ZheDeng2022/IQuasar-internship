  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic neck pain causes errors in joint position sense. There are studies in the literature&#xD;
      suggesting that instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization and Kinesiotape applications&#xD;
      improve the joint position sense. There is no study examining these applications acutely on&#xD;
      joint position sense and pain in the cervical region. As a result of our study, we will&#xD;
      compare the effects of single-session instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization and&#xD;
      Kinesiotape application on pain and joint position sense.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be carried out on volunteers after the approval of the ethics committee.&#xD;
      Before the research, individuals and / or their relatives will be informed about the purpose&#xD;
      and content of the study. Volunteer individuals between the ages of 18-45 with chronic neck&#xD;
      pain will be included in the study after obtaining their informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly divided into two groups: Instrument assisted soft tissue&#xD;
      mobilization and Kinesiotape Applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization group, the trapezius and&#xD;
      sternocleidomastoideus muscles will be applied in a single session for 90 seconds.&#xD;
      Kinesiotape application will be applied to the trapezius and sternocleidomastoideus muscles&#xD;
      in one session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain will be evaluated with Visual Analog Scale and joint position sense will be evaluated&#xD;
      with Cervical Range of Motion device before and after application.&#xD;

    <description>The instruments will be applied to the soft tissue at 30º-60º angles, with multi-directional &quot;stroking&quot; movements. Instrument Assisted Soft Tissue Mobilization will be applied to the trapezius and sternocleidomastoideus muscles of the participants for 90 seconds.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Kinesiotape Application</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The application will be made from the insertion of the upper trapezoidal muscle to its origo . During taping, the patient will be allowed to sit in an upright position in a chair with a back, with the scapula fixed, without supporting the arms. Before taping, the patient will be positioned with the shoulder in adduction and the head in lateral flexion towards the contralateral side. The patient will be asked to perform shoulder abduction against resistance, and the insertion area of the upper trapezius fibers will be palpated. The initial 2-3 cm part of the band will be glued to the lateral of the acromion without stretching, after full (100%) stretching is applied to the 2-3 cm part of the band from the insertion area of the upper trapezoid fibers, the patient's head is rotated to the affected side and the arm part of the band is stretched along the muscle fibers. it will be glued up to the hairline without doing it.</description>
