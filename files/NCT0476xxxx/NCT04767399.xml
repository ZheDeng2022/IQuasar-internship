      Comparison of Postoperative Pain after Root Canal preparation, in Single and Multiple Visits,&#xD;
      with Reciprocating and Rotary Single-File Systems: A Randomized Clinical Trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:1. Compare between the postoperative pain after root canal preparation, in single and&#xD;
      multiple visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. To assess the influence of reciprocating and rotary single-file systems instrumentation on&#xD;
      post-operative pain.&#xD;

      Subjects allocation and randomization method:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All diagnoses and treatment procedures will be performed by a single operator in one&#xD;
           visit or multiple visits to eliminate or minimize individual variability in the&#xD;
           treatment between clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total of 160 patients, as per the inclusion criteria will be intervened. This will be&#xD;
           divided into two groups as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Group A (n=80) single visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Group B (n=80) multiple visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A and B will be subdivided into two groups (each group=40) based on the motion of&#xD;
           the files to be used either Reciprocation EOF (Edge one Fire file) or Rotational motion&#xD;
           PN (ProTaper Next files). Each subgroup will be divided based on either the tooth is&#xD;
           vital or non-vital (each subgroup=20) as shown in study design (Figure 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Figure 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A pulpal and periapical diagnoses will be done for each tooth on taking careful history,&#xD;
           clinical and radiographic examination based on the American Association of Endodontists&#xD;
           (AAE 2008) diagnostic guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The treatments in groups A or B by ProTaper Next or Edge one Fire will be randomized&#xD;
           with sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes (SNOSE) with 40 patients in PN group&#xD;
           and 40 patients in EOF group with allocation sequence and assigning to intervention&#xD;
           which will be done by blinded second investigator at the time of cleaning and shaping,&#xD;
           concealed from operator to reduce bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3. Treatment protocol Endodontic therapy consisted of local anesthesia (2% lidocaine with&#xD;
      epinephrine 1:100,000 (Xylocaine; Dentsply Pharmaceutical, York, PA) administration and&#xD;
      rubber dam isolation followed by access cavity preparation. A size # 10 stainless steel hand&#xD;
      K-file (Dentsply) will be used to check the patency of canal. Root ZX II apex locator (J&#xD;
      Morita Corp, Kyoto, Japan) will be used to determine the working length which will further&#xD;
      confirmed using periapical radiographs After working length determination, the canal will be&#xD;
      enlarged to size # 15 using stainless steel hand K-files (Dentsply). At this stage,&#xD;
      randomization will be carried out by second investigator based on SNOSE method and patients&#xD;
      will be assigned to two different rotary systems, namely, PN and EOF for cleaning and&#xD;
      shaping. The patient will be blinded to the type of rotary system used for cleaning and&#xD;
      shaping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systems Used for Cleaning and Shaping:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reciprocating motion single file system (n=40): The canals in this group will be instrumented&#xD;
      with an engine driven reciprocation motion using an Edge one Fire files (EOF) (EdgeEndo,&#xD;
      Albuquerque, New Mexico) with the same preset program specific for the WaveOne Gold&#xD;
      instruments, because Edge One Fire has no preset motion and manufacturer declare its full&#xD;
      compatibility with WOG counter-clock wise reciprocating motion with an engaging angle of 150°&#xD;
      and a disengaging angle of 30° at 300 rpm using an X-Smart Plus endodontic motor (Dentsply&#xD;
      Maillefer) with S (20 .06) or P (25 .06) for narrow or severely curved canals and M (35 .04)&#xD;
      or L (45 .03) for wide canals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rotation motion multiple file system (n=40): The canals in this group will be instrumented&#xD;
      with an engine driven rotational motion using a ProTaper Next (PN, Dentsply Sirona&#xD;
      Endodontics, Ballaigues, Switzerland) in continuous rotary motion at the speed of 300 rpm and&#xD;
      torque 2 Ncm with X1 (17 0.4) and X2 (25 0.6) used for preparation of narrow and curved&#xD;
      canals, using X3 (30 0.6), X4 (40 .06) and X5 (50 .06) for wide canals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irrigation Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same irrigation protocol will be applied in all groups; 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl)&#xD;
      will be delivered using disposable syringes and a 31-G side-vented needle (NaviTip needle;&#xD;
      Ultradent Products Inc, South Jordan, UT) inserted into the canal 3 mm short of the WL&#xD;
      between each instrument change. A total of 25 mL 2.5% NaOCl will be delivered per canal. The&#xD;
      smear layer formed during chemo-mechanical preparation will be removed by rinsing the canal&#xD;
      with 1 mL 17% EDTA and leaving the canal filled with this solution for 1 minute. Patency of&#xD;
      the apical foramen will be maintained during all the techniques by introducing a #10 or #15&#xD;
      K-type file (Dentsply) to a point 1 mm beyond the WL at each instrument change. The root&#xD;
      canals will be thoroughly dried with paper points after irrigation and before obturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obturation Techniques:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The canals will be subsequently filled with the gutta-percha cones of the respective systems&#xD;
      and AH-plus sealer (Dentsply Maillefer) using the continuous wave of condensation technique&#xD;
      ??? Excess gutta-percha will be removed with hot instrument and the coronal gutta-percha was&#xD;
      vertically condensed. The gutta-percha level will be reduced using hot plugger to a depth of&#xD;
      2 mm from the CEJ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The access cavity will be closed by Cavit and GIC&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4. Assessment of post-operative pain and statistical analysis All the participants will be&#xD;
      received a card containing VAS (visual analogue scale) to assess pain levels after root canal&#xD;
      treatment at 12 h, 24 h and 48 h. According to this scale, the level of pain will be&#xD;
      documented in the range of 0-10 numerically and verbally as no pain (0), mild pain (1, 2),&#xD;
      moderate pain (3-5), sever pain (6, 7), very severe pain (8), and worst pain possible (9,&#xD;
      10). All the participants will be explained about the scale verbally before the start of the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be contacted over telephone by the same clinician at 12, 24 and 48 h time&#xD;
      periods and ask to describe the general feeling in the area of the treated tooth, the&#xD;
      presence, absence, and intensity of the pain numerical and verbal, and intake of analgesics&#xD;
      if any. The information so obtained will be recorded at each follow-up period. None of the&#xD;
      patients will be prescribed with medication immediately after the treatment. They will be&#xD;
      asked to call the clinician by telephone if they feel any discomfort in the treated area at&#xD;
      any point of the follow-up time. If patient complained of pain, then the clinician will&#xD;
      prescribe ibuprofen 400 mg as over-the-counter drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: Responses of participants to the visual analogue scale and verbal pain scale&#xD;
      will be entered into a data spreadsheet software. Differences in post-operative pain between&#xD;
      different instruments and different visits will be analyzed using a combination of parametric&#xD;
      and non-parametric inferential analysis methods.&#xD;
