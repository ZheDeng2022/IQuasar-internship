  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PhaoeSOL (Microphyt, Baillargues, France) is a microalgae-based nutritional ingredient&#xD;
      developed with a patented production process that has New Dietary Ingredient (NDI) status&#xD;
      from the FDA (#1120). It is an extract of the microalgae Phaeodactylum tricornutum&#xD;
      standardized to 2.0% Fucoxanthin (FX) content by adding a food grade medium-chain&#xD;
      triglyceride (MCT)-oil and a tocopherol-rich (Vitamin E) extract (0.5 % w:w). PhaeoSOL is&#xD;
      intended for use as a source of the naturally occurring carotenoid, fucoxanthin, in food&#xD;
      supplement products for the general population at levels not to exceed 437 mg/person/day for&#xD;
      a maximal duration of 30 days of PhaeoSOL (equivalent to 10 mg fucoxanthin/person/day). Prior&#xD;
      studies suggest that marine algae and Fucoxanthinol may have anti-obesity, lipid lowering,&#xD;
      and glucose management enhancing properties. The purpose of this proof of concept pilot study&#xD;
      is to examine whether dietary supplementation of PhaoeSOL enhances the benefits of women&#xD;
      participating in an exercise and weight management program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will participate in a supervised exercise training 3 days per week at the&#xD;
      HCRF consisting of a 5-min warm-up, light stretching, resistance training (3 sets of 10&#xD;
      repetitions @ 60%-80% 1RM on the bench press, seated row, shoulder press, lat pulldown,&#xD;
      biceps curl, triceps extension, leg press, leg extension, leg curl, abdominal crunch/curl,&#xD;
      back extension), and cardiovascular training (walking or cycling for 20 to 30 min training at&#xD;
      60% to 80% heart rate reserve [HRR]). Additionally, participants will be asked to accumulate&#xD;
      10,000 steps per day of brisk walking on non-training days (goal &gt; 100 min./wk. of moderate&#xD;
      to vigorous exercise). Training will be recorded on training logs and by using an iPhone,&#xD;
      Fitbit or pedometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given 1,400, 1,500 kcal/day or 1,600 kcal/day diets based on resting&#xD;
      energy expenditure determination designed to promote a 400-500 kcal/d energy intake deficit&#xD;
      following the American Heart Association (AHA) macronutrient distribution recommendations&#xD;
      (55% CHO, 30% FAT, 15% PRO). A goal energy intake, weekly diet plan, examples, and a food&#xD;
      substitution list will be provided. A phone app (e.g., MyFoodDiary) will be used to help&#xD;
      participants monitor and adhere to energy intake goals. In our prior studies, this exercise&#xD;
      and diet intervention has been shown to promote a 3-5 kg fat loss, 3-5% decrease in percent&#xD;
      body fat, a maintenance in fat free mass and REE, and improved health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoints: Differences in body weight, body fat mass (kg and %), and waist and hip&#xD;
      circumference at weeks 6 and 12 compared to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints: Differences in resting energy expenditure, aerobic capacity, estimated&#xD;
      1RM, muscular endurance total work, training volume, energy and macronutrient intake, blood&#xD;
      lipids, and HbA1c, IL6, CRPhs, TNFa, INF, Leptin, HbA1C, Insulin, Glucose, Comprehensive&#xD;
      Clinical Panel (HDL, LDL, TG, BUN, CREAT, etc.), side effects, SF-36 quality of life at weeks&#xD;
      6 and 12 compared to baseline.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Are pregnant, breastfeeding, or wish to become pregnant during the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Plan major changes in lifestyle (i.e. diet, dieting, exercise level, travel) during&#xD;
             the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have a recent history (&lt;3 months) of exercise training or weight loss (&gt; 5%);&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have an orthopedic limitation that would prevent participation in a general fitness&#xD;
             program;&#xD;
