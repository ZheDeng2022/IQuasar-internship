      CONCORD is a prospective observational study evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of&#xD;
      cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and computed tomography with fractional flow reserve&#xD;
      (CT-FFR) in patients with suspected coronary artery disease, using invasive fractional flow&#xD;
      reserve (FFR) as the reference standard.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD), CT coronary angiography (CTCA)&#xD;
      provides excellent sensitivity and negative predictive value, enabling the safe exclusion of&#xD;
      significant CAD. However, its positive predictive value remains suboptimal (c.50%).&#xD;
      Undertaking additional CT-FFR improves specificity and positive predictive value, reducing&#xD;
      unnecessary invasive coronary angiography. It has been established that CMR perfusion imaging&#xD;
      offers excellent diagnostic accuracy for the identification of functionally significant&#xD;
      coronary artery disease. The diagnostic performance of qualitative CMR perfusion assessment&#xD;
      may be further enhanced by additional quantitative assessment. The purpose of this&#xD;
      prospective observational study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of all three&#xD;
      modalities (CT-FFR and qualitative and quantitative CMR perfusion imaging), involving 300&#xD;
      patients with suspected coronary artery disease referred for invasive coronary angiography. A&#xD;
      subset of 167 subjects will undergo an additional accelerated CMR scan for comparison.&#xD;
      Invasively measured fractional flow reserve (FFR) will serve as the reference standard.&#xD;
