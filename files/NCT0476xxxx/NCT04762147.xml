      Objective of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the efficacy of intravenous paracetamol and fentanyl for intra-operative and&#xD;
      post-operative pain relief in patients undergoing diagnostic and therapeutic hysteroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no difference in pain control between intravenous fentanyl and paracetamol in&#xD;
      patients undergoing hysteroscopy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperative pain assessment will be based on:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic vital (SBP, DBP. MAP and HR) increase 20% from the baseline will be observed and&#xD;
      assumed pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain assessment will be based on:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean Pain score :Visual analogue pain scale (VAS) of 0-10 cms will be used to assess the pain&#xD;
      at the end of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic hysteroscopy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients presenting with abnormal premenopausal or postmenopausal uterine bleeding, pain,&#xD;
      infertility, intrauterine adhesions, endometrial biopsy, foreign body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic hysteroscopy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To remove IUD, uterine polyps, fibroid, foreign body and submucosal fibroids, sterilization.&#xD;
