  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to assess the effect of nitazoxanide delivered subgingivally as&#xD;
      thermosensitive hydrogel on the clinical and biochemical outcomes of SRP in patients with&#xD;
      moderate periodontitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, controlled clinical trial in a split-mouth design was conducted on forty&#xD;
      patients equally divided between two groups: a control group treated with full mouth scaling&#xD;
      and root planing (SRP) and a test group treated with SRP combined with subgingivally&#xD;
      delivered 0.01% NTZ sustained release Poloxamer 407/hyaluronic acid thermosensitive hydrogel.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Probing depth</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Probing depth was recorded at tested sites with graduated William's probe graduated in 1 mm increment. Readings were rounded to the nearest mm.</description>

    <measure>Clinical attachment loss</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical attachment loss was recorded at tested sites with graduated William's probe graduated in 1 mm increment. Readings were rounded to the nearest mm.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Bleeding on probing</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Bleeding on probing was assessed at tested sites with graduated William's probe graduated in 1 mm increment, within 15 seconds after probing, using a dichotomous scoring system (+ and -) for presence or absence, respectively.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gingival index</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Gingival index was assessed at 4 sites on six index teeth. Scores range from 0 to 3, with 0 being normal and 3 being severe inflammation</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Biochemical assessment of inflammation</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This involved determination of the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) levels of matrix metalloproteinase 8 (MPP-8). A GCF sample was taken from the area showing the deepest pocket depth around the treated area.The samples were diluted in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) up to 1 mL. After waiting for 15 min, the paper points were removed, and 500 μL were centrifuged at 400 g for 4 min, then frozen at -20°C pending MMP-8 analysis using Human Matrix metalloproteinase 8/Neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) ELISA Kit according to the manufacturer instructions.</description>
