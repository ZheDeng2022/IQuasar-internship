  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a rater-blinded, randomized controlled trial. All patients will receive esketamine&#xD;
      for treatment of Major Depression with Suicidal Ideation (MDSI). Subjects will be randomized&#xD;
      (1:1) to receive CBT (computer-assisted) or TAU alone following esketamine.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim 1: To determine the feasibility and safety of performing a larger study&#xD;
      examining the effectiveness and mechanism of action of CBT to improve the longer-term&#xD;
      outcomes following esketamine treatment in patients hospitalized for suicidal ideation or&#xD;
      suicide attempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the appropriateness and utility of the proposed tests of&#xD;
      cognitive control measures in exploring the mechanisms underlying the effects on depression&#xD;
      of esketamine and the combination of esketamine+CBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To examine the efficacy of esketamine+CBT combination compared to&#xD;
      esketamine+TAU in reducing suicidal ideation.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Esketamine:All participants will receive esketamine for MDSI (Major depression with suicidal ideation) as part of their standard care. The protocol will adhere to the FDA label for this product and the FDA-registered trials.&#xD;
CBT:Half of participants will be randomized to the CBT intervention, which will consist of an in-person and computer-based component (based on Good Days Ahead). In total, this will consist of 20 total sessions given over 16 weeks (the first 4 weeks of CBT will have sessions twice weekly; thereafter sessions will be held weekly).&#xD;
TAU only:Participants not randomized to CBT will undergo treatment as usual (TAU). These patients will undergo standard, post-hospitalization clinical treatments, which may include physician visits and psychotherapy (except for formal CBT).</intervention_model_description>
