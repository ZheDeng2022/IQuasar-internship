  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, two-stage, multi-arm Phase 1 study designed to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of combining niraparib with four standard chemotherapy regimens used to&#xD;
      treat TNBC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Niraparib is an oral, selective poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP)-1 and PARP-2 inhibitor. A&#xD;
      strategy of combining a PARP inhibitor, as a chemopotentiator, with chemotherapy is a&#xD;
      promising approach in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate the combination of niraparib with several standard chemotherapy regimens used to&#xD;
      treat breast cancer to determine a recommended Stage 2 dose (RS2D) of chemotherapy regimens&#xD;
      with niraparib. Stage 1 will be conducted in subjects with metastatic TNBC and will include 4&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment arms in escalating dose levels (Arm 1: doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      (AC) every 14 days with pegfilgrastim (or biosimilar) for 4 cycles followed by AC every 21&#xD;
      days; Arm 2: AC every 21 days; Arm 3: weekly paclitaxel; Arm 4: weekly paclitaxel +&#xD;
      carboplatin every 21 days), each combined with oral daily niraparib. Treatment will continue&#xD;
      until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or subject withdrawal.Stage 2 will be&#xD;
      conducted in subjects with non-metastatic TNBC. Subjects will receive neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy with either AC every 14 days (Arm 1A) or every 21 days (Arm 2A) at the RS2D of&#xD;
      chemotherapy combined with oral daily niraparib from Stage 1. Treatment will continue for 4&#xD;
      cycles.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subject must meet all of the following applicable inclusion criteria to participate in this&#xD;
        study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Able to understand and willing to provide written informed consent and HIPAA&#xD;
             authorization for release of personal health information. NOTE: HIPAA authorization&#xD;
             may be included in the informed consent or obtained separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female and age ≥ 18 years at the time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. ECOG Performance Status of 0, 1 or 2 (Stage 1), or 0-1 (Stage 2) within 14 days prior&#xD;
             to day 1 of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Histologically or cytologically confirmed hormone receptor negative tumor (estrogen&#xD;
             and progesterone) on pathology immunohistochemistry (IHC) assessment defined as &lt;10%&#xD;
             staining and HER2-negative, non-overexpressing defined by an IHC 0 or 1+ or&#xD;
             fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) HER2:CEP17 ratio &lt; 2.0 with an average HER2&#xD;
             gene copy number of &lt;4 signals/nucleus, and:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Stage 1 (metastatic):&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Measurable (by RECIST v1.1) or evaluable lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
             Stage 2 (non-metastatic, treatment naïve, with no prior excisional&#xD;
             biopsy/lumpectomy/LND staging):&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Primary tumor size ≥ 2 cm by at least one radiographic or clinical measurement.&#xD;
                  NOTE: this requirement does not apply to subjects with inflammatory TNBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Clinical stage at presentation: cT1c-cT4, cN0-cN3&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Tumor tissue:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Stage 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Willing to provide tumor tissue for research purposes. Fresh biopsy of metastatic&#xD;
             lesion prior to day 1 of treatment preferred if feasible. If fresh biopsy of&#xD;
             metastatic lesion is not feasible, fresh biopsy can be obtained from the primary tumor&#xD;
             site (i.e. breast). Tumor tissue from bone metastases is not acceptable. If fresh&#xD;
             biopsy from metastatic tumor or primary tumor site is not possible, archival tumor&#xD;
             tissue (formalin-fixed paraffin embedded [FFPE] or tumor block) may be used as long as&#xD;
             it is from within 12 months of study entry. NOTE: If tissue is not available within&#xD;
             required timeframe (i.e., either fresh or archival) subject will still be eligible for&#xD;
             trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Stage 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Willing to undergo fresh biopsy of the primary tumor prior to day 1 of treatment for&#xD;
             research purposes (breast is preferred; lymph node is acceptable). If not clinically&#xD;
             feasible, then provide archived tumor tissue (FFPE or tumor block) of the primary&#xD;
             tumor within 12 months of study entry. If archived tissue will be submitted rather&#xD;
             than fresh biopsy, the archived tissue must be assessed and documented by pathology to&#xD;
             ensure adequate tumor is present for correlative analysis. NOTE: For subjects who do&#xD;
             not have archival tumor tissue available within required timeframe or if archival&#xD;
             tissue insufficient, a pre-treatment core biopsy of the primary breast tumor must be&#xD;
             obtained. If subjects have inflammatory breast cancer and a core biopsy is not&#xD;
             possible, consideration can be given to obtain a skin punch biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in the table below; all screening labs&#xD;
             to be obtained within 14 days prior to day 1 of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC): greater than or equal to 1,000/µL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelet Count greater than or equal to 100,000/µL without platelet transfusion&#xD;
                  within 4 weeks of day 1 of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin (Hgb): greater than or equal to 9 g/dL without red blood cell&#xD;
                  transfusion within 4 weeks of day 1 of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine (SCr): less than or equal to 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. For subjects anticipated to receive anthracyclines, adequate cardiac function as&#xD;
             defined by ≥50% Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) by ECHO or MUGA within 28&#xD;
             days prior to day 1 of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 7 days prior to day 1 of treatment and documented. NOTE: Females are considered&#xD;
             of childbearing potential unless they are surgically sterile (have undergone a&#xD;
             hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy) or are&#xD;
             postmenopausal (&gt;45 years of age and at least 12 consecutive months with no menses&#xD;
             without an alternative medical cause).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. FCBP must be willing to use a highly effective contraceptive method (i.e., highly&#xD;
             effective achieves a failure rate of &lt;1% per year when used consistently and&#xD;
             correctly) or a combination method from the time of informed consent until 30 days&#xD;
             after treatment discontinuation. Contraceptive methods with low user dependency are&#xD;
             preferable but not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Acceptable methods of contraception (highly effective) are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Single method (one of the following is acceptable):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Non-hormonal Intrauterine device (IUD)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Vasectomy of a female subject's partner&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as&#xD;
                  refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk&#xD;
                  associated with the study treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Combination method (requires use of two of the following):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Diaphragm with spermicide (Cannot be used in conjunction with cervical&#xD;
                  cap/spermicide)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cervical cap with spermicide (nulliparous women only)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Contraceptive sponge with spermicide (nulliparous women only)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male condom or female condom (cannot be used together) with spermicide&#xD;
