  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many dialysis facilities have financial relationships with nephrologists, including joint&#xD;
      venture agreements, where the nephrologist owns a minority share of the dialysis facility.&#xD;
      Such agreements could present a conflict of interest with respect to patient care. This study&#xD;
      will investigate whether these joint venture agreements are associated with differences in&#xD;
      the quality of care provided by dialysis facilities.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The investigators will use the United States Renal Data System (USRDS), a registry of all&#xD;
      patients on dialysis in the US irrespective of payer. The dataset includes patient&#xD;
      characteristics (biologic and sociodemographic) within 45 days of initiating dialysis for all&#xD;
      patients with ESKD irrespective of insurance coverage, death data for all patients with ESKD&#xD;
      irrespective of insurance, dialysis facility characteristics, which are updated annually,&#xD;
      longitudinal treatment data submitted by the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) networks for all&#xD;
      patients irrespective of insurance, and CROWNWeb clinical data: monthly treatment data (e.g.,&#xD;
      Kt/V, treatment time, serum hemoglobin, vascular access) submitted by dialysis facilities for&#xD;
      all patients irrespective of insurance. The registry is linked to Fee-for-service Medicare&#xD;
      claims for all patients with this payer. All data have already been collected (i.e., this is&#xD;
      a retrospective study) and deidentified by a data distributor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have also obtained a cross-sectional dataset of dialysis facilities and&#xD;
      physician owners in 2017 from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) through a&#xD;
      Freedom of Information Act request.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will link the USRDS to this cross-sectional dataset. The&#xD;
      investigators will also link the data to publicly available data from Dialysis Facility&#xD;
      Compare (which contains quality performance of each dialysis facility, published by the&#xD;
      government on a quarterly basis) and Census data (which contains geographic sociodemographic&#xD;
      characteristics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      From this data linkage, the investigators will study differences between facilities that are&#xD;
      physician owned and those that are not physician owned. The investigators will study outcomes&#xD;
      both at the facility level and the patient level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All models will have an alpha of 5% and will have 2-sided statistical tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For facility level outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will construct a facility level dataset and compare physician-owned&#xD;
      facilities to non-physician owned facilities adjusting for facility characteristics and&#xD;
      regional (zipcode level) sociodemographic characteristics. The investigators will also test&#xD;
      the effect of incorporating patient characteristics into the model. For patient&#xD;
      characteristics, the investigators will take the average for each facility's population&#xD;
      (e.g., average age, % of patients male, etc.). The investigators will use ordinary least&#xD;
      squares for continuous outcomes and logistic regression for binary outcomes. The&#xD;
      investigators will use robust standard errors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patient level outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will construct a patient-month panel dataset and compare patients dialyzing&#xD;
      at physician-owned facilities to those dialyzing at non-physician owned facilities. The&#xD;
      investigators will adjust for patient, facility, and zipcode level sociodemographic&#xD;
      characteristics. Since all outcomes are binary, the investigators will use logistic&#xD;
      regression for all models. The investigators' primary analysis will be logistic regression,&#xD;
      adjusting for patient, facility, zipcode characteristics, with patient-level fixed effects&#xD;
      and non-parametric bootstrap standard errors. In order, The investigators will explore the&#xD;
      sensitivity of results to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  logistic regression with all adjusters, patient-level fixed effects, and robust standard&#xD;
           errors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ordinary least squares with all adjusters, patient-level fixed effects, cluster-robust&#xD;
           standard errors at the facility level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ordinary least squares with all adjusters, patient-level fixed effects, robust standard&#xD;
           errors&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also pre-specify the adjusters below:&#xD;
