      ACHT - Adipositas Care and Health Therapy - is a structured, digitally-supported,&#xD;
      cross-sectoral and close to home program developed for the postoperative care of patients&#xD;
      following obesity surgery. The aim is to ensure the long-term success of therapy following&#xD;
      bariatric surgery. ACHT was selected by the Federal Joint Commission for support under the&#xD;
      Innovation Fund. The project started in July 2019 and will end in December 2022.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Germany, every second adult is overweight and almost one in four is obese - the trend is&#xD;
      rising. Obesity is a chronic illness which significantly increases the risk of developing&#xD;
      co-morbidities such as cardiovascular and joint diseases, cancer and diabetes. In addition to&#xD;
      those functional and health limitations, many people are stigmatised which can lead to social&#xD;
      exclusion and a reduced quality of life. Available conservative therapies do not always lead&#xD;
      to sufficient, long-term weight loss. In those cases and if the disease is very pronounced,&#xD;
      an obesity surgery (bariatric-metabolic surgery) can help. In order to ensure its success,&#xD;
      patients require long-term after care following surgery. Currently, there are no necessary&#xD;
      outpatient care standards and provisions. Inpatient obesity centres try to compensate for&#xD;
      this with their own structures and limited resources, but are already reaching their limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the ACHT project is to ensure long-term therapeutic success after an operation.&#xD;
      This is done through a digitally supported, structured, cross-sectoral and close-to-home&#xD;
      aftercare program. Obesity case managers (obesity guides) coordinate the aftercare process&#xD;
      and monitor the therapy goals. A digital case file links patients, case managers, resident&#xD;
      doctors and obesity centers. Individual exercise goals, nutritional advice and psychological&#xD;
      support are part of ACHT. ACHT is connected to quality assurance measures of a medical&#xD;
      society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four groups are compared in the ACHT study. One group begins their 18 months ACHT aftercare&#xD;
      program directly after the operation, another group 18 months after the operation. These two&#xD;
      groups are compared to patients who receive standard care. Through these two intervention&#xD;
      groups, we hope to examine the long-term effects of the program within the given time&#xD;
      constraints of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACHT is funded for three and a half years by the Federal Joint Committee as part of the&#xD;
      Innovation Fund with approx. 4.5 million euros.&#xD;

    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Primary endpoint will be the difference in the modified King's Score between intervention group I and control group I resp. intervention group II and control group II. The modified King's Score is a multifaceted sum score taking into account categories A to L (airways, BMI, cardiovascular, diabetes mellitus, economic, functional, gonadal/sexuality, health status, body image, junction (gastroesophageal), kidney, liver). For each category patients receive between 0 and 3 points describing the degree of impairment (0 Points: normal; 3 Points: severe impairment); the minimum score can be 0, maximum sum score can thus be 36.</description>

    <description>Patients in this group will begin the ACHT program immediately after their bariatric metabolic operation. 3 weeks post surgery, they will attend the initial examination and meet their case manager. The obesity guide will then set up an electronic case file for the patient and introduce the patient to the obesity app. Through the next 18 months the obesity guide will monitor the patient's therapeutic success and adherence to the therapeutic goals. In month 2 patients visit a sports physician who assesses their mobility and physical capacity to compile a personal training plan, which will be uploaded onto the patient's case file and thus be available to the patient via the app. In months 3,6,9.12 and 18, patients will attend their aftercare appointments at specially trained ACHT physicians, where they will be physically examined by a physician and receive tailored dietary advice from a nutritional advisor. In month 18 patients revisit the surgical centre for the follow-up examination</description>

    <description>Patients in this group first visit the study center 18 months after their bariatric surgery for the initial examination and start the program in month 19 post-op. At the center, they will meet their obesity guide who will set up an electronic case file for the patient and introduce the patient to the obesity app. Throughout the next 18 months, the obesity guide will monitor the patient's therapeutic success and adherence to the therapeutic goals. In month 19 post-surgery, patients visit a sports physician who assesses their mobility and devises a personal training plan. This plan will be uploaded onto the patient's case file and made available to the patient via the app. In months 19,21,24, 30 and 36, patients attend their aftercare appointments at specially trained ACHT physicians, where they will be physically examined and receive tailored dietary advice. In month 36, patients will be reexamined at the study center.</description>
