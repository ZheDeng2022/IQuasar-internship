  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A serious complication to colorectal surgery is anastomotic leakage (AL). AL increases&#xD;
      post-operative mortality, decreases long-term survival, reduces the functional result and&#xD;
      reduces qual-ity of life. Studies suggest that performing an indocyanine-green enhanced&#xD;
      fluorescent angi-ography (ICGeFA), blood perfusion in the bowel can be visualised. It is&#xD;
      suggested that using this procedure the relative risk of AL is reduced about 54-67%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this project we wish to evaluate the feasibility of the procedure, and, if proven&#xD;
      feasible, to plan further studies evaluating the procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancer-diagnosis in Denmark. In 2014, 5186&#xD;
      pa-tients with colorectal cancer were registered. 1674 patients had cancer in the rectum and&#xD;
      1316 in the sigmoid colon. 668 patients underwent surgery with low anterior resection (LAR)&#xD;
      and primary anastomosis, and 850 patients had a sigmoid resection with primary anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A serious complication is anastomotic leakage (AL). In 2014 a total of 67 (10%) patients were&#xD;
      registered with AL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general AL increases the post-operative mortality, decreases long-term survival and&#xD;
      reduces the functional result and thereby reduces quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the possible severity of AL all measures possible should be taken to ensure an early&#xD;
      diag-nosis and timely treatment, as this has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      The symp-toms of AL are uncharacteristic; the diagnosis cannot only rely on the development&#xD;
      of clinical symptoms. However, specific clinical scoring symptoms, measuring C-reactive&#xD;
      protein (CRP) and radiologic examinations are proven useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of AL varies with the degree of leakage, from conservative treatment with rectal&#xD;
      lavage, endo-VAC therapy, drainage of abscesses, re-laparoscopy or laparotomy with a&#xD;
      diverting stoma, and finally to break down the anastomosis and creating a temporary or&#xD;
      permanent colostomy, all procedures with or without antibiotic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is essential that surgeons continuously strive to improve the operative technique with&#xD;
      regard to anastomosis construction. Many factors influence the anastomotic healing:&#xD;
      instrumentation error, tension on the anastomosis, bacterial contamination, etc. An important&#xD;
      factor to ensure most opti-mal conditions in anastomotic healing is to ensure sufficient&#xD;
      blood-supply/oxygen tension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgeon evaluate so-called surrogates of bowel perfusion (evaluation of colour,&#xD;
      mesenteric pulsation and arterial bleeding) prior to form the anastomosis, but studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that surgeon's intraoperative judgment in predicting of anastomotic leakage AL&#xD;
      has an extremely low sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies suggest that performing an indocyanine-green enhanced fluorescent angiography&#xD;
      (ICGeFA), the blood perfusion in the bowel can be visualised. It is suggested that by&#xD;
      evaluating perfusion of bowel ends, and, if needed, doing a re-resection, the risk of&#xD;
      anastomotic leakage can be diminished. It is suggested that evaluating the anastomosis with&#xD;
      ICG-FA and revising the anas-tomosis if necessary, the relative risk reduction of AL is about&#xD;
      54-67%. Several studies in robotic and laparoscopic colorectal surgery, confirms feasibility&#xD;
      of using ICGeFA, also showing promising results in evaluating the bowel perfusion. Most&#xD;
      studies and a newly published systematic review conclude that there is great need for larger&#xD;
      controlled studies or randomised trails.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective with this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using ICGeFA in&#xD;
      colorectal surgery and to evaluate if the surgeon's interpretation is dose and time&#xD;
      dependent. Secondary ob-jective is to establish a nationwide research team, joining all the&#xD;
      Robotic Surgery Centres in Den-mark for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Last we wish to identify the optimal design for a further study, evaluating whether ICG is a&#xD;
      helpful tool in diminishing the risk of anastomotic leakage.&#xD;
