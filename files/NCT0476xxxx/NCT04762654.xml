      Background: The faces version of the Modified Child Dental Anxiety Scale (MCDASf) is less&#xD;
      time consuming and an easy to understand tool for measuring dental anxiety. The aim of this&#xD;
      study was to develop the Turkish version of MCDASf and to analyze its validity and&#xD;
      reliability.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The internal consistency reliability was determined by calculating Cronbach's alpha (n=300).&#xD;
      Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated for test-retest reliability&#xD;
      (n=67). Construct validity was determined by comparing with the Venham Picture Test (VPT).&#xD;
      The factor structure was examined using exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Confirmatory&#xD;
      factor analysis (CFA) was used for the dimensionality. The cut-off points of the Turkish&#xD;
      version of MCDASf were plotted using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.&#xD;

    <measure>The Turkish version of MCDASf is a reliable scale that meets psychometric properties.</measure>
    <time_frame>for six months from the beginning of the study</time_frame>
    <description>The reliability of the Turkish version of MCDASf was assessed using the Cronbach alpha coefficient and Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Cronbach alpha coefficient scores vary from 0 to 1. Values higher than 0.70 are considered acceptable, and values higher than 0.80 are considered good internal consistency reliability. ICC values lower than 0.40 indicate poor agreement, 0.41-0.60 moderate agreement, 0.61-0.80 good agreement, and values higher than 0.80 show excellent agreement.</description>

    <description>The validity of the Turkish version of MCDASf was assessed using The Venham Picture Test (VPT). The VPT includes eight cards that have two figures; one shows an anxious child, the other is not anxious. All cards are shown in order. For the selection of anxious and non-anxious figures, 1 and 0 points are recorded, respectively. The total scores can range from 1 to 8.</description>

    <description>The MCDASf is self-reported dental anxiety measure effective among children aged 5-12 years.11 The scale has eight questions about 'going to the dentist generally,' 'having teeth examined,' 'teeth being scraped and polished,' 'injections in the gum,' 'fillings,' 'having a tooth taken out,' 'being put to sleep for treatment,' and 'having a mixture of gas and air that will help you feel comfortable for treatment but will not make you sleep.' The scores of each question ranged from 1 'relaxed' to 5 'very worried.' The scores are also represented by cartoon faces varied according to emotions and anxiety levels. The total scores can range from 8 to 40.</description>
