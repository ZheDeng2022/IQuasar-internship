  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and feasibility of&#xD;
      outpatient-utilization of low-dose dasiglucagon administered via a multi-dose reusable pen&#xD;
      injector in preventing and treating mild hypoglycemia in insulin pump-treated people with&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, open-label, two-arm, two-week crossover study will be conducted to assess the&#xD;
      study objectives. The study will enroll 24 participants with insulin pump-treated type 1&#xD;
      diabetes. Upon study enrollment, participants will complete two consecutive 2-week periods -&#xD;
      a 'usual care' period and 'dasiglucagon' period. During the 'usual care' period, participants&#xD;
      will manage episodes of manifest or impending hypoglycemia as usual, e.g. through&#xD;
      carbohydrate consumption or manual insulin pump suspension. During the 'dasiglucagon' period,&#xD;
      participants will use pen-administered low-dose dasiglucagon to treat or prevent episodes of&#xD;
      hypoglycemia.&#xD;
