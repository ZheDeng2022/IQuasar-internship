    <textblock>
      Aging process and the chronic diseases that affect older adults lead to balance disorders,&#xD;
      which makes these individuals more susceptible to falls. However, currently there is no&#xD;
      evidence available to support effects of Yang Style Tai Chi exercises combined with mental&#xD;
      imagery training on balance and fall prevention in older adults. Because separately Tai Chi&#xD;
      training techniques having good effects according to evidence .So in this study we will be&#xD;
      find out the effects of Tai chi with mental imagery training for the selection of most&#xD;
      appropriate treatment method.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fall is defined as any unintentional positional change that results in a person coming to&#xD;
      rest on the ground, floor, or other lower surface. The risk of fall increase dramatically&#xD;
      with age. In older adults unintentionally injuries are the fifth leading cause of death, and&#xD;
      falls constitute two thirds of these days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Falls are most serious common condition present in older adults. Falls and balanced problem&#xD;
      are more common in elder population, causing injuries, social isolation, and psychological&#xD;
      difficulties. Proper balance is imperative for the performance of functional activities. Any&#xD;
      deficiency or impairment in balance increases the risk of fall thus making it difficult to&#xD;
      perform functional activities. Balance is defined as exertion of postural control that&#xD;
      provides a stable base of support while remaining stationary or during movement. Decrease in&#xD;
      balance ability resulting from aging triggers motor and gait disabilities in elderly people,&#xD;
      which greatly affects their mobility in day-to-day life. They are the serious cause of&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity which leads to immobility and premature nursing care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As life expectancy increases, the problem of falls among the elderly will become more&#xD;
      pertinent. Falls occurred in more than one third of the elderly aged 65 years and older&#xD;
      annually. The incidence of falls rises steadily from Middle age and peaks in persons older&#xD;
      than 80 years. The frequency of falls increases with age and frailty level. Older people who&#xD;
      are living in nursing homes fall more often than those who are living in the community.&#xD;
      Approximately 30-50% of people living in long term care institutions fall each year, and 40%&#xD;
      of them experienced recurrent fall. Approximately 25% to 35% of people over age 65 years&#xD;
      experiences more falls every year. Older people have stiffer, less coordinated and more&#xD;
      dangerous gaits than younger people. Risk factors for falls among elderly people include&#xD;
      environmental hazards and housing characteristic. There are several factors that may&#xD;
      influence the fall risk in the elderly to a great extent. Environmental hazards are the&#xD;
      leading cause of falls, accounting for about 25 to 45 percent in most studies. Major risk&#xD;
      factor of fall among elderly population weakness, mobility impairment, balance and gait&#xD;
      disturbance, Dizziness, vertigo, drop attacks, postural hypotension, visual impairment, and&#xD;
      syncope are known to cause falls. Attention to these factors significantly reduce the risk of&#xD;
      fall. Lower extremity muscle weakness is a significant risk factor for falls, increasing the&#xD;
      odds of falling fourfold. A history of fall and gait or balance deficits increases the risk&#xD;
      threefold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other high-risk situations that can cause or contribute to falls are use of an assistive&#xD;
      device, visual deficit, arthritis, and impaired activities of daily living, depression,&#xD;
      cognitive impairment, and age older than 80 years. Use of four or more medications has been&#xD;
      strongly associated with an increased risk of falls. In particular, use of psychotropic&#xD;
      medications, cardiac drugs including class 1A antiarrhythmic agents, digoxin, diuretics, and&#xD;
      anticonvulsants have been Implicated in increasing the risk of falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is paucity in the literature regarding evidence for the effectiveness of Tai chi&#xD;
      exercises in older adults Lin YC et al 2019 found that in both cross sectional and&#xD;
      longitudinal studies that Tai Chi exercises has more effectiveness in balance control,&#xD;
      psychological wellbeing ,cardiovascular fitness and postural stability than other exercises.&#xD;
      These findings shows that Tai chi exercises has more beneficial and health effective to&#xD;
      maintain the good, physical, psychological conditions in older adults.In previous studies&#xD;
      have shown beneficial effects of Tai Chi on cardiorespiratory system ,flexibility, Muscle&#xD;
      strength, and body fat composition in middle aged and elderly individuals. Likewise, Hong and&#xD;
      colleagues found that older adults who had been practicing Tai Chi Chuan for an average of&#xD;
      13.2 years had better balance and functional fitness compared to sedentary older adults. In&#xD;
      2015 Rahal et al in this study 76 elderly individuals who were divided into two groups: the&#xD;
      Tai Chi Chuan Group and the Dance Group. The subjects were tested using the Neuro Com Balance&#xD;
      MasterH force platform system with the following protocols: static balance testsand dynamic&#xD;
      balance tests and found that older expert Tai Chi Chuan practitioners had better bilateral&#xD;
      static balance with eyes open on firm and foam surfaces compared to dancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study was done by Cho HY, et al. with the title of Effects of motor imagery training on&#xD;
      balance and gait abilities in post-stroke patients published in 2013 and concluded that&#xD;
      Adding motor imagery training to gait training produced more significant improvements in the&#xD;
      balance and gait abilities than gait training in stroke subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another study was done by Hamel MF, et al. in 2005 and concluded that the link between&#xD;
      attentional demands, postural oscillations, static balance and the prevention of falls among&#xD;
      the elderly is of importance. The reduction of attentional demands reflects the automaticity&#xD;
      of a task. Therefore, when attentional demands are reduced, more attentional resources are&#xD;
      unbound to avoid, among other things, the environmental risk factors that can lead to falls.&#xD;
      It has been shown that mental imagery is an effective technique, not only in reducing&#xD;
      antero-posterior postural oscillations, but also in interpreting the postural control tasks&#xD;
      more automatic. Therefore, this technique may be considered effective among the elderly&#xD;
      population, in order to contribute to improving their static balance and preventing falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study was done by Page SJ, et.al with the title of a randomized efficacy and feasibility&#xD;
      study of imagery in acute stroke. Published in 2001 and concluded that Imagery technique is a&#xD;
      clinically feasible intervention and Imagery, in association with therapy, appears to be a&#xD;
      noninvasive, efficacious complement to traditional therapy&#xD;
