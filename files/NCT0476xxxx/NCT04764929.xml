      This a research study to find out whether giving Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)&#xD;
      through a Helmet is the same or better than giving CPAP through a Facemask, Nasal Mask, or&#xD;
      Nasal Prongs. CPAP can help kids with lung infections breathe easier. The machine delivers&#xD;
      pressurized air, which may help people with lung infections breathe more easily. Doctors&#xD;
      routinely use a Facemask, Nasal Mask or Nasal Prongs to give CPAP for kids with lung&#xD;
      infections, but the researchers want to know whether using Helmet CPAP is the same or better.&#xD;

      Prior clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy of Helmet CPAP in adults with acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome, superior tolerance and improved respiratory scores compared to&#xD;
      nasal/facial CPAP in infants, and no major safety concerns were identified with the use of&#xD;
      helmet CPAP. This is a prospective pilot study to (1) determine if infants and pediatric&#xD;
      patients requiring CPAP in the PICU will tolerate helmet CPAP for at least four hours, and&#xD;
      (2) measure changes in the respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, heart rate and blood pressure&#xD;
      over four hours. If helmet CPAP is found to be well tolerated in this small cohort, a larger&#xD;
      study comparing it directly to other CPAP interfaces will be conducted.&#xD;

    <description>Patients in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) already receiving CPAP through a facemask or nasal prongs or mask for at least four hours but no more than 48 hours will be transitioned to the Vyatil nonpowered oxygen tent system (Rochester, NY) by trained respiratory therapists per the manufacture's instructions: patient's neck circumference will be measured with a soft tape measure to ensure appropriate sizing. The helmet will be connected to at least 30 liters per minute of high flow medical air with an oxygen blender. The expiratory limb will be attached to the positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) valve (initially set at 5 centimeters of water pressure) connected to a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to prevent any viral particles from being released into the environment. A disposable manometer will be used to measure the pressure within the helmet. Once the flow to the helmet interface is on, the helmet will be sealed and secured with the system's arm straps.</description>
