  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nocebo effects, negative responses to inert or active treatments which are putatively induced&#xD;
      by negative outcome expectations, have been shown to play a significant role in pain&#xD;
      perception. The underlying neurobiological mechanisms of these effects remain largely&#xD;
      unexplored. The primary objective of this study is to test the role of N-methyl-D-aspartate&#xD;
      (NMDA) receptor-dependent learning in an experimental model of conditioned nocebo effects on&#xD;
      self-reported pain. Secondary objectives are to examine the role of the NMDA manipulation and&#xD;
      related neural correlates during the acquisition and extinction of nocebo effects using&#xD;
      statistical learning models. This study will utilize a placebo controlled, double-blind&#xD;
      design with respect to the pharmacological administration of 80 mg D-Cycloserine (DCS), an&#xD;
      NMDA agonist, or placebo. Validated conditioning and verbal suggestion (VS) paradigms will&#xD;
      induce nocebo effects on pain in a random sample of 50 healthy adults. The primary endpoint&#xD;
      of the study is the magnitude of the induced nocebo effect on pain measured as the difference&#xD;
      between self-reported pain, between the first conditioned and control extinction trials.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include the classification analysis of the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent&#xD;
      (BOLD) responses of participants into pharmacological groups with multivariate pattern&#xD;
      analysis. This study will be conducted at Leiden University and the Leiden University Medical&#xD;
      Center (LUMC), The Netherlands.&#xD;

      Main outcome variable:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The magnitude of induced nocebo hyperalgesia is defined as the difference in pain ratings&#xD;
      for the first nocebo trial compared to the first control trial of the extinction phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant difference here is assessed within the mixed model analysis of variance&#xD;
      (ANOVA), comparing within-subjects differences for control and nocebo trials between DCS and&#xD;
      placebo groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time frame: On the day of the experimental session, during the extinction phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The difference in BOLD response at a series of a priori ROIs between pharmacological&#xD;
           groups during the acquisition of nocebo effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The classification accuracy (into pharmacological groups), indicating that patterns of&#xD;
           activation in the network of a priori ROIs form a model that can detect differences in&#xD;
           neural activations during the acquisition of nocebo effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The difference in BOLD response at a series of a priori ROIs between pharmacological&#xD;
           groups during the extinction of nocebo effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The classification accuracy (into pharmacological groups), indicating that patterns of&#xD;
           activation in the network of a priori ROIs form a model that can detect differences in&#xD;
           neural activations during the first trials of the extinction phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The difference in BOLD response at a series of a priori ROIs between pain at baseline&#xD;
           and nocebo-augmented pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The classification accuracy, indicating that patterns of activation in the network of a&#xD;
           priori ROIs form a model that can detect commonalities and differences in neural&#xD;
           activations between the experience of pain at baseline and nocebo-augmented pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The prediction accuracy, indicating that patterns of activation in the network of a&#xD;
           priori ROIs form a model that can predict the magnitude of induced nocebo effects based&#xD;
           on patterns of activations during the acquisition of nocebo effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The moderation of the magnitude of induced nocebo effects in the first trials of the&#xD;
           extinction phase by scores on the psychological questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
           0. Manipulation checks: Pain intensity responses during the acquisition phase To assess&#xD;
           the effectiveness of the conditioning paradigm, pain ratings during acquisition will be&#xD;
           analysed using a 2x1 mixed model ANOVA with group as a between-subjects factor (DCS,&#xD;
           placebo), and pain intensity scores as a within-subjects, repeated measure with two&#xD;
           levels (conditioned and unconditioned trials).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect of DCS on learning The Wechsler Memory Scale-Fourth Edition (WMS-IV) subtest Verbal&#xD;
      Paired Associates will be used to assess whether DCS enhanced learning. A 2x1 mixed model&#xD;
      ANOVA with group as the between-subjects factor and WMS-IV scores as the within-subjects&#xD;
      repeated measure with two measurements, before administering DCS or placebo versus at two&#xD;
      hours post-administration, before the beginning of the conditioning paradigm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The magnitude of the induced nocebo effect on pain is hypothesized to be larger in the&#xD;
           DCS group relative to the placebo group. The magnitude of the nocebo effect is measured&#xD;
           as the difference between self-reported pain on a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) between the&#xD;
           first conditioned and control extinction phase trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1. The magnitude of the conditioned nocebo effects still present after extinction is&#xD;
           measured as the change from the average nocebo effect reported in the first trials of&#xD;
           the extinction phase (after acquisition) and the average nocebo effect reported in last&#xD;
           trials of the extinction phase (after extinction).&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2. DCS and placebo groups will be characterized by divergent neural activity across a&#xD;
           set of a priori regions of interest (ROIs) during acquisition. ROI analysis of&#xD;
           differences in BOLD responses will be performed on periaqueductal grey, (PAG),&#xD;
           ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, (vlPFC), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC),&#xD;
           amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (aCC), hippocampus, rostral ventromedial medulla&#xD;
           (RVM), thalamus, insula.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3 Multivariate pattern analysis (i.e., machine learning methods) will be used to&#xD;
           investigate differences in BOLD responses during the acquisition of nocebo effects and&#xD;
           thereby classify participants into pharmacological treatment groups (1) DCS, or 2)&#xD;
           placebo) based on neural activity in the following ROIs: PAG, vlPFC, dlPFC, aCC, RVM,&#xD;
           amygdala, thalamus, insula.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.4. DCS and placebo groups will be characterized by divergent BOLD responses across a&#xD;
           set of a priori ROIs during extinction. ROI analysis for differences in BOLD responses&#xD;
           between DCS and placebo groups will be performed on the following ROIs: PAG, vlPFC,&#xD;
           dlPFC, aCC, RVM, amygdala, thalamus, insula.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.5 Multivariate pattern analysis will be used to investigate differences in BOLD&#xD;
           responses during the extinction of nocebo effects and thereby classify participants into&#xD;
           pharmacological treatment groups (1) DCS, or 2) placebo) based on neural activity in the&#xD;
           following ROIs: PAG, vlPFC, dlPFC, aCC, RVM, amygdala, thalamus, insula.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.6. Pain and baseline, and nocebo augmented pain of a similar intensity will be&#xD;
           characterized by divergent neural activations. Within the placebo group, ROI analysis&#xD;
           for differences in BOLD responses between nocebo experiences and sensory experiences of&#xD;
           pain based on BOLD responses in the following ROIs: PAG, vlPFC, dlPFC, aCC, RVM,&#xD;
           amygdala, thalamus, insula.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.7. Pain and baseline, and nocebo augmented pain of a similar intensity will be&#xD;
           characterized by divergent neural activations. Within the placebo group, multivariate&#xD;
           pattern analysis will be used to investigate the differences in BOLD responses between&#xD;
           nocebo experiences and sensory experiences of pain based on neural activity in the&#xD;
           following ROIs: PAG, vlPFC, dlPFC, aCC, RVM, amygdala, thalamus, insula.&#xD;
&#xD;
           . 2.8. Patterns of BOLD responses measured during the acquisition of nocebo effects in&#xD;
           all pharmacological groups (1) DCS, or 2) placebo) at the previously listed ROIs, will&#xD;
           predict the magnitude of nocebo effects on pain during extinction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Questionnaires To assess the influence of psychological traits, questionnaires will also&#xD;
           be included. These will include the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PSC), Spielberger State&#xD;
           Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the Body Vigilance Scale (BVS).&#xD;
