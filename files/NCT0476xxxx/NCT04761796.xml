  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep is a physiological function that plays an essential role in many somatic, cognitive or&#xD;
      psychological processes. Although the criteria for sleep effectiveness are multiple, its&#xD;
      quantity is unanimously recognized as a major determinant of health. Too little sleep time is&#xD;
      indeed associated with an increase in metabolic, cardiovascular and accidental morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality, caused by sleepiness during journeys or at the workplace. In the wake of recent&#xD;
      work in the general French population, a specific study on the prevalence and factors&#xD;
      associated with sleeping time and chronic insomnia among flight members appears relevant.&#xD;
      Chronic insomnia and sleep debt can thus be assumed to be more common among aircrews than in&#xD;
      the general population, due to these specific operational constraints. Better consideration&#xD;
      of certain sleep disorders in professional flight members could make it possible to adapt&#xD;
      prevention or countermeasures strategies intended to optimize risk management with regard to&#xD;
      flight safety.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Today, time dedicated to sleep is in competition with working time, transport time or time&#xD;
      spent on new technologies, in a professional or recreational setting. Faced with the public&#xD;
      health issue thus raised, studies have highlighted the interest of studying the relationships&#xD;
      between sleep time and socio-demographic factors, beyond the mere implication of sleep&#xD;
      pathologies. However, among these pathologies, the place of insomnia is not negligible: it is&#xD;
      indeed the most frequent sleep disorder (16% of French people in 2010) and represents an&#xD;
      important source of involuntary reduction in sleep time, likely to increase inappropriate&#xD;
      sleepiness during periods of wakefulness, in the context of activities sometimes involving&#xD;
      safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flight crews are exposed to specific operational constraints, both in civilian and military&#xD;
      environments, likely to compromise the recovery function of sleep (operational fatigue,&#xD;
      extended working ranges, repetitions of time differences, etc.). These constraints, conducive&#xD;
      to compromising the levels of vigilance and cognitive performance required, are also at risk&#xD;
      of cardio-metabolic complications. They therefore raise the issue of controlling risks and&#xD;
      maintaining aviation safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The issue of pilot fatigue remains an essential issue for the safety of flight operations. In&#xD;
      the context of air transport, several determinants of operational fatigue have been&#xD;
      identified, such as irregular sleep schedules, large, irregular and sometimes unpredictable&#xD;
      activity ranges, sleep debts, night flights and circadian disturbances in connection with&#xD;
      multiple and repeated changes of time zones. If these factors must deal within airlines with&#xD;
      rules more often based on alternating &quot;work / rest&quot; than &quot;sleep / wakefulness&quot;, the laws and&#xD;
      regulations in force, within the aeronautical industry, are now oriented towards scientific&#xD;
      approaches to the management of fatigue in commercial aviation, by emphasizing the importance&#xD;
      of sleep and taking into account circadian rhythms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the vast majority of studies devoted to the sleep of aviation flight personnel are&#xD;
      therefore limited to the cases of commercial aviation airline pilots. They have established&#xD;
      that most flights, especially over long-haul sectors, involve disturbances of the circadian&#xD;
      rhythm, fractionation and restriction of sleep that are harmful to cognitive performance and&#xD;
      the risk of accidents. Most publications have looked for associations between sleep measures&#xD;
      and performance in an operational context. Some have been able to demonstrate that the&#xD;
      classic methods of evaluating sleep in flight (by actimetric readings, sleep diaries or&#xD;
      subjective evaluation of self-questionnaires) were correlated with reference data obtained by&#xD;
      polysomnography, strongly for the duration of sleep but moderately to weakly for its&#xD;
      effectiveness. In the specific case of sleep duration, self-report questionnaires have proven&#xD;
      to be a reliable alternative to in-flight actimetric measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of studies have been designed considering pilot sleep as a determinant of&#xD;
      in-flight performance, especially during long (12 to 16 hours) and very long (over 16 hours)&#xD;
      flights. On the other hand, taking into account the consequences of aeronautical activity on&#xD;
      the sleep of pilots is relatively rare in the scientific literature. Thus, most &quot;ecological&quot;&#xD;
      studies, known as field studies, generally focus on specific flights with limited time slots&#xD;
      and small sample sizes, limiting the scope of the results regarding the effects of flights on&#xD;
      sleep. Currently, the main topic of interest is still the sleep of pilots immediately before,&#xD;
      during and after duty periods, but without characterizing their baseline sleep, observed&#xD;
      during periods of rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From this perspective, a study looked at the basic sleep of airline pilots, making&#xD;
      comparisons to samples of the general North American population. On a total number of 332&#xD;
      long-haul pilots, the actimetric data revealed longer sleep times during rest periods,&#xD;
      highlighting the influence of environmental stresses deemed to be risky to health. In&#xD;
      addition, the influence of socio-demographic and professional parameters was reported in a&#xD;
      study of 435 pilots. The high prevalence of sleep disorders, drowsiness and fatigue have been&#xD;
      documented, as well as an increased risk of fatigue for flight crews on short and medium-haul&#xD;
      flights, in connection with the working hours and repetition of rotations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study project therefore fits into this global context, in the light of 3 innovative&#xD;
      perspectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Target a rich and varied professional panel of aeronautical specialties (not limited to&#xD;
           airline pilots only), integrating civil and military status, engaged in distinct&#xD;
           operational frameworks but where risk control and aviation safety prevail;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recruit a large sample, without current equivalent to our knowledge in the scientific&#xD;
           literature;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Benefit from equivalent and recent data from a study carried out on a very large&#xD;
           representative sample of the general French population&#xD;
