  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have histologically confirmed metastatic or unresectable (not amenable to&#xD;
      curative therapy) breast cancer may be screened for eligibility. All patients must have HER2&#xD;
      negative breast cancer with the identified PIK3CA mutation and received at least one line of&#xD;
      endocrine therapy. The study will consist of a screening phase, a treatment phase, and a&#xD;
      post-treatment phase which includes safety, efficacy, and follow-up. The treatment phase will&#xD;
      include taking alpelisib daily in combination with continued use of either Fulvestrant or&#xD;
      Aromatase Inhibitor per standard of care until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Eligibility Criteria Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health&#xD;
             information. NOTE: HIPAA authorization may be included in the informed consent or&#xD;

          -  Age ≥ 18 years at the time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG Performance Status of 0-2 within 28 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and postmenopausal female patients. Premenopausal patients (age 18 or older) who&#xD;
             have been rendered postmenopausal will also be included. Postmenopausal is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Age &gt;= 55 years and one year or more of amenorrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Age &lt; 55 years and one year or more of amenorrhea, with estradiol &lt; 20 pg/ml&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Age &lt; 55 years with prior hysterectomy but intact ovaries, with estradiol &lt; 20&#xD;
                  pg/ml&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prior bilateral oophorectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Women who do not fit the criteria for being postmenopausal as above are deemed&#xD;
        premenopausal. Premenopausal patients (age 18 or older) who can be rendered postmenopausal&#xD;
        will also be eligible. Methods eligible for rending premenopausal patients postmenopausal&#xD;
        include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing treatment with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist, with&#xD;
             treatment starting at least 4 weeks prior to randomization and with estradiol &lt; 20&#xD;
             pg/ml. LHRH agonist must be administered within 7 days of scheduled administration&#xD;
             date during the length of the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed metastatic or unresectable (not amenable to curative therapy)&#xD;
             breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has confirmed hormone receptor positivity with ER &gt;=1% and/or PR &gt;=1%. Preferred&#xD;
             receptor testing is obtained from a metastatic site, but can be from the primary&#xD;
             breast or axilla biopsy as long as this is most recent biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has confirmed HER2 negative breast cancer. HER2 negative or non-amplified is&#xD;
             determined by the current ASCO-CAP criteria which are as follows: HER2 testing by IHC&#xD;
             as 0 or 1+. Or negative by in situ hybridization (FISH/CISH/SISH) defined as&#xD;
             Her2/CEP17 ratio &lt;2 and for single probe assessment a HER2 copy number &lt;6). Preferred&#xD;
             receptor testing is obtained from a metastatic site, but can be from the primary&#xD;
             breast or axilla biopsy as long as this is most recent biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PIK3CA mutation identified via local testing from tumor tissue or blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has either measurable disease, i.e. at least one measurable lesion as per RECIST 1.1&#xD;
             criteria OR if no measurable disease is present, then at least one predominantly lytic&#xD;
             bone lesion must be present, within 28 days prior to registration. Patients with no&#xD;
             measurable disease and only one predominantly lytic bone lesion that has been&#xD;
             previously irradiated are eligible if there is documented evidence of disease&#xD;
             progression of the bone lesion after irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received at least one line of therapy with an endocrine therapy or endocrine&#xD;
             therapy combination with other agents in the metastatic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have received endocrine therapy (aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant as single&#xD;
             agent or in combination with other agents) as last line of therapy with progressive&#xD;
             disease, as determined by treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No more than two prior lines of endocrine therapy or endocrine therapy combinations in&#xD;
             the metastatic setting. Transition from one nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor to a&#xD;
             second nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor due to tolerance will only count as one line&#xD;
             of endocrine therapy. Combination therapy will be considered one line even if one of&#xD;
             the agents is discontinued and the other continued.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have received treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor for breast cancer in the&#xD;
             metastatic setting. CDK4/6 inhibitor discontinuation due to intolerance or reasons&#xD;
             other than progression is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in the protocol; all screening labs to&#xD;
             be obtained within 28 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men who are not surgically or medically sterile must agree to use an acceptable method&#xD;
             of contraception. Acceptable forms of contraception include castration, vasectomy, and&#xD;
             condom/occlusive cap with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository. Male patients&#xD;
             with female sexual partners who are pregnant, possibly pregnant, or who could become&#xD;
             pregnant during the study must agree to use condoms at least one month after the last&#xD;
             dose of study drug. Total abstinence for the same study period is an acceptable&#xD;
             alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Premenopausal females must agree to use an acceptable method of contraception or to&#xD;
             abstain from sexual intercourse for the duration of their participation in the study&#xD;
             and for 3 months after discontinuation of therapy. Adequate forms of contraception&#xD;
             include: total abstinence, surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (defined as&#xD;
             hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal ligation), non-hormonal IUD,&#xD;
             or condom/occlusive cap with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository).&#xD;
&#xD;
