    <textblock>
      ARB-PMCF is a multicenter, observational study of the safety and performance of Abbott&#xD;
      annuloplasty devices used in surgical repair of mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation. The&#xD;
      devices included in this study are the SJM™ Rigid Saddle Ring and SJM Séguin Annuloplasty&#xD;
      Ring, indicated for mitral valve repair, and the SJM Tailor™ Annuloplasty Ring and SJM Tailor&#xD;
      Annuloplasty Band, indicated for mitral or tricuspid repair. Participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      prior to undergoing mitral or tricuspid valve repair surgery including an Abbott annuloplasty&#xD;
      implant and will complete annual follow-up visits through five years from implant. The study&#xD;
      is being conducted to meet post-market clinical follow-up requirements of the European Union&#xD;
      Medical Device Directives.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ARB-PMCF Study has a prospective, multicenter, observational, parallel group design in&#xD;
      which up to 550 subjects will be followed through five years from implant of an Abbott&#xD;
      annuloplasty device, with or without concomitant procedures, in five treatment groups,&#xD;
      including primary mitral disease repair (N=200) with the Rigid Saddle Ring, Séguin Ring or&#xD;
      full Tailor Ring without cut zone removal; secondary mitral disease repair (N=200) with the&#xD;
      Rigid Saddle Ring, Séguin Ring or full Tailor Ring; primary tricuspid disease repair with the&#xD;
      full Tailor Ring (N=50); secondary tricuspid disease repair with the full Tailor Ring (N=50);&#xD;
      and primary tricuspid disease repair with the Tailor Band or partial Tailor Ring with cut&#xD;
      zone removed (N=50). Study enrollment will occur at up to 25 global centers with&#xD;
      approximately half or more of all implanted subjects being from European sites. The study&#xD;
      will enroll adult subjects expected to be implanted with an Abbott annuloplasty device within&#xD;
      90 days who meet all other eligibility requirements. Participants will complete annual&#xD;
      in-clinic or telephone follow-up visits through five years from their annuloplasty implant.&#xD;
      Data collected will include adverse events, cardiac medication usage, New York Heart&#xD;
      Association functional classification (a measure of the severity of heart failure symptoms)&#xD;
      and echocardiographic assessments of regurgitation through the repaired valve.&#xD;

    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants in each study treatment group (Groups 1 through 5) who are free of death from any cause through 5 years after their Abbott annuloplasty device implant, estimated from time-to-event data using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. This outcome will be reported for each treatment group separately.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants in Each Mitral Treatment Group with Freedom from Reoperation or Transcatheter Reintervention for Mitral Regurgitation through 5 Years Post-Implant</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants in each mitral treatment group (Groups 1 and 2) who are free from reoperation or transcatheter intervention for mitral regurgitation through 5 years after their Abbott annuloplasty implant, estimated from time-to-event data using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. This outcome will be reported separately for Group 1 and Group 2.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants in Each Tricuspid Treatment Group with at least a 1-Class Reduction in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification at 1 Year Post-Implant.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be reported for each tricuspid repair group (Groups 3 through 5) separately. NYHA functional classification is a widely used indicator of the severity of heart failure symptoms with four classes:&#xD;
Class I. No limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea (shortness of breath).&#xD;
Class II. Slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea.&#xD;
Class III. Marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea.&#xD;
Class IV. Unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of heart failure at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort increases.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants in Each Treatment Group by Grade of Regurgitation in the Valve Undergoing Repair, Pre-Operatively, at Discharge, and at 1, 3 and 5 Years Post-Implant</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Operative Baseline, within 60 days post-implant, and 1, 3 and 5 years post-implant</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be reported for each treatment group separately at each timepoint. Regurgitation occurs when a heart valve does not fully seal, allowing backflow of blood through the closed valve. Mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation in this study will be graded as none/trivial, mild, moderate or severe by echocardiographic assessment. Moderate or severe regurgitation can cause symptoms of heart failure, such as fatigue, shortness of breath and exercise intolerance.</description>
