  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye disease (DED) is a keratoconjunctive disorder that &quot;is a multifactorial disease of&#xD;
      the tears and ocular surface that results in symptoms of discomfort, visual disturbance, and&#xD;
      tear film instability with potential damage to the ocular surface. The goal of this study is&#xD;
      to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple ascending doses of&#xD;
      palovarotene ophthalmic solution in healthy adult subjects.&#xD;
