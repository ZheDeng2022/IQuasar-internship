  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Local control rates of nasopharyngeal carcinoma are increasing, but 15% of patients still&#xD;
      have local recurrence within 5 years after initial treatment. Systematic treatment based on&#xD;
      chemotherapy has become the mainstream approach for recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma which&#xD;
      is intolerant to local therapy. we sought to find an efficient chemotherapy regimen with high&#xD;
      tolerance according to the characteristics of chemotherapy drugs, that is, to explore the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of platinum plus 5-fluorouracil with continuous intravenous infusion at a&#xD;
      low dose for a long term.&#xD;

      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant tumor of the nasopharyngeal epithelium with&#xD;
      high sensitivity to ionizing radiation, but failure in local control was observed in&#xD;
      approximately 15% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy is the cornerstone of the treatment of recurrent NPC. Many studies were aimed at&#xD;
      the systemic treatment of recurrent NPC, but most of them were retrospective studies or phase&#xD;
      II trials with small samples. Platinum-containing doublet chemotherapy is generally regarded&#xD;
      as the standard treatment for recurrent NPC. After a multicenter phase III randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial was published in 2016, gemcitabine plus cisplatin is recommended, however,&#xD;
      less than 60% of patients could complete the treatment in the trail. Finding a proper regimen&#xD;
      with promising efficacy results as well as high tolerance is still a big challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil (PF) is a classical regimen widely used in recurrent NPC. The&#xD;
      continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil with low dose was investigated in esophagus carcinoma,&#xD;
      rectal carcinoma and prostate carcinoma with encouraging outcome and acceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Whereas, data of platinum containing chemotherapy with low-dose continuous infused&#xD;
      5-fluorouracil in recurrent NPC was absent. In this study, we aimed to investigate the&#xD;
      antitumor activity of platinum plus low-dose long-term continuous intravenous infused&#xD;
      5-fluorouracil (PFLL).&#xD;
