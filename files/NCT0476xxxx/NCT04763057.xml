  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conservative approaches such as indirect pulp capping techniques became popular over the last&#xD;
      years for the management of deep carious lesions. In particular, indirect pulp-treatment&#xD;
      (IPT) techniques have gained remarkable attention in pediatric dentistry, mainly because&#xD;
      children require a fast and accurate treatment, besides it enables the affected primary tooth&#xD;
      to remain in the mouth until exfoliation without causing any pain or infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Indirect pulp treatment is recommended for teeth with deep caries approximating the pulp with&#xD;
      no signs and symptoms of pulp deterioration. In this treatment, the deepest layer of the&#xD;
      remaining carious dentine (affected dentin) is covered with biocompatible material followed&#xD;
      by an airtight restoration to achieve a good seal against microleakage, without the need to&#xD;
      reencounter for the removal of remaining caries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calcium hydroxide has served as a gold standard for IPT over the years. However, the&#xD;
      introduction of newer bioactive materials such as mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and&#xD;
      Biodentine helped surpass the demerits of calcium hydroxide such as internal resorption,&#xD;
      nonadherence to dentin, degradation over time, tunnel defects, and poor sealing ability.&#xD;

             primary molars.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Extension of carious lesion such that complete caries removal would risk pulp&#xD;
