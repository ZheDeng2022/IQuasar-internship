  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tumor asthenia is the most common symptom associated with cancer and its treatment. Although&#xD;
      the estimated prevalence varies between 60-90%, and it is considered the longest-lasting&#xD;
      symptom in cancer patients, having the greatest impact on quality of life parameters, it is a&#xD;
      problem that is still undervalued in general by health professionals . It has been observed&#xD;
      that individuals with this process find it difficult to normalize their daily life, either&#xD;
      due to a deterioration in their clinical condition or due to a problem in the generalization&#xD;
      of what they have learned during their hospital stay. That is why we plan to carry out a&#xD;
      clinical trial, to evaluate the effect of a controlled patient follow-up program, and thus be&#xD;
      able to address these difficulties in the most optimal way. A randomized clinical trial of&#xD;
      two parallel groups will be carried out, belonging to the oncology service of the University&#xD;
      Hospital of Salamanca. 44 participants with tumor asthenia, who are admitted at the time of&#xD;
      inclusion, will be selected through a consecutive sampling. After the baseline evaluation,&#xD;
      the participants will be randomized into two groups. The subjects of the experimental group&#xD;
      will carry out a Functional Rehabilitation Program, with a duration of one month. The main&#xD;
      variable will be the evaluation of the basic activities of daily life (Barthel scale). The&#xD;
      secondary variables will be oriented to evaluate the change in tumor asthenia, attention and&#xD;
      cognitive functions, parameters of quality of life, pain, functional capacity and body&#xD;
      composition. The results of this study could be transferred to the clinic, incorporating them&#xD;
      into care protocols for cancer patients with tumor asthenia.&#xD;

    <description>Prescription of multimodal physical exercise. A supervised and structured home program will be carried out for one month. It will be carried out daily in two short sessions of 15-20 minutes, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Each session will be structured in a warm-up, a main part and a cool-down and relaxation (14).&#xD;
Reeducation of Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Specific training will be carried out after the evaluation and before the discharge of the patients from the university healthcare complex. It is intended to identify the factors that are interfering with the performance of activities of daily living. The intervention will consist of three parts: Direct intervention on Activities of Daily Living (ADL), carried out in situ in the hospitalization and generalizable to their daily environment; teaching in Energy Saving Techniques (APR).&#xD;
Prescription of support products and adaptations of the environment.</description>
