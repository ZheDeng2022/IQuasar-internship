      Participants participated in the screening period visit, and received HER2-PET and 18 F-FDG&#xD;
      PET/CT examinations before receiving tumor treatment, after receiving 2 cycles of&#xD;
      chemotherapy, and after disease progression. Patients of first-line received docetaxel&#xD;
      combined with trastuzumab±pertuzumab regimen, and patients of second-line received T-DM1&#xD;
      monotherapy or capecitabine combined with pyrrotinib regimen.&#xD;
