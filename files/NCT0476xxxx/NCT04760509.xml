      Neural tube defects (NTD), which is the most common anomaly of the central nervous system,&#xD;
      which can be diagnosed during antenatal period, brings many problems both in the neonatal&#xD;
      period and in advanced ages. Open neural tube defects, in particular, progress with&#xD;
      sensory-motor deficits due to the risk of infection and neural tissue loss from birth, and&#xD;
      should be followed closely from the neonatal period. Newborns born with a neural tube defect&#xD;
      should be operated within the first 72 hours postnatal and the defect should be closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this hospital, newborns with NTD are monitored in our neonatal surgery intensive care unit&#xD;
      before and after surgery. Neonatal specialists, neurosurgeons and other specialists when&#xD;
      there is an additional anomaly evaluate the baby as multidisciplinary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, the short-term follow-up data of babies with NTD who have been followed up&#xD;
      in this neonatal surgery intensive care unit for the last fifteen years will be evaluated&#xD;
      retrospectively.&#xD;

      Neural tube defects (NTD), which is the most common anomaly of the central nervous system,&#xD;
      which can be diagnosed during antenatal period, brings many problems both in the neonatal&#xD;
      period and in advanced ages. Open neural tube defects, in particular, progress with&#xD;
      sensory-motor deficits due to the risk of infection and neural tissue loss from birth, and&#xD;
      should be followed closely from the neonatal period. Newborns born with a neural tube defect&#xD;
      should be operated within the first 72 hours postnatal and the defect should be closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this hospital, newborns with NTD are monitored in neonatal surgery intensive care unit&#xD;
      before and after surgery. Neonatal specialists, neurosurgeons and other specialists when&#xD;
      there is an additional anomaly evaluate the baby as multidisciplinary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, the short-term follow-up data of babies with NTD who have been followed up&#xD;
      in neonatal surgery intensive care unit for the last fifteen years will be evaluated&#xD;
      retrospectively.Information of patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of neural tube defect&#xD;
      in the neonatal intensive care unit between January 1, 2006 and January 1, 2021 will be&#xD;
      recorded in the file. In addition to demographic information such as antenatal follow-up data&#xD;
      of patients, maternal diseases, birth weights, birth weeks, delivery types, neurological&#xD;
      examinations, laboratory findings, imaging (such as graphy, tomography, ultrasonography),&#xD;
      surgery notes, additional anomalies from the hospital system retrospectively will be saved.&#xD;
      Immediately after babies with NTD are born, the defect should be protected in the delivery&#xD;
      room with a wet sterile sponge and the baby should be placed in a lateral or prone position.&#xD;
      Since the risk of meningitis is high and the destruction of the neural tissue within the&#xD;
      pouch will increase within days, the sac repair should be performed within the first 72&#xD;
      hours. Antibiotics should be initiated empirically in these patients with high risk of&#xD;
      meningitis. In the postoperative follow-up; The patient should be monitored in terms of wound&#xD;
      infection of the repaired sac, bosom leakage, fistula formation and hydrocephalus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the short-term follow-up of patients with neural tube defects in the neonatal&#xD;
      intensive care unit will be evaluated retrospectively. As a result of this data evaluation to&#xD;
      be made over the hospital information system, &quot;Hacettepe University Neonatal Intensive Care&#xD;
      Unit patient follow-up with NTD&quot; will contribute to the literature.&#xD;
