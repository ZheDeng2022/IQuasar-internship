  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A correlation study was conducted to correlate between the convergence insufficiency and&#xD;
      postural stability at three different cervical positions in patients with non-specific&#xD;
      cervical pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A correlational study was conducted on eighty (male and female) subjects aged between 30-40&#xD;
      years old, presented with chronic NSCP persisted for six months or more, with neck disability&#xD;
      index score (NDI) ≥10%, and can possess at least 45° of left and right cervical rotation&#xD;
      participated in the study. Convergence insufficiency was evaluated by the near point of&#xD;
      conversion (NPOC) rule and postural instability was examined by the Biodex balance system.&#xD;
      RESULTS: There was significant positive correlation between (NPOC) and anteroposterior&#xD;
      stability index (APSI) at the three cervical positions; neutral, 45° right torsion and 45°&#xD;
      left torsion (P&gt;0.05).&#xD;
