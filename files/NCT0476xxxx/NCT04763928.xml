Decitabine 20 mg/sqm intravenously on days 1 to 5 of 28-days courses&#xD;
Venetoclax 400 mg per day orally on days 1 to 28 of 28-days courses; a dose escalation period is provided at first cycle (ramp-up) in which VEN is administered as follows: 100 mg on day -2, 200 mg on day -1, and 400 mg on day 1, a dose that is continued subsequently, daily, for 28-day cycles.&#xD;
In case of achievement of response, the treatment will be continued until disease progression or death by other causes.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with AML secondary to myeloproliferative neoplasms (sAML), untreated, newly&#xD;
             diagnosed, according to WHO 2016 criteria based on conventional cytological,&#xD;
             cytogenetic, and immunophenotypic disease characterization&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients unfit for intensive treatment modalities at the discretion of the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. ECOG performance status 0-2 or disease-related reversible ECOG 3 score following&#xD;
             adequate supportive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Signed written informed consent according to ICH/EU/GCP and national local laws.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Males enrolled in the study with partners who are women of childbearing potential,&#xD;
             must be willing to use an acceptable barrier contraceptive method during the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of de novo AML&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pre-existing, uncontrolled pathology such as heart failure (congestive/ischaemic,&#xD;
             acute myocardial infarction within the post 3 months, untreatable arrhythmias, NYHA&#xD;
             classes III and IV), sever liver disease with total bilirubin â‰¥2,5 x ULN and/or ALT&gt;3&#xD;
             ULN (unless attributable to AML), acute or chronic pancreatitis, kidney function&#xD;
             impairment with Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) level &lt;30ml/min (calculated by Cockcroft&#xD;
             Gault formula) (unless attributable to AML) and severe neuropsychiatric disorder that&#xD;
             impairs the patient's ability to understand and sign the informed consent or to cope&#xD;
             with the intended treatment plan. For altered liver, pancreas and kidney function&#xD;
             tests, eligibility criteria can be reassessed at 24-96 hours, following adequate&#xD;
             supportive measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Pre-existing HIV positive serology (i.e. already known before enrolment). The&#xD;
             participation to the study will require serology testing for HIV positivity at&#xD;
             baseline: in case of HIV positivity or refusal to perform HIV testing, the patient&#xD;
             will be considered not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Uncontrolled bacterial or fungal infections&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. QTc &gt;470 msec on screening ECG (Fridericia's formula)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. A history of cancer that is not in remission phase following surgery and/or&#xD;
             chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy with life expectancy &lt; 6 months.&#xD;
