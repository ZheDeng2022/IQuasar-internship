  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the implementation and use of Dyadic Developmental&#xD;
      Psychotherapy (DDP) in three centra, with particular focus on its potential effects on the&#xD;
      quality of the observable caregiver-child interaction. The three centra included are Telemark&#xD;
      Hospital Trust, Department for Child- and Adolescent Psychiatric Health, Child Protective&#xD;
      Services in Skien and Porsgrunn, and the Office for Children, Youth and Family Affairs in&#xD;
      Skien. The implementation of DDP is being led by Telemark Hospital Trust, while therapists&#xD;
      from all centra are being trained in DDP as part of the implementation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primarily we aim to identify the changes associated with DDP treatment in the caregiver-child&#xD;
      interaction, as measured by the Emotional Availability Scales (EA scales). Our secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures assess changes in parental self-efficacy, parental stress, and child&#xD;
      emotional and behavioral problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research aims are divided in three research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Q1: What changes are associated with DDP treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Q1.1 the quality of the caregiver-child interaction Q1.2 parental self-efficacy Q1.3 parental&#xD;
      stress, Q1.4 child emotional and behavioral problems Based on previous literature, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that we will see an increase in the quality of the caregiver-child interaction&#xD;
      and parental self-efficacy after completing the DDP treatment, and a decrease in parental&#xD;
      stress and child emotional and behavioral problems (Becker-Weidman, A. 2006)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to assessing the effects of DDP we will evaluate the implementation of DDP in the&#xD;
      three centra, and inform the implementation by collecting information through interviews with&#xD;
      patients and clinicians. We aim to answer:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Q2: How do children and their caregivers experience DDP as a therapeutic intervention? Q3:&#xD;
      How do clinicians experience the training process and the use of DDP as a therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous literature, we hypothesize that we will see an increase in the quality of&#xD;
      the caregiver-child interaction and parental self-efficacy after completing the DDP&#xD;
      treatment, and a decrease in parental stress and child emotional and behavioral problems&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children who have been subject to physical, sexual or emotional abuse or neglect are at risk&#xD;
      of developing unhealthy relationships with their caregiver, increasing the likelihood of them&#xD;
      developing a wide range of mental health problems later in life. Norway offers few&#xD;
      therapeutic programs for treatment of children and adolescents that focus specifically on&#xD;
      treating traumatic experiences within attachment relationships. An intervention with this&#xD;
      focus is Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy (DDP),where dyad refers to the unit of a child&#xD;
      and its caregiver(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Family-Based Treatment Unit (SFB) within the Division for Child- and Adolescent Mental&#xD;
      Health (ABUP) at Telemark Hospital has started implementing DDP with funding from the &quot;BUP&#xD;
      Project&quot;, resulting in a multi-center implementation plan including local child protective&#xD;
      services and the office for children, youth and family affairs. This project seeks to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect and implementation of DDP on the quality of the caregiver-child&#xD;
      interaction, parental efficacy, parental stress and wellbeing, and child emotional and&#xD;
      behavioral problems as well as the subjective experience of this implementation among&#xD;
      caregivers and clinicians. The results of interviews with clinicians and parents will provide&#xD;
      feedback, guide the implementation, and provide essential knowledge about using DDP in a&#xD;
      Norwegian setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Child protective services (CPS) in the municipalities of Skien and Porsgrunn as well as the&#xD;
      office for children, youth and family affairs (Bufetat) will participate in providing DDP,&#xD;
      include dyads in the study and deliver the DDP intervention. Mixed method assessment will be&#xD;
      used to study the effects of the implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will contribute new knowledge of how the intervention is experienced by&#xD;
      Norwegian children and their families, both in a clinical outpatient setting at Telemark&#xD;
      Hospital and Skien and Porsgrunn Child Protective Services, and in a clinical inpatient&#xD;
      setting with the Norwegian Office for Children, Youth and Family Affairs (Bufetat).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinicians' experiences with the implementation and use of DDP is an important dimension for&#xD;
      its success. No previous studies have investigated the clinicians' experiences with working&#xD;
      with DDP, underscoring the need for this project. The project will report on what challenges&#xD;
      arose during implementation in Norway, and how both families and clinicians experienced the&#xD;
      process of learning, using and receiving DDP. By using the information gained directly into&#xD;
      the process of this project it can help guide the continued implementation and contribute to&#xD;
      its success. If DDP is shown to have a good effect there are plans for a multi-center&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will investigate the specific context through participant-observations during project&#xD;
      meetings, and analyze central documents regarding the implementation and use of DDP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through working closely with Child Protective Services and the Norwegian Office for Children,&#xD;
      Youth and Family Affairs (Bufetat) we will also be able to explore the experiences of&#xD;
      implementation of the treatment in different settings, namely outpatient in the hospital,&#xD;
      outpatient with child protective services, and inpatient in Bufetat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical review has been conducted by the Norwegian South East Regional committee for Medical&#xD;
      and Health Research (REK) as well as the Norwegian Centre for Research Data (NSD) and the&#xD;
      project has been approved. The participants will receive full information, and be asked to&#xD;
      give consent both verbally and in writing. They will be assured confidentiality and&#xD;
      anonymity. They will be informed of their right to withdraw at any time, and that it will&#xD;
      have no impact on their treatment at ABUP. We do not expect this study to cause any harm to&#xD;
      participants. The observations are part of routine examination, of short duration and are&#xD;
      conducted within the security of a familiar institution&#xD;
