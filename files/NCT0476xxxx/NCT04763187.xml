  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healing of post-extraction alveolus is a complex process that involves soft and hard tissues&#xD;
      regeneration. Pain, swelling, difficulty of opening the mouth, delayed healing of bone&#xD;
      tissue, alveolitis and horizontal or vertical resorption of bone tissue are the main problems&#xD;
      that have impact on consequent treatment. Blood concentrates PRGF (plasma rich in growth&#xD;
      factors) and PRF (platelet-rich fibrin), which are rich in growth factors, create better&#xD;
      conditions for post-extraction alveolus healing and enhance quality of soft tissues and bone&#xD;
      regeneration. Our study objective was to compare physiological healing of post-extraction&#xD;
      zone, PRF and PRGF induced changes of healing process. Methods that we used: 43 patients were&#xD;
      randomly divided into 3 groups: I control group - lower molar extraction and filling of&#xD;
      post-extraction alveolus with hemostatic sponge containing gentamicin, II group -&#xD;
      post-extraction alveolus is filled PRGF and III group - post-extraction alveolus is filled&#xD;
      with PRF. Bone regeneration was evaluated in CBCT scans after 1 month. Pain was evaluated&#xD;
      using visual analogical scale (VAS).&#xD;

      This was a prospective, single-centre, with unequal randomisation ratio [1,9:1:1], parallel,&#xD;
      multiple-group (control and two experimental groups) study. Randomized clinical trial was&#xD;
      conducted between September 2019 and December 2019 at department of Maxillofacial Surgery&#xD;
      Clinic of Kaunas Clinics. Permission of Bioethics Center was acquired for this study.&#xD;
      Participants of this study were patients who needed extraction of lower molars due to K04.5&#xD;
      (chronic apical periodontitis) and K01.0 (embedded teeth) diagnoses, based on ICD-10-CM&#xD;
      classification. In this study participated 43 patients: 33 (76,7%) women and 10 (23,3%) men,&#xD;
      average age - 28,6 years, the youngest was 18 years old and the oldest was 48 years old. All&#xD;
      patients were introduced to the study protocol and gave informed consent. Confidentiality of&#xD;
      subjects is assured because only summarized results will be published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomised into 3 groups: I control group - lower molar extraction and filling&#xD;
      of post-extraction alveolus with hemostatic sponge containing gentamicin, II group -&#xD;
      post-extraction alveolus is filled PRGF and III group - post-extraction alveolus is filled&#xD;
      with PRF. Randomization sequence was created using Excel 2019 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA)&#xD;
      with a 1,9:1:1 allocation using random block sizes of 2 and 4. Surgery was performed by the&#xD;
      same surgeon. After procedures of tooth extraction and PRGF or PRF application, zone of&#xD;
      surgery was closed up using resorbable thread (Ethicon Coated Vicryl Plus 4-0) and applying&#xD;
      the method of cross mattress suture. During procedure control group was administred with&#xD;
      local antibiotics (gentamicin) to avoid infection possibility. Non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory medication was administered one hour after procedure and before sleep.&#xD;
      Threads were removed after 7 days. Pain felt on 1st and on 7th day after procedure was&#xD;
      evaluated using visual analogical scale (hereinafter - VAS) during the same appointment.&#xD;
      Pacients selected number from 0 to 10, there accordingly 0 - no pain, 5 - moderate pain and&#xD;
      10 - worst pain. [22] Cone beam computed tomography (hereinafter - CBCT) (E-WOO, Picasso&#xD;
      Trio, Republic of Korea) was carried out immediately after procedure and 1 month after&#xD;
      procedure for evaluation of bone tissue regeneration. It was decided to evaluate bone&#xD;
      regeneration in CBCT scans (Ez3D Plus Professional Ver.1.2.6.1) at following dimensions:&#xD;
      horizontal AA (X) (mm) and vertical AA (Y) (mm) dimensions of alveolar ridge were measured.&#xD;
      Also, horizontal X (mm), vertical Y (mm) and diagonal Z (mm) dimensions of primary bone&#xD;
      tissue formed in post-extraction alveolus in 1 month (Figure 2) All measurements carried out&#xD;
      by the same examinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size of this study was calculated by using Paniotto formula. During the research&#xD;
      period (September to December 2019) was estimated that on average within 4 months 48 pacients&#xD;
      applies to department of Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic of Kaunas Clinics due to lower molars&#xD;
      extraction. After calculations with 95% probability and 0,05 error defined required sample&#xD;
      size - 43 pacients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis carried out using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Science for&#xD;
      Windows; Chihago, USA) package 22.0. The diagnostic and demographic charasteristics were&#xD;
      compared using Wilcoxon test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-Whitney test and Spearman correlation&#xD;
      analysis. Level of significance p was set at 0,05 for verification of statistical hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood of 11 patients (3 men and 8 women, average age 27 years) taken from peripheral vein,&#xD;
      using 21G blood collection needle and PRGF-Endoret® test tubes with volume of 9 ml, for&#xD;
      production of PRGF. As per instruction of manufacturer, tubes contain 3,8 % sodium citrate,&#xD;
      which serves as anticoagulant. In order to produce the PRGF, test tubes were centrifuged for&#xD;
      8 minutes in 580 g Endoret® (PRGF®) System V centrifuge. 3 different layers are formed -&#xD;
      erythrocytes, leukocytes and blood plasma. Layer of blood plasma is divided into two&#xD;
      fractions. 1st fraction is called plasma poor in growth factors, which forms a top layer in a&#xD;
      tube down to 2nd fraction. 2nd fraction (2 ml of blood plasma, which is above the layer of&#xD;
      leukocytes), forms the layer of plasma rich in growth factors. Activation of this fraction is&#xD;
      carried out using sterile 10 % calcium chloride solution (50 µL of activator for 1 ml of&#xD;
      blood plasma), which carried out degranulation of platelets and therefore released growth&#xD;
      factors. After activation, test tubes were incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes, in order give&#xD;
      the consistency of gelatin to PRGF. Formed fold or fluid was inserted into alveolus of&#xD;
      extracted tooth, then the edges were closed up using resorbable cross mattress suture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood of 11 patients (2 men and 9 women, average age 26 years) were collected from peripheral&#xD;
      vein using 21G blood collection needle and PRF test tubes with volume of 9 ml, for production&#xD;
      of PRF. Test tube was inserted into A-PRF centrifuge &quot;A-PRF 12&quot;. The lid was closed and&#xD;
      program at 2800 rpm for 12 minutes was initiated. A-PRF fold was separated from red blood&#xD;
      cells (blood clots) in the test tube. After pulling the fold out of test tube, it was formed&#xD;
      on sterile surgical tray. Formed fold was inserted into alveolus of extracted tooth and edges&#xD;
      of wound were closed up using resorbable cross mattress suture.&#xD;
