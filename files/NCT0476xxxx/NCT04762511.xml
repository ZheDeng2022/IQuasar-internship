    <textblock>
      The purpose of this first-time-in-human (FTiH) study is to assess the reactogenicity, safety&#xD;
      and immunogenicity of four different dose levels of an experimental herpes simplex virus type&#xD;
      2 (HSV-2) vaccine, when administered intramuscularly (IM) on a 0, 2-month schedule to healthy&#xD;
      participants aged 18-40 years.&#xD;
