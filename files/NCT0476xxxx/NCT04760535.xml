  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to assess the effectiveness of Invisalign® First clear aligners compared to&#xD;
      tooth-borne Hyrax-type maxillary expander on palatal morphology in growing subjects using 3D&#xD;
      technology. In this two-arm parallel-group randomized prospective clinical trial we will&#xD;
      include patients with: indications for maxillary expansion treatment, age between 6 and 10&#xD;
      years old, mixed dentition, good standard of oral hygiene, good compliance during treatment&#xD;
      as assessed by the practitioner. Patients will be assigned to one of two expansion methods&#xD;
      (arm A: Invisalign® First clear aligners, arm B: tooth-borne Hyrax-type maxillary expander)&#xD;
      according to a computer-generated randomization list shortly before the start of expansion&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure will be the change in palatal morphology (palatal volume and surface&#xD;
      area variations). Secondary outcomes will be: arch dimensions (upper inter-canine width,&#xD;
      upper inter-molar width, anterior segment length, posterior segment length), complications,&#xD;
      patients' satisfaction and periodontal health. Due to the nature of the intervention blinding&#xD;
      will not be possible. Potential statistical differences between the two intervention groups&#xD;
      will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Palate morphology</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome will be to evaluate the changes in palatal morphology after the treatment of maxillary deficiencies using two different therapies and to re-evaluate changes over the initial 12-months after the end of the treatment. The changes in palatal morphology are defined as the variation in palatal volume and surface. These will be measured from digitized study models within the boundaries of the palate, the gingival and distal planes, defined as follow. The gingival plane will be created by connecting the midpoints of the dentogingival junction of all upper erupted deciduous and permanent teeth. The distal plane will be created through two points at the distal of the first upper permanent molars perpendicular to the gingival plane.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Upper arch dimensions</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in upper arch transverse dimensions (Upper inter-canine width (ICW), Upper inter-molar width (IMW), Anterior segment length (ASL), Posterior segment length (PSL)) will be also recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Appliances survival</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Appliances survival (secondary outcome measure) will be recorded as the time to the first episode of failure. The date of failure will be recorded as the day the patient became aware of the problem or the date the clinician will note the failure when participants will be unaware of a failed retainer.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction (secondary outcome measure) will be determined by a modified 10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS)26, which contained 10 questions. Patients were given oral and written instructions and explanations on how to complete these questionnaires. The lowest (least favourable) score was '0' and the highest (most favourable) score was '10' For example if the retainer was very uncomfortable, it was scored as '0' and if it was very comfortable, it was scored as '10'. The questionnaires will be administered to the participants and filled in front of the treating doctor at their scheduled review appointments. The data from the questionnaires were coded and will be assessed by one investigator.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Periodontal health</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Periodontal measurements will be taken in the maxilla by a calibrated operator before, at the end of the active orthodontic treatment and at the subsequent review appointments.&#xD;
A simplified Basic Periodontal Examination (BPE) on three index teeth will be performed in all co-operative children and adolescents included in the trial. The simplified BPE is performed using the WHO 621 probe with a light probing force of 20-25 g.&#xD;
It is recommended the use of a simplified examination determining only codes 0, 1, 2 up to the age of 11 years because of the likelihood of pseudopockets associated with newly erupting teeth.</description>

    <description>The Invisalign® First aligners are fabricated in a multilayer aromatic thermoplastic polyurethane/co-polyester 0.75mm (.030&quot;)-thick with a fine 3D manufacturing process.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The Hyrax-type maxillary expander is a tooth-borne expansion appliance that is fixed to the upper second deciduous molars (or to the first permanent molars) using bands and includes a midline 12-mm self-locking screw (Forestadent, Pforzheim, Germany; 0.9 mm, complete turn). The expansion screw is connected to the conventional molar bands or printed clasps, modeled surrounding the molars, via a framework of 0.9mm stainless-steel wire. The framework is soldered to the bands and extending on the palatal side to the deciduous canines. The expander will be fabricated by qualified laboratory technician.</description>
