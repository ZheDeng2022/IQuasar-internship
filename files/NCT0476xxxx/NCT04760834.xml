  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rugby is a popular contact sport in France the majority of whom are amateur players.&#xD;
      Concussion is one of the main risks given its potential severity and frequency (between 2.78&#xD;
      and 10 per 1,000 player hours). Faced with a concussion, stop sport activity, medical&#xD;
      evaluation and a progressive resumption of activity are simple things to do to avoid an&#xD;
      over-risk of injury and better recovery of the player. For this purpose, the rugby federation&#xD;
      implement the blue card and the concussion declaration by clubs. A recent study showed that&#xD;
      the directives of the federation are not sufficiently respected. The non-declaration problem&#xD;
      is added knowing that around 50% of concussions are not declared. In professional rugby, the&#xD;
      presence of a medical staff makes possible to optimize care as much as possible. In the&#xD;
      amateur world, there are not always medical or paramedical personnel trained for this problem&#xD;
      at the edge of the field when all the participants (player, coach, coaching) lack of&#xD;
      knowledge on the subject and that the general practicer remains the referent for the&#xD;
      concussion management. We will reach a dozen amateur rugby club to complete a questionnaire&#xD;
      about concussions and conduct un formation session about this issue.&#xD;
