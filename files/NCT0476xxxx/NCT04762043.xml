  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the ability of MyoVoice to replace natural speech. Referred to&#xD;
      generally as an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) device, MyoVoice uses&#xD;
      electrical signals recorded non-invasively from speech muscles (electromyographic, or EMG,&#xD;
      signals) to restore communication for those with vocal impairments that resulted from&#xD;
      surgical treatment of laryngeal and oropharyngeal cancers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 7.5 million people worldwide are unable to vocalize effectively. Among these individuals&#xD;
      are cancer survivors who underwent oropharyngeal/laryngeal surgery and must rely on AAC&#xD;
      systems such as text-to-speech applications or artificial voice prostheses as substitutes for&#xD;
      their natural voice. Yet most of these devices struggle to convey the expressive attributes&#xD;
      of speech (prosody), leading to poor comprehension and a lack of emotional content. The&#xD;
      clinical trial will investigate the feasibility of MyoVoice-a novel AAC device that uses&#xD;
      surface EMG signals to extract patterns for understanding vocabulary and expressive&#xD;
      attributes from articulatory musculature during silently mouthed speech-to effectively&#xD;
      restore conversational capabilities for individuals living with vocal impairments due to&#xD;
      surgical treatment of laryngeal and oropharyngeal cancers. Patients who underwent a total&#xD;
      laryngectomy will be asked to communicate with a conversational partner by silently mouthing&#xD;
      words using MyoVoice. The device performance will be evaluated in terms of its ability to&#xD;
      accurately and quickly translate articulatory muscle activity into audible speech. MyoVoice&#xD;
      will also be compared to that of conventional electrolaryngeal speech aids (i.e., artificial&#xD;
      larynx) to evaluate device ease-of-use, functional efficacy, and social reception.&#xD;
