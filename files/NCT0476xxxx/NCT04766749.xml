  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug-coated balloon is being used more and more widely for the advantage of intervention&#xD;
      without implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But the balloon needs to be released long enough to be effective. Prolonged balloon dilation&#xD;
      resulting in the cessation of blood flow in the distal vessels, especially large vessels, may&#xD;
      result in severe ischemia in the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RIPC can enhance patients' tolerance to ischemic events, so we believe that RIPC application&#xD;
      before the use of drug balloon for PCI can improve patients' ischemic symptoms, thus&#xD;
      increasing the release time of drug balloon and improving the effect.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some patients receiving PCI cannot tolerate the symptoms of myocardial ischemia caused by the&#xD;
      release of the drug balloon for a long time and even lead to the occurrence of adverse&#xD;
      events.RIPC was found to improve tolerance to myocardial ischemia in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, it can open collateral circulation and improve the tolerance of myocardial&#xD;
      ischemia in patients.Therefore, this study designed a parallel control group. The&#xD;
      experimental group was treated with RIPC before PCI, while the control group was not treated&#xD;
      before PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operator does not know whether the patient has undergone RIPC or not, and the operator&#xD;
      decides the time of drug balloon release according to the symptoms of the patient during the&#xD;
      operation.Angiography was performed at 6 months, and QCA was used to determine late lumen&#xD;
      loss at 1 year.The 1-year incidence of target lesion failure events was assessed.&#xD;
