  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent immunological and physiological studies have provided evidence in support of a central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS) lymphatic drainage system in vertebrate animals, and preliminary&#xD;
      evidence has suggested that a similar system exists in humans. If operative, this system may&#xD;
      have central relevance to many vascular and fluid clearance disorders such as stroke,&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease related dementia (ADRD):&#xD;
      diseases which represent some of the most pressing healthcare challenges of the 21st century.&#xD;
      Evaluating this possibility will require improved, robust imaging methods sensitive to&#xD;
      lymphatic drainage dysfunction; as such, the goal of this work is to apply novel magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging approaches, optimized already for evaluating lymphatic circulation in&#xD;
      patients with peripheral lymphatic dysfunction, to quantify relationships between&#xD;
      physiological hallmarks of ADRD and CNS lymphatic function in humans.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposal involves magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of healthy volunteers and patient&#xD;
      volunteers suffering from Parkinson's disease. As part of the research study, volunteers will&#xD;
      undergo 1-2 non-invasive MRI scans at a field strength of 3 Tesla. Each scan session will&#xD;
      last 60-90 minutes, and will include the time when the volunteers will rehearse the&#xD;
      experiment outside of the scanner, time for the volunteers and patients to be comfortably&#xD;
      placed in the scanner, scanning, and finally time for the patients to slowly exit the scan&#xD;
      room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All MRI methods are non-invasive and no exogenous contrast agents will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient volunteers will also undergo an C-11 PiB PET scan for Aim (2). This procedure&#xD;
      utilizes a common radiotracer that is used routinely in clinical PET scans and will be&#xD;
      purchased here from PETNET and certified for human use. All PET scans will be performed by a&#xD;
      certified PET technologist at the Vanderbilt University Institute of Imaging Science.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, in Aim (3) of this study, measurements of glymphatic function will be performed&#xD;
      before and during general anesthesia. Importantly, the general anesthesia will be&#xD;
      administered as part of standard-of-care for clinically-indicated MRIs required for deep&#xD;
      brain stimulation planning and electrode placement. Therefore, the intervention itself is not&#xD;
      a research procedure. Additionally, the scan that will be performed, which is a modified&#xD;
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) MRI approach, is already performed as part of this clinical&#xD;
      protocol. Therefore, it is anticipated that the participant will not be sedated any longer&#xD;
      than what would be required for clinical indication for this procedure. As such, while this&#xD;
      study qualifies as a clinical trial by NIH criteria, it is expected to pose no more risk than&#xD;
      what the participant will receive from their clinical standard-of-care procedure.&#xD;
