    <textblock>
      This study will compare two non- invasive treatment options: Hall technique and 38% Silver&#xD;
      diamine fluoride. Both are methods used to create a more favorable environment without&#xD;
      removal of caries leading to the arrest of the progression of demineralization process and&#xD;
      restoring the function of the diseased molars.&#xD;

      Detailed Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental caries, also known as tooth decay, it can occur in primary teeth in early childhood,&#xD;
      is formed through interaction between acid-producing bacteria and carbohydrate. The caries&#xD;
      develops in both the crowns and roots of teeth. Progress of caries depended on the lifestyle&#xD;
      of the child (as high numbers of cariogenic bacteria, inadequate salivary flow, insufficient&#xD;
      fluoride exposure and poor oral hygiene). To avoid this disease should follow the proper oral&#xD;
      hygiene and improve lifestyle . A lot of methods found to treatment the decayed tooth - like;&#xD;
      Hall technique and Silver diamine fluoride The first report on the Hall Technique published&#xD;
      in 2007 by a general dental practitioner from Aberdeen/Scotland, Dr. Norna Hall. Dr. Hall&#xD;
      used PMCs to restore carious primary molars rather than using the standard technique, placed&#xD;
      them using a simplified method2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have recommended that Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) solution would exert a&#xD;
      preventive result in managing early childhood caries ECC. However, no well-designed clinical&#xD;
      trials have yet been performed to study the effect of SDF on caries prevention. the objective&#xD;
      is useful in arresting early childhood caries (ECC)&#xD;
