  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Catheter-related thrombosis could impair blood flow in the vein, block the central venous&#xD;
      catheter, induce catheter-related infection or venous thromboembolism in the deep veins or&#xD;
      pulmonary vessels, which furthermore progress into the post-thrombotic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researches using echogenic mass as the primary outcome could miss those premature thrombi&#xD;
      which might not be seen on traditional ultrasonography but may be detected by Duplex and&#xD;
      Doppler ultrasound with vessel compression. Moreover, studies indicated that some thrombus&#xD;
      developed after the catheter removal. Removal of the catheter is not the endpoint of thrombus&#xD;
      detection. This study is designed to determine the preventive effects of continuous heparin&#xD;
      infusion on real-world central venous catheter-related thrombosis in infants after cardiac&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

      infusion on real-world central venous catheter-related thrombosis in infants after cardiac&#xD;
      surgery. One hundred and twenty-four infants were randomized to the intervention group or the&#xD;
      control group. Unfractionated heparin or normal saline was infused continuously through each&#xD;
      lumen of the central venous catheter at the speed of 0.5 ml/h/line until the catheter was&#xD;
      removed. Catheter-related thrombosis was detected by point-of-care Duplex and Doppler&#xD;
      ultrasound periodically until 30 days after the cardiac surgery or discharge, whichever comes&#xD;
      first.&#xD;

    <description>CVC-related thrombosis of any catheter as imaged by echocardiogram or ultrasound at 30 days after cardiac surgery. Thrombus was defined as an echogenic mass near the tip of the catheter or slow/no flow detected by Duplex and Doppler ultrasound at the nearby vessels and the on-site vessel couldn't be clasped as narrow as the collateral vessel by compression of the probe.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>124 infants of heparin-related comorbidity</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days after cardiac surgery or at discharge, whichever comes first</time_frame>
    <description>Abnormal coagulation and hemostasis were defined as treatment initiation by the clinical teams at the discretion of heparin adverse events. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was confirmed with consistent low platelet level and positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay heparin-platelet factor 4 antibody assay. Catheter-related sepsis was defined as culture of the same organism from both the catheter tip and at least one percutaneous blood culture. Culture of the same organism from the catheter was also accepted as an alternative of culture of catheter tip.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Post-thrombotic syndrome</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after cardiac surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The symptoms of post-thrombotic syndrome included aching, swelling, itchy and ulcer in the indwelling site and the collateral varicose veins.</description>
