  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), or atrial-synchronized biventricular (BiV) pacing,&#xD;
      is an FDA-approved device therapy option for heart failure (HF) patients with reduced left&#xD;
      ventricular ejection fraction and electrical dyssynchrony. A traditional CRT device has&#xD;
      pacing leads implanted within the right atrium (RA), the right ventricle (RV), and within a&#xD;
      coronary vein overlying the lateral or posterior left ventricle (LV). Within the past decade,&#xD;
      various multi-center randomized controlled trials have reported improved quality of life,&#xD;
      aerobic exercise capacity, LV systolic function and structure, as well as decreased&#xD;
      hospitalization rates and mortality among patients with HF. Despite improvements in CRT&#xD;
      technology with multipoint pacing, quadripolar leads, and adaptive pacing algorithms,&#xD;
      approximately 30% of patients do not clinically benefit and are considered non-responders.&#xD;
      This study looks to optimize CRT device programming in patients considered non-responders to&#xD;
      CRTusing information obtained from standard ECG machines, and to assess acute and chronic&#xD;
      effects of CRT optimization using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized study designed to evaluate if CRT device optimization,&#xD;
      guided by electrocardiography, improves cardiac function and clinical outcomes among patients&#xD;
      considered non-responders to CRT. All patients will have electrocardiographic assessment of&#xD;
      electrical dyssynchrony at a range of device settings using standard ECG machines. All&#xD;
      patients will then have a baseline CMR study at baseline CRT programming, underlying rhythm,&#xD;
      and optimal settings derived from the electrocardiographic assessment to assess acute effects&#xD;
      of CRT optimization on mechanical synchrony, LV regional wall motion, and LV structure/&#xD;
      function. To assess chronic effects of CRT optimization, patients will be randomized in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio after baseline CMR to either the active comparator arm (baseline CRT programming), or&#xD;
      the experimental arm (CRT device programmed to optimal settings derived from the&#xD;
      electrocardiographic assessment). Patients will be blinded to randomization. After 6 month,&#xD;
      all patients will return for follow up CMR study to assess chronic effects. After follow up&#xD;
      CMR imaging, the active comparator group will crossover to the experimental group. After 12&#xD;
      months, all patients will return for follow up echocardiogram to further evaluate the chronic&#xD;
      effects of CRT optimization.&#xD;
