  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the iBreastExam device to find out whether it can detect a mass or lump&#xD;
      in the breast as accurately as a routine breast cancer screening examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The iBreastExam is a handheld device that performs a painless electronic palpation&#xD;
      (examination by touch) of the breast. The device is designed to detect breast abnormalities&#xD;
      that may require breast imaging and additional clinical examination by a nurse or doctor. The&#xD;
      iBreastExam device creates a color map of the breast, with red spots indicating areas that&#xD;
      may be abnormal.&#xD;
