    <description>PFS was measured from the date of enrollment to the date of disease progression as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) Version 1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. For patients whose disease did not progress, PFS was evaluated by censoring patients at their most recent imaging.</description>

    <description>OS was defined as the time from the date of enrollment until death by any cause. Participants still alive at the time of data analysis were censored at the date of last follow-up.</description>

    <description>Patients who possess oligoresidual disease after 3rd generation EGFR-TKI therapy will be treated with the intent to ablate all residual disease with consolidative SBRT. The choice of dose-fractionation regimen is at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist. TKI will be continued during and after consolidative SBRT until disease progression or intolerable toxicity.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a diagnosis of pathologically confirmed NSCLC by tumor biopsy and/or&#xD;
             fine-needle aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a diagnosis of American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th Edition&#xD;
             stage IV NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient receives 3rd generation EGFR-TKI after progression on 1st or 2nd&#xD;
             generation EGFR-TKI with either tissue or liquid biopsy-confirmed acquired T790M&#xD;
             mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is ≥18 years of age and ≤75 years of age at the time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient's Karnofsky performance score (KPS) is ≥70 at study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has adequate baseline tumor assessment before initiation of 3rd generation&#xD;
             EGFR-TKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has at least one measurable lesion according to Response Evaluation&#xD;
             Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient presents with a residual &quot;oligometastatic&quot; state after 3rd generation&#xD;
             EGFR-TKI therapy that would be amenable to consolidative SBRT in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of another malignancy or concurrent malignancy. Patients with cervical&#xD;
             carcinoma in situ or adequately treated basal cell carcinoma who have been disease&#xD;
             free for &gt; 5 years are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is pregnant (confirmed by serum b-HCG if applicable) or is breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients confirmed to be negative for T790M mutation or patients in whom the T790M&#xD;
             status is not evaluated after progression on 1st or 2nd generation EGFR-TKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled epilepsy, mental disorders, drug abuse, or social condition&#xD;
             that may affect compliance or ability to sign a written informed consent in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with residual metastatic disease after 3rd generation EGFR-TKI therapy that&#xD;
             is deemed not amenable to consolidative SBRT.&#xD;
