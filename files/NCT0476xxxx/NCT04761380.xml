      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dysphagia is frequently observed in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      (COPD). But tongue strength has not been investigated yet in COPD subjects. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesized that tongue strength is weaker in COPD subjects compared to normal subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a single-centre, observational, and cross-sectional study. Twenty-seven subjects&#xD;
      with COPD and twenty-four age-matched control subjects were enrolled in this study. Isometric&#xD;
      tongue strength was measured using a device fitted with a disposable oral balloon probe. The&#xD;
      investigators also evaluated handgrip strength, gait speed, and appendicular skeletal muscle&#xD;
      mass (ASM) to define participants as having sarcopenia. ASM, fat free mass index (FFMI), and&#xD;
      skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) were measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Gait&#xD;
      speed was measured using the 6-meter walking test. The eating assessment test-10 (EAT-10) was&#xD;
      used to diagnose dysphagia.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>maximum tongue pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>To measure maximum tongue pressure (MTP), the balloon was positioned on the anterior palate with the lips closed. Subjects raised their tongue and compressed the balloon onto the palate with maximal voluntary muscular effort for approximately 7s. The measurement was taken three times with a 1-min interval. The maximum value was recorded as the MTP.</description>

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Handgrip strength was measured three times for the right hand using a grip strength dynamometer and mean values were used.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>fat free mass index (FFMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>FFMI (kg/m^2) was calculated by fat free mass／height^2(m^2).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>fat free mass</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Fat free mass was measured using the medical body composition analyzer. It is designed for measurements in the supine position, using four pairs of electrodes (eight electrodes in total), positioned on each hand and foot21. Supine measurements were taken after lying down for 10 minutes. Alcohol was prohibited for 24h prior to the impedance measurements.</description>
