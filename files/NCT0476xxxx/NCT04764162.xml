  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a metabolite produced by gut microbial metabolism of dietary&#xD;
      choline, has recently been causally linked to atherosclerosis in animal models and has been&#xD;
      shown to be predictive of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in some but not all cohort&#xD;
      studies. The relevance of observations in animals to humans is unclear and little information&#xD;
      is available on the mechanisms linking TMAO to increased CVD risk. Vascular dysfunction plays&#xD;
      a critical role in the initiation and progression of atherothrombotic disease. Whether TMAO&#xD;
      impairs vascular function in humans is not known. The purpose of this study is to determine&#xD;
      if short term supplementation of dietary choline, which increases TMAO, affects CVD risk&#xD;
      factors, such as glucose homeostasis and vascular function.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Insulin Response after Supplementation</measure>
    <time_frame>3-hour test in laboratory at 4 timepoints; baseline, week 4, week 6, and week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete a mixed meal tolerance test at baseline, after a 2-week washout, and immediately following each intervention. A catheter will be placed in one of the participant's arms. After a baseline blood draw to measure fasting levels of glucose, insulin, cholesterol and other factors, participants will drink a mixed meal beverage (Ensure originalÂ®, 220 calories, 32 g carbohydrate, 6 g fat, and 9 g protein). Blood will be collected in small amounts (less than one half teaspoon) at eight timepoints over a three-hour period. This test will be conducted two times separated by about 4 weeks for each intervention (choline, placebo).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in 24-hour Area Under the Curve for Glucose Levels after Supplementation</measure>
    <time_frame>4-day measurement during free living</time_frame>
    <description>Glucose will be monitored by a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) sensor (Enlite Sensor; Medtronic, Inc. or FreeStyle Libre Pro; Abbott) and this will be placed on the participant's abdomen or back of the upper arm in order to measure glucose continuously. The measured glucose levels will be assessed by an iPro2 Professional CGM; Medtronic, Inc. or FreeStyle Libre Pro reader; Abbott; and the CGM will be worn for 4 consecutive days. This test will be conducted two times separated by about 4 weeks for each intervention (choline, placebo).</description>
