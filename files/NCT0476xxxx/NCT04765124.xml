  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Non-Interventional Study (NIS) with secondary data usage. It is designed as a&#xD;
      multi-center retrospective cohort study in which the data of adult locally advanced&#xD;
      HER2-positive breast cancer patients, who are treated with as neoadjuvant therapy, who&#xD;
      underwent breast surgery in participating centers, were taken from hospital records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The source population is academic or community oncology centers treating patients with breast&#xD;
      cancer from Turkey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population is planned to be the subgroup of breast cancer patients, who are treated&#xD;
      with trastuzumab plus taxane with or without pertuzumab as neoadjuvant therapy, and underwent&#xD;
      breast surgery at the participating centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is anticipated to include approximately 1500 patients from 20 sites.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2013, the Food and Drug Agency (FDA) granted accelerated approval to pertuzumab for use in&#xD;
      the neoadjuvant setting with trastuzumab and chemotherapy for HER2+ locally advanced breast&#xD;
      cancer (either greater than 2 cm in diameter or node positive), based on improvement in pCR&#xD;
      in the NeoSphere (Neoadjuvant Study of Pertuzumab and Herceptin in an Early Regimen&#xD;
      Evaluation) and TRYPHAENA (Trastuzumab plus Pertuzumab in Neoadjuvant HER2- positive Breast&#xD;
      Cancer) studies. Full approval of pertuzumab in the early stage for patients at high risk of&#xD;
      recurrence was recently received based on results of the adjuvant APHINITY study. NeoSphere&#xD;
      study demonstrated a higher breast pCR rate with THP 17 (docetaxel, trastuzumab, pertuzumab)&#xD;
      as compared to TH (breast pCR 45.8 versus 29%), and TRYPHAENA study also demonstrated high&#xD;
      total pCR rates with FEC (5- fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide)-THP (pCR 54.7%)&#xD;
      and TCHP (docetaxel, carboplatin, HP, pCR 63.6%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pertuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody and is the first of a novel class of&#xD;
      HER2-targeted agents known as HER2 dimerization inhibitors. This agent bind to a distinct&#xD;
      epitope on the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor (the domain II dimerization arm),&#xD;
      blocking the interaction between HER2 and other HER family receptors. Potent inhibition of&#xD;
      HER-mediated intracellular signaling results in cancer cell growth inhibition and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Turkey, Pertuzumab has been authorized as neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer patients&#xD;
      since March 2019. Before this date pertuzumab was also available after patient- based&#xD;
      approvals. Due to lack of local data regarding outcomes of pertuzumab in neoadjuvant therapy&#xD;
      for breast cancer patients, this study will be the first in this area, in terms of national&#xD;
      real world data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a Non-Interventional Study (NIS) with secondary data usage. It is designed as a&#xD;
      multi-center retrospective cohort study in which the data of adult breast cancer patients,&#xD;
      who are treated with as neoadjuvant therapy and underwent breast surgery in participating&#xD;
      centers, were taken from hospital records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIS secondary data use based on electronic health records and paper files. Required key,&#xD;
      primary and secondary variables will be ready including pCR data at the hospital records. If&#xD;
      not, at the time of surgery there will be biopsy / imaging and other laboratory results, so&#xD;
      primary or sub-investigator could also assess response and note as a source document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients' data planned to be collected in line with this study protocol after the ethics&#xD;
      approval of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This retrospective design and secondary data use will help to reach endpoints in a short time&#xD;
      with a 1500 target patient number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is planned to be performed on nation-wide across Turkey from 20 oncology clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected into the database via an electronic case report form (e-CRF).&#xD;
      Principal investigators at each participating site will be in charge of transferring patient&#xD;
      data into the e-CRF. Data from the initial diagnosis of each patient until the last requested&#xD;
      and available data in the patient charts at each participating site will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary variables for this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics Clinical Information Diagnosis date Clinical Stage Pathological stage(TNM stage)&#xD;
      Receptor status Histologic subtype Imaging details Neoadjuvant therapy Start date Stop date&#xD;
      Response at the time of surgery Imaging after neoadjuvant treatment if available Recurrence&#xD;
      if available Breast surgery Surgery type Operation date Imaging after operation Adjuvant&#xD;

      follow-up)&#xD;

&#xD;
      The secondary variables for this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events Incidence Therapy relationship Grade according to CTCAE Start/End date&#xD;
      Outcomes : Hospitalization, intervention, ex, etc Recurrence date, death date if applicable.&#xD;
