  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to determine whether community health worker (CHW)&#xD;
      navigation improves outcomes of chronic disease and chronic disease risk factors in a&#xD;
      low-income, primarily ethnic minority population when combined with an evidence-based&#xD;
      population health model as compared to usual care after 10 months.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The I-POP+CHW participants will be paired with a CHW at baseline to assist with navigation&#xD;
      for 10-months between health and wellness services in the selected zip codes: 75210, 75215,&#xD;
      75216, 75217, 75223, or 75227. Participants will receive a multi-level intervention utilizing&#xD;
      the current I-POP Health model that includes: 1) Access to health services (including oral&#xD;
      health), 2) Access to clinical prevention services, 3) Access to education and facilities to&#xD;
      increase physical activity and improved nutrition choices, and 4) Scheduled visits with CHWs&#xD;
      for education and navigation. Individuals will complete study measures at baseline, 6-months,&#xD;
      and 10-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group participants will receive access to the same I-POP Health resources without&#xD;
      CHW navigation until the end of 10-months (delayed CHW navigation). The current usual care&#xD;
      model is outlined below (section 2.3) Participants will complete study measures at baseline,&#xD;
      6-months, and 10-months timepoints. Upon completion of 10-months measures, these individuals&#xD;
      will be assigned a CHW and receive delayed navigation.&#xD;

Individuals will have access to resources within our current, ongoing I-POP Health model, but without CHW navigation between BSW HWC and local service providers. Participants will complete follow-up visits for collection of study measures with study personnel at 6- and 10- months. At the end of the 10-month follow-up period, participants receive an assigned CHW and CHW-navigation.</description>
