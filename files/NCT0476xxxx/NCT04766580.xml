  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Quebec, there has been an important increase of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder&#xD;
      (ADHD) diagnosis since 2015. ADHD symptoms, related to behavioural and/or concentration&#xD;
      difficulties, are very similar to other disorders symptoms, such as anxiety and depression,&#xD;
      and have a significant impact on students' academic success and future life. Adults (parent,&#xD;
      teacher, coach) expectations towards a child's abilities are consciously or unconsciously&#xD;
      perceived by the child, influence his expectations of his own abilities, and thus his&#xD;
      academic performance (Pygmalion effect). The child and his entourage's expectations are&#xD;
      therefore a major factor to consider, especially in school-age children. According to ADHD&#xD;
      studies, some brain areas involved in pain regulation and in attention cognitive abilities&#xD;
      develop at a slower rate in children with ADHD than the other children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the deleterious consequences generated by the symptoms of this disorder, the&#xD;
      research project aims to better understand the role of expectations in children with ADHD in&#xD;
      a medical (pain) and school (attention abilities) context. It also aims to contribute to&#xD;
      better understand the role of the brain on the expectations effect and ADHD. In this study,&#xD;
      children expectations will be modulated while pain experiments and cognitive task will be&#xD;
      realized by children with and without ADHD. Brain measures will also be assessed with&#xD;
      advanced techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, we hope that the results will help improve intervention strategies in these contexts to&#xD;
      ensure better support for children with ADHD, with a distant goal of contributing to the&#xD;
      development of stronger tools for differential diagnostics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit with or without Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      disorder that affects 2 to 7% worldwide youth population and 6.2% of children aged 6 to 11&#xD;
      years in Quebec [1-3]. The main symptoms of this disorder are difficulties in regulating&#xD;
      behaviour and/or concentration [4]. These difficulties have significant negative consequences&#xD;
      in someone's life, particularly in terms of their academic success [5] and has significant&#xD;
      negative consequences in the medical context, increasing accidents and mortality risk [6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children's academic performance can be modulated by the Pygmalion (or Rosenthal) effect,&#xD;
      which refers to an improvement or decrease in an individual's performance depending on the&#xD;
      degree of belief in his or her abilities on the part of an authority or the environment [7].&#xD;
      Thus, these beliefs have an influence on a person's expectations of his or her ability to do&#xD;
      a task, and thus on final performance [8]. The expectations of an individual and his or her&#xD;
      entourage is therefore a major factor to consider, especially in school-age children [9].&#xD;
      Expectations also play an important role in the placebo effect. Whereas a placebo is a&#xD;
      treatment without any real influence on a particular condition (drug or therapeutic&#xD;
      technique), the placebo effect is the perceived beneficial effect following this treatment.&#xD;
      Furthermore, a placebo effect is almost always added to the beneficial effect of a treatment&#xD;
      in different ways (for example, an analgesic effect could occur faster or in a shorter delay)&#xD;
      and to different degrees [10]. The placebo effect is regularly studied and increasingly&#xD;
      understood in the context of pain [11]. Although the perception of pain is influenced by&#xD;
      placebo treatment, this effect is itself modulated by the expectations of the person in pain&#xD;
      [12]. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is an essential region for the placebo's&#xD;
      mechanism of action [10]. In children with ADHD, there is a delay in the maturation of the&#xD;
      cortical thickness of DLPFC between the ages of 7 and 10 years [13]. These differences in&#xD;
      neuronal activity in the prefrontal region are associated with difficulties in attention&#xD;
      control and inhibition in these children: inhibitory functions measured using transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) show a lower inhibition capacity in individuals with ADHD than&#xD;
      without ADHD [14].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the important consequences generated by the symptoms of this disorder, it is&#xD;
      essential to better understand the role of the placebo/nocebo effect and expectations in&#xD;
      children with ADHD in a medical (pain) and academic (attentional skills) context. Our goal is&#xD;
      to better understand how this placebo/nocebo effects and expectations are associated with&#xD;
      changes in the DLPFC and the inhibitory functions. This study also aims to better&#xD;
      characterize the role of neurophysiological and neuroanatomical factors in these contexts,&#xD;
      with the distant goal of contributing to the development of stronger tools for differential&#xD;
      diagnostics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives (1) To compare the placebo/nocebo effect on pain and (2) on attention abilities in&#xD;
      children with and without ADHD. (3) To determine if there is a relationship between the&#xD;
      placebo/nocebo effect and neurophysiological (inhibitory mechanisms) and neuroanatomical&#xD;
      (DLPFC) measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assumptions&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) Children with ADHD will have a weaker response to the placebo/nocebo effect on pain and&#xD;
      (2) on attention abilities than children without ADHD (3) There is a moderate to strong&#xD;
      association between the placebo/nocebo effect and neurophysiological/ neuroanatomical&#xD;
      markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Data will be collected from 44 children, 22 with ADHD and 22 without ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first session, we will proceed with the experimentation of the placebo and nocebo&#xD;
      effect on pain and on the ability to perform cognitive tasks. The experiment will be divided&#xD;
      into two parts; a placebo part where the participant will have to take a &quot;drug&quot; (inactive;&#xD;
      placebo) that improves cognitive abilities and pain tolerance for a short period of time, and&#xD;
      a nocebo part where the participant will have to take a &quot;drug&quot; (inactive; nocebo) that&#xD;
      decreases cognitive abilities and pain tolerance for a short period of time. The&#xD;
      placebo/nocebo effect will be induced using an inactive capsule that &quot;increases&quot; or &quot;reduces&quot;&#xD;
      (depending on the experimenter's discourse) general cognitive skills, as well as sensitivity&#xD;
      and tolerance to pain. Following the administration of each capsule, we will proceed with the&#xD;
      pain and attention experiments, all in a randomized order. Between the two parts of the&#xD;
      experimentation, we will proceed to the questionnaire administration with the participant.&#xD;
      Since all the steps are approximately 45 minutes in length, we will be able to plan a session&#xD;
      with participants lasting between one and one and a half hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second session, we will perform the neurophysiological (inhibitory mechanisms) and&#xD;
      neuroanatomical (DLPFC) measures. At the end of the visit, we will also proceed with a review&#xD;
      of the study in order to disclose the information that was obscured during the project. An&#xD;
      explanatory document containing this information and the participant's detailed participation&#xD;
      will also be given to the parent and the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses T-tests will be used to assess the effect of expectations on pain in children with&#xD;
      ADHD compared to children without ADHD (Objective 1). The same analyses will be conducted to&#xD;
      compare the effect of expectations on the ability to perform attentional cognitive tasks&#xD;
      between the two groups (objective 2). For objective 3, simple regressions will first be used&#xD;
      to determine whether there is an association between independent variables&#xD;
      (neurophysiological and neuranatomical measures) and the effect of expectations on pain and&#xD;
      cognitive tasks. Potentially predictive variables with a p-value ˂ 0.15 on the correlation&#xD;
      test will be retained for the development of the multiple regression model. All possible&#xD;
      models, and therefore all subsets of the variables retained in the previous step, will be&#xD;
      considered. Statistical criteria (R2, adjusted R2 and Mallow's Cp) as well as a critical&#xD;
      clinical judgment will allow us to decide on the best model. This final model will only&#xD;
      include variables with a beta coefficient that is significantly non-zero at the alpha level&#xD;
      of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-parametric analyses will also be performed to determine if significant results can be&#xD;
      obtained. In addition to providing preliminary results, this study will provide the&#xD;
      statistical parameters (mean, standard deviation) required to calculate the sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contributions Research. This study could contribute to a better understanding of the role of&#xD;
      expectations in children with ADHD, in a medical (pain) and academic (attentional skills)&#xD;
      context. It will also allow us to better understand the role of DLPFC in the mechanism of the&#xD;
      placebo/nocebo effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic. As a result, it will be potentially possible to improve the intervention strategies&#xD;
      to be implemented in order to ensure better support for children with ADHD, also in the&#xD;
      medical (pain) and school (attentional skills) contexts. This study may also allow a better&#xD;
      general understanding and evaluation of the disorder, and thus reduce prejudice towards&#xD;
      children with ADHD.&#xD;
