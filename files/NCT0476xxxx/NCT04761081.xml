  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Being south Asian or centrally obese may be associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      inflammation. The investigators are seeking to investigate whether this is the case by&#xD;
      recruiting white European and south Asian men who are lean or have central obesity. Further,&#xD;
      the investigators wish to investigate whether physical activity influences the associations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Central obesity is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Further,&#xD;
      south Asians have been shown to be at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease compared to&#xD;
      white Europeans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular disease is underpinned by inflammation. Evidence suggests that people with&#xD;
      obesity have a more pro-inflammatory and pro-migratory monocyte profile compared with&#xD;
      individuals who are lean. The excessive monocyte migration contributes to metabolic&#xD;
      dysfunction over time, increasing the risk of chronic disease. However, there is no evidence&#xD;
      in south Asians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One modifiable risk factor which may be able to influence this is physical inactivity, with&#xD;
      higher levels of physical activity being associated with reduced inflammation. However,&#xD;
      although south Asians are more at risk of cardiovascular disease than white Europeans,&#xD;
      evidence suggests south Asians are also less physically active than white Europeans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are looking to recruit south Asian and white European men who are lean or&#xD;
      have central obesity to investigate 1) is there an association between ethnicity and the&#xD;
      tethering and migration of pro-inflammatory monocytes? 2) is there an association between&#xD;
      central obesity and the tethering and migration of pro-inflammatory monocytes, and is there&#xD;
      an interaction with ethnicity? 3) do higher levels of physical activity influence the&#xD;
      tethering and migration of pro-inflammatory monocytes, and is this influenced by ethnicity or&#xD;
      central obesity?&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate this, the investigators are looking to recruit south Asian and white European&#xD;
      men who are either centrally obese or lean. The investigators require 1 blood sample and the&#xD;
      participants to wear an activity monitor for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be isolated from the whole blood sample.&#xD;
      Then, the investigators will quantify the migratory capacity of PBMCs to a fixed chemokine&#xD;
      gradient over time. Further, the investigators will phenotype the monocytes to indicate the&#xD;
      characteristics of the monocytes that migrate towards the chemokine mix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The activity monitor will quantify habitual physical activity, which will be used in the&#xD;
      statistical analyses to investigate whether physical activity may influence the response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to investigate as it will further scientific knowledge on the underpinnings&#xD;
      of chronic disease and enable a better understanding on the role of physical activity to&#xD;
      potentially reduce the risk.&#xD;
