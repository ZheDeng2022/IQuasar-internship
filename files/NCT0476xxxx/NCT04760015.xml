  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with dementia develop behavioral problems over time. Among these, the investigators&#xD;
      object screams or cries or disruptives vocalizations. Their cause is multifactorial and their&#xD;
      management difficult in nursing homes. Often this patients are polymedicated, sedated or/and&#xD;
      isolated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many scientific studies are interested in drug and non-drug treatments. In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators are looking for a profile for disruptives vocalizations's patients. Thus, the&#xD;
      investigators will study the global profile of demented patients residing in EHPAD to&#xD;
      determine if there are any similarities between them.&#xD;
