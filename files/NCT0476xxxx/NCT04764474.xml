  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open label single-arm clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of HMPL-306 in subjects with advanced relapsed, refractory, or resistant&#xD;
      hematological malignancies that harbor IDH mutations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HMPL-306 is a dual IDH1/2 inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase 1, open-label, multicenter, single-arm study to evaluate safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary efficacy of HMPL-306 administered orally in treatment&#xD;
      of subjects with advanced relapsed, refractory, or resistant hematological malignancies that&#xD;
      harbor IDH mutations (or co-mutations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of 2 parts: a dose-escalation part (Part 1) and a dose-expansion part&#xD;
      (Part 2). The dose-escalation part will determine the MTD/R2PD. The dose-expansion part will&#xD;
      administer the MTD/RP2D to subjects with mIDH-positive hematological malignancies including,&#xD;
      but not limited to, AML, MDS/MPN, AITL.&#xD;
