  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laryngeal mask airway device (LMA) is a common device used in the daily practice for airway&#xD;
      management. Consecutive generations have permitted an expansion of its use, probably because&#xD;
      of a rapid increase of ambulatory surgical procedures and also due to the development of&#xD;
      procedures in areas away from the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cuff inflating volume is not standardized and it is common practice to inflate the LMA&#xD;
      cuff according to the manufacturer's recommendations, without using a manometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A hyperinflation of the LMA cuff was associated with complications ranging from sore throat,&#xD;
      or dysphagia and dysphonia, to more serious complications such as paralysis of the vocal&#xD;
      cord, arytenoid cartilages dislocation, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury and hypoglossal&#xD;
      nerve injury. Also, the excess of volume or pressure is related to poor ventilation and&#xD;
      increase the risk of gastric insufflation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the best cuff inflation method, in order to limit the&#xD;
      intracuff pressure beyond the recommended maximum pressure (PM &lt; 60 cmH2O) and to allows&#xD;
      decrease the pharyngo-laryngeal complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary outcome is to compare three different cuff inflating methods using AuraOnce™ LMA&#xD;
      during fibrobronchoscopy and endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) procedures, and to control the&#xD;
      intracuff pressure, and the effect on pharyngo-laryngeal complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three different cuff inflating methods are: 1) residual volume group (RV group) 2) half&#xD;
      of the maximum volume group (MV group) 3) unchanged volume group (NVgroup)&#xD;

      This is a prospective randomized controlled trial. The study was approved by the Ethics&#xD;
      Committee of University Hospital of La Paz, Madrid. Written informed consent will be obtained&#xD;
      from each patient before the procedure. We plan to include 210 patients scheduled for a&#xD;
      fibrobronchoscopy with EBUS-transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) procedures under general&#xD;
      anesthesia using a LMA. Patients will be allocated randomly to one of three groups of cuff&#xD;
      inflating methods according to computer-generated randomization. The size of LMA will be&#xD;
      chosen according to body weight, following the manufacturer recommendations (LMA size 3 for&#xD;
      patients of 30-50 kg, LMA size 4 for patients of 50-70 kg and LMA size 5 for patients with a&#xD;
      weight &gt;70 kg). After standard monitoring with electrocardiography, noninvasive blood&#xD;
      pressure device and pulse oximeter were applied, general anesthesia will be induced with&#xD;
      Propofol 2.5 mg.kg-1 and fentanyl 1 mcg.kg-1 intravenously Face mask ventilation with 100%&#xD;
      oxygen will be used after patients have lost eyelash reflex. Then, the assigned LMA will be&#xD;
      inserted, after appropriate conditions for insertion are obtained. LMA Insertion will be&#xD;
      performed with standard maneuver according to LMA practice manual by the same experienced&#xD;
      anesthesiologist (&gt; 1-year use experience). The initial position of LMA will be assessed by&#xD;
      visualization of bilateral chest movement when positive pressure ventilation will be&#xD;
      performed and the square capnography waveform is observed on the monitor screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the LMA is not in the proper position at the first attempt, we will use an &quot;up and down&quot;&#xD;
      maneuver to adjust and reposition LMA to attain satisfactory ventilation. If this maneuver&#xD;
      fails, LMA will be withdrawn from the mouth of the patients and a second attempt will be&#xD;
      authorized to acquire a correct position. If the proper position of LMA cannot be achieved&#xD;
      after two attempts, the airway will be controlled with another device or a tracheal&#xD;
      intubation will be performed and the patients will be excluded from the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient´s lungs will be ventilated with the anesthesia machine in controlled volume mode,&#xD;
      using the following parameters: Tidal volume, 8 ml/kg; frequency, 12-14 per min; the ratio of&#xD;
      inspiratory and expiratory, (I: E) = 1:2; and positive end expiratory pressure, 5 cmH20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the LMA will be fixed with adhesive tape and the vital signs will be stable, the LMA&#xD;
      cuff will be connected with a closed system manometer composed of a three-way stopcock, a 5&#xD;
      ml syringe and a manometer. Intracuff pressure will be measured and recorded, if it exceeds&#xD;
      of 60 cmH20 we will deflate the cuff 1 mL by 1 mL with the syringe until intracuff pressure&#xD;
      reaches 60 cmH20. The deflated volume and the final intracuff pressure will be recorded. We&#xD;
      will measure the inspiratory peak airway pressure, the volume difference of inspiratory and&#xD;
      expiratory tidal volume under the positive pressure ventilation. The plateau pressure, medium&#xD;
      pressure and Compliance will also be recorded at the corresponding cuff inflating volume,&#xD;
      before and after measuring OLP. The OLP will be measured simultaneously at the corresponding&#xD;
      cuff inflating volume, by setting the airway pressure relief valve (APL) of the breathing&#xD;
      circuit to 40 cmH20 at a fixed gas flow rate of 4 L/ min and reading the airway pressure on&#xD;
      manometer at which equilibrium of airway pressure will be established or at the pressure the&#xD;
      air leakage will be heard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fiberoptic visibility scores will be recorded on a scale of 1 to 4 (4: only vocal cords&#xD;
      visible, 3: vocal cords plus posterior epiglottis visible, 2: vocal cords plus anterior&#xD;
      epiglottis visible, 1: vocal cords not seen). A score of 1 will be considered the worst and a&#xD;
      score of 4 was considered the best.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any adverse events (i.e., desaturation (pulse oximetry&lt; 90%), aspiration/regurgitation,&#xD;
      bronchospasm, airway obstruction, coughing, gagging or vomiting) and corresponding&#xD;
      interventions will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the procedure, all patients will be transferred to the recovery unit and observed for&#xD;
      at least 1 hour. Observed adverse effects, such as sore throat, hoarseness, aphasia, nausea&#xD;
      and vomiting will be recorded in the recovery room period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 24h, a home telephone interview will record these parameters, as well as patient&#xD;
      satisfaction scores using visual analog scales.&#xD;
