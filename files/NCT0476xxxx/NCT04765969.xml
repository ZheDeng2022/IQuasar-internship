  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) rehabilitation applications&#xD;
      is to increase the functional capacity of the patients and improve the quality of life in&#xD;
      daily living activities (ADL). Therefore, the investigators planned the study to determine&#xD;
      the influence of ADL and related factors in severe COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GOLD C and D COPD patients admitted to Bezmialem Vakif University Faculty of Health Sciences&#xD;
      Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation, Pulmonary Rehabilitation Application and&#xD;
      Research Laboratory will be included in this study on a voluntary basis. Individuals who have&#xD;
      experienced exacerbations of COPD in the last 6 weeks, have comorbidities affecting&#xD;
      ambulation and have cognitive impairment will be excluded. Physical and sociodemographic&#xD;
      characteristics of all participants will be recorded. Spirometric measurement will used to&#xD;
      evaluate pulmonary functions, London Chest Activities Scale (LCADL) will used to evaluate&#xD;
      daily living activities, six minute walking test (6MWT) will used to evaluate functional&#xD;
      capacity, and mouth pressure will measured to evaluate respiratory muscle strength. (MIP:&#xD;
      maximal inspiratory pressure, MEP: maximal expiratory pressure). Saint George Respiratory&#xD;
      Questionnaire (SGRQ) for assessing quality of life, International Physical Activity&#xD;
      Questionnaire (IPAQ) for assessing physical activity, COPD Assessment Test (CAT) for symptom&#xD;
      assessment, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) for anxiety and depression&#xD;
      assessment will be applied. SPSS 22.0 package program will be used in statistical analysis.&#xD;
      For descriptive statistics, mean ± standard deviation values will be calculated and Pearson&#xD;
      correlation test will be used in correlation analysis. p &lt;0.05 will be the level of&#xD;
      significance.&#xD;

    <description>The LCADL Scale is going to used to assess dyspnea resulting from ADL . It consists of a total of 15 items within four domains: personal care (4 items), domestic (6 items), physical (2 items), and leisure (3 items). Each item is graded from 0 to 5 with higher scores indicating more difficulty performing ADL. The scale can be evaluated as total score, domain scores, and item scores. The maximum total score is 75. There is also a single question that assesses to what degree dyspnea perception affects daily life in general. This item is answered by selecting one of three responses: 'a lot', 'a little', or 'not at all'</description>

    <description>For the symptom burden of COPD, COPD Assessment Test (CAT) is going to used. It consists of eight items, each presented as a semantic 6-point differential scale, providing a score out of 40 indicating the impact of the disease</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>It provides information about time spent on walking, moderate to severe activities. Time spent in sitting is considered as a separate question.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>For the assessment of quality of life, Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) is going to used. The SGRQ is a 76-item pulmonary disease-specific health related quality of life (HRQL) questionnaire with well-demonstrated reliability and validity in subjects with pulmonary diseases. The SGRQ results are grouped into 3 domains (symptoms, activity, and impacts) and a total score. Scores range from 0 to 100, with a lower score indicating better pulmonary-specific HRQL.</description>
