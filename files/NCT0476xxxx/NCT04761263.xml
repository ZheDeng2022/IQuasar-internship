      Statement of the problem:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does task-oriented circuit training have an effect on kinematic parameters of gait, pelvic&#xD;
      symmetry and trunk endurance in children with hemiplegic CP?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate the effect of exercise-based task-oriented circuit training on gait&#xD;
           kinematics including (Stride length, step length, cadence, walking speed, ankle&#xD;
           dorsiflexion angle in initial contact, knee extension angle in midstance and hip&#xD;
           extension angle in terminal stance) in children with hemiplegic CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the effect of task-oriented circuit training on pelvic symmetry including&#xD;
           (Anterior and lateral pelvic tilting) in children with hemiplegic CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine the effect of task-oriented circuit training on trunk endurance including (prone&#xD;
           plank test, timed partial curl up test, front abdominal power test and unilateral supine&#xD;
           bridge test) in children with hemiplegic CP.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with CP have lowered physical fitness levels because their motor impairments&#xD;
      restrict their participation in daily physical activities. Children with hemiplegic CP may&#xD;
      experience a variety of concomitant health conditions including, movement difficulty,&#xD;
      postural and balance instability, muscle spasticity, difficulty with motor planning and&#xD;
      control, and cognitive impairments. They also have diminished force generation, debilitated&#xD;
      proprioception around the core, lack of enough harmonization in core musculature, and&#xD;
      diminished capacity to adjust coupling between the trunk, pelvis, and hip stabilizers leading&#xD;
      to diminished proficiency of movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the concept of motor learning, training is considered to be most effective when&#xD;
      the training task is specific to the intended outcome, as optimal improvement in function&#xD;
      involves the practice of task-specific activities. Due to the shift in focus on functional&#xD;
      movements rather than muscle activity or movement patterns, there has been a task-oriented&#xD;
      approach which is based on the system model of motor control providing motivation due to&#xD;
      specific achievements that can be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task-oriented circuit training effectively provides various sensory stimulation and promotes&#xD;
      functional activities for stroke patients; however, more attention is becoming directed to&#xD;
      children with CP to examine the effect of the task-oriented circuit training program on&#xD;
      functional performance in children with CP. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine&#xD;
      the effect of rehabilitation delivered as a task-oriented circuit exercise program on&#xD;
      kinematic parameters of gait, pelvic symmetry, and trunk endurance in children with&#xD;
      hemiplegic CP.&#xD;

    <time_frame>at baseline and after 3 months of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Endurance of the trunk muscles will be evaluated using four endurance tests designed to establish the change in isometric trunk muscles endurance including; prone plank test (sec), timed partial curl up test (sec), front abdominal power test (cm) and unilateral supine bridge test (sec). For each trunk endurance measure, the examiner will instruct the child to hold the test position as long as possible prior to all testing. Each position will be tested three times and the average time will be recorded.</description>

    <description>The task-oriented circuit training program consisted of 14 workstations. Time spent at each station will be 1.5 minutes. The children will complete the activity at one station and move to another station. The whole circuit will be completed in 21 minutes and it will be repeated twice per session with 3 minutes rest interval between the 2 circuits. Children will be encouraged to work as hard as possible at each workstation and will also be given verbal feedback and instructions aimed at improving performance. The progression of the task will be considered according to each child's ability and progressed as tolerated. Progressions include increasing the number of repetitions and increasing complexity of the exercise performed at each workstation, such as the distance reached in standing, reducing the height of the chair during sit-to stand, changing the height of blocks or by increasing speed of movement.</description>
