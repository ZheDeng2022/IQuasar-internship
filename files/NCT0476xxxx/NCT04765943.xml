      Nowadays, Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) due to malignant arrhythmias is an important cause of&#xD;
      death among acute myocardial infarction (AMI) survivors. Preventive strategies with&#xD;
      implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) are the best clinical option for patients, but&#xD;
      associated sociosanitary impact in the National Health Systems and the fact that current&#xD;
      implant strategy not always results in benefits for the patient requires to develop further&#xD;
      selection criteria. The TeVeO project aims to study the events that take place early&#xD;
      following an AMI to predict the short- and long-term risk of experiencing a potentially&#xD;
      lethal ventricular tachycardia (VT). The project will carry out an observational and&#xD;
      multicentric study involving 5 different hospitals to: a) qualitative and quantitative&#xD;
      characterize non-sustained VTs (NSVT) that take place during the first 6 months after an AMI&#xD;
      and b) characterize the evolution of the substrate (scar and surrounding tissue) in patients&#xD;
      meeting criteria for ICD implant. Patients included in the study will be implanted with an&#xD;
      implantable loop recorder (ILR) in order to register NSVT and cMRI images will be acquired&#xD;
      prior to hospital discharge and at 6 months after AMI to study the substrate. Further&#xD;
      patients' management will follow the protocols within each entity. Project results will allow&#xD;
      us to stratify patients according to identified risks for developing malignant VT, which will&#xD;
      improve patient selection for ICD implantation and will contribute to tailor patients'&#xD;
      treatment and prevention, improving the cost-effectiveness of these devices and minimizing&#xD;
      their associated problems and sociosanitary burden.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death, being&#xD;
      responsible for nearly one out of three demises, and including pathologies with a huge impact&#xD;
      in patients' and their families' quality of life and a major sociosanitary burden for&#xD;
      national health systems. Among them, ischemic heart diseases including mainly myocardial&#xD;
      infarction are the leading cause of death (12-15% deaths Globally), but with significative&#xD;
      differences among countries. In Spain, and similarly in other European nations, prevention&#xD;
      strategies, early and new therapeutic interventions and social awareness campaigns have&#xD;
      contributed to reduce ischemic heart diseases death rate from 11% in 2001 to 7.6%. However,&#xD;
      its incidence has remained practically unaltered in last decades due to the fact that the&#xD;
      benefit from prevention strategies is being undermined by progressive population ageing.&#xD;
      Since elder patients are at higher risk of developing these cardiovascular diseases, the&#xD;
      impact and burden of heart failure in our society are expected to be increased during the&#xD;
      next decades. Nowadays, approximately 30% of the patients with an acute myocardial infarction&#xD;
      (AMI) die before reaching the hospital. Among survivors, life-threatening sequels are highly&#xD;
      common and account for secondary alterations in heart pacing, mainly ventricular tachycardia&#xD;
      (VT), and contractility leading to heart failure. VT can be also presented as a consequence&#xD;
      of other pathologies, but cardiac alteration following AMI is the underlying cause in most&#xD;
      patients and it is often poorly tolerated leading to sudden cardiac death (SCD) in up to 30%&#xD;
      of AMI survivors. Today SCD represents a relevant problem for national health systems and it&#xD;
      is expected to get worse in the future European society due to population aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the duration of the episodes, VT can be classified as non-sustained, when the&#xD;
      altered rhythm is selfterminated within 30 seconds, and sustained if it lasts more than 30&#xD;
      secs. While non-sustained VT (NSVT) are frequently asymptomatic, sustained VT (SVT) are&#xD;
      potentially lethal leading to SCD by haemodynamic destabilization, shock or ventricular&#xD;
      fibrillation and usually an intervention is required to stop the arrythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions to avoid SCD following SVT are based on restoring sinus rhythm as soon as&#xD;
      possible. Therefore, preventive strategies with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)&#xD;
      are the best clinical option for certain patients at higher risk of developing VT leading to&#xD;
      life-threating events and, in fact, its implantation can rescue them from SCD. Some patients&#xD;
      more prone to suffer STV following AMI are those with prior history of SVT, poorly tolerated&#xD;
      VT or previous aborted SCD. Prevention of further lethal VT by ICD implantation, a strategy&#xD;
      known as secondary prevention, was proved beneficial by through 3 different early clinical&#xD;
      trials, even when compared with antiarrhythmic drugs. The overall evidence clearly&#xD;
      demonstrated that IDC reduce global and arrhythmic death and thus, its implantation is now a&#xD;
      class I recommendation in the international guidelines for patients with aborted SCD, or&#xD;
      potentially lethal VT. On the other hand, despite the fact that NSVT are usually&#xD;
      asymptomatic, they often precede SVT especially when recurrent and monomorphic as an&#xD;
      expression of a significant ventricular dysfunction. These NSVT are the clinical&#xD;
      manifestation of an underlaying arrhythmogenic substrate and of the activation status of&#xD;
      triggering factors. In fact, our group has published that the amount of NSVT is associated&#xD;
      with the risk of medium and long-term clinically relevant events, especially with the risk of&#xD;
      developing poorly tolerated and potentially lethal VT. Several multicentric prospective&#xD;
      clinical studies have demonstrated that ICD implantation improves overall survival of&#xD;
      patients at high risk of developing a first episode of SVT after AMI, a strategy known as&#xD;
      primary prevention. As a general conclusion, mortality is reduced around 20-30% and mainly&#xD;
      due to SCD abortion. Although different approaches have been considered to identify those&#xD;
      patients at higher risk, up to date, scientific evidence only support selection of ICD&#xD;
      candidates for primary prevention according to following criteria: a) left ventricular&#xD;
      ejection fraction (LVEF) and b) functional class by the New York Heart Association (NYHA)&#xD;
      scale, both measured between 1-6 months after the AMI and under optimal pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs. However, different guidelines do not agree on LVEF&#xD;
      threshold to select primary ICD implantation, but it is generally accepted that a benefit is&#xD;
      obtained in patients with functional class I-III and LVEF&lt;35%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, ICD devices not always produce benefits. On one hand, the apparition of a lethal SVT&#xD;
      is not prevented, just aborted, and ICD implantation early after AMI is not translated into a&#xD;
      better prognostic outcome for the patient. In fact, in the MADIT-II study, ICDs only produced&#xD;
      a reduced mortality in patients implanted beyond 18 months after AMI. On the other, the&#xD;
      device only responses to treat a VT in one every 10 patients implanted for primary&#xD;
      prevention. Besides, ICD implantation requires an invasive surgery which implies the&#xD;
      possibility of having a surgical complication and post-procedural infections in up to 3% of&#xD;
      the patients, requiring sometimes to remove the IDC and replace it once the infection is&#xD;
      cleared up. IDC malfunction and inappropriate shocks delivered by the device when no&#xD;
      life-threatening arrythmia is present are additional problems that can be presented after the&#xD;
      surgery. Therefore, device implantation and management accounts for a high economic cost,&#xD;
      with a relevant burden for the national health systems and, despite the fact that clear&#xD;
      benefits are observed, patient selection for primary prevention of VT by IDC implantation&#xD;
      should be further studied in order to first maximize the cost-effectiveness of the device and&#xD;
      second minimize as much as possible associated complications and sociosanitary burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implantable loop recorders (ILR) are small devices that are subcutaneously implanted&#xD;
      requiring a minimally invasive procedure and work as a long-term Holter, monitoring for&#xD;
      24-hour a day patient's heart rhythm to detect arrythmias. ILR are compatible with remote&#xD;
      monitoring systems (RMS), allowing the patients to send daily the information registered by&#xD;
      the device to the healthcare center just using a conventional phone landline. This&#xD;
      information can be immediately analyzed by the medical practitioner allowing to quickly adopt&#xD;
      proper measures according to patient's clinical situation, which contributes to reduce the&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Due to their safety and effectiveness, ILR are a valuable tool for&#xD;
      the diagnosis of different clinical manifestations suspected to have a cardiac origin.&#xD;
      However, up to date they have not been systematically used to detect NSVT in patients&#xD;
      following an AMI, neither in their prognostic stratification, thus the viability of this&#xD;
      strategy that could result in improving patients selection for ICD implantation need to be&#xD;
      demonstrated. Though ILR monitoring, the TeVeO project aims to qualitative and quantitative&#xD;
      characterize NSVT that take place during the first 6 months after an AMI, stablishing the&#xD;
      relative importance of the two main factors influencing the arrhythmogenic mechanisms that&#xD;
      can originate potentially lethal VT: substrate and triggers, which will allow us to advance&#xD;
      in the proper treatment and prevention of these life-threatening events through patients&#xD;
      stratification. The substrate for VT following AMI is the scar tissue, which extension and&#xD;
      heterogeneity increase the risk. Prior studies have demonstrated that scar characterization&#xD;
      by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) provides additional information to the LVEF and&#xD;
      functional class to identify those patients at higher arrhythmic risk. However, little data&#xD;
      are available regarding the underlying substrate and its evolution in chronic AMI with NSVT.&#xD;
      Therefore, in addition to ILR monitoring, TeVeO study will evaluate the scar tissue by cMRI&#xD;
      trying to identify further predictive markers associated to increased risk of developing SVT&#xD;
      after AMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS The project is grounded on the main assumption that the unsustained ventricular&#xD;
      tachycardias (NSVT) that spontaneously occur during the first 6 months after an AMI can&#xD;
      predict short and long-term functional outcome, specifically the risk of experiencing a&#xD;
      potentially lethal VT. Therefore, the study of theses arrhythmic events can contribute to&#xD;
      patient stratification and help to develop further improvements for their management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TeVeO project assume the following further hypothesis for the study of the NSVT following an&#xD;
      AMI:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The implantable loop recorders (ILRs) are able to accurately detect the NSVTs that&#xD;
           patients submitted to coronary revascularization experiment after the medical discharge&#xD;
           and during the first 6 months after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are differences in the arrhythmogenic substrate of patients presenting NSVT in the&#xD;
           6 first months after an AMI with depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)&#xD;
           that can be determined by the study of the scar tissue by cardiac MRI (cMRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES The main objective of TeVeO study is to qualitative and quantitative characterize&#xD;
      NSVTs that take place during the first 6 months after an AMI in patients with LVEF ≤40%, and&#xD;
      to discriminate the short- and long-term risks of developing potentially lethal arrhythmic&#xD;
      events, which will contribute to tailor patients' treatment and prevention according to&#xD;
      identified risks and will improve patient selection for implantable&#xD;
      cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation, improving the cost-effectiveness of these&#xD;
      devices and minimizing its associated problems and sociosanitary burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve main purpose, primary and secondary specific objectives have been stablished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Type: prospective clinical study, multicentric, Observational study. Participating&#xD;
           centres: Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Complejo Asistencial Universitario de&#xD;
           Burgos, Hospital Universitario San Pedro de Alcántara, Complejo Asistencial&#xD;
           Universitario de Santiago de Compostela and Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Lugo.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Comparing groups: Acquired data within the first 6 months after an AMI will be study in&#xD;
           order to stablish possible associations with the patient outcome in the first 2 years&#xD;
           after an AMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  NSVT: Any rhythm with a wide QRS from a ventricular origin that is self-terminated&#xD;
                within 30 second, with a heart rate over 100 bpm and over 5 beats.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  SVT: Any rhythm with a wide QRS from a ventricular origin with a heart rate over&#xD;
                100 bpm, that lasts over 30 seconds or that needs an intervention to be finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Monomorphic VT: All QRS complex present the same morphology&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Polymorphic VT: QRS morphology changes in any heartbeat.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Appropriate therapy: Any therapy (antitachycardia pacing or discharge) applied by&#xD;
                ICD due to a ventricular tachycarrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Inappropriate therapy: Any ICD therapy that is not due to a ventricular&#xD;
                tachycarrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ischemic left ventricular dysfunction: The systolic dysfunction due to a previous&#xD;
                coronary artery disease with myocardial necrosis with previous demonstration of at&#xD;
                least one obstructed epicardial coronary artery, and presence of ischemic scar in&#xD;
                MRI with characteristic distribution of late-enhancement of gadolinium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study population: Unselected patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction and who&#xD;
           have an LVEF equal to or less than 40% (determined by transthoracic echocardiography) on&#xD;
           the fourth day after the event.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample size calculation: Study aims to include around 200 AMI patients. Sample size has&#xD;
           been estimated for a confidence level of 95%, defined by a coefficient Za = 1.96 and&#xD;
           taking into account a prevalence (p) of NSVT (&lt; 5 episodes in 6 months) of 15% and a&#xD;
           precision level (d) of 5%. According to the following formula, in which q = 1-p:&#xD;
&#xD;
           n = Z2 * a * p * q / d2 n = 3.84 * 0.15 * 0.85 / 0.0025 = 196 patients to be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Epidemiological and basic clinical data of all the patients hospitalized in the&#xD;
                participating hospitals after an episode of AMI will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients accomplishing inclusion and exclusion criteria will be submitted to&#xD;
                continuous electrocardiographic monitoring until medical discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Before discharge a cMRI (days 6-10 after AMI) will be performed and after an ILR&#xD;
                will be implanted.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Following medical discharge, enrolled patients will daily transmit the device&#xD;
                register, which will be analyzed by specialized personnel. An intervention will&#xD;
                take place if any arrhythmic event is registered following the current&#xD;
                recommendations of scientific society.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients will be reevaluated 6 months after the coronary revascularization&#xD;
                performed during hospitalization. This clinical evaluation will include, at least,&#xD;
                the clinical and functional status (NYHA scale), pharmacological treatment and LVEF&#xD;
                determination by echocardiography. Besides, ILR will be explanted to cMRI&#xD;
                acquisition. If the patient fulfills current criteria of the European Society of&#xD;
                Cardiology according to LVEF criteria, an ICD will be then implanted without&#xD;
                resynchronization therapy. If the patient does not fulfill ICD criteria, ILR&#xD;
                monitoring will continue for 18 months more (2 years after the AMI event). Periodic&#xD;
                clinical checkup will take place according to the protocols specified by our&#xD;
                center. According to the scientific evidence, 5-10% of subjects with LVEF &lt;40% in&#xD;
                the first week post revascularizated AMI will recover part of the ventricular&#xD;
                function, falling outside of ICD implantation criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients will be followed-up during the first 2 years after the AMI. Periodic&#xD;
                checkups will be programmed according to the protocols of our center. ICD and ILR&#xD;
                implanted patients will daily transmit the device register that will be weekly&#xD;
                reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  After the 2 years follow-up, the ILR, in those patients without an ILR, will be&#xD;
                explanted and a cMRI will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ICD programming:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Detection and therapy programming will be standardized and included two zones:&#xD;
           Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) (Cycle Length [CL] &lt; 250 ms) and Ventricular Tachycardia&#xD;
           Zone 1 (CL from 250 to 320 ms). In both cases tachycardia detection will require that 30&#xD;
           of the last 40 R-R intervals had to have a CL bellow the cutoff point. Episodes&#xD;
           classified as VF will receive a sequence of high-energy shocks. Otherwise, episodes&#xD;
           detected in Ventricular Tachycardia Zone 1 will be initially treated by a single ATP&#xD;
           sequence (an 8-pulse-burst train at 88%). Failed ATP will be followed by shock and then&#xD;
           other shocks as necessary. An additional monitoring zone (Ventricular Tachycardia Zone&#xD;
           2) will be programmed for episodes with a CL from 321 to 400 ms. All devices will be&#xD;
           programmed to store the far-field electrograms before the onset of the episodes detected&#xD;
           to aid in rhythm classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
           MRI protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients will undergo contrast-enhanced MRI with a 1.5-T or 3 T scanner. All images&#xD;
           will be obtained with electrocardiographic gating and breath-holding. The MRI study will&#xD;
           consist of cine steady-state free precession imaging of left ventricular function and&#xD;
           late enhancement imaging of myocardial scar tissue. Late Enhancement images will be&#xD;
           obtained 10 to 15 min after an injection of 0.2 mmol/kg of gadodiamide. Late-enhanced&#xD;
           images will be used for infarct characterization. Infarct and heterogeneous tissue&#xD;
           (i.e., gray zone) mass will be quantified by 2 methods: 1) the full width at half&#xD;
           maximum; and 2) on the basis of Standard Deviations (SD) of the signal intensity from&#xD;
           the remote mean healthy myocardium (&gt;2SDs defined the total infarct mass,&gt;3SDs the core&#xD;
           infarct and HT between 2 and 3 SDs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Data collection and statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
           No personal data will be collected or processed without prior formal authorization. Once&#xD;
           informed consent has been signed, data will be collected, stored and managed according&#xD;
           to current local, national and EU legislation on this matter. In particular, the&#xD;
           Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection&#xD;
           of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free&#xD;
           movement of such data will be carefully fulfilled. Any further ethical issue that may&#xD;
           arise within the project will be properly consulted and addressed by participating&#xD;
           entities.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
                     o Data: day and hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     o Number of beats.&#xD;

&#xD;
                  -  LVEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Extension of scar.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Extension of dense scar.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Extension of heterogeneous tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Statistical analysis will be performed using the SPSS programme 11.0 or further.&#xD;
                Normal and continuous variables will be described by means and standard deviations,&#xD;
                whereas categorical variables will be summarized by the number of patients and&#xD;
                percentages. Comparison of the categorical variables will be performed with the&#xD;
                Chi-square test (or Fisher's exact test if n&lt;5). Comparison of 2 normal variables&#xD;
                (determined with the Kolgomorov-Smirnov test) and continuous variables will be done&#xD;
                with Student's t test. Comparison of &gt;2 continuous variables will be performed&#xD;
                using the ANOVA test. Multivariate analysis will be accomplished by a logistic&#xD;
                regression or Cox regression tests. To determine the individual mean of proportions&#xD;
                adjusted per multiple episodes per patient, the Generalized Estimating Equations&#xD;
                Method will be used in the calculations and comparisons. A p value &lt;0.05 will be&#xD;
                considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Machine learning and Deep learning:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Due to the great amount of data to be collected by the ILR during the first 6&#xD;
                months after an AMI and by the ICD/ILR up to 2 years following the AMI, a Machine&#xD;
                Learning analysis will be also performed to determine the association between the&#xD;
                incidence, burden and temporal distribution of NSVTs registered by ILRs with the&#xD;
                occurrence of ICD appropriate therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Machine Learning techniques to be used will consist in supervised since the&#xD;
                response variable is identified. The usual algorithms (random forest, xgboost, SVM,&#xD;
                etc.) will be combined in order to find the balance between bias and variance,&#xD;
                avoiding overfitting the available data, so that the model can be successfully&#xD;
                generalized to further populations. In cases where the response variable is&#xD;
                represented by a few cases, we will use subsampling and oversampling techniques&#xD;
                such as bagging balance. All the Machine Learning analysis will be carried out&#xD;
                using the Python programming language and libraries like scikit-learn, which&#xD;
                include proper algorithms and techniques for the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Project will also acquire 2/3 cMRI of ICD/ILR implanted patients. Together with the&#xD;
                abovementioned statistical analysis, cMRI images will be analyzed by deep learning&#xD;
                (neural networks) in order to detect any possible pattern and their evolution. Raw&#xD;
                images could be a reliable predictor of patient's evolution. For the implementation&#xD;
                of deep learning techniques Keras and TensorFlow programs will be used.&#xD;
