      This study is set up as a phase I-II prospective, single center, interventional pilot study&#xD;
      carried in Office setting under local anesthesia. It will assess the impact in quality of&#xD;
      life and adverse events produced by transperineal laser ablation of the prostate (TPLA) in&#xD;
      men 40 to 85 years of age with benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      BPH is currently managed with medications (ie, alpha-1 adrenergic medications) and/or&#xD;
      invasive approaches such as transurethral resection of prostate or surgical excision of&#xD;
      prostate - robotic or open lead to relaxation or excision of the bladder neck. Such&#xD;
      alteration of the bladder neck function or anatomy portends a significant and noticeable&#xD;
      change on a male lifestyle, represented by absence of antegrade ejaculation among others.&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the use of TPLA in the office setting under local anesthesia -&#xD;
      greatly decreasing patient perioperative surgical risk. Moreover, it aims to determine safety&#xD;
      profile and outcomes from TPLA therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fundamental objective is to determine the feasibility and safety of TPLA in healthy men&#xD;
      with LUTS due to BPH, successful performed in the outpatient office-based setting under local&#xD;
      anesthesia. Secondary objectives include: 1-Uroflowmetry and Patient Reported Outcome&#xD;
      Measures (PROMs) at three, six and 12 months; 2-Immediately spontaneous voiding post-TPLA;&#xD;
      3-Hematuria incidence after TPLA, measured by patient reporting; 4-LUTS after the treatment&#xD;
      measured by IPSS; 5- Erectile function and presence of ejaculation after TPLA treatment and&#xD;
      6-Prostate volume changes using Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) volume measurements&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Echolaser system (ELS - Elesta SpA. 50041, Calenzano (FI), Italy ), which consists of&#xD;
      Echolaser X4 plus Echolaser Smart Interface is a new device for minimal invasive procedures.&#xD;
      The system induces tissue coagulation thru a continuous 1064 nm laser wave. Light tissue&#xD;
      interaction is reliable, reproducible, and safe. The laser fiber tip induces necrosis near&#xD;
      the tip and coagulative effects deeper in tissues thru heat ablation. The body cleans up&#xD;
      treated tissue over time. Much experience is gained with laser application in different&#xD;
      organs. A preliminary study conducted in Europe by the investigators showed promising results&#xD;
      (1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 4 out 5 men experience bothersome alterations in their voiding pattern. This pervasive&#xD;
      condition usually begins in the 5th decade of life. These patients usually express complaints&#xD;
      of Urinary urgency, frequency and nocturia as the sensation of incomplete voiding and&#xD;
      decrease in the force of stream leading to stranguria. Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) is&#xD;
      the common term that represents constellation of these symptoms, most triggered by prostate&#xD;
      enlargement, commonly referred as Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). Today management of BPH&#xD;
      may call for medications such as alpha-blockers, 5 alpha reductase inhibitors,&#xD;
      phosphodiesterase inhibitors or combination of them. In addition, there surgical approaches&#xD;
      to improve BPH, they are based on cytodestruction or excision of prostate tissue. These&#xD;
      surgical approaches range from office based minimally invasive to hospital based robotically&#xD;
      conducted. Office based minimally invasive approaches are favored by patients given their&#xD;
      low-risk nature, safety profile and avoidance of general or spinal anesthesia. Furthermore,&#xD;
      minimally invasive approaches aim to preserve the bladder neck, this avoids alterations in&#xD;
      sexual function such as retrograde ejaculation. Excision or resection of the bladder neck is&#xD;
      a major step of definitive invasive approaches such as transurethral resection of prostate or&#xD;
      surgical excision of prostate - robotic or open. Bladder neck resection portends a&#xD;
      significant and noticeable change on a male lifestyle, represented by absence of antegrade&#xD;
      ejaculation. This is a tradeoff that evokes hesitation in many men to resolve their BPH.&#xD;
      Minimally invasive procedures have emerged aiming to relieve BPH without sacrificing the&#xD;
      bladder neck. They carry two major advantages: preservation of ejaculation and absence of&#xD;
      major anesthesia requirements, thus amenable to office setting execution. The latter provides&#xD;
      significant saving to the health system and decreases post-operatory risks of adverse events&#xD;
      in a not insignificant manner. The fundamental question raised to minimal invasive procedures&#xD;
      relates to degree of subjective and objective response, durability of BPH relief, ability to&#xD;
      wean off from medications and impact on quality of life, from a two domain - urinary and&#xD;
      sexual perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ELS is a novel disruptive approach that allows a transperineal approach and provides for&#xD;
      a safe and simultaneous multiple laser fiber energy delivery that translated in expediency&#xD;
      and decreased procedure times. ELS has been safely conducted in men with BPH in the&#xD;
      ambulatory setting, as a procedure called SoracteLiteTM transperineal laser ablation (TPLA),&#xD;
      performed in men with LUTS due to BPH that were suboptimal candidates for surgery, they&#xD;
      exhibited good tolerability with minimal adverse event profiles. To the investigators&#xD;
      knowledge, there is no data or evaluation of its safety profile if/when conducted in an&#xD;
      office setting under local anesthesia. Therefore, in this study the investigators aim to&#xD;
      assess efficacy, tolerability, response and safety profile of SoracteLite™ TPLA conducted in&#xD;
      men with LUTS due to BPH in the office setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective of this study is to assess efficacy, tolerability, short&#xD;
      term response and safety profile of SoracteLite™ TPLA for LUTS due to BPH in healthy men. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives are to evaluate quality of life changes in erectile and sexual function&#xD;
      as the well as imaging volumetric changes in prostate size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This study is set up as prospective, single center, interventional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The study will be offered to men ≥ 40 years of age, with moderate or severe&#xD;
      international prostate symptoms scores and concomitant objective decrease in flow studies of&#xD;
      at 30% consistent with bladder outlet obstruction (Qmax of 5 - 15 mL/sec, Elevated voiding&#xD;
      pressures consistent with bladder outlet obstruction) Study Intervention Upon meeting&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria, subjects will undergo prostate transperineal laser ablation&#xD;
      planning and execution under local anesthesia using the ELS. Planning and execution will aim&#xD;
      to destroy the prostate adenoma or transitional-anterior zones while sparing critical&#xD;
      structures such as the urethra, neurovascular bundles, and bladder neck. The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate between one and four laser fibers would be placed in the prostate to induce the&#xD;
      laser coagulative necrosis required to achieve desired response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Fundamental study parameters are efficacy and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be measured in changes- improvement in IPSS score and uroflowmetry parameter as&#xD;
      Qmax and Post void volume profile of the procedures measured by successfully completed&#xD;
      SoracteLiteTM TPLA procedures. For safety, the main study parameter is the number of grade 3&#xD;
      or worse adverse events based on the CTCAE v5.0 within 30 days post procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: The risks for participation in this study are related to the SoracteLiteTM TPLA&#xD;
      procedure. Laser fibers are introduced in the prostate by needles and these could injure and&#xD;
      damage surrounding tissues. For example, plausibly, perforation of the urethra could lead to&#xD;
      hematuria, clot retention and urinary tract infections. The laser energy delivery could&#xD;
      damage vessels and nerves evoking erection changes, even loss. Thermal injuries from the&#xD;
      laser could lead to communication with rectum leading to infections and fistulas.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the prostatic tissue may become quite edematous triggering urinary retention&#xD;
      that would require an indwelling catheter for several days or the weeks and may even trigger&#xD;
      a need for of transurethral resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Granted, several precaution actions will be undertaken to reduce the patients' risk, such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients will be instructed to self-administer a fleet enema, the evening before and&#xD;
           morning of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The procedure will be performed under local anesthesia; thus, patient will be awake and&#xD;
           able to provide feedback while it takes placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Single dose intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis with either cefuroxime or gentamicin will&#xD;
           be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Echolaser Smart Interface will be used for the planning of the treatment taking care of&#xD;
           the safety distance in longitudinal and transversal US planes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The laser fibers will be placed following the plan under live co-registered ultrasound&#xD;
           guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Laser ablation will be monitored in real time and restricted to the safety margins&#xD;
           established on the plans, thus other critical anatomic areas will be spared.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Patients will be transferred to a recovery room and be discharge when subjectively they&#xD;
           feel better and objectively have stable vital signs and full respiratory, cardiac,&#xD;
           neurological and musculoskeletal capacities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following represent advantages of SoracteLiteTM TPLA: minimal invasive procedure;&#xD;
      performance under local anesthesia; the intent is to treat transition-anterior zone, so&#xD;
      called surgical capsule; urethral sparring, preservation of bladder neck and antegrade&#xD;
      ejaculation, limited to absent need of indwelling catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to streamline the follow up following standard of care. Patients will&#xD;
      be instructed to call if they perceive any adverse event. Patients will be contacted 30 days&#xD;
      after procedure and an adverse event questionnaire will be administered. Subjective quality&#xD;
      of life survey instruments will be administered 6 weeks and 3, 6 and 12 months from procedure&#xD;
      date. Flow and volumetric studies will be conducted 3 months from procedure date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Conclusion, SoracteLiteTM TPLA will expose patients to intervention risks. However, is the&#xD;
      investigators estimation and bias these will be favorable or equal to those observed with&#xD;
      compared available standard minimal invasive treatment approaches. The burden is in our&#xD;
      opinion acceptable.&#xD;
