      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical study.&#xD;
      Target population is patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer who had not received&#xD;
      systemic chemotherapy. Study objective is to compare the efficacy and safety of Camrelizumab&#xD;
      + carboplatin/cisplatin + pemetrexed /paclitaxel / albumin paclitaxel ± SRT/WBRT with placebo&#xD;
      + carboplatin/cisplatin + pemetrexed /paclitaxel / albumin paclitaxel ± SRT/WBRT.&#xD;

      Detailed Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, eligible subject will be randomized into study arm or control arm to accept&#xD;
      study treatment. Paticipant was confirmed without EGFR activating mutation or ALK fusion and&#xD;
      received no prior systemic therapy. Patients would receive Camrelizumab/placebo in&#xD;
      combination with chemotherapy for 4-6 cycles，non-squamous subject followed by&#xD;
      Camrelizumab/placebo + pemetrexed as maintenance treatment until progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, squamous subject followed by Camrelizumab/placebo as maintenance treatment until&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity, Camrelizumab/placebo for a maximum of 2 years.&#xD;
