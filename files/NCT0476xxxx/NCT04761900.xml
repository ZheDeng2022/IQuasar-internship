  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, a consensus was proposed by an international expert panel for the terminology&#xD;
      changed from NAFLD to Metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). The comprehensive&#xD;
      criteria shift to a &quot;positive&quot; diagnosis. It helps to increase patient awareness and&#xD;
      understanding of fatty liver (FL), for who has high-risk metabolic dysfunction. However, a&#xD;
      more simplified and easily applicable definition is needed. It will have an impact on&#xD;
      clinical practice, especially in developing countries.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver diseases.&#xD;
      It affects nearly 25% of the global population. Recently, a consensus was proposed by an&#xD;
      international expert panel for the terminology changed from NAFLD to Metabolic associated&#xD;
      fatty liver disease (MAFLD). The comprehensive criteria shift to a &quot;positive&quot; diagnosis. It&#xD;
      helps to increase patient awareness and understanding of fatty liver (FL), for who has&#xD;
      high-risk metabolic dysfunction. However, a more simplified and easily applicable definition&#xD;
      is needed. It will have an impact on clinical practice, especially in developing countries.&#xD;
      It may provide a better understanding of MAFLD, and optimize strategies for prevention of&#xD;
      extrahepatic complications in clinical practice.&#xD;

    <description>We performed the cohort analysis for the outcome of T2DM. T2DM was defined as the presence of any of the following conditions based on the American Diabetes Association criteria: FPG ≥126 mg/dL, HbA1c ≥6.5%; or self-reported clinician-diagnosed T2DM.</description>

    <measure>Comparison of different groups in MAFLD and MAFLD-simplified definition for the outcome of hypertension</measure>
    <time_frame>7 years in a cohort study</time_frame>
    <description>We performed the cohort analysis for the outcome of hypertension. Hypertension was defined as the presence of any of the following conditions based on Revised Chinese Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Hypertension in 2018: a clinic systolic BP ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg without the use of anti-hypertensive medications, or self-reported clinician-diagnosed hypertension.</description>

    <time_frame>7 years in a cohort study</time_frame>
    <description>We performed the cohort analysis for the outcome of carotid atherosclerotic plaque.&#xD;
Carotid atherosclerotic plaque was assessed by recording ultrasonographic images of the right carotid artery according to Mannheim Intima-Media Thickness Consensus.</description>
