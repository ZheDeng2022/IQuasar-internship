  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coughing affects almost all individuals with ILD leading to physical, psychological and&#xD;
      social distress and prevents individuals from performing their activities of daily living,&#xD;
      working or socialising in public places. Unfortunately, there are no licensed medications&#xD;
      available to treat chronic cough and the few drugs that have been tried resulted in little&#xD;
      efficacy and significant side effects. Drug-free cough control interventions have shown&#xD;
      promise in reducing the severity and impact of coughing on patients' lives but have not been&#xD;
      tested in individuals with ILD. This study aims to explore the feasibility and effectiveness&#xD;
      of a non-pharmacological cough control therapy, as an adjuvant of pulmonary rehabilitation,&#xD;
      in patients with ILD and chronic cough (&gt;8 weeks in duration).&#xD;

      Research questions and hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Is a non-pharmacological cough control therapy feasible to treat chronic cough in patients&#xD;
      with ILD? Hypothesis: Given the results of previous non-pharmacological interventions in&#xD;
      patients with refractory cough, we predict that this intervention will be feasible and well&#xD;
      accepted in patients with ILD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) Is a non-pharmacological cough control therapy more effective than pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation (PR) alone to treat chronic cough in patients with ILD? Hypotheses: Given the&#xD;
      results of previous non-pharmacological interventions in patients with refractory cough, we&#xD;
      predict that improvements observed in participants receiving the non-pharmacological&#xD;
      intervention will exceed those receiving PR alone. Improvements are expected in HRQOL&#xD;
      (exceeding the minimal clinically important difference), intensity of cough-related&#xD;
      sensations and symptoms of fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design The proposed research is a feasibility pre-post intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study details:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults with ILD and chronic cough will be enrolled in this study. Potential eligible patients&#xD;
      will be recruited from the outpatient PR program at West Park Healthcare Centre and St.&#xD;
      Joseph's Healthcare. As the outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program at West Park&#xD;
      Healthcare Center and St. Joseph's Healthcare will transition partially to virtual meetings,&#xD;
      the interactions between the research team and patients will be completed via phone calls or&#xD;
      online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study will be delivered online using the Zoom Healthcare Plan, an online&#xD;
      platform that is available at West Park Healthcare Centre, and is used for telerehabilitation&#xD;
      programs. Participants will be enrolled into a PR program composed of aerobic and&#xD;
      strengthening exercises, disease-specific education and self-management, as part of their&#xD;
      usual care. Two weeks before termination of PR, participants will start the&#xD;
      non-pharmacological cough control therapy, following the intervention proposed by Chamberlain&#xD;
      colleagues (2017). Participants will attend four virtual sessions of 45 to 60 minutes of&#xD;
      educational and self-management&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will measure several clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Feasibility will be reflected by the number of eligible patients enrolling (enrolment&#xD;
           rate of at least 75%) and completing the intervention (attendance rate of at least 80%),&#xD;
           compliance with the sessions and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Leicester cough questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The King's Brief Interstitial Lung Disease (KBILD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Modified Borg scale (mBorg&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Cough Hypersensitivity Questionnaire (CHQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale (FACIT-F)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Global rating of change questionnaire (GRCQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Satisfaction Semi-structured interviews using open-ended questions will be conducted&#xD;
           before and after the cough control intervention to capture participants' expectations&#xD;
           and perspectives about the cough control therapy.&#xD;

    <description>The LCQ is a validated 19-item cough-specific HRQoL questionnaire. It is divided into 3 domains (physical, social and psychological) and the overall score range from 3 to 21, with a higher score indicating a better cough related HRQOL.</description>

    <measure>The King's Brief Interstitial Lung Disease (KBILD)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, average 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The KBILD is a self-completed health status questionnaire that comprises of 15 items with the following three domains: psychological, breathlessness and activities and chest symptoms. Total score ranges from 0 to 100; 100 representing the best health status. This KBILD has an established minimal clinically important difference of 5-points in people with ILD.</description>

    <time_frame>through study completion, average 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Borg scale is widely used to assess the intensity of dyspnoea in individuals with chronic respiratory diseases and has recently been successfully adopted to assess the urge to cough and severity of cough in this population. The mBorg is measured on a 10 point scale; with 0 as feelings of &quot;nothing at all&quot; (no signs of dyspnoea) to 10 as &quot;very very hard&quot; intensity of dyspnoea.</description>

    <time_frame>through study completion, average 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of triggers and laryngeal symptoms associated with cough were recorded using a standardized novel questionnaire, the CHQ. The CHQ comprises 23 items related to cough triggers, urge and laryngeal sensations associated with cough.</description>

    <measure>Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale (FACIT-F)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, average 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The FACIT-F is, a multi-dimensional 13-item questionnaire assessing tiredness, weakness and difficulty in handling daily living activities due to fatigue, over the previous 7 days. Participants are asked to rate their level of fatigue on a 4-point scale, where 0-not very much to 4- very much so. The sum of these values will provide a FACIT-F score ranging 0 to 52 (less fatigue to most fatigue).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global rating of change questionnaire (GRCQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, average 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The GRCQ is a 15-point scale widely used to determine the participants' and health. professionals' perceptions about cough changes after interventions. Participants will be asked to rate global changes in cough in a scale ranging from -7 (a great deal worse) to +7 (a great deal better).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction of cough therapy program</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, average 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' satisfaction and perceived benefits will be evaluated following completion of the intervention participants with a 9-item survey previously used to assess interventions in chronic respiratory diseases. The survey asks participants to report their level of agreement with statements on enjoyment and perceived improvements/benefits according to a 5-point Likert type scale (1=strongly agree; 5=strongly disagree).</description>
