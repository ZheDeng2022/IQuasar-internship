  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      WHO recommends that Therapeutic Efficacy Studies (TES) for 1st and 2nd line antimalarial&#xD;
      medicines should be routinely carried out and data made available for decision-making due to&#xD;
      the threat of emergence and spread of artemisinin resistance in malaria-endemic countries,&#xD;
      especially in Africa. In line with this WHO recommendation, Rwanda Ministry of Health (MOH)&#xD;
      is conducting the TES to determine the efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine (ALN), which has&#xD;
      been used in Rwanda for the last 14 years) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ),&#xD;
      another WHO-approved drug for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria which, though, has not&#xD;
      been used in Rwanda, is being considered for adoption as a second line or alternative first&#xD;
      line treatment. The objective of this study is to inform the decisions or actions made by a&#xD;
      public health authority (Rwanda Rwanda Ministry of Health) to inform decision on revision of&#xD;
      the antimalarial guidelines and policy in Rwanda. Jhpiego's Impact Malaria project in Rwanda,&#xD;
      with funding and technical oversight from US President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) through&#xD;
      USAID and CDC, will support the Rwanda MOH in its effort to evaluate the efficacy of ALN and&#xD;
      DHA-PPQ in the treatment of children with uncomplicated malaria. The study is being conducted&#xD;
      by Rwanda MOH, with technical support and funding by PMI-USAID through Jhpiego in Rwanda.&#xD;

      WHO recommends that Therapeutic Efficacy Studies (TES) for 1st and 2nd line antimalarial&#xD;
      medicines should be routinely carried out and data made available for decision-making due to&#xD;
      the threat of emergence and spread of artemisinin resistance in malaria-endemic countries,&#xD;
      especially in Africa. The Rwandan Ministry of Health (MOH) in 2006 adopted WHO-approved&#xD;
      artemether-lumefantrine (ALN) as the first-line drug for the treatment of uncomplicated&#xD;
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria. A clinical trial carried out in 2004-2005 in Rwanda showed&#xD;
      that ALN was very efficacious in children although efficacy varied in different parts of the&#xD;
      country. ALN efficacy was shown to remain high in TES conducted in 2012-2015 and in 2018.&#xD;
      However, both studies found a molecular marker of parasite resistance to artemisinin&#xD;
      (included delayed parasite clearance associated with artemisinin resistance in one site in&#xD;
      2018) and both studies also found high prevalence of markers associated with tolerance to&#xD;
      lumefantrine. The clinical efficacy of ALN therefore needs to be regularly monitored in&#xD;
      Rwanda to ensure this first line treatment is still efficacious. Given the detection of&#xD;
      antimalarial resistance markers in recent TES, it is also important for Rwanda MOH to&#xD;
      determine the efficacy an additional ACT that could be considered for adoption as a second&#xD;
      line or alternative first line treatment. This study will monitor the efficacy of ALN (which&#xD;
      has been used in Rwanda for the last 14 years) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ),&#xD;
      another WHO-approved ACT for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria which has not been used&#xD;
      in Rwanda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In line with the WHO recommendation, Jhpiego Impact Malaria project in Rwanda, with funding&#xD;
      and technical oversight from US President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) through USAID and CDC,&#xD;
      will be supporting the Rwanda MOH Malaria and Other Parasitic Diseases Unit (MOPDD) of the&#xD;
      Rwanda Biomedical Center (RBC) to conduct a TES to monitor the efficacy of ALN and DHA-PPQ in&#xD;
      children with uncomplicated clinical malaria in rural Rwanda. The study is being conducted by&#xD;
      Rwanda MOH MOPDD, with technical support and funding by PMI-USAID through the Jhpiego Impact&#xD;
      Malaria project in Rwanda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine (ALN) and&#xD;
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ) in children with uncomplicated clinical malaria in&#xD;
      rural Rwanda&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Sites: The study will be conducted in three sentinel sites - Rukara, Bugarama and&#xD;
      Masaka rural health centers- where antimalaria efficacy studies are always carried out in&#xD;
      Rwanda because of the intensity of malaria transmission. Different levels of artemisinin&#xD;
      resistance have been identified in two of these three (Rukara and Bugarama) in previous&#xD;
      studies. At each site, there will be two arms: one for ALN and one for DHA-PPQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: The study will be a two-arm, open-label trial in which patients (children aged&#xD;
      6 months to 59 months) with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria will be treated with&#xD;
      supervised doses of ALN or DHA-PPQ. Children will be followed for 28 days after treatment for&#xD;
      ALN and 42 days after DHA-PPQ. Data on molecular markers of artemisinin resistance will be&#xD;
      collected at all sites. The study will be conducted at three sites in Rwanda with&#xD;
      historically different efficacy profiles to antimalarials, including ACTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the clinical and parasitological cure by day 28 (ALN) and day 42&#xD;
      (DHA-PPQ) post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Period: March 2021 to October 2022&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: At each site, 88 patients per treatment arm (allowing for 20% loss to follow-up)&#xD;
      would be enrolled. In total, we will enrol 528 patients in our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment(s) and follow-up: All children enrolled in the study will be admitted to a health&#xD;
      centre for three days to ensure adherence to treatment regimen, and detect possible adverse&#xD;
      events. Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 28-day follow-up&#xD;
      period to evaluate ALN efficacy, and over a 42-day follow-up period to evaluate DHA-PPQ&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory endpoints: to characterize molecular markers of artemisinin and partner drug&#xD;
      resistance in all three sites and the clinical (parasite clearance) and in vitro phenotypes&#xD;
      of resistance in two of the three study sites: Rukara and Masaka.&#xD;
