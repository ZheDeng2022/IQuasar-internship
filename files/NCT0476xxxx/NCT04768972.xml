  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of ION363 on clinical&#xD;
      function and survival in carriers of fused in sarcoma mutations with amyotrophic lateral&#xD;
      sclerosis (FUS-ALS).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, two-part study of ION363 in up to 64 participants. Part 1 will&#xD;
      consist of participants that will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive a multi-dose&#xD;
      regimen of ION363 or placebo for a period of 29 weeks, followed by Part 2, which will be an&#xD;
      open-label period where all participants will receive ION363 for a period of 77 weeks.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 225 in Part 1</time_frame>
    <description>Functional impairment to be measured by joint rank analysis of the combined assessment of: In-clinic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) Total Score, time of rescue or discontinuation from Part 1 and entering Part 2 due to a deterioration in function, and Ventilation Assistance-free survival (VAFS).&quot; ALSFRS-R measures functional disease severity. The scale measures four functional domains, bulbar function, gross motor skills, fine motor skills, and respiratory. The assessment will contain 12 questions scored from 0 (no function) to 4 (full function), with a total possible score of 48, which will indicate the highest level of function. ALSFRS-R will be a part of the combined assessment of joint rank analysis to assess efficacy in Part 1.</description>

    <description>The ALSSQOL-R is a disease-specific 50-item assessment that measures the quality of life (QoL). Each item will be rated by the participant on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being the least desirable situation and 10 being the most desirable.</description>
