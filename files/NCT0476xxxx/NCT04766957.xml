    <measure>To evaluate the effect of Idracare® gel using Bachmann Vaginal Health Index (BVHI).</measure>
    <time_frame>4 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Effect of Idracare® gel will be evaluated on vaginal health status using Bachmann Vaginal Health Index (BVHI). It consists of 5 domains that evaluate different parameters (elasticity, fluids, pH, epithelial integrity and moisture) scoring each one of them independently, considering the maximum score as the best vaginal health status.</description>

    <measure>To evaluate the effect of Idracare® gel using vulvar health index (VHI).</measure>
    <time_frame>4 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Effect of Idracare® gel will be evaluated on vaginal health status using vulvar health index (VHI). It consists of 8 domains that evaluate different parameters: physiological state of the labia majora, labia minora, clitoris, urethra, coloration, elasticity / introitus, discomfort / pain and other findings) scoring each of them independently, considering the maximum score as the worse in vulvar health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>To evaluate the effect of Idracare® gel using vaginal pH</measure>
    <time_frame>4 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Effect of Idracare® gel will be evaluated on vaginal health status using vaginal pH changes. A lower pH compared to basal is considered an improvement on vaginal health status.</description>

    <measure>To evaluate the effect of Idracare® gel using maturation of vaginal epithelial cells.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Effect of Idracare® gel will be evaluated on vaginal health status using Maturation Index (MI). MI is the most commonly used index to assess hormonal status. It evaluates the percentage composition of the three large types of cells that make up the vaginal epithelium in the cytological samples obtained: parabasal, intermediate and superficial. It consists of selecting five fields at random (x 10 magnification) and counting 100 epithelial cells in each area, determining the percentage of superficial, intermediate and parabasal cells in each area. The result is expressed as% parabasal cells:% intermediate cells (navicular):% superficial cells.</description>

    <measure>To evaluate the effect of Idracare® gel using vaginal microbiota.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Effect of Idracare® gel will be evaluated on vaginal health status using vaginal Dysbiosis test. It consists of analyzing by means of real time polymerase chain reaction (real time PCR) different microorganisms that are part of the vaginal ecosystem such as Lactobacillus species (L. crispatus, L. jensenii, L. iners, L. gasseri ), Candida species, lactic acid microbiota (Atopobium, Gardnerella), non-lactic acid microbiota and pathogens.</description>
