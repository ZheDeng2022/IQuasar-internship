  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, observational, non-interventional, multicenter, open-label,&#xD;
      single arm study in patients being treated for nAMD with brolucizumab in Portugal.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Naïve and pre-treated patients will be included after decision to start treatment with&#xD;
      brolucizumab and consent is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline visit will be used to assess eligibility and collect baseline characteristics&#xD;
      information. The study eye will be defined as the first eye treated during the study; the&#xD;
      other eye will be considered as fellow eye. If both eyes are treated at baseline, the eye&#xD;
      with the worse visual acuity will be chosen as the study eye (if the visual acuity is&#xD;
      measured equal, the treating ophthalmologist defines the study eye upon his discretion). The&#xD;
      follow-up visits will take place at a frequency defined as per investigator's discretion.&#xD;
      Patients that have not received an intravitreal anti-VEGF injection or visited an eye&#xD;
      specialist for at least 6 months will be discontinued from the observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective data will be collected for switch patients starting treatment with brolucizumab&#xD;
      for up to six months before baseline. Patients, already being treated with brolucizumab may&#xD;
      also be included. Here, retrospective data will be collected since the first brolucizumab&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
