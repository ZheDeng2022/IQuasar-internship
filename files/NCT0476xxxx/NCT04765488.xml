      Inhalation anesthesia is the most frequently used technique and is performed in around 70% of&#xD;
      surgeries worldwide. Sevoflurane is the most frequently used halogenated anesthetic and is&#xD;
      used in 2/3 of the cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anesthetic strength of inhalation agents was established in the classic work of Eger and&#xD;
      colleagues who determined the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of an inhaled anesthetic&#xD;
      at atmospheric pressure, necessary to prevent a motor reaction in response to a pain stimulus&#xD;
      in 50% of patients. Since alveolar concentrations of inhaled anesthetics correspond to their&#xD;
      concentrations in other organs after equilibrium, which is most quickly achieved in organs&#xD;
      with rich perfusion, such as the brain and heart, MAC is an analogue of the plasma EC50&#xD;
      (concentration effective at 50%) for intravenous anesthetics. 1 MAC of sevoflurane is equal&#xD;
      to an end-tidal concentration of 2.0 volume percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Agitation is a frequent anesthesia complications and it not only lengthens the period of post&#xD;
      anesthetic awakening and need for advance monitoring of the patient, but may be a&#xD;
      predisposing factor in the development of postoperative delirium (POD) and postoperative&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunction (POCD) which are independent predictors of increased mortality,&#xD;
      prolonged treatment in the ICU and hospital, and prolonged social adaptation of the operated&#xD;
      patients.(The ability of the patient to serve themselves independently.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the fact that attempts to reduce the risk of postoperative neurological complications&#xD;
      have been made repeatedly, the frequency of occurrence of agitation in the early post&#xD;
      operative period in adult patients is up to 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some authors drew attention to the need to comply with the basic requirements for the safety&#xD;
      of anesthesia: continuity and adequacy of anesthesia, and avoidance of excessively deep or&#xD;
      too superficial level of anesthesia. Other authors consider it suitable to use midazolam,&#xD;
      propofol, opioid and non-opioid analgesics in case of agitation. Magnesium and calcium&#xD;
      chloride were also tested to stop the described phenomenon, but their beneficial effects were&#xD;
      not confirmed in subsequent investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a fairly popular point of view that there is no specific prophylaxis or treatment of&#xD;
      postoperative agitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, a variant of anesthesia induction with sevoflurane was recently proposed, which&#xD;
      reduced the frequency of agitation in children from 24.7% to 4.4%. The technique consisted in&#xD;
      interrupting anesthesia at the moment of loss of consciousness, awakening the patient and&#xD;
      subsequently performing re-induction. Since this technique might be time consuming in the&#xD;
      busiest period of a surgical theatre and not safe if performed with the airways still&#xD;
      unsecured it is advisable to shift the Wash In/Wash Out procedure to the stage of awakening&#xD;
      at the end of surgery. The authors also have occasionally experienced high quality awakenings&#xD;
      in patients who received this technique, without side effects or patients' discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective for the multicentral OPERA Trial will be to explore the&#xD;
      effect of the &quot;Wash In / WashOut&quot; procedure at the end of the operation on the incidence of&#xD;
      post-anesthetic agitation, delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery under general inhalation anesthesia will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A group of patients in relation to whom will be applied the traditional method of&#xD;
           recovery from anesthesia. In this group during the period of awakening, the supply of&#xD;
           sevoflurane will be stopped and the patient will be extubated after recovery of muscle&#xD;
           tone, spontaneous breathing and consciousness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigating group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A group of patients in relation to whom the &quot;Wash In / WashOut&quot; procedure will be&#xD;
           applied. In this group the supply of sevoflurane will be stopped to the first signs of&#xD;
           awakening and record the level of sevoflurane , then the supply of sevoflurane will be&#xD;
           resumed to the end-tidal concentration of 1 MAC maintain the anesthesia for 5 min and&#xD;
           stop the supply of sevoflurane to the first signs of awakening again, then the supply of&#xD;
           sevoflurane will be resumed to the end-tidal concentration of 1 MAC maintain the&#xD;
           anesthesia for 5 min and finally ( the third time) stop supplying sevoflurane and&#xD;
           extubate patient after recovery of muscle tone, spontaneous breathing and consciousness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Perioperative and anesthetic management&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative monitoring will include continuous assessment of hemodynamic parameters (NIBP,&#xD;
      ECG), SpO2, analysis of expiratory gases (CO2, O2, sevoflurane), ABB analysis of arterial or&#xD;
      mixed venous blood(for patients (from both group)whose monitoring indicators during surgery (&#xD;
      saturation ) will go beyond the reference values ( less than 95 % )). Benzodiazepines,&#xD;
      ketamine, , antipsychotics should not be used in premedication, induction, and while&#xD;
      maintaining anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, induction is achieved by intravenous administration of propofol, to patients&#xD;
      under the age of 55 at a dosage of 2 mg / kg of ideal body weight until they lose&#xD;
      consciousness, to patients older than 55 years and to patients of classes III and IV&#xD;
      according to ASA 1 mg / kg ideal body weight until unconscious, with fentanyl at a dose of&#xD;
      2-3 μg / kg or mask induction with sevoflurane 2 l / min 3 MAC with fentanyl at a dosage of 4&#xD;
      μg / kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance of anesthesia in both groups is ensured by the use of sevoflurane with a finite&#xD;
      alveolar concentration 1 MAC and fentanyl (0.05-0.1 mg as needed, according to the decision&#xD;
      of the attending anesthesiologist). Muscle relaxants(monitoring of curarization and reversal&#xD;
      will not be carried out) , vasoactive drugs, infusion solutions, adjuvants, with the&#xD;
      exception of those listed above (if there is no strict need for them), are selected at the&#xD;
      discretion of the anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the awakening period, the time from the sevoflurane interruption until the occurrence&#xD;
      of spontaneous breathing, the time before opening the eyes, the time before extubation, the&#xD;
      time before orientation is recorded. The criterion of awakening the patient will be&#xD;
      considered the ability to perform the simplest commands: open your eyes, raise your head,&#xD;
      show your tongue. The patient is assessed on the RASS scale immediately after awakening, 15&#xD;
      minutes after awakening and 30 minutes after awakening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After awakening, assessing severity of the condition, the need for prolonged mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, vasopressor or inotropic support, the need for monitoring in ICU, the patient is&#xD;
      transferred to the unit or to ICU (The Aldrete Scale will be used to assessment of the&#xD;
      patients condition) , where he will be monitored for hemodynamics (NIBP, ECG, SpO2), a&#xD;
      dynamic assessment of the general state, monitoring of laboratory parameters and&#xD;
      postoperative therapy, according to current practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative examination, anesthesia management, pre- and postoperative therapy will be&#xD;
      carried out in accordance with current practice. All data from laboratory and instrumental&#xD;
      assessments, as well as all medical documentation (protocol of anesthesia course, anesthesia&#xD;
      card, patient management cards in the ICU, prescriptions) will be available as part of the&#xD;
      clinical study to treating doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Mechanics, Methodology, &amp; Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following measures will allow us to achieve a high level of protocol adherence in this&#xD;
      trial: research teams will be created in each participating hospital, which will consist of&#xD;
      anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists. Each research team will be responsible for&#xD;
      conducting a &quot;Wash In / WashOut&quot; procedure to each randomized patient. All members of the&#xD;
      research team will be instructed on the technique of &quot;WashUp / WashOut&quot; procedure before the&#xD;
      start of the study. All the data obtained in this study will be recorded in medical&#xD;
      documentation (protocol of anesthesia course, anesthesia card, patient management cards in&#xD;
      the ICU, prescriptions) and patient's case report forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequency of the primary endpoint was considered and the relative reduction was&#xD;
      associated with sequential awakening by sevoflurane. Considering a type I error of 0.05 and a&#xD;
      power of 80% (type II error of 0.2), the required number was 98 patients per group. Planned&#xD;
      to enroll 100 patients in each groupsurgery study arm to account for possible dropouts. 200&#xD;
      patients summary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. No imputation will&#xD;
      be applied for missing data. Per-protocol analyses will be also performed. Demographic and&#xD;
      baseline disease characteristics will be summarized with the use of descriptive statistics.&#xD;
      Categorical variables will be reported as absolute numbers and percentages. Unadjusted&#xD;
      univariate analyses, to compare the two treatment groups, will be based on Chi-square or&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated by means&#xD;
      of the two-by-two table method with the use of log-normal approximation. Continuous variables&#xD;
      will be reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile range (IQR).&#xD;
      Between-group differences will be evaluated using the t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test, in&#xD;
      accordance with normality of the distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A logistic regression model using a stepwise selection will be used to estimate the treatment&#xD;
      effect and predictors of primary endpoint. The pre-randomization clinical data and center&#xD;
      will be entered into the model if their univariate p value is&lt; 0.1 and there is no&#xD;
      correlation between them. Collinearity and overfitting will be assessed using a stepwise&#xD;
      regression model and Pearson correlation test. The treatment group will be forced into the&#xD;
      multivariate model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent safety committee will perform three interim analyses after recruitment of 25%,&#xD;
      50% and 75% of patients. Data evaluation at each interim analysis will be based on the alpha&#xD;
      spending function concept, according to Lan and De Mets', and will employ O'Brien-Fleming&#xD;
      Z-test boundaries, which are very conservative early in the trial. For the first interim&#xD;
      analysis the efficacy stopping rule would require an extremely low p value (p &lt; 0.000015).&#xD;
      For the second interim analysis p &lt; 0.003 will be taken as efficacy stopping rule. For the&#xD;
      third interim analysis p &lt; 0.02 will be taken as efficacy stopping rule. Investigators will&#xD;
      be kept blind to the interim analysis results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Data Safety and Monitoring Committees will also perform conditional power analyses in&#xD;
      order to evaluate potential interruption for futility issues in the trial. Conditional power&#xD;
      will be calculated by assuming that the proportion of outcomes will follow the observed&#xD;
      trend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following analysis will be performed to determine the effect of sequential awakening by&#xD;
      sevoflurane on different subgroups of patients.&#xD;
