  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a worldwide health care burden that affects the structure and function of the&#xD;
      macro- and microcirculation. Non-invasive vascular biomarkers are essential to timely&#xD;
      diagnose end organ damage to improve cardiovascular (CV) risk stratification and medical&#xD;
      decision making. The &quot;Hypertension and retinal microvascular dysfunction&quot; (HyperVasc) trial&#xD;
      will investigate macro- and microvascular impairments in hypertensive patients and healthy&#xD;
      controls to investigate hypertension-induced end organ damage by using gold-standard methods&#xD;
      as well as newly developed and unique retinal microvascular biomarkers. Additionally, this&#xD;
      trial will investigate the reversible effects of an eight weeks supervised and walking based&#xD;
      high-intensity exercise intervention on blood pressure as well as macro- and microvascular&#xD;
      health, compared to a control group with standard physical activity recommendations.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity, microalbuminuria,&#xD;
      hypertensive retinopathy, and classical cardiovascular risk marker. The results of the&#xD;
      HyperVasc trial will improve the understanding of hypertension-induced vascular impairments&#xD;
      and will push the development of non-invasive vascular biomarker to screen end organ damage&#xD;
      in general CV risk stratification.&#xD;

    <description>The exercise intervention will be eight weeks of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) started by one warm-up week with an intensity of 75% maximum heart rate (HRmax). In the following seven weeks, the participants will perform a HIIT based on the following protocol and with a total duration of 45 minutes per session: warm-up for 10 minutes at 60-70% HRmax followed by a high-intensity interval consisting of 4x4 minutes at 80-90% HRmax with 3 minutes of active recovery at 60-70% HRmax and a 10 minutes cool-down at 60-70% HRmax. HR will be monitored during training by Polar® H7 heart rate sensors combined with Polar® M400 watches.</description>
