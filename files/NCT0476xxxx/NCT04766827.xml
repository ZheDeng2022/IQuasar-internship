      Research Topic:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective randomized controlled clinical study of albumin-bound paclitaxel combined with&#xD;
      cisplatin (AP regimen) versus docetaxel combined with cisplatin (TP regimen) induced&#xD;
      chemotherapy in advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected study duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject received a 3-week regimen of AP or TP over 2 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of induction chemotherapy with albumin-bound paclitaxel&#xD;
      in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HSCC), two induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimens, AP regimen and TP regimen, were compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design. Single center, open label, controlled clinical study Number of cases: 116&#xD;
      Objective response rate (ORR=CR+PR) was used as the main evaluation index in this study.&#xD;

      Research purposes:Research the effectiveness and safety of albumin-bound paclitaxel for&#xD;
      induction chemotherapy in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were&#xD;
      evaluated,by comparing the AP regimen and the TP regimen .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research content:To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of albumin-bound paclitaxel for&#xD;
      induction chemotherapy in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study endpoint Primary endpoint: Objective response rate (ORR=CR+PR) (Assessed according to&#xD;
      RECIST standards, see Annex 1) Secondary study endpoint: Surgical resection rate,Pathological&#xD;
      remission rate,Progression-free survival (PFS), Overall survival (OS) Main safety indicators:&#xD;
      Observe any adverse events that occurred in all subjects during the clinical study and within&#xD;
      1 month after stopping the drug, including clinical symptoms, abnormal vital signs, and&#xD;
      abnormalities in laboratory examinations, and record their clinical features, Severity, time&#xD;
      of occurrence, duration, treatment method and prognosis outcome, and determine its&#xD;
      correlation with the study drug. The safety of the drug was evaluated according to the&#xD;
      NCI-CTC AE 4.0 standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:This is a single-center, open-label, controlled clinical study.The aime is&#xD;
      observing and evaluating the effectiveness and safety of albumin-bound paclitaxel for&#xD;
      induction chemotherapy in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is planned to be carried out in Tianjin Cancer Hospital. According to the research&#xD;
      principles of GCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study plans to recruit 116 qualified subjects. This study used objective response rate&#xD;
      (ORR=CR+PR) as the main evaluation index. According to previous reports, the ORR of the TP&#xD;
      group was 50%, and the ORR of the AP group was estimated to be 75%. The test level is set to&#xD;
      0.05 on one side, the test power is set to 0.8, and the estimated dropout rate is 20%. Using&#xD;
      the Logrank-Lakatos algorithm, the total sample size is calculated to be 116 cases.&#xD;
