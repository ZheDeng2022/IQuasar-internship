    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to verify the quantitative and qualitative effect of Erbium dental&#xD;
      laser therapy on microbial populations in carious lesions and to compare the laser therapy&#xD;
      with traditional conservative therapies.&#xD;

      Patients will be assessed and selected at the University Odontostomatology Clinic (COU) in&#xD;
      Perugia; patients are considered eligible for enrolment if they are at least 18 years old and&#xD;
      have a carious lesion on permanent teeth, cavitated and non-destructive, deepening to the&#xD;
      middle third of the dentine and no further. The patients will be randomly assigned to two&#xD;
      groups as follows: group A, control group, which includes treatment with traditional therapy;&#xD;
      group B, intervention group, which includes treatment with Er:YAG laser therapy. For each&#xD;
      patient, two salivary swabs will be taken on the cavity dentine of the carious lesion: one&#xD;
      before and one after the treatments.&#xD;

    <masking_description>To ensure confidentiality of the data, each subject will be assigned a serial number so that only one of the experimenters will be able to link a number to the corresponding person. In addition, a dedicated computer will be used for data collection and analysis, which will be set up to allow limited access with a password known only to one of the experimenters.</masking_description>

    <description>The removal of caries was performed with Er:YAG laser (Doctor Smile, Lambda SRL,Italy) with BOOST handpiece to cut the enamel and open the cavity, and 90° handpiece to remove the carious dentin with tips of 800 µ in diameter and 8 mm or 12 mm in length, in relation to the depth and distance of the lesion.</description>

    <description>The removal of caries was performed with manual and rotating instruments, such as dentin spoon (ASA Dental S.p.a.), turbine (NSK Dental Italy S.r.l.) with diamond burs (Kerr Dental Italia S.r.l.) to cut the enamel and open the cavity and drill handpiece (KaVo Dental Italia S.r.l.) with tungsten carbide burs (Kerr Dental Italia S.r.l.) to remove the infected dentin.</description>
