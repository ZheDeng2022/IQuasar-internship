  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to identify home safety hazards for adolescents with acquired&#xD;
      brain injury and to identify adaptations to the home healthcare virtual simulation training&#xD;
      system (HH-VSTS) to improve the user experience for adolescents with ABI&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the home safety hazards that place adolescents with ABI at risk of&#xD;
      injury. In addition, the study will determine ways to adapt our current home safety virtual&#xD;
      simulation training system, a game based training and assessment that trains home healthcare&#xD;
      workers to identify and respond to hazards they encounter in client homes. The study will&#xD;
      include interviews with three stakeholders groups: adolescents with ABI, parents of&#xD;
      adolescents with ABI, and healthcare providers working with adolescents with ABI to identify&#xD;
      home safety hazards encountered by adolescents with ABI. We will demonstrate proof of concept&#xD;
      for adolescents with ABI through assessment of safety concerns from multiple perspectives and&#xD;
      evaluation of design considerations from our intended user-group. Further, we are applying&#xD;
      the HH-VSTS in a novel way to solve an understudied problem in adolescents with ABI. In&#xD;
      addition, we will apply a user-centered, participatory approach to assess the design&#xD;
      consideration of virtual gaming technologies to health and safety training adolescents with&#xD;
      ABI.&#xD;
