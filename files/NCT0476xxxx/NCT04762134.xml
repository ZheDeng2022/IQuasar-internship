  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a growing epidemic of the bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) syphilis,&#xD;
      chlamydia and gonorrhea worldwide; similarly concerning trends have been noted in Canada,&#xD;
      where increases of over 160% have been seen in bacterial STIs over the last decade. In&#xD;
      Canada, gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (gbMSM) - including those living&#xD;
      with HIV - are disproportionately impacted by bacterial STIs5,6These dramatic increases in&#xD;
      bacterial STIs, the potential development of serious complications including AMR, and waning&#xD;
      effectiveness of the promotion of conventional STI prevention tools (e.g. condoms), signals&#xD;
      the need for novel STI prevention strategies and tools to mitigate STI-related complications.&#xD;
      A rigorous randomized controlled trial will be conducted to definitively assess the efficacy,&#xD;
      safety, antimicrobial resistance profiles and costs associated with doxycycline-based STI&#xD;
      prevention&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the rising rates of STIs among gbMSM populations in Canada, there is an urgent need for&#xD;
      novel interventions to prevent significant sequelae (e.g. neurosyphilis) and onward&#xD;
      transmission of untreated infections. Despite longstanding public health efforts to encourage&#xD;
      conventional strategies of STI prevention, gbMSM continue to bear the burden of syphilis&#xD;
      which poses synergistic effects in the transmission of HIV. This study will add to this field&#xD;
      through providing the first methodologically rigorous, prospective multicentre, open-label&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) of doxycycline-based STI PrEP (daily 100mg doxycycline) and&#xD;
      STI PEP (200mg doxycycline after exposure event) versus standard-of-care for the prevention&#xD;
      of bacterial STIs among gbMSM over 15 months (60 weeks) of follow-up with adequate power to&#xD;
      address drug efficacy in the prevention of bacterial STIs. Beyond the determination of&#xD;
      efficacy, our trial will provide insight to the unique challenges of medication adherence&#xD;
      through assessing the acceptability, tolerability and safety of therapy with doxycycline.&#xD;
      This study aims to provide health care providers one additional tool to address the burden of&#xD;
      STIs in populations with an increased likelihood of infection.&#xD;
