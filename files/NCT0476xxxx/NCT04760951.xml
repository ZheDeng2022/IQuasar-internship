  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study aims to assess the efficacy of TOTUM-070, a mix of 5 plant extracts, on&#xD;
      lipid metabolism in moderate hypercholesterolemic subjects. The hypothesis is that TOTUM-070,&#xD;
      daily consumed, is superior to placebo for decrease of fasting blood LDL-cholesterol&#xD;
      concentration (determined by ultracentrifugation method) after 24 weeks of consumption.&#xD;
