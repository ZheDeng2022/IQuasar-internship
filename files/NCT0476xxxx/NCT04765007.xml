  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychological impairments have a significant role in management and coping of pain in&#xD;
      patients with orofacial pain disorders. The response of this kind of pathologies to topical&#xD;
      or systemic medications is not predictable and mindfulness breathing and relaxation&#xD;
      techniques could present good results since it help patients to accept their problem and to&#xD;
      cope it. In consequence, the present study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a mindfulness&#xD;
      therapy program in management of chronic orofacial pain.&#xD;
