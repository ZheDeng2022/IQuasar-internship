  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator propose an extension of the previous National, multicentric study, promoting&#xD;
      an observational registry, both retrospective and prospective, in order to expand and further&#xD;
      characterize the series of Italian patients with Philadelphia-positive, chronic phase CML&#xD;
      (CP-CML) who discontinue TKIs in an off-protocol setting. As safety concerns may arise for&#xD;
      patients receiving long-term treatments, and due to the growing number of patients&#xD;
      discontinuing TKIs in clinical practice, the study aim to collect all available data&#xD;
      regarding feasibility and freedom from progression of the cohort of patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, retrospective and prospective study of CP-CML patients who&#xD;
      discontinue TKIs in Italy. The study will not imply additional costs for the participating&#xD;
      centers. Data already present in the clinical charts will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients, answering to inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in one of the follow&#xD;
      cohorts&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1 retrospective/prospective study: 293 patients enrolled and reported in Fava et&#xD;
           al 2019 with at least 1 year of follow up at the end of the study (February 2017) and&#xD;
           107 patients enrolled but not reported in Fava et al 2019 since their follow-up was&#xD;
           shorter than 1 year. The data for these patients will be collected since the end of&#xD;
           previous study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2 retrospective/prospective study: patient not enrolled in the previous study&#xD;
           (Fava et al 2019). The data for these patients will be collected since patient diagnosis&#xD;
           to the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3 prospective study: patients who have discontinued TKI therapy after the study&#xD;
           approval in each center. These patients will also participate in the validation process&#xD;
           of Phase 2 of a questionnaire developed by an expert panel of eight CML patients with&#xD;
           the purpose of capturing the experiences of people along all phases of the TFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients participating in the study will not be subjected to any procedure that falls outside&#xD;
      the clinical practice; in the same way, clinical variables that will be collected for the&#xD;
      study are those that are commonly collected by physician in daily clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any decision about drug administration or suspension is made by the physician based on his&#xD;
      clinical judgment in the context of clinical practice, independently from decision to include&#xD;
      the patient in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registration of enrolled patients will be done on-line on a key restricted accessible&#xD;
      web-database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective and endpoint To assess the TFR rate at 1 year from discontinuation of TKIs.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives and endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To further describe the observed population of patients in terms of:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  treatment-free duration; o survival in MR4.5;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  survival in MR3;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  event-free survival;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  progression-free survival;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  deaths after treatment discontinuation;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  rate of achievement of MMR and DMR after treatment re-initiation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify clinical and biological prognostic factors affecting the persistence of&#xD;
           off-therapy remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify optimal timing and modalities of molecular monitoring of BCR-ABL1 transcript&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluation of the safe minimum monitoring during and after treatment&#xD;
                discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluation of the maximum MRD positivity level acceptable to safely stay&#xD;
                off-treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of short-term adverse events (withdrawal syndrome: fever, arthralgia,&#xD;
           myalgia, bone pain, weight loss) after treatment discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of long-term adverse events (i.e. cardiovascular adverse events, second&#xD;
           neoplasia) after treatment discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Validation of the Italian version of the &quot;Phase 2&quot; of a questionnaire developed by an&#xD;
           expert panel of eight CML patients to capture the experiences of people along all phases&#xD;
           of the TFR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of patient-reported outcomes describing quality of life of patients off&#xD;
           therapy and after resumption of TKIs&#xD;
