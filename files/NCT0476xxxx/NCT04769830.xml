  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of gastrointestinal diseases is high in intensive care unit (intensive care&#xD;
      unit,ICU). In critically ill patients, the intestinal tract is the &quot;engine&quot; of multiple organ&#xD;
      dysfunction syndrome (Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome,MODS) and a component of multiple&#xD;
      organ dysfunction syndrome, which is closely related to the poor prognosis of critically ill&#xD;
      patients. In 2012, the abdominal working group of the European Association of critical Care&#xD;
      Medicine (the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine,ESICM) put forward the concept of&#xD;
      &quot;acute gastrointestinal injury&quot; (acute gastrointestinal injury,AGI), which was defined as&#xD;
      gastrointestinal dysfunction caused by acute disease in critically ill patients. However, the&#xD;
      grading system is complex and general, which does not reflect other gastrointestinal&#xD;
      functions such as endocrine, immunity, barrier and so on, and lacks the support of objective&#xD;
      laboratory results. When patients with acute gastrointestinal injury, gastrointestinal&#xD;
      digestion and absorption, endocrine, immunity, barrier function are affected in varying&#xD;
      degrees. The levels of indexes reflecting gastrointestinal digestion and absorption,&#xD;
      endocrine and immunity were different among different AGI grades. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      was to observe the characteristics of AGI bowel sounds in critically ill patients with ICU by&#xD;
      digital continuous bowel sound monitoring, and to explore the clinical value of bowel sounds&#xD;
      characteristics in AGI of critically ill patients combined with the changes of biomarkers of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal injury.&#xD;

      In this study, digital bowel sound monitoring equipment was used to continuously monitor the&#xD;
      bowel sound of critically ill patients with ICU. This technology added the intestinal sound&#xD;
      characteristic database to the data processing center, analyzed and identified the intestinal&#xD;
      sound data through the intestinal sound recognition algorithm, further analyzed the&#xD;
      parameters such as audio frequency, spectrum and power spectrum, and observed the changes of&#xD;
      biomarkers such as citrulline and intestinal fatty acid binding protein.&#xD;
