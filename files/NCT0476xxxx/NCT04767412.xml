  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of inspiratory muscle training on&#xD;
      physical fitness in Down syndrome children. Twenty Down syndrome children from both genders&#xD;
      ranged in age chronologically from seven to ten years will be selected to participate in this&#xD;
      study. Selection of the study sample and evaluation of physical fitness improvement as well&#xD;
      as Inspiratory Muscle training will be conducted in the Down Syndrome Charitable Association&#xD;
      (DSCA), Riyadh City.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study sample will be divided randomly into two equal groups of (A &amp; B). All the children&#xD;
      participated in the current study will receive 30 minutes of treatment session of aerobic&#xD;
      exercise, group B will receive first 30 minutes of IMT then take a period time of rest about&#xD;
      30 minutes before starting the aerobic exercise. Exercise frequency three times per week for&#xD;
      a period of three successive months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Body mass index (BMI) of each participated child will be determined by measuring weight/&#xD;
      Kg and height/ m2 using Electronic weight and height scale to include BMI ≥ 29 Kg/ m2 to&#xD;
      exclude the obese children. Also using Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT) for measuring the aerobic&#xD;
      capacity and Pulse Oxymeter for measuring pulse rate and Oxygen saturation. In addition, The&#xD;
      Gio Digital pressure gauge will be used to assess Respiratory Muscle Strength of children by&#xD;
      determining the Maximal Inspiratory (MIP) and Expiratory Pressure (MEP) which used to detect&#xD;
      the inspiratory training intensity and reflect the improvement in respiratory muscle strength&#xD;
      after training program. Brockport Physical Fitness Test (BPFT) will be used to measure&#xD;
      physical fitness of the participated children. The participated children will be assessed&#xD;
      before and after three successive months .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The obtained results of this study will measure Maximal Inspiratory (MIP) and Expiratory&#xD;
      Pressure (MEP), Aerobic capacity, Musculoskeletal Function and Maximum Heart Rate (HR Max.)&#xD;
      to determine the significant improvement of participated children&#xD;
