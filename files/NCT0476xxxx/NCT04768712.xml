    <textblock>
      Objectives: To investigate if a physical activity intervention (one year) can reduce the risk&#xD;
      of falls (primary endpoint), improve physical function (balance and muscle strength) and&#xD;
      cortical bone geometry as well as trabecular microarchitecture (secondary endpoints) in&#xD;
      women, 70-80 years old, with manifest osteoporosis, treated with zoledronic acid, calcium and&#xD;
      vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategic goal: To include 200 patients (100 intervention and 100 controls) during 2010 and&#xD;
      2011 and randomize 100 patients to a one year physical activity intervention (3 hours&#xD;
      weekly). The results will be published in an international scientific peer-review journal.&#xD;
      All patients will receive standard medical treatment with calcium, vitamin D and yearly&#xD;
      zoledronic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study rationale: The role of physical activity intervention has not previously been evaluated&#xD;
      in patients with manifest osteoporosis and zoledronic acid treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Randomized controlled trial. All included patients (women 70-80 years of age)&#xD;
      will have manifest osteoporosis, be treatment naïve, and will be treated on clinical&#xD;
      indication with yearly infusions of zoledronic acid (approved treatment, for this patient&#xD;
      category, by the Swedish Medical Products Agency). Patients with secondary osteoporosis, with&#xD;
      disabilities, and with high levels of exercise at the baseline visit will be excluded.&#xD;
      Intention to treat analysis will be used. Physical activity intervention includes 3 hours of&#xD;
      weight bearing aerobic exercise per week, using a standardized program. Patients in both&#xD;
      groups will be contacted monthly and asked about their exercise habits. Frequency of falls,&#xD;
      physical activity level will be ascertained using questionnaires. Balance and muscle strength&#xD;
      will be assessed using standardized tests. Bone geometry at the tibia diaphysis will be&#xD;
      determined using an XCT2000 pQCT device (Stratec, Germany) and trabecular microarchitecture&#xD;
      at the tibia metaphysis will be determined using an XtremeCT device (Scanco Medical AG,&#xD;
      Switzerland). These examinations will be performed on all patients prior to the intervention&#xD;
      and after the completion of the study.&#xD;
