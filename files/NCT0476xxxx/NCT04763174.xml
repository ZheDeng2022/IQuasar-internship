  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed an innovative mobile health (mHealth) coping skills training&#xD;
      protocol, mCOPE, that is adapted to meet the multiple symptom needs and stage-of-life&#xD;
      challenges faced by young and middle-aged adults with cancer, and delivered in a convenient&#xD;
      and flexible format that does not incur further demands. Young and middle-aged colorectal&#xD;
      cancer patients who report pain, fatigue, and psychological distress will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions:&#xD;
      mCOPE or standard care. mCOPE will teach patients coping skills to manage their&#xD;
      cancer-related symptoms (pain, fatigue and distress) in the context of unique age-related&#xD;
      challenges; session content will be tailored based on participants' report. mCOPE sessions&#xD;
      will be delivered via videoconferencing to the patient in his/her own environment and&#xD;
      scheduled at times that are convenient to the patient. mHealth technology, including a mobile&#xD;
      app, will be used to capture daily symptom and coping skills use data, allowing the study&#xD;
      team to provide personalized real-time feedback to patients. Investigators want to understand&#xD;
      the impact of the mCOPE intervention delivered to young and middle-aged colorectal cancer&#xD;
      patients with pain, fatigue, and distress. mCOPE is expected to lead to reduced symptom&#xD;
      severity and improved quality of life. Study aims include: testing the efficacy of mCOPE for&#xD;
      improving symptoms and quality of life and examining improved self-efficacy for symptom&#xD;
      management as a mediator of symptom severity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a high level of evidence that suggests cognitive and behavioral factors play an&#xD;
      important role in colorectal cancer patients' abilities to cope with pain, fatigue and&#xD;
      distress. Patients with multiple persistent symptoms may be particularly likely to have low&#xD;
      confidence in their ability to control their symptoms (i.e., self-efficacy for symptom&#xD;
      management). Cognitive behavioral coping skills protocols can enhance patients' abilities to&#xD;
      cope with their symptoms in the context of age-related challenges; to date, these protocols&#xD;
      have been tested in older patients and neither intervention content nor delivery modality&#xD;
      meet the needs of younger patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention protocols aimed at young and middle-aged patients dealing with age-related&#xD;
      stressors and high time demands must be adapted to meet the needs and challenges (e.g.,&#xD;
      coping skills practice strategies within the context of competing demands, communication with&#xD;
      others about symptoms and limitations, relaxation for managing stoma-related pain, activity&#xD;
      pacing to manage fatigue due to cancer and the demands of multiple life roles; cognitive&#xD;
      restructuring negative thoughts surrounding managing time off work for treatment while&#xD;
      maintaining health insurance and arranging childcare) of younger adults with cancer and&#xD;
      delivered in a format (e.g., videoconferencing, adjunctive mobile app) that is acceptable and&#xD;
      does not incur further demands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to use a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test an innovative&#xD;
      mHealth Coping Skills Training for Symptom Management (mCOPE) intervention designed to target&#xD;
      pain, fatigue, psychological distress, and quality of life with unique content adapted for&#xD;
      young and middle-aged colorectal cancer patients. mCOPE will be delivered with convenient&#xD;
      mHealth modalities (videoconferencing, mobile app supported). Young and middle-aged adults&#xD;
      with colorectal cancer that endorse multiple symptoms will be randomized to: 1) mCOPE or 2)&#xD;
      standard care. mCOPE includes 5 videoconferencing sessions of a cognitive behavior&#xD;
      theory-based protocol that teaches coping skills (e.g., relaxation, activity pacing,&#xD;
      cognitive restructuring) relevant to managing pain, fatigue and distress, and improving&#xD;
      quality of life in the context of the unique challenges facing younger patients. mCOPE uses&#xD;
      mHealth technology, including a mobile app, to capture daily symptom and coping skills use&#xD;
      data and provide personalized support and feedback to patients. The central hypothesis is&#xD;
      that mCOPE will result in decreased pain, fatigue and distress, and increased quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific study aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Test the efficacy of mCOPE for improving symptoms and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Examine improved self-efficacy for symptom management as a mediator of symptom&#xD;
      severity.&#xD;

    <description>mHealth Coping Skills Training for Symptom Management (mCOPE) protocol tests the efficacy of a theory-based symptom management intervention designed to target multiple interrelated symptoms (pain, fatigue, psychological distress) with content uniquely relevant for young and middle-aged colorectal cancer patients. Addressing the co-morbid consequences of cancer while providing support in the context of age-related challenges (e.g., caring for children and parents, career) has the potential to significantly improve overall quality of life in young and middle-aged patients with cancer.</description>
