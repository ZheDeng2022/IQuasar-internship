  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ProSeal laryngeal mask airway (PLMA) has become an effective alternative to tracheal tube for&#xD;
      gaining airway access and for the institution and maintenance of positive pressure&#xD;
      ventilation (PPV) in patients undergoing short-to-moderate duration (20-60 minutes) surgery&#xD;
      under GA. The PLMA is the more preferred supra-glottic airway access device for advantages&#xD;
      therein over the other SGA's, including having an option of dedicated introducer-tool (ease&#xD;
      of placement), availability of esophageal opening (allows regurgitated fluid to bypass the&#xD;
      airway), and reinforced main body tube (prevents luminal compression). Additionally, as&#xD;
      compared to other supra-glottic airway devices, the PLMA device has been found to be more&#xD;
      consistent in providing PPV to patients' lungs during GA. However, not uncommonly, PLMA&#xD;
      itself is not consistent in maintaining trouble-free PPV owing to the vulnerability to&#xD;
      position change, especially secondary to the rhythmic movement posited by back pressure&#xD;
      during PPV. This movement vulnerability induced by PPV may be because of the size/shape of&#xD;
      PLMA cuff that does fit upon placement but gets vulnerable to undue movement during PPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that keeping the introducer-tool in position after insertion of PLMA result in&#xD;
      greater stabilization of PLMA in position by minimizing the movement that occurs due to&#xD;
      back-pressure effect on the cuff during positive pressure ventilation. This randomized study&#xD;
      intends to evaluate whether keeping the introducer-tool in position (after PLMA insertion)&#xD;
      accords greater positional stabilization to the PLMA and thereby offers greater efficacy for&#xD;
      achieving adequate pressure control ventilation in paralyzed anesthetized adults undergoing&#xD;
      elective surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Supraglottic airways (SGA) have become a standard proposition in management of the upper&#xD;
      airway. These devices have suitably interposed its utility as airway conduit between the&#xD;
      facemask and the tracheal tube in terms of anatomical position and degree of invasiveness.&#xD;
      These devices sit outside of trachea but provide a hands-free means of achieving a gas-tight&#xD;
      airway. In the year 1989, the first SGA, the classic laryngeal mask airway (C-LMA), became&#xD;
      available. As time went on, additional variants of LMA came into use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ProSeal Laryngeal mask airway (PLMA), introduced in 2000, is by far the most specialized&#xD;
      SGA device. It comprises of four main subparts: the cuff, inflation line with pilot balloon,&#xD;
      airway tube, and the gastric drain tube. All components are made of silicone and are&#xD;
      latex-free. Studies indicate that size 3/4 is most preferable for adult women and size 4/5&#xD;
      for adult men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The airway (breathing, ventilation) tube of the PLMA is shorter and smaller in diameter than&#xD;
      its C-LMA counterpart. PLMA's wire-reinforced body makes it more flexible and yet resistant&#xD;
      to luminal compression. The locating-strap on the anterior distal tube of PLMA prevents&#xD;
      finger slipping off the tube and also provides an insertion slot for an 'introducer-tool'. An&#xD;
      additional safety accessory vent under the drainage tube in the bowl help avoid secretions&#xD;
      from pooling and accessing the upper airway. The PLMA has a deeper bowl than C-LMA and has a&#xD;
      bite-block between the airway and drain tubes at the level of teeth to prevent device injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a correctly positioned PLMA, the cuff tip lies behind the cricoid cartilage at the origin&#xD;
      of the esophagus; allows liquids/gases a bypass escape from the stomach and reduces the risk&#xD;
      of gastric insufflation, regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration; and provides information&#xD;
      about the PLMA position. The drain tube is designed to prevent the epiglottis from occluding&#xD;
      the airway tube, thus eliminating the need for aperture bars. A gastric tube, doppler probe,&#xD;
      temperature probe can be passed into the oesophagus through the drainage port.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PLMA also has a second dorsal cuff which pushes the mask anteriorly to provide a better&#xD;
      seal around the glottic aperture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As per the standard guidelines, an introducer-tool (a curved, malleable, silicone-coated&#xD;
      blade with a guiding handle) is used to facilitate placing an PLMA in the pharyngo-laryngeal&#xD;
      slot, and helps greatly with the first-insertion placement success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once in place, the PLMA offers a dependable conduit through which effective PPV can be&#xD;
      instituted. Interestingly, although the PLMA placement and position adequacy has a static&#xD;
      corollary to it and that the institution of PPV situates a dynamic airflow system; not&#xD;
      uncommonly, there are problems to effective PPV even through an adequately placed PLMA. The&#xD;
      rhythmic PPV which leads to back pressure onto the PLMA cuff often result in subtle cuff&#xD;
      movements resulting in leak at the desired PPV pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on past clinical data in unit regarding safety of this procedure we hypothesize that&#xD;
      keeping the introducer-tool in position (after facilitating insertion of PLMA) minimizes&#xD;
      unwanted position changes owing to back pressure effect of PPV on the PLMA cuff, and&#xD;
      therefore, would enable us to achieve and maintain adequate ventilation during GA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan this study with an objective to compare efficacy of PLMA with or without introducer&#xD;
      tool assisted stabilization during PPV in anaesthetized paralyzed patients undergoing short&#xD;
      to moderate duration surgery.&#xD;
