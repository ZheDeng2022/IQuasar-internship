      The objective of prospective RELOC-AGE is to study housing choices and relocation and to&#xD;
      examine the effects on active ageing among people aged 55+ considering relocation. All data&#xD;
      collection will be conducted at baseline and after 12 and 24 months of follow-up.&#xD;

      The objective of prospective RELOC-AGE is to study housing choices and relocation and to&#xD;
      examine the effects on active ageing among people aged 55+ considering relocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What aspects of housing, health and participation predict a) relocation to different&#xD;
           housing options in the ordinary housing stock; b) residential care facilities; c)&#xD;
           remaining in the present dwelling?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How is the complex interaction between objective and perceived aspects of housing,&#xD;
           health and participation associated with active ageing, and what are the patterns and&#xD;
           characteristics of such dynamics?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What housing attributes do people aged 55+ considering relocation find important, and to&#xD;
           what extent, when making their decisions on housing preferences?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. How do people aged 55+ considering relocation reason a) regarding different housing&#xD;
           options; b) motives for considering and effectuating relocation, and; c) to what extent&#xD;
           are their motives fulfilled?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample will include people aged 55+ considering relocation. Recruitment will be made from&#xD;
      a sub-sample based on waiting lists (n=22 000) among two housing companies in Sweden:&#xD;
      Karlshamnsbostäder AB and Riksbyggen. The expected final sample size is n=3000. Quantitative&#xD;
      data will be collected through two web surveys and one telephone interview at baseline, 12&#xD;
      and 24 months. Data on primary and secondary outcomes are based on established questionnaires&#xD;
      used in previous research on older people, health, and housing as well as in national public&#xD;
      health surveys in Sweden. In addition to primary and secondary outcomes (presented below),&#xD;
      the surveys include demographic and socioeconomic characteristics including civil status,&#xD;
      education level, economic situation, occupational status, holding a driver license, critical&#xD;
      life events (e.g., death of spouse, long-term disease, divorce), original nationality;&#xD;
      questions about present housing situation (dwelling characteristics (e.g., type and size of&#xD;
      dwelling, location) and neighborhood characteristics (e.g., access to services and green&#xD;
      areas), potential and realized mobility, social/cohabiting situation, time spent at home,&#xD;
      housing adaptations); use of technical aids for mobility, use of health, social and informal&#xD;
      care, thoughts about future housing, reasons related to consideration about relocating and&#xD;
      moving intentions. Data on stated preferences in relation to housing will be collected in a&#xD;
      specific survey based on a discrete choice methodology. Qualitative interviews will be&#xD;
      conducted consecutively with a subsample (n=100) of respondents who have relocated during the&#xD;
      follow-up period. Further, linking to register data will be made within the scope of Register&#xD;
      RELOC-AGE, which is another part of the larger project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For quantitative data, descriptive, exploratory, and inferential statistics will be used. For&#xD;
      longitudinal analyses, generalised linear models or Cox regression with time-dependent&#xD;
      covariates will be applied. Throughout, we will control for demographic and socioeconomic&#xD;
      characteristics and other potential confounders and compare the results across different&#xD;
      cohorts. Quantitative analyses will be conducted using standard statistical software. For&#xD;
      analyses of DCE data, we will use the conditional logit model (also referred to as the&#xD;
      multinomial logit model) as the reference model, but the analysis will be extended to mixed&#xD;
      logit and latent class models to take preference heterogeneity into account. Qualitative&#xD;
      interviews will be audio-recorded and transc¬ribed verbatim and principles from Grounded&#xD;
      Theory will be used for the analysis.&#xD;
