  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a secondary-use study based on previously-collected data and blood samples from a&#xD;
      previously completed double-blind, dose-ranging trial of maternal prenatal and postpartum&#xD;
      vitamin D supplementation in Dhaka, Bangladesh (NCT01924013). The aim of this sub-study is to&#xD;
      examine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on iron status during pregnancy and early&#xD;
      infancy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The risk of both low iron and vitamin D status have been recognized as public health concerns&#xD;
      among pregnant women and young children, with high rates of deficiency in low-and&#xD;
      middle-income countries. Through its involvement in regulation of the hepcidin-ferroportin&#xD;
      axis, as well as its potential to increase the expression of the erythropoietin receptor,&#xD;
      vitamin D has been suggested as a modulator of iron homeostasis. Vitamin D supplementation&#xD;
      may therefore represent a candidate facilitator for the management of iron deficiency, yet&#xD;
      few intervention trials have directly assessed the effect of vitamin D supplementation on&#xD;
      biomarkers of iron status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on iron status during pregnancy and early&#xD;
      infancy, data and blood samples will be drawn from a completed double-blind, dose-ranging&#xD;
      trial of maternal prenatal and postpartum vitamin D supplementation. Women at 17-24 weeks'&#xD;
      gestation were randomized to 1 of 5 dose groups comprising a prenatal; postpartum regimen of&#xD;
      placebo; placebo, 4200;0, 16800;0, 28000;0 or 28000;28000 IU vitamin D3/week until 26 weeks&#xD;
      postpartum. Enrolment (n=1300) was completed in September 2015, and all infants were&#xD;
      delivered by February 2016. The MDIG trial was primarily designed to determine the effect of&#xD;
      maternal vitamin D on infant length at 12 months of age (with follow-up continuing until&#xD;
      infants reached 24 months of age; completed in March 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses of serum ferritin and related iron biomarkers (serum iron, transferrin, soluble&#xD;
      transferrin receptor, hepcidin), and inflammatory makers (e.g. CRP), will be conducted using&#xD;
      previously collected stored blood samples. Linear regression models will be used to assess&#xD;
      the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the biomarkers of interest among pregnant women&#xD;
      and their infants at 6 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the potential dose-response relation between prenatal vitamin D treatment dose&#xD;
      (i.e., across all 4 assigned prenatal vitamin D doses by combining the 2 high-dose prenatal&#xD;
      vitamin D treatment groups) and the biomarker of interest, linear regression models will be&#xD;
      fitted using the assigned prenatal vitamin D treatment group as the categorical exposure&#xD;
      variable and the specified biomarker as the (continuous) outcome variable. Data will be&#xD;
      reported as mean differences (or mean % differences, if applicable) and 95% CIs. We will also&#xD;
      regress each outcome on the average weekly dose of vitamin D assigned as a continuous&#xD;
      variable during the prenatal period, for which the data will be reported as means and 95%&#xD;
      CIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore potential effects of prenatal only versus prenatal plus postpartum vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation on Hb concentrations among infants at 6 months of age, a similar&#xD;
      dose-response analysis will be conducted across all 5 treatment groups (i.e., disaggregation&#xD;
      of the 2 high-dose prenatal vitamin D groups), for which we will regress the biomarker (Hb as&#xD;
      a continuous variable) on the vitamin D treatment group assigned during the prenatal and&#xD;
      postpartum periods (as a categorical variable). Differences in each supplementation group&#xD;
      will therefore be compared to the placebo group, and expressed as mean differences (or&#xD;
      geometric means, or mean % differences, if applicable) and 95% CIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the influence of inflammation on serum ferritin concentrations, secondary analyses will&#xD;
      include inflammatory markers (e.g. CRP) as covariates to test the role of inflammation in&#xD;
      mediating the association between the vitamin D intervention and serum ferritin&#xD;
      concentrations.&#xD;
