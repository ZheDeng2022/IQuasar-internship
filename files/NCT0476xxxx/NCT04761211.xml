      This is a multicenter, prospective clinical study was conducted to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of Xiehe smart bra for breast disease screening in outpatients with breast&#xD;
      surgery. According to the patients' wishes and written informed consent, they were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the study group. A total of 2000 patients were expected to be enrolled. The&#xD;
      training group: validation group = 1:1.&#xD;

      This study is a randomized, open, multicenter clinical study. It will be conducted in Peking&#xD;
      Union Medical College Hospital, Shanxi Provincial People's Hospital, Beijing Third Hospital,&#xD;
      Zhalantun ZhongMeng hospital, Chongqing Medical University affiliated university town&#xD;
      hospital, Shenzhen People's Hospital and other national hospitals. A total of 2000 subjects&#xD;
      are expected to participate. The patients in the group wore the device for about 3 minutes,&#xD;
      and took photos of 5 breast sites. After that, the artificial intelligence learning was&#xD;
      carried out on the photos of the training group. For the photos of the verification group,&#xD;
      the algorithm obtained by the training group was compared with the existing artificial&#xD;
      intelligence algorithms of ultrasound and molybdenum target. During the follow-up, the safety&#xD;
      of the product was evaluated. According to the basic principles of safety and performance of&#xD;
      who international general GHTF (sg1-n020r5) medical devices.&#xD;
