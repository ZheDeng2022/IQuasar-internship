  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aim is to compare the effects produced by two different exercise training&#xD;
      modalities on atrial function evaluated by speckle-tracking echocardiography on hypertensive&#xD;
      patients with coronary artery disease. 50 males patients will be randomized to interval&#xD;
      training or combined training the latter including both aerobic and resistance exercises. The&#xD;
      training period will last 12 weeks. The protocol will provide two different assessment of&#xD;
      atrial function: -acute: after a single session of exercise; - 12 weeks: at the end of&#xD;
      exercise training protocols.&#xD;

      This is a prospective randomized two- arms open trial evaluating the effects of two different&#xD;
      exercise training modalities on atrial function, assessed by speckle-tracking&#xD;
      echocardiography, on hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease. First endpoint will&#xD;
      be: between-groups comparison of exercise-induced changes on peak atrial longitudinal strain&#xD;
      (PALS). Secondary endpoints will be: exercise-induced changes on diastolic function and left&#xD;
      ventricular strain. We will include 50 patient with hypertension and underlying coronary&#xD;
      artery disease, evaluated for entering a cardiac rehabilitation program. Patients that will&#xD;
      be judged suitable for the study will be randomized, with a 1:1 ratio, to interval training&#xD;
      or combined training the latter including both aerobic and resistance exercises. Each patient&#xD;
      will undergo three visits. At visit 1 in which patients will perform a first echocardiography&#xD;
      with evaluation of the acoustic window and an ergometric test (for excluding myocardial&#xD;
      ischemia and for establishing the training intensity); visit 2- acute evaluation- :patients&#xD;
      will undergo an echocardiographic assessment before and within 30 minutes after a single&#xD;
      exercise session (alternatively interval or combined training according to the randomization&#xD;
      code). Visit 3: at 12 weeks all patient will perform a final echocardiography evaluation and&#xD;
      a second ergometric test. Patients of both groups will exercise three times/week for 12&#xD;
      weeks. Each exercise session will last 45 minutes&#xD;
