  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Young cancer survivors are at higher risk of cancer reoccurrence, frailty, suicidal ideation,&#xD;
      sedentary behaviour, reduced quality of life, and reduced overall life expectancy, compared&#xD;
      to their siblings or healthy young persons. Development of new interventions after cancer&#xD;
      treatment is urgently needed in order to reduce and diminish these unwanted risks in young&#xD;
      cancer survivors. Previous studies have reported that wilderness therapy may reduce&#xD;
      anxiety/depression, improve body image and self-efficacy, and increase physical activity in&#xD;
      young adult cancer survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High quality randomized controlled studies are lacking and thereby urgently needed to&#xD;
      investigate the impact of wilderness programs on mental and physical health of adolescent and&#xD;
      young adult cancer survivors. The primary aim of this study is to conduct a pilot randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) on a wilderness program versus an attention-control activity in&#xD;
      adolescent and young adult cancer survivors. We will examine the feasibility of performing a&#xD;
      RCT and examine health outcomes, in preparation for a larger RCT with adolescent and young&#xD;
      adult cancer survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 40 adolescent and young adult cancer survivors (aged 16-39) will be randomized to&#xD;
      a wilderness intervention or an attention-control group. The wilderness intervention is a&#xD;
      one-week outdoor program where participants have individualized and group activities such as&#xD;
      climbing, hiking, kayaking, bush crafting and mindfulness. After this week, participants&#xD;
      continue a 3-month program to incorporate elements of the intervention into their daily life.&#xD;
      The control group will join a relaxing one-week holiday at a Wellness Center and will be&#xD;
      followed for 3 months to control for attention. Study outcomes will be recruitment speed,&#xD;
      willingness to be randomized, study adherence, self-reported mental health using validated&#xD;
      scales, and tests of physical activity and health (six-minute walk test, submaximal oxygen&#xD;
      uptake, blood pressure, sedentary behaviour and physical activity). Outcomes are measured at&#xD;
      the start of the study, 1 week and 3 months after intervention. One year follow up of&#xD;
      self-reported outcomes will be online. Findings of the study will provide important insights&#xD;
      into the feasibility of a large study as well as on ways by which wilderness therapy can&#xD;
      promote health in young cancer survivors.&#xD;

      Aim of the study The objective of the present study is to conduct a pilot randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) on a wilderness program versus an attention-control activity in&#xD;
      adolescent and young adult cancer survivors. We will examine the feasibility of performing a&#xD;
      RCT, in preparation for a larger RCT with adolescent and young adult cancer survivors, as&#xD;
      well as to investigate individuals' experience and safety of the wilderness program. To the&#xD;
      best of our knowledge, we are preparing the first RCT that will be undertaken to investigate&#xD;
      the impact of a wilderness program in adolescent and young adult cancer survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that the wilderness program is a highly appreciated and safe health&#xD;
      promotion intervention that may substantially benefit adolescent and young adult cancer&#xD;
      survivors, and that results of the proposed pilot study warrant further research with&#xD;
      adequate power to test for effectiveness in a larger RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RCT - Intake (Contact 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Young cancer survivors who are interested in participating will contact the researchers of&#xD;
      this study at Mid Sweden University via email or phone. The researchers will provide&#xD;
      information about the study, both verbally and written in an information letter to be sent by&#xD;
      post or email. The following tasks will be carried out at the intake interview:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening of inclusion and exclusion criteria,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explanation/information about the study and informed consent procedures,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explanation/information about the interventions and the randomisation procedure,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Check participants' willingness to be randomized, ask if they have a strong preference&#xD;
           for either intervention, and ask about their expectations of the interventions,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sending the information letter and informed consent forms, including a postage-paid&#xD;
           return envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation (Contact 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent from the participants will be obtained prior to randomisation. One&#xD;
      of the researchers of this study will also sign the informed consent form. After the signed&#xD;
      informed consent form has been received, young cancer survivors will be randomised for&#xD;
      participation in the study. All data of each randomized participant in the study will be&#xD;
      documented in a Case Report Form (CRF) that will be developed for this study. Participants&#xD;
      will be contacted by telephone and the following tasks will be carried out:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inform participants about the outcome of the randomisation procedure,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect demographic data (DD), medical history (MH), medication use (MU), concomitant&#xD;
           medication/therapies, dietary and lifestyle measures,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Instructions for using the step counter, one week before the start of intervention: All&#xD;
           participants that are randomized in the study will be send a step counter, to be used in&#xD;
           the week before the intervention,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sending the step counter and instructions for use to participants,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Instruction for measurements and timelines during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (Visit 1) All participants will travel for the intervention (8 days in total) to&#xD;
      Sundsvall, Sweden. At Day 1 of the intervention (Baseline, T=0), participants will perform&#xD;
      physical performance/fitness tests at Mid Sweden University under supervision of a test&#xD;
      leader from the Sweden Winter Sports Research Centre (Östersund, Sweden). After the tests,&#xD;
      participants in the intervention group will be transported to the wilderness site at Höga&#xD;
      Kusten, Västernorrland, Sweden. Participants will be provided with outdoor clothes, backpack,&#xD;
      tent, sleeping pads and sleeping bag. All other necessary outdoor equipment will be made&#xD;
      available through the facilitators. Participants in the control group will be transported to&#xD;
      a Wellness Center in Västernorrland. Before leaving for home, a plan for activities in the&#xD;
      three-month home program will be discussed with participants in the wilderness program group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three-months at home (Contact 3 and 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both groups will be followed during a 3-month period after the one-week&#xD;
      intervention. During this period, participants will be contacted by a facilitator via&#xD;
      telephone or other media after one month (Contact 3) and two months (Contact 4). The&#xD;
      following tasks will be carried out:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Documentation of concomitant medication/therapy use, dietary and lifestyle measures,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Documentation of adverse events that may have occurred,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Filling in the IPAQ,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results of the step counter during the week before Contact 3 and 4,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adherence and transference of participants to the agreed and planned activities at home&#xD;
           (wilderness program group only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (Visit 2; Re-visit) After three months, participants will return to Mid Sweden&#xD;
      University for follow up measures (T=2), as well as for two additional nights outdoor at Höga&#xD;
      Kusten to re-connect (intervention group) or two holiday nights at the Wellness canter&#xD;
      (Control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One year follow-up One year after start of the intervention (T=3), participants in both&#xD;
      groups will be contacted to fill in online self-reported questionnaires. Concomitant&#xD;
      medications/therapies, dietary and lifestyle measures will be documented as well as a recent&#xD;
      one-week measurement of step counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size No sample size calculation is needed for a pilot RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Participants will be randomized according to a randomization list as generated&#xD;
      by the Random Allocation Software Program using a random block size of 2 in order to&#xD;
      guarantee a balanced allocation. The two interventions (wilderness therapy versus&#xD;
      attention-control are assigned to intervention A and intervention B and upon intake&#xD;
      participants will receive a screening number ranging from 01 to 100. Participants who drop&#xD;
      out of the study before being randomized will keep their screening number without receiving&#xD;
      an intervention. On enrolment in the study, participants that are randomized receive an&#xD;
      intervention number (01-110). The study numbers are sequentially allocated to the&#xD;
      participants in the order of inclusion in the randomized intervention period. Each&#xD;
      participant will receive only that intervention which is labeled with the study number&#xD;
      allocated to him/her. Participants will be stratified according to age group (16-22 and 23-30&#xD;
      and 31-39) and gender (male/female) in order to achieve equal distribution among the two&#xD;
      groups. Per stratification, separate randomization lists will be generated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Regular descriptive statistics will be calculated with regard to demographical and&#xD;
      categorical data and mean scores and standard deviations of the numerical variables will be&#xD;
      calculated using SPSS (version 25.0). As a first step, preliminary mean differences between,&#xD;
      and within groups (over time changes) will be calculated using students t-test, related&#xD;
      samples t-test, and R-ANOVA analysis. As a second step, the Aickin separation test will be&#xD;
      applied to the domains of the MMQL and other outcome measures to determine whether there are&#xD;
      indications of differences, even if obtained p-values are non-significant. If indications of&#xD;
      differences are identified with the Aickin separation test it provides information whether a&#xD;
      further larger RCT is warranted. The Aickin separation test is used for early phase trials to&#xD;
      determine whether the data are 1) in the hypothesized direction, 2) counter to the&#xD;
      hypothesized direction or 3) equivocal. Results in the hypothesized direction warrant further&#xD;
      research with adequate power to test for effectiveness.&#xD;

The program is designed to encourage participants to connect with nature as to experience gratitude for the richness of the natural world, a sense of calmness and trust upon spending time in nature, and to be more physically active in nature.&#xD;
Elements previously described Participants will continue in a three-month program at home (on-line supported) after the initial 8-days in order to empower participants to incorporate elements of the onsite wilderness program into their daily life. An individualized a plan for activities will be developed together with the participant.&#xD;
After three months, there will be a re-visit with follow up on outcome measures and reconnection.</description>
