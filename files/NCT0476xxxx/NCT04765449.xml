  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will study the safety and efficacy of COVID-19-specific T cells when&#xD;
      given as treatment to adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) with a COVID-19 infection. This&#xD;
      immunologic treatment is aimed at patients, who are at high risk of progression due to their&#xD;
      advanced age, or other underlying health conditions. The outcomes of patients receiving the T&#xD;
      cells (Arm A) will be compared to patients treated with standard of care (Arm B).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      T cells that recognize COVID-19 peptides will be manufactured at Thomas Jefferson University&#xD;
      and are frozen and ready for use. The T cells have to have an immune protein called HLA in&#xD;
      common with a patient to work. If a patient enrolled on the COVID-19 study has this HLA, they&#xD;
      will receive a dose of the COVID-19 T cells. Groups of 3-6 patients will be treated at each&#xD;
      testing dose level. There are four dose levels of T cells: 1 x 105/kg, 3 x 105/kg, 1 x&#xD;
      106/kg, and 3 x 106/kg. Patients will receive the T cells intravenously in the hospital and&#xD;
      be monitored there for 4 days before being discharged. Before discharge, patients will be&#xD;
      taught to take and record their temperature, blood pressure, and oxygen levels (using a&#xD;
      finger monitor) at home. After discharge, study staff will continue to monitor patient&#xD;
      symptoms and recordings with video visits or phone calls daily until the monitoring period of&#xD;
      14 days is over. Patients will also be asked to give blood samples 7, 14, 28, days and 2, 3,&#xD;
      and 6 months after the T cells are given. Patients who meet study criteria and wish to&#xD;
      participate but do not have the HLA protein in common with the T cells, will be monitored by&#xD;
      study personnel in their own homes for the full 14 day period. These patients will also be&#xD;
      taught to take and record their temperature, blood pressure, and oxygen level. Study&#xD;
      personnel will contact them daily by video or voice calls and check on the results of their&#xD;
      readings and their symptoms. These patients may be treated with any standard or experimental&#xD;
      COVID-19 therapy. How patients handle their COVID-19 infection will be compared between the&#xD;
      group of people receiving the T cells and the group of people who do not receive the T cells.&#xD;

    <description>Patients who have an HLA antigen in common with COVID-19 fighting T cells will be admitted to the hospital and receive the COVID-19 T cells. They will be premedicated with diphenhydramine and acetaminophen before the cells are infused intravenously. The patients will be monitored for side effects for at least 4 days prior to discharge. Close monitoring will continue in the patients' homes for 14 days. Three to six patients will receive a specific dose of T cells, and then if there are no serious side effects, the dose will be increased for the next group of patients. There are 4 doses of T cells to be tested, and each patient will complete a 14 day monitoring period before the next patient can be treated.</description>

    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients in the observation arm will not have inherited an HLA antigen in common with the COVID-19 T cells and so cannot receive the T cells. They will be monitored by the study staff for the 14 day monitoring period in their homes. They will be taught to record their own blood pressure, temperature, and oxygen level (pulse oximetry) at home and report this information, as well as their progress in getting over the COVID-19 infection, to the study staff every day by phone. The outcomes of patients on arm B will be compared to the outcomes of patients treated on Arm A to see if the T cells made a difference in how patients recovered from COVID-19. Patients in Arm B are not prevented from being treated with any available COVID-19 therapy.</description>
