  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, multi-center, ambispective cohort study in real world to&#xD;
      describe the effectiveness and safety profile in patients with EGFR mutation-positive&#xD;
      advanced NSCLC treated with dacomitinib (Vizimpro®) as the first-line treatment followed by&#xD;
      3rd generation EGFR-TKI in case the T790M resistance mutation was developed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center observational study with both retrospective and prospective data&#xD;
      collections to describe the effectiveness and safety of sequential dacomitinib and 3rd&#xD;
      generation EGFR-TKI used in patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC with T790M-aquired&#xD;
      resistance in a clinical practice setting. The study will include patients who were or will&#xD;
      be diagnosed as advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutation positive and received dacomitinib as&#xD;
      first-line treatment followed by second-line 3rd generation EGFR-TKI treatment in multiple&#xD;
      tertiary care hospitals after Sep 1st, 2019. Patients' clinical information prior to the&#xD;
      study initiation in each hospital will be collected retrospectively through chart review.&#xD;
      After the study initiation, new patient enrollment will last till Dec 2022. Patients'&#xD;
      clinical care after the study initiation will be followed up prospectively until the end of&#xD;
      study. The interval of response evaluation is recommended to be every 2 to 3 months in the&#xD;
      treatment period and the interval of follow-up is recommended to be every 2 to 3 months in&#xD;
      the post-treatment period till the end of study in the prospective data collection period.&#xD;
