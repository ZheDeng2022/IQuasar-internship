  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this online study, investigators will explore the psychosocial burdens of swallowing&#xD;
      difficulties in people with Parkinson's Disease. This study is completely virtual, so you can&#xD;
      participate from wherever you live in the United States. Participation requires you to&#xD;
      complete a one-hour Zoom interview and a brief questionnaire. You will be compensated with a&#xD;
      $25 Walmart gift card. To learn more, please use the &quot;send email&quot; feature. Thank you!&#xD;

      This is a mixed methods study. The investigators will collect qualitative data from&#xD;
      participants by conducting 1-2 hour semi-structured interviews on Zoom. The interview&#xD;
      questions are designed to systemically inquire about patient experiences, affective&#xD;
      reactions, coping strategies, social support, self-identity issues, and treatment&#xD;
      experiences. The investigators will collect quantitative data by asking participants to&#xD;
      complete The Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire. The data will be analyzed using a&#xD;
      comprehensive stress and coping model, which has not been done previously in the field. The&#xD;
      investigators hope to discover themes about psychosocial burdens and related coping&#xD;
      mechanisms.&#xD;

    <measure>Identification of the Impact of Swallowing Impairment on Individuals with Parkinson Disease as Expressed During Interviews</measure>
    <time_frame>To be assessed from the participant interviews through study completion, an average of 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>A 1-2 hour, semi-structured interview will be conducted with each participant on Zoom to identify patient experiences, affective reactions, coping strategies, social support, self-identity issues, and treatment experiences associated with swallowing impairment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Score on Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (Brief IPQ) as Self-Reported by Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>The Brief IPQ will be mailed to participants after their interview and asked to complete it and return it to us within one week.</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief IPQ is a self-report survey that contains nine items that quantify the cognitive and emotional representations of an illness. It has good test-retest reliability and concurrent validity with relevant measures in a few populations with chronic disease. Scores range from 0 (i.e., illness has no effect on life) to 80 points (i.e., illness extremely effects various aspects of life).</description>
