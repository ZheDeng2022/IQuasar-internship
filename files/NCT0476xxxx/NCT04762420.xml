    <textblock>
      Many clinicians continue to rely on subjective evaluation in making decisions about the&#xD;
      adequacy of neuromuscular function before tracheal extubation rather than using quantitative&#xD;
      monitoring. The aim was to compare the sugammadex dose as suggested by senior&#xD;
      anaesthesiologists (SSD) based on clinical experience versus the dose determined by&#xD;
      quantitative monitoring (QSD) to determine if the subjective dose was appropriate.&#xD;

      Materials and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining approval from the Institute Ethics Committee, a prospective 3-month study in&#xD;
      patients aged 18-75 years who underwent general anesthesia with rocuronium (initial dose 0.6&#xD;
      mg/kg) NMB and subsequent reversal with sugammadex, was carried out. American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists (ASA ) physical status V, emergency surgery, patients with hypersensitivity&#xD;
      history to rocuronium or sugammadex, severe renal impairment/dialysis, neuromuscular&#xD;
      diseases, severe hepatic disease, pre-existing coagulopathies and pregnancy were excluded.&#xD;
      Monitoring included ASA standard monitoring, bispectral index and NMB monitoring using&#xD;
      TOFscan® monitor. The senior anaesthesiologist was blinded to the TOFscan®, which was only&#xD;
      available to the author.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of pharmacologic reversal of NMB, both the sugammadex dose proposed by the&#xD;
      anaesthesiologist (SSD) and the dose suggested by TOFscan® (QSD) according to the Portuguese&#xD;
      recommendations for the management of NMB were recorded. Afterwards the QSD was administered&#xD;
      to overcome ethical issues. When train-of-four (TOF) count was 0, the author performed the&#xD;
      post tetanic count (PTC) stimulus to determine the recommended dose. The SSD was considered&#xD;
      appropriate if it was within 10% of the QSD for the depth of NMB. All patients were extubated&#xD;
      with a TOF ratio &gt; 0.9 (TOFr) and both the rocuronium and sugammadex dose were calculated&#xD;
      based on the real patient weight. Data regarding anaesthesia, duration of anaesthesia and&#xD;
      dosing pattern of rocuronium were also noted. The results were analysed descriptively.&#xD;

The QSD was then administered to the patient. The SSD was considered appropriate if it was within 10% of the recommended dose for the given depth of NMB, as measured by TOFscan® monitor.
