  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains a health burden in people living with human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Interferon (IFN)-based therapy is the treatment of choice for&#xD;
      HCV infection for HIV coinfected patients in earlier years. However, the treatment responses&#xD;
      are far from ideal and the treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) are frequently&#xD;
      encountered. Based on the excellent efficacy and safety, IFN-free direct acting antivirals&#xD;
      (DAAs) have been the mainstay of therapy for HCV. Furthermore, the world health organization&#xD;
      (WHO) has set the goal of global HCV elimination by 2030. The microelimination of HCV among&#xD;
      HIV/HCV-coinfected patients is also listed as the prioritized target by WHO. Although the&#xD;
      overall treatment response has improved dramatically during the past 5-10 years, several&#xD;
      studies have indicated the HIV/HCV-coinfected patients had high risks of reinfection&#xD;
      following successful antiviral treatment. The risk of HCV reinfection was reported to be&#xD;
      24.6% among HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) in Austria, German, France and the&#xD;
      United Kingdom who attained sustained virologic response (SVR) by IFN-based therapy. Two&#xD;
      recent studies from Canada showed that the incidence of HCV reinfection in HIV-positive&#xD;
      patients was higher that HIV-negative patients (3.44 vs. 1.13 per 100 person-year; 2.56 vs.&#xD;
      1.12 per 100 person-year). In Taiwan, 14.1% of the HIV-positive patients had HCV reinfection&#xD;
      following treatment-induced or spontaneous viral clearance, resulting an incidence of 8.2 per&#xD;
      100 person-year with a total of 218.3 person-years of follow-up for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because data regarding to the HCV reinfection in HIV-positive patients are still limited,&#xD;
      where a more comprehensive assessment of HCV reinfection is important based on the&#xD;
      perspectives of HCV microelimination among HIV-positive patients in Taiwan, the investigators&#xD;
      thus aim to conduct a long-term, large-scale cohort study to assess the risk of HCV&#xD;
      reinfection in HIV-positive patients achieving SVR after IFN-based or IFN-free therapies, and&#xD;
      to assess the factors associated with different risks of reinfection in these patients.&#xD;

      Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains a health burden in people living with human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Compared to the midpoint prevalence rate of HCV coinfection to&#xD;
      be 2.4% in the general HIV-positive population, the prevalence rates are higher among&#xD;
      bisexual men (4.0%), gay men (6.4%), and people who inject drugs (PWIDs) (82.4%). Following&#xD;
      the widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV which improves the health outcome&#xD;
      by reducing the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related deaths, the liver-related&#xD;
      death has become a frequent cause of non-AIDS-related deaths in HIV-positive population. If&#xD;
      HCV is left untreated, the HIV/HCV-coinfected patients may have higher risks of developing&#xD;
      hepatic decompensation or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) than HCV-monoinfected patients due&#xD;
      to the accelerated progression of hepatic fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interferon (IFN)-based therapy is the treatment of choice for HCV infection for HIV&#xD;
      coinfected patients in earlier years. However, the treatment responses are far from ideal and&#xD;
      the treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) are frequently encountered. Based on the&#xD;
