  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a mental illness with a variety of clinical symptoms that can be regrouped&#xD;
      into 2 categories: positive and negative symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This mental illness is also characterised by cognitive alterations in various fields,&#xD;
      including social cognition difficulties and self / non-self-discrimination difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self and non-self-discrimination abilities have been regrouped under a function called source&#xD;
      memory. This source memory enables a person to identify the source of an information&#xD;
      previously encoded. In our everyday life, these processes are necessary to distinguish events&#xD;
      generated by an external source from imagined events. It is called reality monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of studies have evidenced reality-monitoring alterations in patients suffering from&#xD;
      schizophrenia. More specifically, patients would present with an externalisation bias, they&#xD;
      would assign more imagined events to an external source. The knowledge of these deficits&#xD;
      encourages the study of the processes involved in order to better understand the alterations,&#xD;
      particularly including auditory processes. A recent study has shown that discrimination&#xD;
      errors concerning certain sound characteristics (e.g. frequency) were associated to reality&#xD;
      monitoring errors. However, the links between reality-monitoring and basic auditory processes&#xD;
      have rarely been explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dysfunction of the auditory &quot;where&quot; path, especially the possibility to discriminate&#xD;
      between the intra and extra cephalic localisation of sounds, could lead to difficulties to&#xD;
      discern between what is produced by one self and what is produced by another or the local&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to study the links between source memory deficits and&#xD;
      externalization abilities in schizophrenic patients and healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, this study will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluate the impact of emotional content on the ability to externalize an auditory&#xD;
           perception&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluate the abilities to separate sources concerning vocal stimuli&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluate the basic auditory processes In order to meet the objectives, the correlation&#xD;
           between the percentage of good attributions in the reality monitoring task and the&#xD;
           percentage of correct perceptions in/out (sound perceived as coming from inside or&#xD;
           outside the head) will be analyzed in the externalization task in patients suffering&#xD;
           from schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will also be analyzed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the number of correct perceptions In/Out in the externalization task&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the number of correct perceptions In/Out for the emotional stimuli&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the detection level of difference in pitch between 2 vocal sources pour the height&#xD;
           discrimination task&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the number of correctly identified words in the speech-in-speech task&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tasks :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo a battery of cognitive and auditory experiments in order to answer the&#xD;
      objectives and hypothesis. The duration of the entire experiments will be 3.30 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Subjects will undergo the source monitoring task (30 min):&#xD;
&#xD;
      This task is divided in 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  one part that will evaluate the reality monitoring performances (LISTENING task).&#xD;
           Subjects either have to listen to words or imagine themselves listening to words&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  another part evaluating internal source monitoring performances (SAY task). Subjects&#xD;
           either have to pronounce words or imagine themselves pronouncing words.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In order to measure perception abilities, all subjects will undergo a battery of&#xD;
                psychoacoustic tests (30 min) including the Tone Matching Task (TMT) which&#xD;
                evaluates the capacity of discriminating static pitch. The battery is also composed&#xD;
                of tasks measuring length, amplitude, etc…&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A yes / no discrimination task will be used to measure the externalization&#xD;
                abilities: subjects will have to discern whether a sound is perceived as coming&#xD;
                from inside or outside the head&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the ability to separate sources will be measured using 2 paradigms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a pitch discrimination task (30 min): it will evaluate the capacity to discern sources&#xD;
           based on voice pitch&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a speech-in-speech task (30 min): target words are presented simultaneously to masks&#xD;
           (composed of words time reversed so that have lost the semantic content). The subject&#xD;
           has to listen and repeat the words heard.&#xD;
