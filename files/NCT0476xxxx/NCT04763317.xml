  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the use of a prostate cancer specific predisposition genetic&#xD;
      panel test in men with / at high risk of prostate cancer. The genetic test will analyse men's&#xD;
      DNA samples for the presence of mutations in rare genes as well as common genetic variation&#xD;
      to provide men with information about their risk of prostate cancer. This study will evaluate&#xD;
      the clinical impact of the test on risk assessment and clinical management in terms of&#xD;
      screening and treatment.&#xD;

        There are two pathways for men to be approached about this study; first eligible men will&#xD;
        be identified and approached by their clinical team in Urology and Uro-Oncology clinics at&#xD;
        the Royal Marsden. Second, men already under the care of the Oncogenetics Research team due&#xD;
        to their family history of prostate cancer and who meet the eligibility criteria will be&#xD;
        given information about the study as deemed appropriate by the research clinician who has&#xD;
        been managing their care (Research Nurse or Clinical Research Fellow).&#xD;
