      The purpose of this multi-center, double-blinded pilot study is to determine if extra virgin&#xD;
      olive oil (EVOO) has a positive effect on HDL cholesterol levels and anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      markers for subjects diagnosed with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to determine if the&#xD;
      polyphenol concentration is proportional to those effects. Subjects will complete consecutive&#xD;
      28-day periods (with a 14-day washout between) in which they will either consume the low&#xD;
      polyphenol concentration EVOO daily or the high polyphenol concentration EVOO. In a&#xD;
      double-blinded manner, each subject will be his or her own control with a 14-day washout&#xD;
      between study periods. HDL levels and other parameters will be measured after each period of&#xD;
      the protocol. The investigators anticipate HDL levels will improve with both olive oils. The&#xD;
      investigators expect the high polyphenol concentration EVOO will show a greater effect than&#xD;
      the EVOO with a low polyphenol concentration. EVOO with high polyphenol concentration may be&#xD;
      a simple method to reduce the risk of secondary CVD events.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multi-center, double-blinded pilot study to determine if extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) has&#xD;
      a positive effect on HDL cholesterol levels and anti-inflammatory markers for subjects&#xD;
      diagnosed with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to determine if the polyphenol concentration&#xD;
      is proportional to those effects. Subjects will complete consecutive 28-day periods (with a&#xD;
      14-day washout between) in which they will either consume the low polyphenol concentration&#xD;
      EVOO daily or the high polyphenol concentration EVOO. In a double-blinded manner, each&#xD;
      subject will be his or her own control with a 14-day washout between study periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will demonstrate greater improvements in HDL cholesterol levels, other lipid&#xD;
      parameters, and inflammatory markers by adding EVOO to their diets. Consumption of EVOO with&#xD;
      high polyphenol concentration will improve these parameters more than consumption of EVOO&#xD;
      with low polyphenol concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if daily consumption of EVOO will increase HDL cholesterol levels after 28&#xD;
           days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if daily consumption of high polyphenol concentration EVOO increases HDL&#xD;
           cholesterol levels more than EVOO with a low polyphenol concentration (same dosing).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the feasibility of this type of study and the possibility of a larger study&#xD;
           over a longer time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to enrolling subjects, the study staff will order a generic brand EVOO through the&#xD;
      hospital nutritional services department. At the same time, EVOO with a reported high&#xD;
      polyphenol concentration will be ordered from a local olive oil specialty store.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Olive oil testing: Eurofins Microbiology Laboratories, Inc. will test a sample of each batch&#xD;
      of olive oil for polyphenol concentration prior to dispensing. The method is based on direct&#xD;
      extraction of the biophenolic minor polar compounds from olive oil by means of a methanol&#xD;
      solution and subsequent quantification by HPLC-MS/MS. Commercially available polyphenol&#xD;
      standards are used to identify and quantify individual phenolic compounds, focusing on those&#xD;
      most abundant in olive oils.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subject blood testing: Approximately 20 ml of blood will be obtained at five different&#xD;
      study visits for a total of 100 ml of blood over 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline serum and plasma blood samples will be taken prior to olive oil supplementation.&#xD;
      Follow-up blood samples will be taken at four other times points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum total lipid profiles will be evaluated in the mass spectrometry core at the Maine&#xD;
      Medical Center Research Institute (MMCRI). Additionally, inflammatory markers, including CRP,&#xD;
      IL-6 and TNFalpha, will be determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Serum&#xD;
      will be prepared by collecting 10 ml of blood into red cap tubes. Blood will be allowed to&#xD;
      coagulate for 15-20 minutes at room temperature and then centrifuged at 1500 - 2000g, and the&#xD;
      supernatant pipetted off and stored frozen at -65ºC. Plasma samples will be prepared from 6&#xD;
      ml of blood collected into 10 ml ACD (Acid Citrate Dextrose) anticoagulant tubes and&#xD;
      processed within 1h. The white blood cell fraction will be prepared by centrifugation at&#xD;
      1,500-2000g for 15 minutes. The middle layer of white cells will be pipetted off and stored&#xD;
      frozen at -60ºC. The investigators will determine the lipidomic profiles of white blood cells&#xD;
      as well as caveolin-1 protein levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lipid panels, which test total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, and triglycerides, will be run on&#xD;
      remaining blood samples at the local laboratory. All blood testing- associated costs will be&#xD;
      paid for with study funds from the MaineHealth Cardiology Service Line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other study measures: Vital signs including body weight, blood pressure and heart rate will&#xD;
      be measured at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will maintain a study diary documenting each dose of EVOO. They will be asked to&#xD;
      measure out 1 ounce of olive oil in a cup given to them by the study team, and consume it&#xD;
      with bread, in a smoothie, or by drinking it plain. Compliance with EVOO consumption will be&#xD;
      calculated from the diary (%). Study compliance will also be measured by ounces of product&#xD;
      returned (%). Subjects receive 30 ounces of EVOO to cover 28 days, therefore, 2 ounces of&#xD;
      returned olive oil after each study arm will be counted as 100% compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is a pilot study, the investigators utilized data available in the literature to&#xD;
      estimate sample size. A study evaluating the effect of HDL on older age life expectancy&#xD;
      reported a mean HDL of 47.5 with a standard deviation of 12.1 among subjects who lived to be&#xD;
      older than 85 years. Using this estimate, and anticipating to find a 3 point difference in&#xD;
      HDL among the two study groups, the investigators need to recruit 276 participants. However,&#xD;
      as this is a pilot study and the investigators have limited funding, they will start by&#xD;
      recruiting 90 subjects. With additional funding secured from a grant in the future, the study&#xD;
      could be expanded in order to achieve the desired power of 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purpose of this study, the investigators will attempt to detect differences in HDL&#xD;
      and other biomarkers of cardiovascular health in subjects who consumed both low polyphenol&#xD;
      concentration vs. high polyphenol concentration EVOO. Medical record numbers will not be&#xD;
      included in the dataset for analysis. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the&#xD;
      demographic and clinical characteristics of subjects included in the study, with continuous&#xD;
      variables presented as a mean +- standard deviation and categorical variables as&#xD;
      frequencies/percentages of the total. Student t tests and chi-squared tests will be conducted&#xD;
      to compare data between the low vs. high polyphenol EVOO groups. A time series plot will be&#xD;
      generated in order to demonstrate the change in HDL over time by level of polyphenol&#xD;
      consumed.&#xD;
