  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the progression time and efficacy of brain tumors in&#xD;
      patients with brain metastases from HER2-positive breast cancer treated with Pyrrolidine and&#xD;
      Capecitabine combined with brain radiotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastases are very common in HER2-positive breast cancer patients. The vast majority&#xD;
      of patients with metastatic brain tumors are in advanced stages of the disease. If not&#xD;
      treated in time, the natural course of the disease is extremely short. At present, the main&#xD;
      treatment of brain metastases from breast cancer is radiotherapy, combined with chemotherapy&#xD;
      and targeted therapy drugs. On the basis of previous clinical studies, the aim of this study&#xD;
      was to explore the efficacy and safety of combined brachytherapy with Pyrrotidine and&#xD;
      Capecitabine in patients with brain metastases from HER2-positive breast cancer, in order to&#xD;
      provide a new, safer and more effective treatment for patients with brain metastases from&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
