    <textblock>
      The patient outcome in cardiac surgery is substantially linked to the occurrence of&#xD;
      hyperglycemia. Qatar ranks 5th in the rate of diabetes globally; Moreover diabetics comprise&#xD;
      more than 40% of patients admitted to the cardiac surgery intensive care unit (CTICU) in&#xD;
      Qatar heart hospital. This prevalence is higher than the rest of the world. These numbers are&#xD;
      projected to increase with accompanied morbidity-mortality hazardous by 2030 if the adequate&#xD;
      intervention will not be directed towards better control of blood sugar within ICU and the&#xD;
      hospital stay. The overall objective of this project is to explore the immunological profile&#xD;
      in patients with poor glycemic control within their intensive care unit stay in Qatar. 'time&#xD;
      in range' (TIR) was used for defining glycemic control within the ICU, where patients with&#xD;
      time in range more than 80%, (in presence or absence of debates), had better outcomes than&#xD;
      those with time in range less than 80% TIR. Notably, regarding wound infection, lengths of&#xD;
      ventilation and ICU stay; they were not candidates to recurrent hypoglycemic episodes also.&#xD;
      The high HbA1C preoperatively is probably a valid forecaster of indigent glycemic control.&#xD;
      Previous studies demonstrated conversion of non-diabetics to diabetics when they face stress&#xD;
      of critical illness. No previous studies explored this possible conversion cardiac surgery.&#xD;
      Our primary objectives will be to determine whether non-diabetic patients with poor glycemic&#xD;
      control in cardiac surgery would develop subsequent diabetes later on. Investigators will&#xD;
      follow up non-diabetics patients after 3 months to satisfy this aim. Investigators will&#xD;
      include all patients who will undergo cardiac surgery over two years from the time of&#xD;
      approval without evidence of diabetes as documented by glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C). Patients&#xD;
      will be followed up to one year with laboratory investigations to document whether they will&#xD;
      develop diabetes or not. Data will be stored and statistically analyzed. Investigators expect&#xD;
      to have details about the possible conversion in this high-risk population.&#xD;

      Critically ill patients frequently suffer from acute hyperglycemia, (a blood glucose level of&#xD;
      more than 6.1 mmol/L (110 mg/dL)) and is observed in around 90 percent of ICU patients.&#xD;
      Additionally, insulin resistance is expected in more than 80 percent of the critically ill&#xD;
      which contributes to the problem. The hypothalamic-pituitary axis, sympathetic adrenergic&#xD;
      system, and circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha&#xD;
      (TNF-α) and interleukins modulate hyperglycemia during stress. The seriousness of illness as&#xD;
      expressed by the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation score (APACHE II), injury&#xD;
      severity, surgery type and the Glasgow Coma Scale correlate with catecholamine and cortisol&#xD;
      levels. Catecholamines are released mainly from the adrenal medulla. Multiple effects are&#xD;
      assumed to be due to the surge of stress hormones (cardiovascular, immune and metabolic)&#xD;
      targeting restoration of homeostasis during stress. Excessive glycogenolysis,&#xD;
      gluconeogenesis, and insulin resistance characterize the neuroendocrine stress response.&#xD;
      Increased hepatic output of glucose is predominantly the reason of stress hyperglycemia.&#xD;
      Mediated through the liver adrenaline and noradrenaline excite gluconeogenesis and&#xD;
      glycogenolysis; the latter has additional effects of enhancing glycerol provisions through&#xD;
      lipolysis in the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the emergence of insulin resistance could be due to the release of adipokines&#xD;
      from adipose tissue during critical illness. Downgrading of insulin signal transduction is&#xD;
      associated with increased TNF-α due to phosphorylation of different molecules straight over&#xD;
      the path of insulin-signaling. Glucose redistribution from peripheral tissues towards immune&#xD;
      cells during infection could be mediated by variable regulation of glucose transporter-1 and&#xD;
      glucose transporter-4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contributing factors for acute hyperglycemia during critical illness includes the concomitant&#xD;
      secretion of additional stress hormones and the use of medications (steroids, lithium,&#xD;
      vasopressors, inotropes and β-blockers). Intravenous glucose solutions, overfeeding,&#xD;
      parenteral nutrition, and antibiotic and dialysis solutions, also precipitate hyperglycemia.&#xD;
      Insulin deficiency or hypovolemia may also lead to hyperglycemia. Peripheral insulin&#xD;
      resistance could be promoted with bed rest even without an obvious disease. Bed rest causes&#xD;
      reduced skeletal muscle glucose uptake. Hyperglycemia in critically ill diabetics is an&#xD;
      integration of pancreatic β-cell secretory disorders and insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequences of hyperglycemia in the Critically ill patients: in different ICU populations&#xD;
      Short-term drawbacks of hyperglycemia include effects on fluid balance through glycosuria and&#xD;
      subsequently dehydration. Hyperglycemia associated with white blood cell abnormalities which&#xD;
      could impair the complement pathway. Mitochondrial protein could be damaged with&#xD;
      hyperglycemia, amplification of inflammatory pathways, altered innate immune system, and&#xD;
      downgrading of endothelial functions. The peripheral blood flow could be compromised due to&#xD;
      the reduction in endothelial nitric oxide and vascular reactivity with hyperglycemia. Acute&#xD;
      hyperglycemia boosts proteolysis and is accompanied by a high risk of cardiac complications,&#xD;
      electro-myocardial alteration, hemodynamic compromise, acute kidney injury, and death.&#xD;
      Therefore poor clinical outcome and complications are associated with hyperglycemia. The&#xD;
      persistence of hyperglycemia for a longer time distinctly associated with pediatric&#xD;
      population outcome as expressed by morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Individual ICU populations, the risk of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia increased in&#xD;
      patients with sepsis. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines recommend keeping the blood&#xD;
      sugar below 10mmol/L. In neuro-critical care improved neurological outcome was observed with&#xD;
      glucose control in patients, with a less strict glycemic target (7.7-10mmol/L). The impact of&#xD;
      hyperglycemia was quantified in a meta-analysis for patients who had acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction. Postoperatively, intensive glucose control was associated with reduced acute&#xD;
      heart failure, myocardial infarction, and death in vascular surgeries. Reduced death,&#xD;
      infections and post-operative atrial fibrillation were observed after cardiac surgery with&#xD;
      moderate blood sugar control. Interestingly, in a recent systemic review and meta-analysis&#xD;
      stress hyperglycemia was associated with increased risk of subsequent diabetes in the&#xD;
      critically ill. No previous studies went through future development of diabetes or impaired&#xD;
      glucose tolerance after cardiac surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Objectives Primary objective : incident of developing diabetes and pre diabetes in&#xD;
           patient with post operative stress hyperglycemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The study will be a prospective cohort study&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Investigators will select patient without diabetes who will undergo cardiac&#xD;
                surgery, patient will be divided into two groups group 1) Patients with&#xD;
                uncontrolled blood sugar in the ICU; and group 2) patient with adequate control of&#xD;
                blood sugar in ICU settings&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The sample size will be calculated based on previous studies in critically ill&#xD;
                patients&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subject inclusion and exclusion criteria Inclusion criteria: 1. Adult males and&#xD;
                females above the age of 18 years subjected to cardiac surgery, 2. Acceptance to&#xD;
                perform the study protocol and participate throughout the whole trial period&#xD;
                (consent approval prior to participation), 3. Understanding the risks and benefits&#xD;
                of the study and having signed a written informed consent. Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
                Diabetics. Patients who refuse to participate or who /can not sign informed&#xD;
                consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time in range (TIR), will be used to define the groups within the study, it is a measure of&#xD;
      time where the blood glucose stays within the set target range. Our group point that it is it&#xD;
      an easy measure that could be encountered without specific demands; therefore, it could be&#xD;
      simply utilized in any ICU. Investigators will calculate the whole time of intravenous&#xD;
      insulin infusion (A) and the time being within the set goal range (B) during intravenous&#xD;
      insulin infusion and expressed TIR as TIR = (B/A) × 100. Our previous study showed that&#xD;
      patients with more than 80% time in range, whether or not they had existing diabetes, had&#xD;
      better outcomes than those with less than 80% time in range, as expressed by wound infection&#xD;
      complication, duration of mechanical ventilation, and ICU length of stay. In addition, they&#xD;
      were not candidates for recurrent hypoglycemic attacks. (27) Outcome measures Factors&#xD;
      assessed at admission to the ICU will include age, gender, ethnicity, diabetes history,&#xD;
      glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), hypertension history, and surgery type. Investigators will&#xD;
      record anesthesia time, cardiopulmonary bypass time (CPP), aortic cross clamp (ACC) time,&#xD;
      utilization of inotropes and vasopressors, blood transfusion, Euro SCORE, medications&#xD;
      including (statin therapy, steroids, vasopressors, and inotropes) length of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, length of stay in the ICU and the hospital length of stay. Complications and&#xD;
      outcomes, including acute kidney injury (AKI), post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF),&#xD;
      nosocomial infection, stroke, wound infection, and death, will reported for each patient.&#xD;
      Data will be retrieved from an established database Dendrite Clinical Systems® (London, UK).&#xD;
      Outcomes will be compared in subgroups of diabetics and non-diabetics, and factors associated&#xD;
      with poor glycemic control will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes and follow up An outpatient visit will be planned approximately three months after&#xD;
      ICU discharge. At the time of this visit, Investigators will obtain age, BMI, waist&#xD;
      circumference, diet, exercise, history of hypertension and family and personal history of&#xD;
      elevated blood glucose to calculate the Finnish diabetes risk score (FINDRISC) questionnaire.&#xD;
      (28) Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) will be performed according to the guidelines of the&#xD;
      World Health Organization (WHO) with 75-g glucose load. Diabetes will be diagnosed according&#xD;
      to the American Diabetes Association guidelines that stat fasting plasma glucose ≥126&#xD;
      mg/dl(7mmol/L) and/or 2-h plasma glucose during the OGTT ≥200 mg/dl (11.1mmol/L) and/or HbA1c&#xD;
      ≥6.5 % (48 mmol/L); impaired glucose tolerance is noted when 2-h plasma glucose during the&#xD;
      OGTT is between 140-200 mg/dl (7.7-11.1mmol/L). Impaired fasting glucose defined as fasting&#xD;
      plasma glucose between 100-126 mg/dl (55.7mmol/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the percentage of development of diabetes in non-diabetics after&#xD;
      cardiac surgery The secondary outcome will be to identify whether those patients who are&#xD;
      non-diabetics associated with increased morbidity in terms of ICU stay, post-operative atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation (POAF), hospital acquired infections, and late wound infections&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize and determine the sample characteristics and&#xD;
      distribution of various considered parameters related to demographic, presenting signs and&#xD;
      symptoms, clinical features, post-operative outcome measures etc. The normally distributed&#xD;
      data and results will be reported with mean and standard deviation (SD) with corresponding&#xD;
      95% confidence interval (CI); the remaining results will be reported with median and&#xD;
      inter-quartile range (IQR). Categorical data will be summarized using frequencies and&#xD;
      percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The focus of the data analysis in this study will be to determine the incident of developing&#xD;
      diabetes and pre diabetes in patient with post-operative stress hyperglycemia. Associations&#xD;
      between two or more qualitative variables will be assessed using Chi-square (χ2) or Fisher&#xD;
      Exact tests as appropriate. Quantitative outcome measures between two independent groups will&#xD;
      be analyzed using unpaired t or Mann Whitney U test depending on the normality of the data&#xD;
      distribution. Concentration-time profiles for blood glucose, serum insulin and other related&#xD;
      quantitative outcome measures will be analyzed as their respective areas under the curve&#xD;
      (AUC) from baseline to specific post-baseline time points, with analysis across groups&#xD;
      (normal, prediabetes, diabetes) performed by linear regression, with results presented as the&#xD;
      marginal group means (95% CI) and associated p value. The impact of different potential&#xD;
      covariates and factors will be assessed using multivariate linear regression model.&#xD;
      Longitudinal changes in data across time points will be analyzed using a mixed model ANOVA.&#xD;
      The relationship between incident of developing diabetes and pre diabetes in patient with&#xD;
      post-operative stress hyperglycemia and main intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors (predictor&#xD;
      or risk factors) will be estimated by deriving odds ratios (ORs) from logistic regression&#xD;
      model and results will be presented and reported in odds ratio (OR) and associated 95% CI. A&#xD;
      two-sided P value &lt;0.05 will be considered to be statistically significant. All statistical&#xD;
      analyses will be done using statistical packages SPSS 23.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL) and Epi&#xD;
