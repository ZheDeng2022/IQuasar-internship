  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the project is to clarify whether DLBCL exhibits mutational diversity among&#xD;
      different lymph node tumors in one and the same patient. It is desired to find out whether a&#xD;
      possible difference between lymph node tumors / tumors can explain why patients who initially&#xD;
      (at diagnosis) have the same prognosis, sometimes have a completely different course, eg with&#xD;
      rapid recurrence of the disease after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A possible difference could also perhaps shed light on why disease in specific places spreads&#xD;
      more frequently to the brain - and therefore have an impact on when one chooses to give&#xD;
      preventive treatment against spread to the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of circulating cell-free DNA (ctDNA) is a new, potential, non-invasive tool for&#xD;
      measuring the full spectrum of genetic variations / mutations and is to be investigated in&#xD;
      our study as a possible non-invasive assessment of diversity / heterogeneity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Only about 60% of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are cured with standard&#xD;
      chemo- and immunotherapy, with R-CHOP(Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride,&#xD;
      oncovin, prednisone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early and more accurate identification of patients with unfavorable prognosis after R-CHOP&#xD;
      will enable the clinician to find patients who need other treatment strategies. New&#xD;
      predictive biomarkers are needed to predict the effect of treatment at the individual level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A proportion of patients have, or develop, lymphoma involvement of the central nervous system&#xD;
      (CNS) and this group has a particularly dismal outcome. Identification of patients with&#xD;
      primary subclinical or later manifest involvement of the CNS also requires new and improved&#xD;
      diagnostic methods. Currently, a number of clinical parameters are included in a CNS-IPI risk&#xD;
      score, that can be used to predict the risk of CNS disease. This score enables the clinicians&#xD;
      to decide if patients should have prophylactic chemotherapy to prevent development of CNS&#xD;
      disease. However, this risk model is far from accurate and the effect of prophylactic&#xD;
      treatment is based on a low level of evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DLBCL is a highly heterogeneous disease as evidenced by the 19 subtypes and variants of large&#xD;
      B-cell lymphoma diagnoses found in the WHO classification of tumors of hematopoietic and&#xD;
      lymphoid tissues. However, the cancer within each patient is also characterized by&#xD;
      heterogeneity. The fact that different lymphoma cells may co-exist in the same tumor has been&#xD;
      known for decades. One example of this is transformation of indolent lymphoma to a more&#xD;
      aggressive lymphoma subtype, often DLBCL where the two types of lymphoma cells are found in&#xD;
      the same lymph node. Differences between the cancer cells in the same tumor is termed&#xD;
      intratumor heterogeneity. Such differences may be found within the same tumor as well as at&#xD;
      spatially separate locations(inter-tumor heterogeneity). Intratumor heterogeneity may have an&#xD;
      important impact on the clinical course and response to therapy. In clinical practice, the&#xD;
      prognosis in patients with similar clinical stage and International Prognostic Index (IPI)&#xD;
      score is often diverse. Such differences may be attributed to both intra and inter-tumor&#xD;
      heterogeneity. Molecular profiling (mutations) in different nodal and extra nodal sites&#xD;
      within the same patient have not before been studied in larger cohorts of DLBCL patients&#xD;
      (Inter-tumor heterogeneity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring circulating cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) has the potential to serve as a&#xD;
      non-invasive tool for measuring the entire spectrum of genetic aberrations found in an&#xD;
      individual patient as an alternative to more invasive diagnostic procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical presentation of DLBCL:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DLBCL is the most common type of lymphoma, and accounts for approximately 40% of non-Hodgkin&#xD;
      lymphomas in adults in Denmark (500 new cases per year). DLBCL can arise de novo or from the&#xD;
      histologic transformation of more indolent lymphomas, most commonly follicular lymphoma (FL)&#xD;
      and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). DLBCL primarily affects elderly patients with a&#xD;
      median age at diagnosis of nearly 70 years. Patients can present with both nodal and&#xD;
      extra-nodal involvement. More than one extra-nodal involvement is a negative prognostic&#xD;
      factor, and some sites are associated with higher risk of having or developing CNS&#xD;
      involvement (e.g. testis, adrenal glands, uterus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DLBCL is characterized as a clinically heterogeneous disease with a variable outcome, however&#xD;
      it is potentially curable. R-CHOP is the standard therapy for patients with DLBCL. The 5-year&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) is around 60%. However, more than 30% of patients treated&#xD;
      with R-CHOP do not respond or relapse, with the majority of these patients succumbing to&#xD;
      their disease. Despite risk models like the International Prognostic Index (IPI) and CNS-IPI,&#xD;
      patients with a high risk of treatment failure, relapse or CNS involvement cannot be&#xD;
      identified accurately by standard prognostic factors. Therefore, new prognostic factors and&#xD;
      biomarkers are under investigation at diagnosis, to better identify those high-risk patients,&#xD;
      who may benefit from an alternative therapeutic strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project aims and perspectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with DLBCL relapse is&#xD;
      limited. It is presently unclear whether clonal heterogeneity in primary tumors plays a role&#xD;
      in DLBCL relapse. Our study is based on the hypothesis that divergent subclones give rise to&#xD;
      the relapse tumor in an early-divergent scenario. This scenario suggest that several&#xD;
      divergent clones exist at diagnosis besides the one that gives rise to relapse. Thus,&#xD;
      information regarding intratumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution of the disease may&#xD;
      provide a better understanding of DLBCL and development of prognostic factors regarding&#xD;
      identification of high risk DLBCL patients. If the tumor is heterogenic, as studies of ctDNA&#xD;
      have indicated, it could potentially transform the clinical care paradigm. It could perhaps&#xD;
      explain the diverse outcome in patients with similarly clinical presentation, or why some&#xD;
      patients develop CNS involvement. Furthermore, knowledge of tumor heterogeneity could guide&#xD;
      the clinician in treatment choice and protocol development and thereby improve outcome for&#xD;
      the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If heterogeneity could be detected in ctDNA it could be made operational and the patients&#xD;
      could avoid invasive biopsy procedures. The dynamic evolution of the tumor could perhaps also&#xD;
      be monitored by ctDNA regarding tumor burden related to interim and end of treatment PET-CT&#xD;
      and treatment intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current genomic models in DLBCL are mainly based on single tumor biopsies. They find a wide&#xD;
      spectrum of mutations between patients. The single tumor models may underestimate the&#xD;
      possible heterogeneity between tumor sites in the individual patient. Furthermore,&#xD;
      heterogeneity, data on mutational evolution and relationship with CNS involvement largely&#xD;
      remains unknown. Our setup will make it possible to clarify heterogeneity within the&#xD;
      individual patient and investigate the relation to prognosis and CNS involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To identify the pattern and variations of mutations in different lymphoma sites in&#xD;
      individual patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify inter-tumor heterogeneity between nodal and extra nodal sites&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify the association between inter-tumor heterogeneity and risk of CNS&#xD;
           involvement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify clonal evolution and clonal relationship between primary tumor site and&#xD;
           tumor at relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the role of &quot;liquid biopsies&quot; and ctDNA in monitoring inter-tumor&#xD;
           heterogeneity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify heterogeneity between nodal sites and bone-marrow biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inter-patient heterogeneity identified with our local clinical lymphoma panel can be&#xD;
           used to subdivide patients according to the Wright classification&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical trials:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will consist of a retrospective study and an observational and clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1 Retrospective study - cohort A - Specific markers in patients with DLBCL&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first part of the retrospective study, cohort A, will be a study of different biopsies&#xD;
      taken from the same patient. The biopsies from different nodal and/or extra nodal sites have&#xD;
      either been taken at the same time or at different times in the treatment course. The time&#xD;
      period is 2015-2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim with cohort A is to explore the biopsy samples for various purposes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The biopsies taken at different times: give us the possibility to look at clonal&#xD;
           evolution over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The biopsies, taken at the same time, but from different sites: gives us the possibility&#xD;
           to look at inter-tumor heterogeneity in one patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from different sites from the same patient will be compared and used to subgroup&#xD;
      the patient according to the Wright algorithm. All analyses will be performed on paraffin&#xD;
      embedded biopsy material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective study - cohort B - Specific markers in patients with DLBCL and secondary CNS&#xD;
      involvement&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the retrospective study - cohort B, the investigators explore heterogeneity and clonal&#xD;
      evolution between CNS lymphoma and nodal/extra-nodal sites using already collected biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will look at patients with both systemic disease and involvement of the&#xD;
      central nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time period is: 2010-2019&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim with cohort B is to explore the biopsy samples for various purposes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The biopsies, taken from different sites (CNS vs systemic) gives us the possibility to&#xD;
           look at inter-tumor heterogeneity and possible clonal evolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The biopsies taken at different times: give us the possibility to look at clonal&#xD;
           evolution over time&#xD;
&#xD;
      By comparing our results from the retrospective cohort A, the aim is to possibly define&#xD;
      particularly important mutations that are only present within patients whose disease has&#xD;
      spread to the central nervous system. Knowledge of mutations that may predispose to&#xD;
      involvement of the CNS would be essential in identifying patients with this risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from different sites from the same patient will be compared and used to subgroup&#xD;
      the patient according to the Wright algorithm. All analyses will be performed on paraffin&#xD;
      embedded biopsy material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective study - cohort A and B - Heterogeneity within lymphoma patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prospective study will include two different cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A: DLBCL patients with lymphoma involvement of several nodal sites accessible for biopsy and&#xD;
      bone-marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B: DLBCL patients with both nodal, extra-nodal sites accessible for biopsy and bone-marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prospective study will include newly diagnosed patients with DLBCL. Patients will be&#xD;
      included in either cohort A or B according to localization of the disease ascertained by&#xD;
      PET-CT to clarify nodal vs extra-nodal involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A - patients with more than one nodal site: One additional biopsy for clinical&#xD;
      evaluation will be performed from a different location than where the diagnostic biopsy was&#xD;
      performed. These biopsies can explore the heterogeneity within the patient at nodal sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Available bone-marrow biopsies will be analyzed as a separate site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B - patients with both nodal and extra-nodal sites: One biopsy for clinical evaluation&#xD;
      will be performed from a different site than the diagnostic biopsy, resulting in one nodal&#xD;
      and one extra-nodal biopsy. These biopsies will explore the heterogeneity between nodal and&#xD;
      extra-nodal sites within the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any available bone-marrow biopsies will be analyzed as a separate site.&#xD;
