  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Virtual reality (VR), is one of the most popular approaches to Cerebral Palsy (CP)&#xD;
      rehabilitation and has been used in rehabilitation field for 30 years. VR is provided via a&#xD;
      computer or a game console, and players interact with real-like objects . Using a VR&#xD;
      interface as a rehabilitation tool increases the fun received by the client which, in turn,&#xD;
      increases the participation of the client to the rehabilitation sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a study that focused on long-term effects of Virtual reality (VR) intervention on&#xD;
      motor skills and activities of daily living (ADL) independence of children with CP.&#xD;

    <description>In the study it was conducted a 12 week-intensive VR intervention (twice a week, 45 minutes each) and compared the results in the 12th week to investigate the effects of rehabilitation and follow-up assessments were made in the 16th and 24th weeks. From the beginning of the VR intervention, each game was played in equal durations by each participant. However, the difficulty of the games varied depending on the child's performance.&#xD;
Microsoft Kinect Games-Carnival Games was used as VR intervention. In meeting held with the authors to determine which games would be used in the VR program, 5 games were chosen and the remaining games were removed from the program because of their similar contents.</description>

    <description>The COT based on neurodevelopmental treatment was carried out by the same occupational therapist. The treatment goals aimed at increasing the use of participant's extremities and improving the independence in ADL. The activities in the treatment were chosen in view of children's motor skills and daily living activities such as getting dressed, solving puzzles, and writing etc.&#xD;
Both groups received COT while the control group received COT only for 12 weeks.</description>
