  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by irreversible airway&#xD;
      obstruction and progressive deterioration of respiratory function. Patients with COPD show a&#xD;
      limited exercise tolerance, early fatigability and progressive dyspnea, with important&#xD;
      consequences on the ability to sustain even mild efforts and a drastic restriction in the&#xD;
      activities of daily living. Muscle dysfunction is a systemic manifestation of COPD that&#xD;
      contributes to exertion intolerance in individuals with COPD to the point of compromising&#xD;
      fundamental functional activities, such as walking. Previous studies have shown, in fact,&#xD;
      that quadriceps strength can be reduced by 20% to 30% in patients with COPD and this value is&#xD;
      associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with lower strength levels. In&#xD;
      addition, loss of muscle mass or sarcopenia also occurs with a prevalence of between 8% and&#xD;
      67% in patients with COPD, exacerbating the picture of muscle dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the goals of respiratory rehabilitation is precisely the prevention of muscle&#xD;
      dysfunction in patients with COPD. However, rehabilitation programs aimed at maintaining and&#xD;
      recovering muscle strength are often lacking in guidance regarding target muscles, duration&#xD;
      of sessions, and training intensity, while strength assessment is often limited by the timing&#xD;
      and resources associated with the clinical setting in which it takes place. This makes it&#xD;
      difficult to determine its short- and long-term effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, assessment of muscle function in patients with COPD requires tests that are simple&#xD;
      and quick to perform, but equally capable of providing quantitative data referable to a&#xD;
      specific characteristic of muscle strength as well as indicative of the patient's overall&#xD;
      function. In addition, complementary measurements such as body composition and muscle mass,&#xD;
      as well as the development of predictive models and normative values of muscle function could&#xD;
      provide additional information on the progression of muscle dysfunction in patients with&#xD;
      COPD, allowing rehabilitation intervention to be directed toward recovery of the most&#xD;
      compromised functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aims of this study are: 1) To evaluate the effectiveness of a standard&#xD;
      pulmonary rehabilitation program in recovering peripheral muscle dysfunction in patients with&#xD;
      COPD. 2) To evaluate the clinical reliability of tests commonly used to measure peripheral&#xD;
      muscle function in the rehabilitation setting of patients with COPD.&#xD;
