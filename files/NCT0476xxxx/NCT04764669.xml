    <description>AEs will be graded on a 3-point scale (mild, moderate, severe). Severe AEs will be defined as those AEs that are incapacitating, with inability to work or to perform normal daily activity. A serious AEs will be defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death or life-threatening AE or requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization or results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

    <description>The C-SSRS (mapped to Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C-CASA) categories) is an interview-based instrument to systematically assess suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. C-SSRS assess whether participant experience any of the following: completed suicide; suicide attempt (response of &quot;yes&quot; on &quot;actual attempt&quot;); preparatory acts toward imminent suicidal behavior (&quot;yes&quot; on &quot;preparatory acts or behavior&quot;, &quot;aborted attempt&quot; or &quot;interrupted attempt&quot;), suicidal ideation (&quot;yes&quot; on &quot;wish to be dead&quot;, &quot;non-specific active suicidal thoughts&quot;, &quot;active suicidal ideation with methods without intent to act or some intent to act, without specific plan or with specific plan and intent, any self-injurious behavior with no suicidal intent (&quot;yes&quot; on &quot;has participant engaged in non-suicidal self-injurious behavior&quot;). Here, number of participants with positive response (&quot;yes&quot;) to suicidal behavior or/and ideation, any non-suicidal self-injurious behavior will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Score of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III: Motor Examination (UPDRS-III)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 84 and Day 112</time_frame>
    <description>The UPDRS scale evaluates extrapyramidal features in motor function in Parkinson's disease. It contains 33 items in 18 categories: (1) speech, (2) facial expression, (3) rigidity, (4) finger tapping, (5) hand movements, (6) supinational and pronation movements of hands, (7) toe tapping, (8) leg agility, (9) arising from chair, (10) gait, (11) freezing of gait, (12) postural stability, (13) posture, (14) body bradykinesia, (15) postural tremor of hands, (16) kinetic tremor of hands, (17) rest tremor amplitude and (18) constancy of rest tremor. Each item is scored 0 (normal) to 4 (severe), giving a total score range 0 to 132. The higher score indicates the worse motor function.</description>
