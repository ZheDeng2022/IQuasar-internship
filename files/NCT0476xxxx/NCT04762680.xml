      The primary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety profile of the study vaccines in each study intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the neutralizing antibody profile after primary series vaccination in&#xD;
           SARS-CoV-2-naïve adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate that a booster dose of monovalent or bivalent SARS-CoV-2 vaccine given to&#xD;
           adults previously vaccinated with an authorized/approved COVID-19 vaccine induces an&#xD;
           immune response that is non-inferior to the response induced by a two-dose priming&#xD;
           series with the monovalent vaccine, and superior to that observed immediately before&#xD;
           booster.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate that two doses of monovalent (B.1.351)-AS03 or bivalent (D614 +&#xD;
           B.1.351)-AS03 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine induce an immune response that is non inferior to the&#xD;
           response induced by monovalent (D614)-AS03 vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the neutralizing and binding antibody profiles after primary series&#xD;
           vaccination at pre-defined time points during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the neutralizing and binding antibody responses of booster vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the occurrences of laboratory-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 after primary&#xD;
           series and booster vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the occurrences of serologically-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection after&#xD;
           primary series vaccination.&#xD;

      and 2: 365 days post-booster injection (ie, 366 days total).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>To address the emergence of variant strains, Sanofi Pasteur is developing monovalent and bivalent vaccines for use as universal late booster and/or variant prime vaccines which will be studied in 3 additional Phase 3 study cohorts that are added to the initial Phase 2 protocol cohorts. Supplemental Cohorts 1 and 2 will evaluate booster vaccine candidates and supplemental Cohort 3 will evaluate priming immunization with variant-containing vaccines.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>In the original Phase 2 part, participants, outcome assessors, Investigators, laboratory personnel, and sponsor trial staff are blinded to intervention group; and those preparing the study interventions are unblinded to vaccine assignment group.&#xD;
The supplemental Cohort 1 intervention group and Supplemental Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 comparator group will be open-label. Supplemental Cohort 2 will involve sequential randomization to main arms then exploratory arms, and the intervention will be modified double-blind (observer-blinded, as described). The supplemental Cohort 3 will also be modified double-blind.</masking_description>
