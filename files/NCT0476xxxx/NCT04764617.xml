    <textblock>
      As people get older, the amount of skeletal muscle in the body can decrease. When the amount&#xD;
      of this muscle in the body gets very low, there is an increased risk of falling, and not only&#xD;
      is recovery to any injury slower, but more complications can be experienced following&#xD;
      surgery, and patients may end up being more dependent on the help of others for meeting daily&#xD;
      activities. However, it is not clear whether it is simply the amount of muscle that is in the&#xD;
      body that is important for health, or whether it is the ability of muscle to function&#xD;
      properly which is important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is looking at the way muscles of frail older people function; not just&#xD;
      how strong they are, but the amount of fats and protein that there are in muscle cells, and&#xD;
      how the genes in the muscles are being expressed (genes being a collection of chemical&#xD;
      information that carry the instructions for making the proteins a cell will need to&#xD;
      function).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also investigate whether recovery from hip fracture is impacted by the amount of&#xD;
      muscle that there is in the body, and/or the functioning of this muscle.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is the age-associated loss of skeletal muscle mass, muscle quality and strength,&#xD;
      and is a contributive factor to frailty in older individuals. Meta-analyses suggest that&#xD;
      individuals with sarcopenia appear to be at greater risk of hospitalisation (all cause),&#xD;
      falls and fracture, with hip fracture following a fall being both a serious consequence of&#xD;
      sarcopenia, as well as a risk factor for frailty syndrome. The short and longer term outcomes&#xD;
      for patients who have a hip fracture following a fall are poor (post-operative complications,&#xD;
      increased length of hospital stay, and increased mortality risk, institutionalisation and&#xD;
      dependency, respectively), and these are understood to be largely due to the underlying&#xD;
      vulnerability (frailty) of the people who sustain hip fractures, with poor recovery being&#xD;
      compounded by the reduced muscle strength and low muscle mass common in those who are frail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a consequence of research on the physiology of ageing muscles and sarcopenia, increasingly&#xD;
      there is the possibility that novel agents (such as anabolic agents) could help to alleviate&#xD;
      the frailty state in these patients and hence improve shorter and longer term outcomes.&#xD;
      However, before novel interventions can be applied to patients with frailty and sarcopenia,&#xD;
      such as those sustaining a hip fracture following a fall, an understanding of how the muscles&#xD;
      of these patients are functioning at the cellular level, both in the injured and uninjured&#xD;
      state is needed; which metabolic pathways are active and which are inactive, those which are&#xD;
      enhanced and those which are impaired, so that treatments that are appropriate for the&#xD;
      specific metabolic state of these patients can be selected. In recent years there have been&#xD;
      advances in the understanding of the cellular physiology of the muscles of older people.&#xD;
      However, few of the research studies carried out to date have analysed muscle collected from&#xD;
      individuals who are as frail as the patients who present with hip fractures, or probed the&#xD;
      metabolic changes which occur in the muscle following injury in this cohort. Findings from&#xD;
      cross-sectional investigations on the healthy older person and prospective studies which try&#xD;
      and mimic the muscle wasting seen in sarcopenia (using immobilisation or bed rest protocols)&#xD;
      could prove useful in this endeavour. However, it is possible that results from these studies&#xD;
      may not be generalizable to those who are frail (who may have other clinical problems and&#xD;
      take multiple medications) and it is important that deep phenotyping of muscle from these&#xD;
      patients is undertaken to address this knowledge gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Across the whole study, including a cohort subset, a range of people with frailty, including&#xD;
      those with cognitive impairment will be studied. Those with dementia or severe cognitive&#xD;
      impairment tend to be those who are most frail and represent a high proportion of patients&#xD;
      admitted with a hip fracture. If such patients are excluded, there is a risk of only&#xD;
      observing muscle metabolic and histological changes seen in milder levels of frailty, which&#xD;
      may not provide a comprehensive picture of sarcopenia. This is a frequent criticism and&#xD;
      limitation of previous studies carried out in this field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be older individuals admitted to Nottingham University Hospital (UK) with a&#xD;
      fractured hip sustained following a fall. In all participants, a muscle sample will be taken&#xD;
      from their injured leg during the surgical repair to their hip, with the option for a muscle&#xD;
      biopsy to be taken, whilst in theatre, from their uninjured leg using the Bergstrom&#xD;
      technique. These samples will be analysed for intramyocellular lipid content and messenger&#xD;
      ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression of 384 gene targets spanning a number of cellular&#xD;
      functions. In the week following surgery, measurements of thigh muscle thickness (Ultrasound&#xD;
      imaging) and hand grip strength will be made, and an optional assessment of whole body muscle&#xD;
      mass using the D3-creatine method will be offered. After discharge from hospital,&#xD;
      patient-related outcomes measures will be obtained from medical notes and Three months after&#xD;
      surgery, a set of questionnaires will be sent to the participant or their carer to complete.&#xD;
      These will assess current mobility, dependency and wellbeing.&#xD;
