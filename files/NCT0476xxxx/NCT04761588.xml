  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      10 participants aged 3 years and over with tyrosinaemia or alkaptonuria will be prescribed&#xD;
      Tyr sphere following an assessment of their individual needs by their dietitian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will enter a 4-week evaluation period, assessing adherence and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tolerance. Evaluations of Tyr sphere's palatability are made at the end of&#xD;
      the evaluation period. Dried blood spots are taken on days 1 and 28 and once per week in&#xD;
      between.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who continue to take the product at the end of their evaluation period will&#xD;
      enter a follow-up period during which metabolic control, anthropometric and nutritional&#xD;
      status data will be collected during the yearly standard of care routine visits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      10 participants with tyrosinaemia or alkaptonuria will be invited to participate in this&#xD;
      study. Following consent they will be assessed by their dietitian and a recommended amount of&#xD;
      Tyr sphere will be prescribed based on their individual needs. Tyr sphere is a food for&#xD;
      special medical purposes as defined by Regulation (EU) No 609/2013. It is designed to be&#xD;
      prescribed based on its protein content, not its energy content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1, baseline clinic visit activities: consent, demographics, anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements, gastrointestinal history, dietary assessment, metabolic control assessment&#xD;
      including collection of dried blood spots for phenylalanine and tyrosine levels, record&#xD;
      routinely taken urine succinylacetone, serum albumin and pre-albumin levels, new dietary&#xD;
      prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weeks 1 to 4 (patient at home): dried blood spots, adverse events reporting/assessment, daily&#xD;
      Tyr sphere adherence diary, daily gastrointestinal symptoms diary (weeks 1 and 4 only), daily&#xD;
      intake diary for Nitisinone which is routinely prescribed. There will be a telephone call&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2, end of acceptability phase clinic visit activities: anthropometric measurements,&#xD;
      review of diaries, review of adverse events, metabolic control assessment including&#xD;
      collection of dried blood spots for phenylalanine and tyrosine levels, investigator's&#xD;
      assessment of Tyr sphere for the participant and decision on continuing with the&#xD;
      prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three-year routine follow-up: for the participants that do continue with the Tyr sphere&#xD;
      prescription (in consultation with the investigator), they will enter a follow-up period of&#xD;
      three years, during which only routine, standard of care visits and procedures will take&#xD;
      place. Data will be collected on anthropometrics, phenylalanine and tyrosine levels from&#xD;
      dried blood spots, adverse events, record routinely taken urine succinylacetone, serum&#xD;
      albumin and pre-albumin levels.&#xD;
