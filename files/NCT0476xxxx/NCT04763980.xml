  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies barriers to genetic testing in African American men with prostate&#xD;
      cancer and whether tailored, culturally relevant genetic testing education provided by a&#xD;
      community-based health coach is beneficial in improving knowledge, attitudes, and awareness&#xD;
      of genetic testing. Information gained from this study, may help researchers better&#xD;
      understand and learn more about how to increase access to germline genetic testing in&#xD;
      underrepresented populations.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess uptake of genetic testing using tailored education strategies and culturally&#xD;
      relevant cancer resources delivered by a community-based health coach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess decisional conflict among African American men receiving tailored education&#xD;
      strategies and culturally relevant cancer resources on genetic testing delivered by a&#xD;
      community-based health coach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the germline mutation rate among African American men with prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT A: Patients complete a survey about knowledge of, attitudes towards, and awareness of&#xD;
      genetic testing and technology preferences and use over 30 minutes at baseline and over 20&#xD;
      minutes at exit or follow up. Patients may also undergo genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT B: Patients participate in educational session with health coach over 60 minutes.&#xD;
      Patients also complete a survey about knowledge of, attitudes towards, and awareness of&#xD;
      genetic testing and technology preferences and use over 30 minutes at baseline and over 20&#xD;
      minutes at exit or follow up. Patients may undergo genetic testing.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Consent rate for germline testing</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline (1 day)</time_frame>
    <description>The consent rate for each cohort will be defined as proportion of patients enrolled in the study who agree to undergo germline genetic testing with Color genomics. The point estimate and 90% confidence interval will be provided.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decisional conflict scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and exit/follow-up visit (up to 2 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The decisional conflict scale will be scored using a validated instrument. Scores range from 0 (no decisional conflict) to 100 (extremely high decisional conflict). Summary statistics with median and interquartile range will be obtained.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Highly penetrant germline genetic mutation rate and variants of unknown significance among all participants who undergo germline testing</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and exit/follow-up visit (up to 2 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Will be determined by the sum of all alterations detected on Color genomics. Summary statistics will be obtained.</description>
