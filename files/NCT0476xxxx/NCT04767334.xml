  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is neurological disease characterized by chronic major disability which will cause&#xD;
      permanent changes in individuals life. In Saudi Arabia stroke considered as the main leading&#xD;
      of disability and death. It is estimated to be 0.67% in Saudi Arabia compared to 2.5% of the&#xD;
      population in the United States (US). Most of individuals have mobility deficit such as walk&#xD;
      speed and postural maintenance which lead to increase the risk of fall and decrease activity&#xD;
      of daily living (ADL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke rehabilitation should starts as early as possible to avoid post-stroke complications.&#xD;
      Several interventions for stroke rehabilitation to improve mobility deficit and posture&#xD;
      control continuously being evaluated. One of the ways of stroke rehabilitation is a using of&#xD;
      body weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT). It is a useful tool to facilitate gait&#xD;
      training and recovery after neurological injures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lower body positive pressure (LBPP) is a treadmill that is enclosed in inflated bag.&#xD;
      There is a chamber inside the treadmill that is produce air pressure which is aid in&#xD;
      eliminate the uncomfortableness feeling produce by weight bearing during gait. The chamber is&#xD;
      supplied with a system provide LBPP aiding in decrease patient weight while walking by giving&#xD;
      the patient lifting force from below using air pressure. This helps the patient to walk&#xD;
      affectively with minimum weight bearing on the lower extremity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of LBPP&#xD;
      on gait function, balance and quality of life in chronic stroke individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis that the LBPP will significantly improve gait function, balance,&#xD;
      quality of life in chronic stroke patients.&#xD;

    <measure>gait function as assessed by 10MWT</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline gait at 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>10-Meter Walk Test (10MWT): The 10MWT assesses self-selected preferred walking speed over a short duration with or without an assistive device. The participant will be asked to walk a total of 10 meters where an acceleration zone is used for the participants to accelerate 2 meters before entering the 6-meter distance and 2 meters to decelerate afterwards. Speed is only calculated for the 6m distance between the end zones. The 10MWT is widely used in clinical practice and research for people with stroke and has been shown to have an excellent test-retest reliability (ICC &gt; 0.95). The test will be performed three times and the average will be calculated for analysis.</description>

    <measure>Balance function</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline balance at 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Reach Test (FRT): It is used to evaluate participant's stability by measuring the maximum distance participant can reach forward while standing in fixed position. The participant will be standing close to a wall and position the arm at 90 degrees of shoulder flexion close but not touching to the wall with close fist. Starting position will be recorded at the 3rd metacarpal head on yardstick. The participant will be asked to reach as far as he/she can forward with the non-paretic arm without taking a step. The maximum distance that the participant can reach will be recorded. The difference between the start and end position will be calculated. The participant will be allowed for two practice trials. Then, the participant will be asked to perform the test three trials. The average of the three trials will be used for analysis. The FRT showed high intra-rater reliability (ICC = 0.98) and validity (r = 0.71)</description>

    <measure>Quality of life as assessed by (Short Form 36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline quality of life at 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life (Short Form 36): A survey that uses to evaluate quality of life in clinical practice and research purpose. It consist of 8 dimensional subscales: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, general mental health, and health transition. It has been translated and validated into Arabic language. Each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively. So a high score defines a more favorable health state.</description>
