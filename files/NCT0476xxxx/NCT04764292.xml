  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are women for whom a screening breast MRI is clinically recommended, but not feasible&#xD;
      either due to patient factors (body habitus, pacemaker or other implant, claustrophobia) or&#xD;
      access (cost, other constraints). Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) is a potential&#xD;
      alternative to MRI for screening that uses updated standard mammography equipment to obtain&#xD;
      low- and high-energy images after intravenous injection of iodinated contrast (as used in CT&#xD;
      scanning). The investigators seek to validate screening CEM as an alternative to screening&#xD;
      MRI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study designed to evaluate the role of contrast enhanced mammography&#xD;
      (CEM) in screening for breast cancer. The overarching goal of the research program is to&#xD;
      improve cancer detection on screening, particularly in women with dense breasts. MRI depicts&#xD;
      more cancers than other screening methods, including ultrasound. MRI is proven to both&#xD;
      improve cancer detection and reduce clinically detected cancers (&quot;interval cancers&quot;) after a&#xD;
      negative screening mammogram in women with dense breasts. PA Senate Bill 595, signed into law&#xD;
      June 30, 2020, requires insurance carriers to provide coverage for supplemental screening&#xD;
      with MRI or ultrasound for a variety of indications. Relative to the number of women who may&#xD;
      benefit from screening MRI, there is a shortage of equipment/capacity. Further, nearly half&#xD;
      of women cannot have an MRI for medical or other reasons, such as claustrophobia, implanted&#xD;
      devices, body habitus, or cost (deductible and copay apply even with the new legislation).&#xD;
      Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) appears to have similar performance to MRI but has not&#xD;
      been widely validated, particularly for screening. In order to lay the foundation for&#xD;
      improved screening of women with dense breasts, the investigators seek to offer screening CEM&#xD;
      as an alternative to MRI for women who meet guidelines for screening MRI but are unable to&#xD;
      have MRI.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Asymptomatic women under age 75 who are recommended for annual screening MRI and&#xD;
             mammography based on current criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Women known to be at high risk for breast cancer because of known or suspected&#xD;
                  pathogenic mutation, prior chest radiation therapy at least 8 years earlier and&#xD;
                  before age 30, or estimated lifetime risk of at least 20% based on family&#xD;
                  history/prior biopsy history (22), between age 30 and 75.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Women with extremely dense breasts age 40-75 (about 7% of the screening&#xD;
                  population (1)) (12).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Women with lobular carcinoma in situ (1% of women biopsied each year; about 0.06% of&#xD;
             our screening population) beginning the year after diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;

             ongoing TOCEM protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Women with heterogeneously dense breasts and any family history of breast cancer&#xD;
             (about 36% of the screening population has dense breasts and about 20% have a family&#xD;
             history of breast cancer) who do not meet current high-risk criteria, beginning at age&#xD;
             40 or ten years prior to the age of the youngest relative but not before age 30.&#xD;
&#xD;

        screening breast MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Under age 30 or over age 75.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Breast implants.&#xD;
&#xD;

          5. Breast signs or symptoms (lump, nipple discharge, nipple retraction, or being followed&#xD;
             for breast abnormality on prior imaging).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Currently undergoing any type of systemic chemotherapy for cancer (excludes oral&#xD;
             endocrine therapy such as aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Reduced kidney function with eGFR &lt; 45 mL/min.&#xD;
