  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this study is to determine the efficacy of time restricted eating (TRE)&#xD;
      for improving metabolic health and preventing endometrial cancer. The primary objective of&#xD;
      the protocol is to conduct a 14-week two-arm randomized crossover trial of a dietary&#xD;
      intervention to evaluate the feasibility, fidelity and preliminary acceptability of a TRE&#xD;
      intervention among Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander women at risk for developing endometrial&#xD;
      cancer, and to provide proof of principle that TRE can improve metabolic health in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

      Enrollment: The study includes two phases. Phase 1 includes focus groups among 30 Native&#xD;
      Hawaiian/Pacific Islander women at risk of endometrial cancer. Focus groups will determine&#xD;
      sociocultural influences on (i) dietary behavior including meal timing; (ii) dietary&#xD;
      preferences; (iii) proposed meal plans and intervention design; (iv) perceptions of weight&#xD;
      loss and body image. In the second study phase, the study team will recruit 10 Pacific&#xD;
      Islander women to participate in a 14-week randomized dietary crossover study. Each woman&#xD;
      will participate in both intervention arms and act as her own control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus Group: To accomplish all aspects of Aim 1 of this study, the study team will recruit 30&#xD;
      Pacific Islander women at risk for endometrial cancer to conduct virtual focus groups. These&#xD;
      focus groups will take place via private videoconference, like Zoom, and a language&#xD;
      translator will be provided, as necessary. The focus groups will be attended by a Native&#xD;
      Hawaiian/Pacific Islander Community Expert. Questions will be designed to understand&#xD;
      sociocultural influences on dietary behavior (questions on social eating, meal timing, and&#xD;
      dietary preferences, soliciting feedback on study intervention delivery design, and&#xD;
      perceptions of weight loss and body image). An icebreaker will be conducted prior to formal&#xD;
      questioning. Sessions will be audio-recorded on the videoconference and an additional device,&#xD;
      transcribed verbatim, and checked for accuracy. Two additional team members will be present&#xD;
      as note takers. Our Community Expert will be present to help facilitate the session.&#xD;
      Questions will be provided at the beginning of the session to ensure cultural sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary Intervention: The dietary intervention includes 5 study visits, and features a&#xD;
      baseline visit, 2-week run-in period, 4-week control diet schedule, 4-week washout period,&#xD;
      and a 4-week, 8 to 10-hour Time Restricted Eating (TRE) protocol (8 to 10-hour feeding and 14&#xD;
      to 16-hour fasting periods). A follow-up questionnaire will be mailed 6-months post-&#xD;
      intervention. For the control schedule, women will receive frozen lunch and dinner meals and&#xD;
      a standardized breakfast and snacks menu. All meals and the breakfast/snack menu will be&#xD;
      designed to be culturally competent with feedback from the focus groups, and meal plans will&#xD;
      be individualized to meet weight maintenance energy requirements. For the TRE schedule, women&#xD;
      will receive prepared frozen lunch and dinner meals as per the control schedule, but will be&#xD;
      asked to consume daily meals, snacks, and calorie-containing beverages within an 8 to 10-hour&#xD;
      period that fits their schedule. They will be asked to maintain their regular sleep and&#xD;
      physical activity schedule. The fasting period will ramp up during the first week (Days 1-3,&#xD;
      12-14 h per day, Days 4-6, 14-16 h per day, Days 7+, 16 h per day). Women will be asked to&#xD;
      schedule the eating period at the same time each day. All meals (control and TRE) will be&#xD;
      provided by the Metabolic Kitchen located at the University of Utah.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: During the baseline visit, a coordinator will obtain consent from the participant,&#xD;
      and they will be asked to compete questionnaires asking about clinical and demographic&#xD;
      factors, chronotype, and physical activity, and various anthropometric measurements will be&#xD;
      taken. Following the baseline visit, participants will undergo a 2-week run-in period. During&#xD;
      this time, the goal is to record women's usual times of eating episodes and appetite while&#xD;
      following their habitual diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Women will provide fasting blood and stool samples, and anthropometric measurements&#xD;
      will be taken. Following visit 2, participants will undergo the control or TRE schedule for 4&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: After 4 weeks, participants will undergo visit 3 and will be asked to provide&#xD;
      fasting blood and stool samples, and anthropometric measures will be taken. Following visit&#xD;
      3, participants will undergo a 4-week washout period, where women are able to return to their&#xD;
      usual lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4: Visit 4 will occur after the 4-week washout period, and will include a telephone&#xD;
      consultation to discuss the next study phase and schedule meal provision. For the following&#xD;
      4-weeks, participants will then undergo the opposite feeding schedule (either control or&#xD;
      TRE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5: During the final visit, women will provide fasting blood and stool samples, and&#xD;
      anthropometric measures will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the run-in period, the TRE phase and the control phase, participants will record&#xD;
      timing of eating episodes using the MyCircadian Clock phone app, complete 3 x 24-hour diet&#xD;
      recalls, a single physical activity recall, and 7-days of sleep and physical activity will be&#xD;
      objectively measured using an Actiwatch device. Hunger and satiety will be evaluated at&#xD;
      random through the MyCircadian Clock phone app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study exit interview will be conducted via Zoom conference call to debrief on the&#xD;
      intervention and obtain detailed information on acceptability of the protocol. Approximately&#xD;
      6-months after the end of the intervention period, women will complete a mailed follow-up&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
