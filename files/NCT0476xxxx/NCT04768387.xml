  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed as a pilot, open-labelled study. We enrolled consecutive IBS-M&#xD;
      patients (n=25, 19 females, 46.06 Â± 13.11 years) according to Rome IV criteria. Fecal samples&#xD;
      were obtained from all patients twice (pre- and post-intervention) and high-throughput 16S&#xD;
      rRNA sequencing was performed. Patients were divided into two groups based on age, gender and&#xD;
      microbiome matched.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six weeks of AI-based microbiome diet (n=14) for group 1 and standard IBS diet (Control&#xD;
      group, n=11) for group 2 were followed. AI-based diet was designed based on optimizing a&#xD;
      personalized nutritional strategy by an algorithm regarding individual gut microbiome&#xD;
      features. An algorithm assessing an IBS index score using microbiome composition attempted to&#xD;
      design the optimized diets based on modulating microbiome towards the healthy scores.&#xD;
      Baseline and post-intervention IBS-SSS (symptom severity scale) scores and fecal microbiome&#xD;
      analyses were compared.&#xD;

    <description>The personalized nutrition model estimates the optimal micronutrient compositions for a required microbiome modulation. In this study, we computed the microbiome modulation needed for an IBS case, based on the IBS-indices generated by the machine learning models. According to that, the baseline microbiome compositions are perturbed randomly with a small probability p. Perturbed profiles are accepted with a probability proportional to the decrease in the IBS-index as suggested by Metropolis sampling. This Monte-Carlo random walk in the microbiome composition space is expected to meet a low IBS-index microbiome composition nearby the baseline microbiome composition of the patient with a minimal modulation. The personalized nutrition model, then, estimates the optimized nutritional composition needed for this individual, expecting to drive the IBS-index to lower values.</description>
