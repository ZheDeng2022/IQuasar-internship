      A prospective double-blind, randomized controlled trial investigating the effect of a&#xD;
      single-dose of intraoperative methadone in patients undergoing spinal fusion.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During early recovery after surgery, intravenous opioids are typically administered to&#xD;
      control the pain, either as intermittent bolus administration by nursing staff or by a&#xD;
      patient-controlled analgesia device. Unfortunately, repeated doses or boluses of&#xD;
      shorter-acting opioids, such as morphine, oxycodone and fentanyl, result in fluctuating blood&#xD;
      concentrations, with the inherent risk of only relatively brief periods of adequate pain&#xD;
      relief. Moreover, the use of shorter-acting opioids increases the risk of opioid-associated&#xD;
      side effects, such as sedation, nausea and vomiting. An alternative approach to the&#xD;
      postoperative use of shorter-acting opioids is therefore called for.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this respect, methadone is an opioid with unique pharmacological properties that may be&#xD;
      advantageous when applied intraoperatively. A single-dose of this long acting opioid could&#xD;
      provide a stable analgesia and potentially reduce the need for shorter-acting opioids&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      150 patients will be included in an investigator-initiated, prospective, randomised,&#xD;
      double-blind, controlled trial with three arms: intervention arm 1 (methadone administered at&#xD;
      induction 0.15-0.2 mg/kg ideal body weight), Intervention arm 2 (methadone administered in&#xD;
      the end of surgery 0.15-0.2 mg/kg ideal body weight), Control arm (morphine administered in&#xD;
      the end of surgery 0.15-0.2 mg/kg ideal body weight).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be GCP-monitored, and is approved by the Danish Health and Medicines Authority&#xD;
      (2020103115) and the Central Denmark Region Committees on Health Research Ethics&#xD;
      (1-10-72-278-20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a single dose of intravenous&#xD;
      intraoperative methadone on postoperative opioid consumption, pain and side effects in&#xD;
      patients scheduled for spinal fusion surgery. A single dose of intravenous intraoperative&#xD;
      morphine will be used as an active comparator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intravenous perioperative methadone reduces opioid consumption (oral cumulative&#xD;
           equivalent dose) by 50% during the first 24 postoperative hours compared to intravenous&#xD;
           morphine(primary outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Methadone reduces opioid consumption the first 6 postoperative hours compared to&#xD;
           intravenous morphine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Methadone reduces pain in the affected areas at rest and during coughing(1-72 hours&#xD;
           after extubation) compared to intravenous morphine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Methadone increases patient satisfaction with pain management during the first 24&#xD;
           postoperative hours compared to intravenous morphine on a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)&#xD;
           from 0 to 10, where 0 is unsatisfied and 10 is satisfied&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effects of methadone is attenuated when administered prior to surgical incision&#xD;
           compared to administration in the end of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The frequency of opioid-related side effects is similar in the groups compared.&#xD;
