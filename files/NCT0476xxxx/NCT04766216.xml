      In the US, patients receiving warfarin therapy are rarely allowed to engage in patient&#xD;
      self-management (PSM) which is less burdensome, less expensive, and safer than standard&#xD;
      clinician-directed warfarin management. National and international evidence-based guideline&#xD;
      panels strongly recommend PSM over other warfarin management methods for appropriate patients&#xD;
      because it improves INR control, cuts risk of thrombosis and death by half without increasing&#xD;
      bleeding risk, and increases patient satisfaction and quality of life. The reasons behind PSM&#xD;
      underutilization in US settings have not been systematically assessed and validated. We will&#xD;
      address this knowledge gap and provide foundational information for increasing PSM&#xD;
      utilization within the US healthcare system. Our Aim 1 will assess and validate barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators to PSM and evaluate their applicability to the US healthcare system; Aim 2 will&#xD;
      develop and test PSM implementation strategies in US ambulatory care sites using rapid-cycle&#xD;
      research methodology; and Aim 3 will assess implementation (feasibility, fidelity, adoption),&#xD;
      clinical (effectiveness, safety, equity, patient-centeredness), and end-user (satisfaction)&#xD;
      outcomes. The long-term objective of our application is to improve the safety of ambulatory&#xD;
      warfarin therapy through increasing the implementation of PSM. Our research proposal is&#xD;
      guided by an implementation science logic model that incorporates well-known implementation&#xD;
      science frameworks to support the specific aims. Qualitative data collection and analysis for&#xD;
      Aim 1 will be organized using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) a&#xD;
      determinant framework that identifies five domains influencing implementation: Intervention,&#xD;
      Inner Setting, Outer Setting, Individuals, and the Implementation Process. Constructs within&#xD;
      each domain provide guidance on factors to identify and measure as potential implementation&#xD;
      barriers or facilitators. PSM implementation activities in Aim 2 will be guided by the&#xD;
      Quality Implementation Framework (QIF), which identifies the critical implementation process&#xD;
      steps and specific actions related to these steps that can be utilized to achieve quality PSM&#xD;
      implementation. Implementation strategies will be supported by the rapid-cycle research&#xD;
      framework developed by the AHRQ Practice Based Research Network. Implementation outcomes in&#xD;
      Aim 3 will be structured using the well-known Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation,&#xD;
      Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. We will utilize a type III hybrid research design to test PSM&#xD;
      implementation strategies while observing/gathering information on PSM-related clinical and&#xD;
      economic outcomes.&#xD;
