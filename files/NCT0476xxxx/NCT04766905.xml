  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incision is very useful and easy for the direct lateral shoulder joint exposure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The skin incision is about 4 to 5 cm made by the distal acromial edge in sagittal plane, The&#xD;
      dissection takes place slightly over the acromial edge proximally and over the origin of the&#xD;
      acromial deltoid part (the middle part of deltoid origin) distally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After clearly revealing the region of the medial deltoid origin on the acromion, the&#xD;
      acromionic deltoid origin is skinned only; of the edge of the acromion, and that maybe&#xD;
      accrued by electric knife pen or periosteal elevator, without exposure the clavicular deltoid&#xD;
      origin in the front and the deltoid origin on the spine of scapula in the back, the origin of&#xD;
      the acromial deltoid is distanced laterally and distally, where the lateral edge, the lower&#xD;
      surface of the acromion, under acromial bursa and the rotator cuff are exposed clearly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throw this approach can be made acromioplasty and rotator cuff tears repair especially upper&#xD;
      part of rotator cuff tear very easily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For wound closure the acromionic deltoid origin is reattached to the acromial edge by long&#xD;
      period synthetic absorbable sutures as PDS and PDO, or non absorbable sutures as Polyester&#xD;
      suture, under skin and skin sutures are made.&#xD;
