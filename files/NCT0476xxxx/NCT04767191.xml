  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      WHO recommends that Therapeutic Efficacy Studies (TES) for 1st and 2nd line antimalarial&#xD;
      medicines should be routinely carried out and data made available for decision-making due to&#xD;
      the threat of emergence and spread of artemisinin resistance in malaria-endemic countries,&#xD;
      especially in Africa. In line with this WHO recommendation, Kenya Ministry of Health (MOH) is&#xD;
      conducting the TES to determine the efficacy of artemether lumefantrine (AL), and&#xD;
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHP), the first and second line treatment of uncomplicated&#xD;
      malaria in Kenya. The objective of this study is to inform the decisions or actions made by a&#xD;
      public health authority (Kenya Ministry of Health) to inform decision on revision of the&#xD;
      antimalarial guidelines and policy in Kenya. Jhpiego's Impact Malaria project in Kenya, with&#xD;
      funding and technical oversight from US President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) through USAID&#xD;
      and CDC, will support the Kenya MOH in its effort to evaluate the efficacy of AL and DHP in&#xD;
      the treatment of children with uncomplicated malaria. The study is being conducted by Kenya&#xD;
      MOH, with technical support and funding by PMI-USAID through Jhpiego in Kenya.&#xD;

      WHO recommends that Therapeutic Efficacy Studies (TES) for 1st and 2nd line antimalarial&#xD;
      medicines should be routinely carried out and data made available for decision-making due to&#xD;
      the threat of emergence and spread of artemisinin resistance in malaria-endemic countries,&#xD;
      especially in Africa. In its strategy to strengthen malaria surveillance, Kenya's Ministry of&#xD;
      Health (MOH) National Malaria Program (NMP) planned to conduct TES every three years to&#xD;
      ascertain continuing efficacy of the first and second-line treatments. The last TES for 1st&#xD;
      line treatment of malaria in Kenya was done in Siaya county in 2016. In line with the WHO&#xD;
      recommendation, Jhpiego Impact Malaria project in Kenya, with funding and technical oversight&#xD;
      from Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) will be supporting the Kenya MOH NMP to&#xD;
      conduct a TES to assess the efficacy of the current first and second line treatment policy in&#xD;
      Kenya. The study is being conducted by Kenya MOH NMP, with technical oversight and funding by&#xD;
      CDC through the Jhpiego Impact Malaria project in Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To assess the efficacy of Artemether Lumefantrine (AL) and&#xD;
      Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DHP) for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Sites: One site will be selected in Siaya county and one site will be selected in&#xD;
      Bungoma county (Kimilili Sub-County). Both sites will be Level-2 facilities (health centers)&#xD;
      with high outpatient department attendance of patients with malaria. At each site, there will&#xD;
      be two study arms: one arm for AL and one arm for DHP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Period: March 2021 to September 2021&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This surveillance study is a two-arm prospective study Patient population:&#xD;
      Febrile patients aged between 6 months and 59 months, with confirmed uncomplicated P.&#xD;
      falciparum monoinfection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: At each site, at least 100 patients will be enrolled per drug (200 patients per&#xD;
      site, 400 patients total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment(s) and follow-up: Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a&#xD;
      28-day follow-up period to evaluate AL efficacy, and over a 42-day follow-up period to&#xD;
      evaluate DHP efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints: The proportion of patients with early treatment failure, late clinical&#xD;
      failure, late parasitological failure or an adequate clinical and parasitological response as&#xD;
      indicators of efficacy. Recrudescence will be distinguished from re-infection by polymerase&#xD;
      chain reaction (PCR) analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints: The frequency and nature of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory endpoints: to determine the polymorphism of molecular markers of drug resistance&#xD;
      and evasion of diagnostic testing; to determine the blood concentration of AL&#xD;
