  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal is to determine the real-world feasibility and utility of body fat imaging&#xD;
      using rapid MRI to enhance risk perception, induce behavioral change, and improve clinical&#xD;
      outcomes in overweight and obese individuals. Here, the investigators will perform a&#xD;
      pragmatic clinical effectiveness pilot trial using a 2x2 factorial design to test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that provision of a detailed individualized visual report of body fat distribution&#xD;
      directly to patients will translate into changes in patient risk perception, behavior, and&#xD;
      improved clinical outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Specific Aim 1: To compare the clinical effectiveness of communicating the body weight and&#xD;
      BMI using a visual aid alone versus a detailed body fat distribution report including&#xD;
      individualized images and values relative to normative data using a visual scale in a&#xD;
      population of overweight and obese adults with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes and at least&#xD;
      one additional cardiovascular disease risk factor. Hypothesis 1: Provision of a detailed body&#xD;
      fat distribution report contextualized with information describing the relevance of each body&#xD;
      fat parameter will be superior to provision of body weight/BMI information alone on risk&#xD;
      perception, behavioral change (enhanced physical activity, dietary choices, and preventive&#xD;
      provider practices and medication adherence), and clinical outcomes (reduction in weight and&#xD;
      waist circumference, blood pressure, triglycerides, and glycosylated hemoglobin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To compare the clinical effectiveness of communicating body fat information&#xD;
      to the medical provider (with the intent that the provider interprets the data and translates&#xD;
      it to the patient) versus communicating the body fat information directly to the patient.&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Provision of body fat information directly to the patient will be superior to&#xD;
      provision of the information to the provider on risk perception, behavioral change, and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes (as assessed in Aim 1).&#xD;

    <description>A detailed body composition profile report that consists of the following elements: basic demographic data, percent body fat, weight to muscle ratio, visceral fat and abdominal subcutaneous fat volume, visceral fat ratio (the fraction of visceral divided by total abdominal fat), muscle fat infiltration and liver fat (%), and thigh muscle volumes (also separated into right and left, anterior and posterior compartments). Each parameter is presented on a visual scale in the context of the individual value, general population defined by reference data (from United Kingdom (UK) Biobank population), a metabolic disease-free population (also from UK Biobank), low/high and very low/very high, corresponding to 15th and 5th percentiles, respectively. There are also descriptions of each biomarker and how they are derived to provide context for the recipient.</description>

    <description>Those randomized to body fat distribution imaging will be scanned on a 1.5 Tesla Siemens Aera MRI scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), located in the Center for Advanced Heart and Vascular Care using a 6-minute dual-echo Dixon Vibe protocol providing a water and fat separated volumetric data set covering neck to knees, and a multiecho Dixon acquisition for proton density fat fraction assessment in the liver. Images of the liver will be acquired using a 16-channel SENSE extra large Torso coil and images from the rest of the body will be acquired using the body coil. Volumetric imaging datasets of the body derived by MRI will be generated and adipose tissue/fat depots will be quantified: abdominal subcutaneous compartment (ASAT), visceral compartment (VAT), and hips and buttocks (lower body fat); proton density fat fraction of the liver (i.e. hepatic steatosis) as well as the quality of lean (skeletal muscle) including muscle volume and degree of fat infiltration.</description>
