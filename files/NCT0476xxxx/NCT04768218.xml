    <textblock>
      Introduction: At the present, conventional WLE (white light endoscopy) with biopsies&#xD;
      according updated Sydney system is still considered the gold-standard for the diagnosis and&#xD;
      stratification of gastric preneoplastic conditions. However, due to the high interobserver&#xD;
      variability and the scarce correlation between the endoscopic and histopathological report,&#xD;
      there is a growing use of virtual chromoendoscopy, which has shown excellent results on the&#xD;
      diagnosis of these conditions. Numerous studies demonstrated the utility of NBI (Narrow Band&#xD;
      Imaging) for this purpose, however, there is scarce data regarding the efficacy of the&#xD;
      FUJIFILM system, Blue Light Imaging (BLI), on this topic, especially in Europe, despite the&#xD;
      good results recently reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim: to validate the new high-resolution endoscopic technologies with BLI on the&#xD;
      diagnosis of gastric preneoplastic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods: a multicentric cohort study will be performed involving centres from&#xD;
      several European countries (Portugal, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Germany). Consecutive patients&#xD;
      performing upper gastrointestinal (GI)endoscopy will be evaluated by WLE and BLI. Random&#xD;
      biopsies or targeted plus random biopsies will be performed in order to determine de accuracy&#xD;
      of BLI system to detect and stage gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: We anticipate that BLI would enable us to assess the extension of GIM&#xD;
      without the need for biopsies. If observed, this would overall improve the upper GI endoscopy&#xD;
      accuracy.&#xD;
