  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cord blood will be taken after birth for evaluation of cytokines level. At age of 4-6 weeks,&#xD;
      we will do fundus examination for babies . Retrograde, we will study the perinatal risk&#xD;
      factors in subjects found to have retinopathy. Follow up fundus will be done according to&#xD;
      results of the first examination. By this study,we will be able later on to predict whom of&#xD;
      preterm infants are more prone to develop retinopathy of prematurity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      All patients will be subjected to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  History taking including name, sex and age at diagnosis of ROP.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Detailed obstetric history [maternal age, type of conception (natural, hormonal or&#xD;
                in vitro fertilization), type of delivery (vaginal or cesarean section), single or&#xD;
                multiple gestation, pregnancy complications (hypertension, diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
                placental abruption, premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis), drug&#xD;
                history including steroid treatment received prior to delivery].&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Neonatal data [Gestational age by weeks calculated from the last menstrual period&#xD;
                and confirmed by physical examination, birth weight in grams, Apgar scores at 1 and&#xD;
                5 minutes, weight appropriate or small for gestational age, presence of hypoxia&#xD;
                during or after delivery, need for oxygen therapy (mode of delivery, duration,&#xD;
                oxygen saturation), presence of clinical sepsis, Respiratory distress syndrome,&#xD;
                anemia or the need of blood transfusion].&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Complete physical examination will be done to all babies including cardiac, chest,&#xD;
                abdominal and neurological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Laboratory assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A- Routine assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Complete blood count (CBC) for the mother.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CBC for all infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B- Immunological assessment: level of Interleukin-6 and 8, and Tumor necrosis factor-α will&#xD;
      be assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Umbilical cord blood will be sampled by venipuncture of umbilical vein at birth under&#xD;
      complete aseptic conditions for determination of cytokine level. Cord blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected on serum separator tube with gel and then are allowed to clot for 30 minutes at&#xD;
      room temperature before centrifugation for 15 minutes at 1000xg. Serum will be removed and&#xD;
      stored at ≤ -20 ˚c.till assessment by Lab-scan 3D using Luminex assay multiplex kits&#xD;
&#xD;
      3- Fundus examination After training on fundus examination at ophthalmology department, I&#xD;
      will do it for babies. Current guidelines by the American Academy of Ophthalmology and&#xD;
      Pediatrics, and American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus recommend&#xD;
      that all infants with gestational age ≤32 weeks or birth weight ≤1500g should be screened for&#xD;
      retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Unnecessary examinations may increase the medical costs for&#xD;
      ROP screening. First examination will be done at age of 4 to 6 weeks of age, then every 2-3&#xD;
      weeks until their vessels have grown out to the ora serrate and the retina is considered&#xD;
      mature. If ROP is diagnosed, examination will be done every 1-2 weeks according to the&#xD;
      severity of the disease. The stage of ROP is the highest stage during all fundus examinations&#xD;
      done.&#xD;
