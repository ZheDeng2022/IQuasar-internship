      Purpose To investigate the significance of time to re-staging transurethral resection&#xD;
      (re-TUR) on recurrence and progression rates in patient with high-risk non-muscle-invasive&#xD;
      bladder cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Patients diagnosed with primary high risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer were&#xD;
      included to the study. The patients were randomly seperated into 3 groups acoording to Re-TUR&#xD;
      timing. In group 1,2, and 3, the time interval between initial and re-TUR were 14-28 days,&#xD;
      29-42 days, and 43-56 days respectively. Kaplan -meier plots were used to estimate&#xD;
      differences in recurrence free survival (RFS) and progression free survival (PFS) rates. Cox&#xD;
      regression analysis was used to assess the effect of time from initial TUR to re-TUR on&#xD;
      oncological outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results A total of 109 patients with high risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer were&#xD;
      randomly divided into 3 groups. Twenty patients in group 1 (14-28 days), 22 patients in group&#xD;
      2 (29-42 days), and 29 patients in group 3 (43-56 days) completed the study. The mean&#xD;
      follow-up was 20 ± 8.9 months. Kaplan-Meier plots showed no differences in RFS and PFS rates&#xD;
      between the three groups. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that only tumor number was&#xD;
      found to be a prognostic factor on RFS rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion Our prospective study demonstrated that time laps from initial TUR to re-TUR did&#xD;
      not significantly affect on RFS and PFS rates.&#xD;

      This study was performed between August 2016 and December 2020 after obtaining the approval&#xD;
      of local ethics committee (0651-5479). Patients diagnosed with primary high risk&#xD;
      non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer at our clinic as well as the patients who were referred to&#xD;
      our clinic with the same diagnosis were included to the study. All patients gave their&#xD;
      written informed consent. The patients were randomly separated into 3 groups according to&#xD;
      Re-TUR timing with the random number table envelope method. The names of the groups were&#xD;
      written on small papers with the same size, they were folded, put in an envelope, and drawn&#xD;
      by the doctors. In group 1,2, and 3, the time interval between initial and re-TUR were 14-28&#xD;
      days, 29-42 days, and 43-56 days respectively. Separate analysis was also performed for&#xD;
      patients who had re-TUR at ≤ 42 and &gt;42 days. All patients received six weekly instillations&#xD;
      of BCG therapy, and at least 1 year of maintenance BCG therapy (3 weekly instillations&#xD;
      administered at 3, 6, 12 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a tumor pathology other than transitional cell carcinoma, incomplete resection&#xD;
      at initial TUR, who cannot complete 1 year of maintenance BCG treatment, did not attend their&#xD;
      regular cystoscopic control or wanted to leave from the study voluntarily and lastly, with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of muscle-invasive cancer on re-TUR were excluded. Inclusion criteria were having a&#xD;
      high grade Ta or T1 transitional cell carcinoma with or without carcinoma in situ (CIS) after&#xD;
      a complete initial TUR of bladder carcinoma, and receiving six weekly induction BCG therapy&#xD;
      with at least 1 year maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Re-TUR contained resection of all visible tumor, deep resection of previously resected areas&#xD;
      and adequate sampling of muscle layers. Cystoscopic control was performed according to EAU&#xD;
      guideline recommendations for high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer [5,6]. Progresson&#xD;
      was defined as an increase in the pathological stage (Ta to T1 or T1 to T2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data of the patients like age, gender, and parameters related to bladder cancer&#xD;
      such as tumor grade, T stage, concomitant CIS, number of tumors, main tumor size, application&#xD;
      of early single dose chemotherapy, recurrence and progression were noted. Primary end points&#xD;
      of the current study were recurrence free survival (RFS) and progression free survival (PFS)&#xD;
      rates. Pathologic investigations were made by single expert uropathologist at our hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data analyses were performed with PASW 18 (SPSS, IBM, Chicago, IL) software.&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov and P-P plot tests were used to verify the normality of the distribution&#xD;
      of continuous variables. The results were reported as means standard deviations, or in&#xD;
      situations in which the distributions were skewed, as the median (minimum-maximum).&#xD;
      Categorical variables were given as percentages. For parameters that did not show normal&#xD;
      distribution, the nonparametric Kruskal Wallis One Way analysis of variance was used to&#xD;
      compare them. Multivariable semi-parametric Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate&#xD;
      predictors of RFS and PFS rates. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed for RFS and PFS and&#xD;
      groups were compared with the long-rank test. The study power and sample size were calculated&#xD;
      with G power 3.1.9.7 version (A priori). When effect size is set to 0.33 (medium size) with&#xD;
      80% power, the total number of patients required to be included in the study was 73. A p&#xD;
      value &lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant.&#xD;
