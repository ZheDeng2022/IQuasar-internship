  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Macrophage-driven immune dysregulation has been shown to be involved in pathophysiology of&#xD;
      diabetic gastroparesis. Currently, there are no non-invasive ways to study macrophage&#xD;
      activation in humans. This study aims to determine the utility of 11C-ER176 based PET-CT&#xD;
      scanning to determine pro-inflammatory macrophage activation in gastric wall of patients with&#xD;
      diabetic gastroparesis.&#xD;

    <description>All patients will have a PET/CT with 11C-ER 176. On each PET image, volumes of interest areas will be drawn around the stomach and other organs that may show radiotracer accumulation. The uptake of radiotracer 11C-ER 176 in each area will be quantified.</description>

    <description>An upper endoscopy procedure will be done for diabetic gastroparesis patients and full thickness core tissue samples will be taken in the stomach in areas that demonstrated 11C-ER 176 uptake in the PET scan as well as non-enhancing control areas. Immune cells will be assessed to determine expression of key pro and anti-inflammatory immune markers.</description>

    <description>An enrichment of markers associated with pro-inflammatory macrophages as well as loss of anti-inflammatory macrophages has been demonstrated in gastroparesis. There are currently no non-invasive ways of assessing immunopathology in the gastric muscle. Additionally, cellular changes can be patchy and untargeted full-thickness biopsies do not allow a comprehensive assessment of the gastric wall. Recently, there have been advancements in radioligands that can be used to determine activated macrophages. A novel, third-generation translocator protein (TSPO)-specific radioligand is ER176, which has shown high affinity and excellent in vivo target-to-background binding. Our preliminary data shows that TSPO is expressed in human gastric muscle macrophages. The overall goal of this proposal is to determine the utility of 11C-ER176 PET/CT imaging for assessing macrophage activation in vivo in gastric muscle of patients with diabetic gastroparesis.</description>

    <description>We hypothesize that increased uptake of 11C-ER176 associates with a shift towards pro-inflammatory macrophage milieu on tissue assessment made by targeted biopsies of gastric muscle. EUS guided biopsies will be taken from the enhancing as well as non-enhancing (control) areas from the diabetic gastroparesis patients. Immune cell gene expression will be determined for pro- and anti-inflammatory gene markers</description>
