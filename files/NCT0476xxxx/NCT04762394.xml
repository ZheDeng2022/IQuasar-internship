  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric, developmental and mental health problems are more common than renal, cardiac and&#xD;
      renal problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compartmental problems were often conceptualised across two broad spectrums: internalising&#xD;
      intrapersonal problems like anxiety, depression and withdrawal and externalising problems&#xD;
      such as Interpersonal problems such as hyperactivity and aggression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mental disorders with long-term consequences can result in children and adolescents,&#xD;
      undermining health compliance and reducing societies' ability to be safe and productive. As,&#xD;
      children and adolescent have long-term deteriorating effects of mental health problems are&#xD;
      often serious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early detection and identification of problems are in the best interest of children,&#xD;
      adolescents, their families, and the community as a whole. All three are important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      how epidemiology can help our understanding of children and adolescent mental health: the&#xD;
      burden of the community, measurement and tracking highly significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will display the first large-scale study of psychiatric disorders in children and&#xD;
      adolescents in the Egypt . to provide services, including prevention and intervention based&#xD;
      on evidence of mental health, a population-representative child survey and adolescent mental&#xD;
      estimates disorders were needed urgently&#xD;
