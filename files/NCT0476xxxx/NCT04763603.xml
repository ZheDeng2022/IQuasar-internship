  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Identification of intraplaque haemorrhage using MRI is technically demanding and sometimes&#xD;
      uncomfortable. Photoacoustic imaging is a new non-invasive technique combining&#xD;
      multi-wavelength infrared laser light and ultrasound imaging, able to discriminate blood and&#xD;
      other components in the tissues. The measurement by the multi-spectral photoacoustic imaging&#xD;
      is likely to be more acceptable and therefore could replace MRI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 60 patients with stenosis grade of &gt; 70% and considered for endarterectomy will be&#xD;
      recruited for additional imaging. Pre-operative PA/US and 3D MR imaging will be conducted.&#xD;
      Two patient groups are designed to allow performance assessment with respect to anatomy,&#xD;
      i.e., penetration depth; One with favourable anatomy (i.e. superficial carotids, proximal&#xD;
      plaques and low bifurcation), the other with no anatomical considerations. For in-vivo&#xD;
      verification of the morphology and mechanical properties obtained with PA/US imaging, the&#xD;
      pre-operative data will be compared to the MR data (imaging-imaging verification). Since the&#xD;
      patient is operated on, endarterectomy specimens are available for histo-pathological&#xD;
      examination and in-vitro testing for verification purposes: the excised tissue will be (snap&#xD;
      freeze with liquid Nitrogen) transported to TUE in Eindhoven for in-vitro validation&#xD;
      (imaging-histology verification). Paris patients will undergo surgery and tissues will be&#xD;
      transferred to Eindhoven for in vitro mechanical testing. Because of the transfer (-80 Â°C),&#xD;
      the rate of success for in vitro testing is expected to be smaller, around 40% (i.e. 12&#xD;
      subjects). Nevertheless, the power of the global analysis will be increased.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome is to evaluate the ability of the experimental device to visualize hemorrhage within the plaque. The primary endpoint will therefore be concordance with histology and plaque analysis (ex-vivo reference method) and MRI (invivo reference method).</description>
