  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective randomized-controlled study, treatment-naive H. pylori-infected patients&#xD;
      are randomized to receive either standard triple therapy or sequential therapy. The aim is to&#xD;
      compare the efficacy of concomitant quadruple therapy with standard triple therapy as a first&#xD;
      line treatment for H. pylori infection in Tunisian patients.&#xD;

      This study includes male and female patients aged between 18 and 65, with documented Hp&#xD;
      infection and who have had no previous eradication treatment.The diagnosis of Hp infection&#xD;
      was made through an anatomopathological study. Gastric biopsies were taken according to the&#xD;
      Sydney protocol: two fundics in one pot, two antrals and one at the angle of the lesser curve&#xD;
      in a second pot. The biopsies were studied by an experienced anatomopathologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The included patients were randomly divided into two treatment groups according to a 1: 1&#xD;
      ratio: the first group received concomitant quadruple therapy (QC) combining a double dose&#xD;
      PPI (esomeprazole: 40 mg x 2 per day) with the amoxicillin (1 g x 2 per day), metronidazole&#xD;
      (500 mg x 2 per day) and clarithromycin (500 mg x 2 per day) for 14 days. The second group&#xD;
      received triple therapy (TT) combining a double dose PPI (esomeprazole: 40 mg x 2 per day)&#xD;
      with amoxicillin (1 g x 2 per day) and clarithromycin (500 mg x 2 per day) for 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H. pylori eradication was assessed by the 13C-urea breath test 8 weeks after treatment.&#xD;
