  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at assessing the effectiveness of a novel liver specific nerve block in&#xD;
      improving pain control during painful liver interventional radiology procedures including&#xD;
      liver tumoral ablation and trans arterial chemoembolization, two procedures aimed at&#xD;
      controlling liver tumors, but that can be associated with significant pain. This novel&#xD;
      hepatic specific nerve block was designed by us and initial retrospective results suggests it&#xD;
      might help in controlling such liver procedural derived pain. The study was designed to&#xD;
      compare the liver block to a sham procedure in a blinded context and to follow the&#xD;
      participants over three days post-procedure to asses for pain levels.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study. Experienced interventional radiologists in the two McGill&#xD;
      University Health Centre study centers (Royal Victoria Hospital and Montreal General&#xD;
      Hospital) will perform all procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  80 consecutive subjects meeting the eligibility criteria, scheduled for&#xD;
           chemoembolization of the liver for primary or secondary liver malignancies OR&#xD;
           radiofrequency ablation of the liver for primary or secondary liver malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consent will be obtained from all patients by an interventional radiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All procedures will be performed by a qualified interventional radiology medical doctor&#xD;
           (IRMD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who accept to participate and fit the criteria will be randomized to either&#xD;
           receive hepatic plexus block or a placebo control procedure, consisting of injection of&#xD;
           normal saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hepatic hilum plexus nerve block will consist of the ultrasound-guided injection of&#xD;
           ropivacaine at the hepatic hilum anterior to the portal vein as close to the bifurcation&#xD;
           as possible. In the sham control group, the same location will be targeted, but only&#xD;
           normal saline will be injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A member of the radiology technologists will load the syringe with either ropivacaine or&#xD;
           normal saline and the IRMD will thus be blinded to the patient's allocated group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will be offered IV analgesia using midazolam and fentanyl during the&#xD;
           procedure at set regular intervals as per our standard regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Similar IV analgesics as well as oral analgesics will be provided as per set orders&#xD;
           during the recovery period in the post-procedural recovery room (PACU)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will be discharged home with standard prescriptions for home analgesics&#xD;
           which include routine medication and medication to be used for breakthrough pain. While&#xD;
           at home they will be entering pain surveys three times per day for three days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data will be gathered, stored, and analyzed. The analysis will be stratified into&#xD;
           patients who have received chemoembolization and patients who have received&#xD;
           radiofrequency ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up of the patient will occur as per routine 4-6 weeks post&#xD;
           chemoembolization/radiofrequency ablation to assess the clinical success of the&#xD;
           therapeutic procedure (ablation and TACE) and patient satisfaction with pain control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject data collection on the day of the procedure will include demographics, relevant&#xD;
      medical history, vital signs before and during the procedure, use of IV analgesics, use of&#xD;
      oral analgesics, use of nerve block or sham procedure and visual analogue pain scales at set&#xD;
      intervals during hospital stay. Subject data collection while at home will include visual&#xD;
      analogue pain scale and self-recording of medication intake.&#xD;
