      OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of non-invasive auricular VNS&#xD;
      (Vagus Nerve Stimulation) on sportive performance and physiological parameters in healthy&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHOD: 46 healthy young individuals aged 19.2(±1.5) years participated in the&#xD;
      study. The participants were randomly divided into 3 groups as Above Threshold Group (n:15;&#xD;
      10 females, 5 males), Under Threshold Group (n:15; 10 females, 5 males) and Control Group (no&#xD;
      stimulation) (n:16; 11 females, 5 males) according to the sensation of electrical current on&#xD;
      ears. The participants were evaluated 3 times; before the application, after the first and&#xD;
      second bicycle exercises. Numerical pain scale (NPS), pulse rate, blood pressure, respiratory&#xD;
      rate, and distance travelled during exercise for sportive performance were recorded in&#xD;
      kilometers as the evaluation method. The stimulation was done during the first bicycle&#xD;
      exercise with 5 minutes of duration. The Kruskal-wallis, mann-whitney u test were used for&#xD;
      the quantitative independent data obtained. In the analysis of qualitative independent data,&#xD;
      chi-squared test was used.&#xD;

      This study included 46 individuals aged 18-35 years in the home patient care laboratory at&#xD;
      Sinop University Vocational School of Turkeli. Priorities were explained and the permission&#xD;
      of the individuals was obtained. The number of females and males was divided into 3 groups as&#xD;
      randomized. Participants were evaluated by Numerical pain scale (NPS), pulse rate, blood&#xD;
      pressure, respiratory rate, and saturation measurement. In addition, the distance travelled&#xD;
      during the exercise for sportive performance was recorded in kilometers. In the study,&#xD;
      evaluation was conducted 3 times before the application, after the first and second bicycle&#xD;
      exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was double-blind randomized. Participants in the whole group were asked to perform&#xD;
      bicycle exercise with maximum performance under 50 watts for 5 minutes. In all groups&#xD;
      Vagustim device was used for stimulation. In the above threshold group, biphasic current was&#xD;
      applied as follows; frequency 10 Hz, in Modulation mode (Modulation mode is a combination of&#xD;
      pulse rate and pulse width modulation. The pulse rate and width are automatically varied in a&#xD;
      cycle pattern. The pulse width is reduced by 50% from its original setting in 0.5 second,&#xD;
      then the pulse rate is reduced by 50% from its original setting in 0.5 second. Total cycle&#xD;
      time is 1 second.), the pulse width was 300 μs. The current intensity was kept constant where&#xD;
      the participant felt the current comfortably and applied for 5 minutes. VNS was applied&#xD;
      bilaterally to transmit current from the tragus and concha parts of the ear. After the first&#xD;
      bicycle exercise, the participants were re-evaluated. In the second bicycle exercise, it was&#xD;
      asked to perform for 5 minutes under the same load without any application. The study was&#xD;
      evaluated for the third time and the study was completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the subthreshold group, the parameters were the same but the current was reduced to where&#xD;
      the participant did not feel the current after the threshold value was reached and again&#xD;
      applied for 5 minutes. It was re-evaluated after the first bicycle exercise. In the second&#xD;
      bicycle exercise, he was asked to perform bicycle exercise with maximum performance for 5&#xD;
      minutes under the same load without any application. The study was evaluated for the third&#xD;
      time and the study was completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group, bicycle exercise was performed under the same load with the&#xD;
      current-free headset produced for sham applications for 5 minutes. Participants were shown&#xD;
      that the device was working, but no current was given. It was re-evaluated after the first&#xD;
      bicycle exercise. In the second bicycle exercise, the device was removed and asked to perform&#xD;
      bicycle exercise with maximum performance for 5 minutes under the same load. The study was&#xD;
      evaluated for the third time and the study was completed.&#xD;
