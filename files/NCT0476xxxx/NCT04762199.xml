    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial evaluates the best dose and side effects of MRX-2843 when given in&#xD;
      combination with osimertinib in treating patients with EGFR gene mutant non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer that has spread to other places in the body (advanced). MRX-2843 and osimertinib may&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the safety and tolerability of Flt3/MerTK inhibitor MRX-2843 (MRX-2843) when&#xD;
      administered along with osimertinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the tested combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To perform biomarker profiling in order to&#xD;
      identify potential predictive biomarker to optimize treatment efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of MRX-2843.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive osimertinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and MRX-2843 PO QD on days 1-28.&#xD;
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for minimum of 30 days, or&#xD;
      until resolution of treatment-related toxicity to =&lt; grade 1, whichever is longer after&#xD;
      removal from study.&#xD;

          -  The effects of MRX-2843 and osimertinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For&#xD;
             this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she&#xD;
             should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this&#xD;
             protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the&#xD;
             duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of study drug&#xD;

          -  Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non-sterilized male&#xD;
             partner agree to use 2 methods of effective contraception from screening, and agree to&#xD;
             continue using such precautions for 90 days after the final dose of study drug;&#xD;
             cessation of birth control after this point should be discussed with a responsible&#xD;
             physician. Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are not&#xD;
             surgically sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or&#xD;
             complete hysterectomy) or postmenopausal (defined as 12 months with no menses without&#xD;
             an alternative medical cause)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-sterilized males who are sexually active with a female of childbearing potential&#xD;
             must agree to use an acceptable method of effective contraception from Day 1 and for&#xD;
             90 days after the final dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must be nonpregnant, and have a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test result at screening and day 1 of cycles 1-6&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  COHORT SPECIFIC ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dose Escalation Cohort: Patients with progressive EGFR (+) NSCLC disease; previously&#xD;
             treated or naive to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) (previous treatment with 3rd&#xD;
             generation EGFR-TKI including osimertinib allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dose Expansion Cohort A (Treatment naive):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Be treatment naive to osimertinib or any other EGFR TKI,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If treated with an EGFR TKI in the adjuvant, must have discontinued treatment&#xD;
                  prior to disease recurrence and be free of recurrence for at least 12 months (+1&#xD;
                  day) while off treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dose Expansion Cohort B (EGFR TKI resistant):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have progression of disease on osimertinib, erlotinib, gefitinib or afatinib as&#xD;
                  last previous systemic treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If not previously treated with osimertinib, must be EGFR-T790M negative as&#xD;
                  confirmed using a standard testing platform (circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic&#xD;
                  acid [ctDNA] or tissue based testing) prior to study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Backfill Cohort C: This cohort will be open to candidates who are not able to get into&#xD;
             any of the dose escalation or expansion cohorts. Examples will be a patient already on&#xD;
             osimertinib but without disease progression or an otherwise eligible patient who is&#xD;
             unable to wait for new cohorts to open due to disease burden and symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Such patients may be enrolled into the backfill cohort if they meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must meet the general eligibility requirements but do not meet cohort&#xD;
             specific requirements,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If currently on osimertinib, must have tolerated the standard dose of 80 mg for at&#xD;
             least 2 cycles without any grade &gt; 2 adverse events,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Will be treated at a dose previously established to be safe from the dose escalation&#xD;
             cohort,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Will not be included in the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) or maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
             (MTD) determination,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Approval by the study sponsor&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with symptomatic untreated brain metastases would be excluded from this&#xD;
             clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop&#xD;
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic&#xD;
             and other adverse events. Patient with treated or asymptomatic untreated brain&#xD;
             metastasis is allowed on study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to MRX-2843 or osimertinib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known diagnosis of interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with corrected QT (QTc) interval prolongation &gt; 500 msec (average of 3&#xD;
             readings), family history of congenital long QTc syndrome or torsades&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known cardiomyopathy or decreased left ventricular ejection fraction&#xD;
             (LVEF) &lt; 50%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with known history of keratitis or symptoms suggestive of keratitis (such as&#xD;
             eye inflammation, lacrimation, light sensitivity, blurred vision, eye pain and/or red&#xD;
             eye)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of&#xD;
             CYP450 enzyme(s) are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly&#xD;
             changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference.&#xD;
             As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled&#xD;
             on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need&#xD;
             to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or&#xD;
             herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because osimertinib is an agent with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with osimertinib and MRX-2843, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with the study agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with&#xD;
             osimertinib and MRX-2843. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal&#xD;
             infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be&#xD;
             undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has known or suspected history of retinitis pigmentosa or known or suspected&#xD;
             familial history of retinitis pigmentosa&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a history of type 1 diabetes (T1D) or is considered at high risk for T1D,&#xD;
             where high risk is defined as&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subject has one first-degree relative (defined as parents, offspring or siblings)&#xD;
                  with T1D and A1C value &gt; 6.5% or subject with two or more first-degree relatives&#xD;
                  with T1D&#xD;
