    <measure>Efficacy as measured by FSS scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy will be reported as the number of participants that dropped one point or more from their baseline Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) scores. FSS is a 9-item questionnaire with questions related to how fatigue interferes with certain activities according to a self-reported scale. Each of the items are scored on a 7 point scale with 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy as measured by MFIS Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) is a scale is used to measure fatigue with the total score ranging from 0 to 84 with 0 being the best possible score and 84 being the worst score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy as measured by the VAS scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) allows participants to rate their health on a 20 cm vertical with a higher number indicating better outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Efficacy as measured by the MSQOL Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life (MSQOL) has a total score ranging from 0 to 100 with a higher score indicating a better quality of life.</description>
