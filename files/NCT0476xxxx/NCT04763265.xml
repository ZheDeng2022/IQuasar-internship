  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to provide preliminary comparative data on BoNT/A-DP versus Botox&#xD;
      Cosmetic. Subsequently the sample size is primarily based on clinical judgement and practical&#xD;
      considerations.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, comparator-controlled study. The study&#xD;
      will take place in the EU, US and Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To allow all subjects to profit from treatment and to obtain adequate data for BoNT/A DP&#xD;
      treatment, the study will be comprised of a double-blinded treatment comparing BoNT/A-DP with&#xD;
      Botox Cosmetic (ratio 1:1). Primary and secondary endpoints will compare efficacy, safety and&#xD;
      subject satisfaction after a single treatment of the investigational BoNT/A DP to an existing&#xD;
      commercially available product (Botox Cosmetic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hundred subjects will be enrolled, which should allow for a precise estimate of response&#xD;
      rate and for post-hoc sensitivity analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of study participation for each subject will be up to 18 weeks, to include&#xD;
      screening (maximum of 2 weeks; re-screening will not be permitted), and a single treatment&#xD;
      (comprised of one injection at five injection points) of BoNT/A-DP (Group A) or Botox&#xD;
      Cosmetic (Group B) followed by six efficacy and safety follow-up visits. A total of 200&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized 1:1 to Group A or Group B at Baseline. Both investigators and&#xD;
      subjects will be blinded to treatment. Investigators and subjects will evaluate the severity&#xD;
      of glabellar lines independently.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Multi-center, randomized, double-blind, comparator-controlled study. The study will take place in the EU, US and Canada. The benefit of participation in this study is the expected reduction in the severity of glabellar frown lines.

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Eligible subjects will be randomized at Baseline (Day 0) to Group A or B in a 1:1 randomization scheme. Investigators and subjects will be blinded to the treatment administered and will evaluate the severity of glabellar lines independently. The subjects should perform their assessment independently and ideally before the investigator, to ensure they are not biased by the investigator. The same investigator must complete the Baseline assessments and FWS at Week 4 (primary endpoint assessments) for a given subject.</masking_description>
