  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Globus pharyngeus or sensation may be defined as a feeling of something a lump in the throat&#xD;
      without dysphagia. Kinesio tex tape is a medical tap developed by Dr. Kase for therapeutic&#xD;
      purposes and has been widely used in physical therapy applications in recent years. Although&#xD;
      it is not a treatment with full consensus, the patient's complaints can be corrected with a&#xD;
      small number of different therapy techniques or regulations on life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We conducted a therapy program with kinesio taping on patients who diagnosed with globus&#xD;
      pharyngeus for 8 session with sham kinesio taping controlled group. This study aimed to&#xD;
      assess of efficacy of the kinesio taping with therapy on patients patients who diagnosed with&#xD;
      globus pharyngeus.&#xD;
