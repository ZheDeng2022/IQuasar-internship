  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label, fixed sequence Phase 1, drug-drug interaction (DDI)&#xD;
      study in healthy subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following a screening period of up to 28 days, subjects will be admitted to the clinical&#xD;
      research unit into one of three cohorts. On the morning of Day 1, subjects in cohorts 1, 2,&#xD;
      and 3 will receive fasted doses of probe substrate(s) per assigned cohort. On Day 5, Cohort 2&#xD;
      only will receive a second fasted dose of probe substrates. Subjects in cohorts 1, 2, and 3&#xD;
      will receive the final fasted dose of probe substrate(s) on Day 13. Fasted ecopipam&#xD;
      administration will begin on Day 5 and will continue through Day 17 at ~2mg/kg for all&#xD;
      cohorts. Ecopipam doses will be tapered starting on Day 18 by 25 mg/day increments until&#xD;
      subjects are off drug, with final discharge occurring 24 hours after the ecopipam HCl dose&#xD;
      has been reduced to 25 mg (Day 21, 23, or 25).&#xD;
