    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility of a brief digital&#xD;
      mindfulness-based intervention for COPD patients and its effectiveness regarding the&#xD;
      reduction of psychological distress as well as stress.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) do not only suffer from somatic&#xD;
      symptoms but also from symptoms of anxiety and depression (defined as psychological distress)&#xD;
      as well as stress. As pharmacological interventions showed only limited effectiveness in&#xD;
      targeting the latter, a need for additional treatment options emerges. In other chronic&#xD;
      conditions, mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are effective in reducing symptoms of&#xD;
      psychological distress and stress. Despite first promising results, research on MBIs in COPD&#xD;
      patients is still scarce and mixed regarding their effects. Furthermore, it is crucial to&#xD;
      implement mental health interventions adapted to the needs of COPD patients. Due to often&#xD;
      experienced physical limitations and impaired mobility, digital MBIs seem particularly&#xD;
      promising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim and Research Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Building on the above, this pilot randomized controlled trial aims to examine a) the&#xD;
      feasibility of a brief digital MBI for COPD patients and b) its effects on psychological&#xD;
      distress and stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 psychologically distressed (assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS-A&#xD;
      ≥ 8 or HADS-D ≥ 8) COPD patients are screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria in a&#xD;
      telephone interview and randomly assigned to the MBI (plus treatment as usual) or waitlist&#xD;
      control group (treatment as usual). After a single face-to-face introductory session,&#xD;
      patients in the MBI condition are instructed to conduct at least one of four brief&#xD;
      audio-guided mindfulness exercises (10-15min) daily for 8 weeks, delivered on their&#xD;
      smartphones. Following an ecological momentary approach, psychological and respiratory&#xD;
      variables (e.g. subjective stress, dyspnoea) are assessed before and after each exercise.&#xD;
      These data will be analysed using multilevel modelling. Moreover, primary (psychological&#xD;
      distress) and secondary outcomes (e.g. chronic stress, fatigue) are measured at baseline, 4&#xD;
      weeks, 8 weeks, and follow-up, including questionnaires and assessments of biological stress&#xD;
      markers (hair cortisol, heart rate variability, electrodermal activity). The data will be&#xD;
      analysed using repeated measures ANOVAs. Finally, in semi-structured telephone exit&#xD;
      interviews with 15 patients of the MBI group, the intervention's feasibility will be explored&#xD;
      using a thematic analysis approach.&#xD;

    <description>The digital MBI consists of four auditory guided mindfulness exercises lasting between 10 and 15 minutes. The four exercises are a body scan and three sitting meditations (awareness of the heartbeat, awareness of the body, awareness of sounds). The exercises can be conducted via a software on participants' smartphones. Participants will be familiarized with the concept of mindfulness and the intervention in a single face-to-face introductory session. Additionally, participants will receive a manual, containing all relevant information. Participants will be instructed to practice at least once daily over the course of eight weeks, either in the morning or in the evening, and additionally whenever they desire to. They can choose individually between the exercises.</description>
