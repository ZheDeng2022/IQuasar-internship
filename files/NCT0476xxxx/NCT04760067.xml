  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to its nature, sports are an activity in which injuries are common. Sports injuries have&#xD;
      athletic and environmental reasons. In sports injuries, although the medical team is&#xD;
      generally interested in the physiological aspect of the injury, in recent years, the&#xD;
      psychological aspect of the injury has also started to be taken care of. One of these&#xD;
      psychological aspects is anxiety. Athletes who develop sports injury anxiety are more prone&#xD;
      to injury. One of the environmental reasons is the ground for sports. We could not find a&#xD;
      study in the literature comparing the anxiety levels of those who do sports on different&#xD;
      grounds in different sports branches. Our study will provide support to the literature in&#xD;
      this direction.&#xD;

      The study will be carried out on volunteers after the approval of the ethics committee.&#xD;
      Before the research, individuals and / or their relatives will be informed about the purpose&#xD;
      and content of the study. Volunteer athletes between the ages of 18-35 without any known&#xD;
      health problems will be included in the study after obtaining their informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      150 athletes competing on turf, artificial turf and wooden parquet will be included in our&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data of our study will be collected by Google survey. After obtaining the demographic&#xD;
      information of the athletes participating in our study, the data on injury anxiety will be&#xD;
      collected with the Sports Injury Anxiety Scale.&#xD;
