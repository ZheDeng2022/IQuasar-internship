      The objective of this study was to assess the changes in thyroid hormones and its activity&#xD;
      during CRRT in patients with Acute Kidney Injury.&#xD;

      After approval from the local Bioethics Committee of the Medical University of Gdańsk in&#xD;
      Poland, the study was carried out between February 2019 and February 2020 among 32 patients&#xD;
      admitted to ICU. There was no need to obtain written consent from the patients since the&#xD;
      study was observational with no therapeutic intervention and decisional incapacity caused&#xD;
      either by sedative drugs or severe condition of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with acute kidney injury and indications for initiation of continuous renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy (CRRT) were included to this study irrespective of their gender, race and&#xD;
      age. Exclusion criteria were patients with previous end-stage chronic kidney disease treated&#xD;
      with dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After decision to implement CRRT the serial blood samples were collected into two red-top&#xD;
      tube (no anticoagulant or preservative) before initiation of CRRT and at&#xD;
      1,2,3,6,9,12,15,18-day following. Last samples were collected 3 days after the end of CRRT.&#xD;
      Level of TSH, fT3 and fT4 were checked from the first tube after collecting the blood. Second&#xD;
      tube was kept frozen until levels of TRH, TT3, TT4, rT3 could be measured. In all the&#xD;
      patients high-dose continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) with citrate&#xD;
      anticoagulation was performed. Blood flow and dialysis dosage were the same for every patient&#xD;
      depending on their weight. The weight was rounded up or down and patients were assigned to&#xD;
      the nearest group.&#xD;
