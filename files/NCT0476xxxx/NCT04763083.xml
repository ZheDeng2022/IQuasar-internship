  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first clinical trial of the drug NVG-111, and will include patients with certain&#xD;
      types of blood cancer called chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma&#xD;
      (SLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). NVG-111 is a bispecific antibody drug, having two&#xD;
      &quot;arms&quot;, one arm attaches to a substance on cancer cells called ROR1, the other arm attaches&#xD;
      to the body's immune cells directing them to kill the cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial has two parts, the first part tests the safety of the drug at different dose&#xD;
      levels. Once the first part of the study is complete a dose will be chosen for the second&#xD;
      part of the study. The second part of the study will test how well NVG-111 works in treating&#xD;
      these diseases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Receptor tyrosine kinase-like Orphan Receptor 1 (ROR1) is a protein which is expressed at&#xD;
      high levels on many types of haematological cancers but is absent or expressed at low levels&#xD;
      in normal adult organs. NVG-111 is a bispecific antibody T cell engager, comprising tandem&#xD;
      single chain variable fragments (scFv), one arm binding to ROR1 on cancer cells, the other to&#xD;
      cell surface CD3 on lymphocytes. Dual binding of NVG-111 causes MHC-independent immunological&#xD;
      synapse formation, releasing perforins, granzyme B and cytokines, resulting in targeted&#xD;
      killing of the cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 1/2 first in human study to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy&#xD;
      of NVG-111 in patients with debulked, relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL and MCL on at least 2nd&#xD;
      line therapy. NVG-111 will be added on to existent therapy which will continue through the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 1, a range of doses will be studied in sequential cohorts to understand safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug and establish the recommended phase 2 dose&#xD;
      (RP2D). At each dose level, patients will receive 3 cycles of NVG-111 by continuous&#xD;
      intravenous infusion, each cycle consists of 21 days treatment followed by 7 days break. An&#xD;
      additional 3 cycles may be given depending on the response seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 2, efficacy and safety of NVG-111 at the RP2D will be studied in separate cohorts of&#xD;
      CLL/SLL and MCL patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have a safety follow up visit 4 weeks after completion of treatment with&#xD;
      NVG-111, and will then enter long term follow up for up to two years to evaluate the duration&#xD;
      of efficacy.&#xD;
