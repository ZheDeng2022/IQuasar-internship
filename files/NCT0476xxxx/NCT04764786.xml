      The aims of this study are to investigate the short term effects of MUFA alone vs. MUFA plus&#xD;
      Polyphenols contained in the extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) on the postprandial glycemic&#xD;
      response in patients with type 1 diabetes and to explore the possible mechanisms through&#xD;
      which MUFA alone or MUFA plus Polyphenols contained in EVOO could influence postprandial&#xD;
      glycaemia.The intervention will be preceded by two-weeks run-in period during which&#xD;
      participants will consume an usual olive oil, fill-in a 7-day dietary food record and&#xD;
      practice continuous blood glucose monitoring (CGM) in order to optimize basal insulin&#xD;
      infusion values and the insulin-to-glycemic load ratio.The study will be conducted according&#xD;
      to a randomized cross-over design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will consume, in random order at a distance of one week from each other, a&#xD;
      meal-test seasoned with extra virgin olive oil rich in polyphenols (EVOO + POLY) or a&#xD;
      meal-test seasoned with olive oil poor in polyphenols (OO-POLY). Upon fasting and during the&#xD;
      6 hours following the meal, patients will undergo to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Venous blood drawing samples for the evaluation of gastrointestinal hormones, markers of&#xD;
           systemic inflammation and oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Breath test with 13C-octanoic acid, for the study of gastric emptying. During the&#xD;
           experimental period the participants will undergo to continuous glucose monitoring&#xD;
           wearing sensors 7 days/week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will allow optimizing insulin therapy based on the macronutrient&#xD;
      composition of the meal in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus treated with insulin pump.&#xD;
      This will improve glycemic control and quality of life of these patients and reduce the risk&#xD;
      of developing chronic diabetes complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a recent study the use of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) (rich in MUFA) to a high glycemic&#xD;
      index meal attenuated the early PGR observed when this meal were consumed with either low-fat&#xD;
      or butter (rich in SAFA), while low glycemic index foods determined a blunted early&#xD;
      postprandial response and a late rise of blood glucose levels, independently of type and&#xD;
      quantity of fat added. Of relevance, the effects on PGR of dietary components known to&#xD;
      influence postprandial blood glucose metabolism, such as polyphenols, remain completely&#xD;
      unexplored in patients with T1D. Polyphenols are bioactive compounds with high antioxidant&#xD;
      power highly present also in EVOO, which could have contributed to the favorable effects on&#xD;
      PGR that the investigators observed in patients with T1D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to investigate the short term effects of MUFA alone vs. MUFA plus&#xD;
      Polyphenols contained in EVOO on the postprandial glycemic response in patients with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes and to explore the possible mechanisms through which MUFA alone or MUFA plus&#xD;
      Polyphenols contained in EVOO could influence postprandial glycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with type 1 diabetes treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for at&#xD;
      least 6 months and HbA1c less than 8.5%, will be recruited at the diabetes care unit of the&#xD;
      Federico II University teaching hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be preceded by two-weeks run-in period during which participants will&#xD;
      consume an usual olive oil, fill-in a 7-day dietary food record and practice continuous blood&#xD;
      glucose monitoring (CGM) in order to optimize basal insulin infusion values and the&#xD;
      insulin-to-glycemic load ratio.The study will be conducted according to a randomized&#xD;
      cross-over design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will consume, in random order at a distance of one week from each other, a&#xD;
      meal-test seasoned with extra virgin olive oil rich in polyphenols (EVOO + POLY), or a&#xD;
      meal-test seasoned with olive oil poor in polyphenols (OO- POLY). Upon fasting and during the&#xD;
      6 hours following the meal, patients will undergo to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Venous blood drawing samples for the evaluation of gastrointestinal hormones, markers of&#xD;
           systemic inflammation and oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Breath test with 13C-octanoic acid, for the study of gastric emptying. During the&#xD;
           experimental period the participants will undergo to continuous glucose monitoring&#xD;
           wearing their sensors 7 days/week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The meals will be similar in terms of glycemic load and macronutrient composition and will&#xD;
      differ in the type of seasoning used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test meal will be postponed in case of premeal blood glucose levels outside the 90-150&#xD;
      mg/dl range or a rapid decrease/increase of glucose levels (above 1 mg/dl per min) during the&#xD;
      previous 60 min according to CGM measurement, Pre-meal insulin doses, will be calculated&#xD;
      based on the individual insulin-to-glycemic load ratio and will be the same on all two&#xD;
      occasions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the experimental period, data from CGM and insulin pump will be downloaded by&#xD;
      dedicated informatics platforms. Participants will use the CGM system integrated with the&#xD;
      insulin pump, i.e., the one they are accustomed to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the difference between the postprandial blood glucose change&#xD;
      groups following dietary interventions and it will be evaluated by 2-way ANOVA for repeated&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will allow optimizing insulin therapy based on the macronutrient&#xD;
      composition of the meal in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus treated with insulin pump.&#xD;
      This will improve glycemic control and quality of life of these patients and reduce the risk&#xD;
      of developing chronic diabetes complications. These complications involve severe disability&#xD;
      for patients and huge costs for the community.&#xD;
