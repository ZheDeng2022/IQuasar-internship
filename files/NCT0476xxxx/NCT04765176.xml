    <textblock>
      The EASY post-market clinical follow-up study is undertaken to demonstrate safety and&#xD;
      clinical performance of the E-tegra Stent Graft System used in endovascular treatment of&#xD;
      infrarenal aortic aneurysm.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, patients will be observed who receive an E-tegra Stent Graft for the treatment&#xD;
      of infrarenal aortic aneurysm. The E-tegra Stent Graft will be implanted at the discretion of&#xD;
      the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating physicians will provide their observations collected during routine care for&#xD;
      patients they have decided to treat with the E-tegra stent graft. Informed consent of the&#xD;
      patients to the use of their clinical records for study purposes will be obtained before&#xD;
      their data will be collected in the post-market clinical follow-up study. All patients will&#xD;
      be asked to complete questionaires focussing on the health status (HS) (SF-12) and Quality of&#xD;
      Life (QoL) (WHOQOL-BREF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The period of data collection will be approximately 60 months from the date of intervention&#xD;
      for each patient. Source document verification will be performed on 100% of the patients;&#xD;
      data from all visits will be reviewed and verified against existing source documents.&#xD;
      Complete DICOM image files of the CT scans as well as other imaging files (e.g. CEUS, MRT)&#xD;
      will be sent to a CoreLab for independent second evaluation. There is no CoreLab screening&#xD;
      before inclusion. All adverse events defined prior to study start, will be adjudicated by the&#xD;
      Clinical Evaluation Committee (CEC).&#xD;
