      Approximately, 20 rural primary care practices to participate in a delayed&#xD;
      intervention-controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: Formal and structured work flow evaluations to better identify specific gaps in&#xD;
      processes of care while assessing what on-going training is needed for adoption of&#xD;
      high-quality cancer survivorship care in rural practice. These will be incorporated into the&#xD;
      ECHO sessions (Aim 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: Conduct and test the effectiveness of the novel KanSurvive-ECHO intervention (Aim2)&#xD;
      and finally identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of KanSurvive-ECHO (Aim 3).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While evidence-based practice (EBP) guidelines exist for cancer survivorship care,&#xD;
      implementation in rural practices has fallen short. Approximately 72.5% of Kansas cancer&#xD;
      survivors who have completed their cancer treatment receive a majority of their health care&#xD;
      from Primary Care Providers, yet these providers describe a lack of basic awareness of&#xD;
      risk-based surveillance, effects of cancer treatment and their management, as well as&#xD;
      inadequate resources, and growing administrative demands as reasons for not working to&#xD;
      improve survivorship care. These factors may also prevent shared care management of cancer&#xD;
      survivors between primary care and rural oncology care providers. There is a pressing need to&#xD;
      understand primary care practice capacity to implement guideline informed management and&#xD;
      follow-up for cancer survivors in the acute and extended phases of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1. Formally assess gaps in processes of care and additional training needed to&#xD;
      result in actual adoption of high-quality care for acute and chronic survivors of breast,&#xD;
      colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer in 20 rural primary care practices. Utilize this&#xD;
      formative information to further refine the KanSurvive-ECHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2. Evaluate the effectiveness of KanSurvive-ECHO for enhancing evidence-based&#xD;
      survivorship care for rural breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Compared to delayed intervention control, rural primary care practices randomized&#xD;
      to KanSurvive-ECHO will demonstrate greater concordance with evidence-based survivorship care&#xD;
      guidelines as measured by a composition score determined by change in EHR documentation&#xD;
      consistent with guideline concordant care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: Utilizing the Integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in&#xD;
      Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework describe key facilitators and barriers to implementation&#xD;
      of KanSurvive-ECHO including innovation, recipients, context, and facilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This novel project will provide a model for development of a community of practice using&#xD;
      practice facilitation and Project ECHO to improve the management and follow-up of cancer&#xD;
      survivors in the acute and extended phases of cancer survivorship.&#xD;
