    <description>During the dosing period, subjects administer the study drug (KHK7791 or placebo) twice daily just before meals in a double blind. The starting dose of the study drug is 5 mg at a time, and the dose is adjusted in the range of 5, 10, 20, and 30 mg at a time based on the dose adjustment criteria described in the study protocol. Dosage adjustment is performed step by step.</description>
