      The purpose of the present study is to develop and test a mobile mindfulness intervention for&#xD;
      Alcohol Use Disorder and PTSD among OEF/OIF veterans&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The long-term goal of this proposal is to improve treatment outcomes for OEF/OIF(Operation&#xD;
      Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom) veterans with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) who are not currently accessing care through the&#xD;
      Veterans Affairs Healthcare System (VA) or other settings. Many OEF/OIF veterans struggle&#xD;
      with heavy drinking and related consequences and this can be especially pronounced with the&#xD;
      co-occurrence of PTSD. Prior research has found aspects of self-regulation (emotion&#xD;
      regulation, impulse control), stress, and craving to be important putative targets in AUD and&#xD;
      PTSD symptom reduction. However, with upwards of 50% of veterans who have behavioral health&#xD;
      needs not seeking treatment, it is imperative to utilize advances in technology to develop&#xD;
      and test interventions that can reach non-treatment seeking veterans and target both symptoms&#xD;
      of PTSD and AUD. As the proposed mechanisms (e.g., self-regulation) are becoming better&#xD;
      understood regarding how they affect PTSD and AUD outcomes, approaches should focus on&#xD;
      targeting these mechanisms and evaluating if they are essential facilitators of change.&#xD;
      Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) can target such mechanisms, but a gap in the knowledge&#xD;
      persists regarding the utility of MBIs with veterans who screen positive for PTSD and AUD.&#xD;
      Therefore, we propose to improve treatment outcomes for OEF/OIF veterans with PTSD and AUD by&#xD;
      targeting self-regulation, stress, and cravings. We will develop and test a novel mobile MBI,&#xD;
      Mobile Mindfulness Based Relapse Prevention (mMBRP), that will improve upon evidence based&#xD;
      in-person and group MBRP by reaching veterans outside of treatment settings. The engaging and&#xD;
      easy to use mobile MBI integrates relapse prevention, stress reduction, and self-regulation&#xD;
      skills and is relevant to issues surrounding stigma and barriers that veterans face when&#xD;
      seeking services. The central hypothesis will be tested through a focus on three specific&#xD;
      aims: (1) refine and add MBRP content to the popular VA developed Mindfulness Coach mobile&#xD;
      application through a beta testing phase where we test for feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      the app, (2) pilot test the efficacy of the mMBRP mobile app on alcohol use and PTSD outcomes&#xD;
      compared to control, and (3) assess mechanisms of change such as self-regulation, stress, and&#xD;
      cravings, as well as exploratory moderators of gender, race/ethnicity, and recency of&#xD;
      discharge, on mMBRP effects. The unique strengths of this proposal are its focus on an&#xD;
      underserved population, utilization of mobile technology for intervention delivery, and use&#xD;
      of a novel intervention known to effectively target self-regulation and stress. The expected&#xD;
      results will define a viable and easy-to-access treatment that can improve both AUD and PTSD&#xD;
      symptoms. Results of this study will have a positive impact on substance use outcomes for&#xD;
      those who have experienced traumatic events and will identify mechanism of action for&#xD;
      treatment success. The app can be disseminated through our partners in the VA and through&#xD;
      targeted sharing on social media.&#xD;

    <description>Mindfulness Coach 2.0 is a mobile application designed by the VA's National Center for PTSD. The app provides: (a) psychoeducational topics related to mindfulness; (b) audio-guided mindfulness exercises; (c) self-assessment using the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (d) a journal to track mindfulness practice sessions; (e) goal setting and tracking; (f) personal, customizable reminders; and (g) immediate access to support and crisis resources. We will enhance Mindfulness Coach with MBRP content by adding information about the triangle of awareness to understand connections among thoughts, sensations, and emotions, and specific meditations of sober breathing space and urge surfing to deal with cravings. We will add additional MBRP-specific modules. Participants will be asked to complete the intervention during 8 weeks, with two to three modules per week. After a beta test with 20 veterans, feedback will be used to refine the app for the national randomized clinical trial (RCT).</description>
