  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm infants undergo early separation from parents and are exposed to frequent painful&#xD;
      clinical procedures, with resultant short- and long-term effects on their neurodevelopment.&#xD;
      We aimed to establish whether the mother's voice could provide an effective and safe&#xD;
      analgesia for preterm infants and whether endogenous oxytocin (OXT) could be linked to pain&#xD;
      modulation. Twenty preterm infants were exposed to three conditions-mother's live voice&#xD;
      (speaking or singing) and standard care-in random order during a painful procedure. OXT&#xD;
      levels (pg/mL) in saliva and plasma cortisol levels were quantified, and the Premature Infant&#xD;
      Pain Profile (PIPP) was blindly coded by trained psychologists.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth rates are continuously increasing in almost all countries, with 15 million&#xD;
      premature infants being born every year worldwide1. Despite rapid advances in technology, the&#xD;
      number of preterm-born children who show short- and long-term sequelae of prematurity, even&#xD;
      before reaching school age, remains high. Around 40% of low birth weight preterm infants&#xD;
      experience a complex spectrum of unfavourable neurodevelopmental outcomes when compared with&#xD;
      their pairs at term. Thus, prematurity is of great concern for health policies in both low-&#xD;
      and high-income countries. The impaired development of preterm infants is not only associated&#xD;
      with medical factors, but it is also at least partly a consequence of the atypical early-life&#xD;
      environment of these infants, including exposure to pain and separation from the primary&#xD;
      caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present work was first, to assess whether early closeness with parents during&#xD;
      essential but painful clinical procedures could have a positive role in pain modulation in&#xD;
      preterm infants, thus contributing to the universal right to pain relief. Second, we aimed to&#xD;
      investigate the possible role of the oxytocinergic system in this putative pain modulation&#xD;
      through maternal vocal contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present protocol, we introduce the effects of separation and early pain exposure as&#xD;
      two environmental factors that are even more deleterious when concomitant, inducing short-&#xD;
      and long-term problems in the preterm infant's development. We then suggest that there are&#xD;
      protective effects of early closeness between parents and preterm infants in early care and,&#xD;
      more specifically, of early vocal contact between parents and preterm infants during&#xD;
      hospitalisation. Lastly, we discuss the role of oxytocin (OXT) as a crucial biomarker for&#xD;
      attachment processes and in relation to brain inflammation due to stressful procedures for&#xD;
      preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).&#xD;

    <description>The PIPP-R score is a cluster of physiological and behavioural measures. Physiological assessment was calculated on the heart rate and oxygen saturation levels as collected from the patient monitor by the researcher. Inter-rater reliability was assessed by three independent coders: expert coders 1 and 2 performed blinded ratings from offline muted videos and digitally recorded physiological parameters, whereas coder 3 was a trained nurse and performed a direct online rating of the scores. Higher levels of pain scores indicate higher levels of pain</description>
