  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The multicomponet psychological intervention is called Feliz-Mente, with third generation&#xD;
      therapy components that aims to improve wellbeing and self-enhancement. Without intervening&#xD;
      directly on the symptoms, it is expected to increase positive experiences, the use of&#xD;
      personal strengths and positive relationships, and aims to build a more meaningful&#xD;
      self-narrative in persons with severe psychiatric conditions. Feliz-Mente is a group&#xD;
      intervention of 12 sessions in which participants are expected to perform exercises during&#xD;
      and between sessions to improve treatment adherence and daily practice. The design for the&#xD;
      present study is a randomized controlled trial, which compares the post-intervention measures&#xD;
      of the experimental group (group receiving the intervention) with the post-intervention&#xD;
      measures of the control group (treatment as usual + waiting list).&#xD;

    <description>The intervention aims to improve well-being, without denying the existence of symptoms or problems, focusing on generating positive emotions and actions congruent with the person's values through 11 weekly 90-minute group sessions. The multi-component intervention manual was composed of evidence-based exercises of Positive Psychoterapy Interventions, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and Mindfulness and was theory driven according the broaden-and-build-theory (Fredrickson, 2001) and the self-serving model of paranoia (Murphy et al., 2018). It was also informed by previous pilot studies carried out on people with paranoid tendencies (see Valiente et al., 2020) and with Severe Psyquiatric Condition samples.</description>
