    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to address gaps in knowledge related to the influence of&#xD;
      pediatric fruit and vegetable prescription programs on food security, child dietary patterns,&#xD;
      and weight status. To do this, we will compare demographically similar pediatric patient&#xD;
      groups from three large clinics in a low-income urban city based on their exposure to a fruit&#xD;
      and vegetable prescription program (FVPP) that provides one $15 prescription for fresh fruits&#xD;
      and vegetable to every child at every office visit. Three clusters will be identified based&#xD;
      on child exposure to the pediatric FVPP at baseline: high exposure (&gt;24 months), moderate&#xD;
      exposure (12-24 months), and no previous exposure. We will then introduce the FVPP to never&#xD;
      exposed patients and collect, record, and compare changes in dietary intake, food security,&#xD;
      and weight status over time. We will test the hypothesis that exposure to the FVPP is&#xD;
      associated with higher intake of fruits and vegetables, better food security, and lower rates&#xD;
      of obesity among children. The first aim will compare baseline dietary intake, food security,&#xD;
      and weight status between high exposure, moderate exposure, no exposure groups. The second&#xD;
      aim will measure changes in diet, food security, and weight status at 6-, 12-, 18-, and&#xD;
      24-months among children newly exposed to the FVPP. The third aim will compare follow-up&#xD;
      measures of dietary intake, food security, and weight status in the initial no exposure group&#xD;
      to baseline measures in the high exposure group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate a Fruit and Vegetable Prescription Program (FVPP). The program&#xD;
      provides one $15 prescription for fresh produce to every child at every office visit.&#xD;
      Prescriptions are redeemable at a local farmers' market and mobile market. To determine&#xD;
      whether exposure to the FVPP is associated with improvements in dietary intake, food&#xD;
      security, and health status, we will compare demographically similar pediatric patient groups&#xD;
      with varying levels of exposure to the FVPP at baseline: high exposure (&gt;24 months), moderate&#xD;
      exposure (12-24 months), and no previous exposure. We will then introduce the FVPP to never&#xD;
      exposed patients and collect, record, and compare changes in dietary intake, food security,&#xD;
      and weight status over time. The central hypothesis is that exposure to the FVPP is&#xD;
      associated with higher intake of fruits and vegetables, better food security, and lower rates&#xD;
      of childhood obesity over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose the following three specific aims to test our hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 - Compare baseline dietary intake, food security, and weight status between pediatric&#xD;
      patients with varying levels of exposure to the FVPP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 - Measure changes in diet, food security, and weight status when never exposed children&#xD;
      are introduced to the FVPP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3 - Compare mean follow-up measures of dietary intake, food security, and weight status&#xD;
      in the initial no exposure group to baseline measures in the high exposure group.&#xD;

    <description>Dietary data from children will be collected via two non-consecutive dietary recalls and one validated food frequency questionnaire. Two non-consecutive 24-hour dietary recalls will be collected using the Automated Self-Administered 24-Hour (ASA24®) Dietary Assessment Tool. We will also administer Block Kids Food Screener, a food frequency questionnaire, to allow for the assessment of usual and long-term eating behaviors. The Block Kids Food Screener will provide nutrient estimates and number of servings by food groups. We will use this data to determine change in child-reported mean daily intake of total fruits and vegetables, total vegetables, total fruits, and whole fruits.</description>
