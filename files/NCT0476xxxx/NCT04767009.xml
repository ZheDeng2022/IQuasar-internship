  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the impressive response rate to PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors, resistance&#xD;
      inevitably develops in most patients. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) plays a&#xD;
      growing role in the management of oligometastatic disease. This study aims to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of SBRT for oligoprogressive NSCLC after treatment with PD-1 inhibitors.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>1-year New Lesion-Free Survival Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>One-year new lesion-free survival rate was defined as the percentage of patients without the appearance of any new metastatic lesions outside the radiation field for at least 1 year after the start of SBRT. Patients who died or developed progressive disease within the radiation field within 1 year after SBRT were censored.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Two years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was measured from the date of enrollment to the date of disease progression as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) Version 1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. For patients whose disease did not progress, PFS was evaluated by censoring patients at their most recent imaging.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Two years</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as the time from the date of enrollment until death by any cause. Participants still alive at the time of data analysis were censored at the date of last follow-up.</description>

    <description>Patients with oligoprogressive NSCLC after treatment with PD-1 inhibitors will be treated with curative-intent SBRT of progressing lesions. The choice of dose-fractionation regimen is at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist. PD-1 blockade will be withheld one day before the treatment and resumed within 2 weeks after completion of SBRT.</description>
