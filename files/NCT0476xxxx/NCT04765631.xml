  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is a major public health problem, associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      fractures. Diabetes even appears to be the most important predictor of low kinetic fractures&#xD;
      in men and women, and the risk of hip fracture in type 2 diabetics is increased by 40 to 50%,&#xD;
      with often more serious consequences (post-operative complications, longer hospital stays,&#xD;
      increased mortality rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the risk of fractures is estimated by the measure of areal bone mineral density&#xD;
      (aBMD) and T-score. However, in diabetics aBMD is not decreased, and even paradoxically&#xD;
      increased. Indeed, aBMD is 5-10% higher in type 2 diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic&#xD;
      subjects, which suggests that the assessment of fracture risk in these patients is&#xD;
      underestimated. The High Resolution peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (HR-pQCT) 3D&#xD;
      bone imaging technique has a resolution close to the size of the bone trabeculae. It is used&#xD;
      to assess volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) and bone microarchitecture at the tibia and&#xD;
      distal radius, and enables a better estimation of the fracture risk compared to the&#xD;
      measurement of aBMD. Our hypothesis is that bone microarchitecture is altered in type 2&#xD;
      diabetic patients, explaining the increased risk of fracture in this population compared to&#xD;
      non-diabetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to set up a descriptive case control study, nestled in 3 cohorts of men and women&#xD;
      (QUALYOR, OFELY and STRAMBO), to compare the bone micro-architecture measured by HR-pQCT at&#xD;
      the level of the tibia and distal radius, in type 2 diabetics compared to non-diabetic&#xD;
      subjects from the same cohorts.&#xD;
