             plan, laboratory tests, lifestyle considerations, and other study procedures,&#xD;
             including completion of the e-diary from Day 1 to Day 7 following administration of&#xD;
             investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy females at enrollment who are determined by medical history, physical&#xD;
             examination, and clinical judgment of the investigator to be eligible for inclusion in&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Expected to be available for the duration of the study and who can be contacted by&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant female participants; breastfeeding female participants; positive urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) at Visit 1 (prior to&#xD;
             vaccination)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe adverse reaction associated with a vaccine and/or severe allergic&#xD;
             reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) to any component of the investigational product or any&#xD;
             diphtheria toxoid-containing or CRM197-containing vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of microbiologically proven invasive disease caused by group B streptococcus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, including recent (within the&#xD;
             past year) or active suicidal ideation/behavior or laboratory abnormality that may&#xD;
             increase the risk of study participation or, in the investigator's judgment, make the&#xD;
             participant inappropriate for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous vaccination with any licensed or investigational GBS vaccine, or planned&#xD;
             receipt during the participant's participation in the study (through the 6-month&#xD;
             follow-up visit [Visit 3]).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vaccination within 5 years with tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and acellular&#xD;
             pertussis-containing vaccines (Tdap) before investigational product administration.&#xD;
