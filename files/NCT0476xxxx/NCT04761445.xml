  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this prospective study is to compare clinically and radiographically two&#xD;
      different tissue-level implants, in partially edentulous patients in the posterior area of&#xD;
      the maxilla and mandible. The primary objective of the study was to track the crestal bone&#xD;
      level changes around the two implant systems. Secondary objectives were implant stability as&#xD;
      well as initial soft tissue thickness which were evaluated throughout this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a prospective clinical trial with a parallel design comparing two&#xD;
      different tissue-level implants placed adjacently in the posterior maxilla and mandible. The&#xD;
      primary outcome is the change in the interproximal crestal bone level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in this study were recruited from the general population attending the department of&#xD;
      Periodontology at the Saint-Joseph University. Adult patients (males and females) in need of&#xD;
      implant rehabilitation for partial edentulism in the posterior maxilla and mandible have been&#xD;
      selected to take part in this study. Following initial screening procedures, each patient&#xD;
      underwent a site-specific intraoral and radiographic examination (Cone Beam Computed&#xD;
      Tomography analysis and periapical radiographs) in order to make sure that the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria were satisfied. Patients presenting with bone width of less than 6 mm or more than 9&#xD;
      mm were immediately excluded from the study. The day of the surgery, each implantation site&#xD;
      was given a number depending on the tooth missing. Then, using a random team generator&#xD;
      software each site was randomly assigned to one of the two groups based on the implant system&#xD;
      used:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group (group 1) consisted of patients receiving Straumann Standard Plus (SP)&#xD;
      implants of 4.1 mm in diameter and length of 10 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second group (group 2) included patients receiving JD Octa implants of 4.3 mm in diameter&#xD;
      and 10 mm in length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were blinded as to the assignment in the first or second group. The implant&#xD;
      placement procedures were planned based on clinical and radiographic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters were monitored for each case:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crestal bone level changes (CBL)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary implant stability&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial soft tissue thickness&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a healing time of 3 months Patients were recalled 6 and 12 months after prosthetic&#xD;
      treatment. At each visit, the restorations were evaluated for mobility, oral hygiene,&#xD;
      peri-implant soft tissue conditions and patient satisfaction. Intraoral standardized&#xD;
      radiographs were also taken at the 12-months follow-up visit to evaluate crestal bone level&#xD;
      changes. CBL changes were defined as the difference between two consecutive CBL measurements.&#xD;
      Secondary implant stability was evaluated. Impressions were taken at the implant level.&#xD;
      Abutments were fixed on the implants with titanium screws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to reduce the risk of bias in the study, all the implant-supported crowns were screw&#xD;
      retained. However, in only one case, and due to prosthetic considerations, two&#xD;
      implant-supported crowns were cemented using a temporary cement. In this case, the&#xD;
      restorations were thoroughly checked for excessive cement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final restorations were delivered within 2 weeks of referral. Finally, standardized&#xD;
      radiographs were taken to ensure abutment seating and check for residual cement (in the case&#xD;
      of cemented crowns).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were recalled 6 and 12 months after prosthetic treatment. At each visit, the&#xD;
      restorations were evaluated for mobility, oral hygiene, peri-implant soft tissue conditions&#xD;
      and patient satisfaction. Intraoral standardized radiographs were also taken at the 12-months&#xD;
      follow-up visit to evaluate crestal bone level changes. As described previously, CBL changes&#xD;
      were defined as the difference between two consecutive CBL measurements.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Crestal bone level changes.</measure>
    <time_frame>Radiographic evaluation took place at three time periods: at implant placement, at implant loading and one year after implant loading.</time_frame>
    <description>Peri-implant CBL changes were assessed using periapical radiographs. Radiographs were taken according to the long cone, paralleling technique, using a positioner (XCP Rinn holders, Dentsply Friadent Schweiz, Nidau, Switzerland) parallel to the implant axis and perpendicular to the cone of rays. An individualized radiographic mount (foam and acrylic) was used for each patient to standardize the periapical radiographs. This technique allows the repositioning of the image plate in future radiologic examinations. For the digital process, an image measuring program, Image J (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health) was used.</description>
