  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-oxygenation increases oxygen reserves in the body to reduce the likelihood of oxygen&#xD;
      desaturation on induction of general anaesthesia. Pre-oxygenation with facemask is the&#xD;
      commonest method method of pre-oxygenation. High-flow nasal oxygen is a newer alternative.&#xD;
      This study randomises participants to receive pre-oxygenation by one of three methods:&#xD;
      facemask, high-flow nasal oxygen, high-flow nasal oxygen plus mouthpiece.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The administration of supplemental oxygen prior to induction of anaesthesia is known as&#xD;
      pre-oxygenation. Pre-oxygenation increases oxygen reserves in the body with the purpose of&#xD;
      delaying the time until oxygen desaturation after breathing stops (apnoea) following the&#xD;
      administration of an anaesthetic. In the last decade, clinicians have begun utilising&#xD;
      high-flow nasal oxygen for pre-oxygenation. However, the rationale for this is based largely&#xD;
      on its ability to achieve ongoing oxygenation after the onset of apnoea (apnoeic&#xD;
      oxygenation). This study isolates oxygen administration with high-flow nasal oxygen to the&#xD;
      period when the person is breathing, without ongoing oxygen administration during the apnoea&#xD;
      period, to quantify its effects during the pre-oxygenation period only. A third group of&#xD;
      participants breathes oxygen through a mouthpiece in addition to receiving oxygen via&#xD;
      high-flow nasal cannulae. The effect of these pre-oxygenation methods will be measured by the&#xD;
      time taken until oxygen saturation levels decline to the lower end of the normal range (92%),&#xD;
      along with other parameters such as blood oxygen levels.&#xD;

    <description>Induction of anaesthesia after 2mins 45 seconds of pre-oxygenation with 1-1.5mcg/kg remifentanil plus 2-3mg/kg propofol. Propofol (10mg/kg/hr) and remifentanil (0.15mcg/kg/min) infusions commenced until study conclusion.&#xD;
Positive pressure ventilation commenced at Sp02 92%. Failure to intubate the patient during the first minute of apnoea results in withdrawal from the study.&#xD;
Blood samples obtained from an arterial catheter immediately prior to commencing pre-oxygenation, after 90 and 180 seconds of pre-oxygenation, after one minute of apnoea, and every two minutes during the apnoeic period.</description>
