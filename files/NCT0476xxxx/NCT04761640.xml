  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is one of the most frequent cancer concerning human beings and it represents,&#xD;
      worldwide, one of the first cause of death. Most of patients with this cancer are males and&#xD;
      85% of lung cancers are non-small cells type (NSCLC) with adenocarcinoma being the most&#xD;
      common histologic subtype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with pulmonary cancer have a poor long-term prognosis with an overall 5 years of&#xD;
      survival which is less than 25% for all stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The natural immune system, with polynuclear neutrophils (PNN) is involved in carcinogenesis.&#xD;
      The impact of PNN localized within the tumor as a prognostic biomarker has not been really&#xD;
      studied in non-small cells lung cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to some studies, an increase in the number of PNN (labelled by the CD66b antibody)&#xD;
      within the tumor is associated to a greater risk of relapse and a poor overall survival rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intra-tumoral ratio PNN over Lymphocytes T CD8 + (iNTR) is an independent factor of the&#xD;
      poor prognosis concerning the overall survival rate and concerning risk of relapse with&#xD;
      patients who went through a first surgery for a non-small cells lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this study we will initially concentrate on lung adenocarcinoma and attempt to evaluate&#xD;
      the PNN's rate within the tumor and its impact on an overall survival rate and&#xD;
      progression-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, we will explore the role of iNTR and the mutational profile of tumors concerning&#xD;
      this survival.&#xD;

    <description>The total number of PNN will be determined by cellular counting on HES slides. The total number of PNN CD66 +, and MPO + will be determined by cell count after immunohistochemical analysis.&#xD;
The appearance of lymph node metastasis or distant metastasis will be considered as a recurrence.&#xD;
The date of the initial surgery, the vital status (deceased/ alive), the possible date of the recurrence as well as the date of death and/ or latest news will be used to estimate the survival rate (with or without recurrence)</description>
