  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Femoral and adductor nerve blocks with ultrasonography(USG) guidance are used effectively and&#xD;
      efficiently in post-operative pain management in lower extremity surgical procedures.&#xD;
      However, the superiority of these two blocks to each other is still controversial. In this&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, double-blind study, patients who underwent elective unilateral knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia, will be performed postoperative femoral block or middle&#xD;
      adductor canal block with the guidance of USG.Patients who underwent spinal anesthesia and&#xD;
      needed sedoanalgesia and who had to switch to general anesthesia will be excluded from the&#xD;
      study. The patients will be divided into two groups by simple randomization. Since a total of&#xD;
      52 patients should be included in the study as a result of the power analysis (G-power 3.1);&#xD;
      It is planned to take approximately 26 patients for each group.The anesthesiologist, who&#xD;
      follows the pain control and mobilization after the block, will not know which study group&#xD;
      the patient is in. The blocks will be performed behind the cover while the patient is under&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia (Thus, the point of application of the block will not be noticed). In this&#xD;
      way, the patient and the anesthesiologist who follows the parameters after the block will be&#xD;
      blind to patient's arm. In the first group, 0.25% 20 ml of local anesthetic and middle&#xD;
      adductor canal block, in the second group 0.25% 20 ml of local anesthetic and femoral nerve&#xD;
      block will be applied We will compare these two blocks in terms of early mobilization,&#xD;
      postoperative pain control, motor, and sensory block.&#xD;

      All patients scheduled for total knee arthroplasty will be evaluated before the operation.&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be informed about the study and &quot;Numeric Rating Scale&quot; for pain&#xD;
      evaluation. Then, patients will be asked for informed consent. After approval from the local&#xD;
      research ethics committee, first patient will be recruited for study and patient's group will&#xD;
      be determined by dice roll. Patients who are scheduled for primary total knee arthroplasty&#xD;
      under spinal anesthesia with a planned sensory block level between T4 and T7 dermatomes, will&#xD;
      be recruited and assigned to a group.Femoral block or middle adductor canal block will be&#xD;
      applied to the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group1 (Group 1 Middle Adductor Canal Block) patients will be administered middle adductor&#xD;
      canal block with 20 ml 0.25% Bupivacaine by an experienced anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group2 (Femoral Nerve Block) patients will be administered femoral block with 20 ml 0.25%&#xD;
      Bupivacaine by an experienced anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selected block will be applied with USG behind the curtain after the operation.Patients&#xD;
      will be taken to the postoperative recovery unit.Patients will be followed-up in&#xD;
      post-anesthesia care unit and in the ward for 48 hours. Post-operatively, patients will&#xD;
      receive 1mg/kg Tramadol when Numeric Rating Scale(NRS) &gt; 3.The duration of the sensory and&#xD;
      motor block and the mobilization of the patients will be recorded and compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      0,2,4,6,8,12,24 of the patient pain scores at hour and 6 months, presence of sensory block&#xD;
      and motor block, pain score when the patient is mobilized will be recorded.In addition,&#xD;
      operation time, complications related to block, mobilization time, discharge day, and opioid&#xD;
      need will be recorded.It will be recorded at what time the first opioid dose was administered&#xD;
      after the block.&#xD;
