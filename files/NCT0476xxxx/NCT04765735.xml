    <measure>The proportion of subjects with a reduction in overstimulation sensation with SCS using a closed-loop algorithm compared with SCS in open-loop</measure>
    <time_frame>In-clinic testing (1 day)</time_frame>
    <description>For every overstimulation sensation brought about by protocol-prescribed activities, subjects will rate the intensity of the sensation using a 5-point Likert scale. The average intensity score during OL and CL periods will be calculated for each subject. If the average intensity score during CL period is less than that from the OL period, the subject is considered as a subject with a reduction in overstimulation sensation during CL vs. OL period. The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects with a reduction in overstimulation sensation among subjects who have in-clinic testing.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  22 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Candidate for or undergoing Medtronic SCS device trial for labeled indication -&#xD;
             Candidate for or undergoing a Medtronic SCS device trial for labeled indication means&#xD;
             that a clinical decision has already been made between a physician and the patient to&#xD;
             undergo Medtronic SCS trialing to treat the patient's chronic pain. This decision is&#xD;
             to be made prior to discussing with the patient whether to enroll in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to provide signed and dated informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of comprehending and consenting in English&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to comply with all study procedures and visits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clear, measurable ECAP ECAPs - If during set up of the in-clinic testing, the subject&#xD;
             does not have a clear, measurable ECAP (&gt;10uV amplitude obtained consistently and&#xD;
             repeatably) they will not move forward with testing or randomization and will be&#xD;
             considered a screen failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Implanted electrical cardiac devices (e.g., pacemaker, defibrillator)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently enrolled or planning to enroll in an interventional clinical study that&#xD;
             could potentially confound the study results (co-enrollment in an interventional study&#xD;
             is only allowed when documented pre-approval is obtained from the Medtronic study&#xD;
             manager or designee)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or is of child-bearing potential and unwilling to use a medically acceptable&#xD;
             form of birth control during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has untreated major psychiatric comorbidity, as determined by the investigator or&#xD;
             designee&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Trialed with a permanent implant lead and extension (&quot;buried lead trial&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If subject is classified as vulnerable or requires a legally authorized representative&#xD;
             (LAR)&#xD;
