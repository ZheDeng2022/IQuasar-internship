  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polar stays expose people to extreme climate, isolation and confinement. The combination of&#xD;
      these factors induces psychological disorders, sleep disorders, immune and endocrine&#xD;
      disturbances, and deficiencies. In the TAAF, (French Southern and Antarctic Lands) two types&#xD;
      of population coexist: winter residents, exposed to these stressors over long periods, and&#xD;
      country people, who benefit from milder conditions and only make short stays. In this&#xD;
      context, the investigators have decided to set up this cohort study with the objective of&#xD;
      comparing the state of health of the winterers of the TAAF from 2012 to 2017 with that of the&#xD;
      country people of the same period, before their stay, during and the year following their&#xD;
      return.&#xD;
