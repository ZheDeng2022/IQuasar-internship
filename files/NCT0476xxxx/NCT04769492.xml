  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Black young gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (B-YGBMSM) and transgender&#xD;
      women (B-YTW) are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS in the U.S. Youth in the House Ball&#xD;
      Community (HBC), a subculture of the Black gay community that offers a social network to&#xD;
      freely express diverse sexual and gender identities, are among the most at-risk for HIV&#xD;
      infection and loss to care, but barriers exist to the provision of HIV services within this&#xD;
      community. One barrier is the increasing rates of violence. Interventions are needed that&#xD;
      will interrupt the cycle of violence within the HBC to allow for adequate provision of HIV&#xD;
      services and increased access to HIV care. The investigators propose to tailor the Cure&#xD;
      Violence model for violence prevention for developmental-appropriateness,&#xD;
      cultural-specificity and HIV relevance, then pilot test the new intervention&#xD;
      (#ChopViolence/#ChopHIV) with B-YGBMSM and B-TW in the Chicago HBC. The proposed research&#xD;
      activities will take place in six steps. In Step 1, the investigators will hold Youth&#xD;
      Advisory Board meetings, finalize our assessment battery and conduct multiple baseline&#xD;
      assessments (months 3, 9 &amp; 15; n=75 per assessment point) at HBC venues to track trends in&#xD;
      violence (i.e., intimate partner, HBC and neighborhood violence), HIV stigma, substance use,&#xD;
      mental health, sexual risk and HIV care engagement. In Step 2, the investigators will employ&#xD;
      ADAPT-ITT strategies for adapting evidence-based interventions including conducting a series&#xD;
      of focus groups (n=32) with youth and leaders from the HBC in order to identify persuasive&#xD;
      messaging around decreasing violence and improving HIV outcomes. Based on the focus group&#xD;
      data as well as consultation with community experts, the investigators will then tailor the&#xD;
      intervention to be relevant for the Chicago HBC and develop training materials along with&#xD;
      standard operating procedures. In Step 3, the investigators will identify, recruit and train&#xD;
      trusted members of the HBC to work as Violence Interrupters (VI) or Outreach Workers (OW). VI&#xD;
      and OW will undergo training over the course of several weeks. Training activities include&#xD;
      didactic seminars, webinars from the Cure Violence team, HIV education, conflict mediation&#xD;
      skills and mock interruption and outreach activities. In Step 4, the investigators will pilot&#xD;
      test the tailored intervention. VI will monitor HBC events as well as social media venues for&#xD;
      potential violence and intervene. OW will build their client caseload with HIV+ youth&#xD;
      identified as of highest-risk for violence and schedule sessions, phone calls, and assist&#xD;
      with HIV care linkage. In Step 5, the investigators will conduct follow-up assessments&#xD;
      (months 21, 27 &amp; 33; n=75 per assessment point) at HBC events to continue to monitor trends&#xD;
      in violence, HIV stigma, substance use, mental health, sexual risk and HIV care engagement.&#xD;
      Qualitative interviews will be conducted with VI, OW and HIV+ intervention clients to explore&#xD;
      the processes and strategies of intervention implementation, with a focus on implementation&#xD;
      barriers and facilitators. Finally, in Step 6, the investigators will conduct data analysis,&#xD;
      disseminate findings and produce scientific publications.&#xD;

    <description>The Trauma History Questionnaire measures history of exposure to potentially traumatic events with 18 yes/no items addressing the occurrence of traumatic events in three categories: crime, general trauma, and sexual and physical assault experiences. We will adapt this measure for participants to identify if event occurred within HBC or within neighborhood.</description>
