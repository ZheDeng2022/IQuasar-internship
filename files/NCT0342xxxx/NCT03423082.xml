  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      18F Fluciclovine is a recently FDA- approved radiopharmaceutical for prostate cancer&#xD;
      biochemical recurrence, which is only minimally eliminated by the kidneys and therefore the&#xD;
      image interpretation is not affected by nonspecific urine activity in the ureters and&#xD;
      bladder, which is advantageous for pelvic imaging. Recent literature suggests that&#xD;
      Fluciclovine PET has diagnostic potential for a variety of solid tumors, thus, allowing new&#xD;
      opportunities for noninvasive probing of glutamine metabolism and clinical use in patient&#xD;
      management. Current literature indicates that amino acid transporters including that of&#xD;
      glutamine are upregulated in endometrial and cervical cancer so that Fluciclovine PET may&#xD;
      have clinical potentials. The hypothesis is that Fluciclovine PET provides better imaging&#xD;
      properties and greater diagnostic confidence and accuracy than FDG PET does in pelvic&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the lack of current clinical data, a pilot study providing a direct comparison of&#xD;
      Fluciclovine PET with FDG PET is warranted. The investigators seek to conduct a pilot study&#xD;
      with 10 subjects to evaluate the clinical utility of Fluciclovine PET for staging of cervical&#xD;
      cancer and endometrial cancer. This research will compare the diagnostic performance of the&#xD;
      research Fluciclovine PET/MRI with the standard-of-care FDG PET/CT as an exploratory&#xD;
      endpoint.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endometrial cancer arises from the inner lining of the uterus and is one of the most common&#xD;
      malignancies in women, representing 3.6% of all new cancer cases in the US. It is estimated&#xD;
      that there are more than 60,000 new cases of endometrial cancer and more than 10,000 people&#xD;
      will die of this malignancy in 2016. It is most frequently diagnosed among women aged 55-64.&#xD;
      Cervical cancer starts in the cervix, the lower part of the uterus. Its prevalence is lower&#xD;
      compared with endometrial cancer thank to effective screening and early disease detection&#xD;
      with the Pap smear. In 2016, it is estimated that there will be more than 12,000 new cases of&#xD;
      cervical cancer and more than 4,000 patients will die of this disease in the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) combined with Computed Tomography (CT) is an essential&#xD;
      part of the workup for many malignancies. F-18 FDG PET/CT is currently the standard-of-care&#xD;
      (SOC) PET/CT modality for staging and restaging of pelvic malignancies in women. But there&#xD;
      are certain diagnostic limitations related to F-18 FDG because it is mainly eliminated by the&#xD;
      kidneys and often interferes with the detection of cancer lesions, particularly in the&#xD;
      abdominal and pelvic regions. On the other hand, the recently FDA approved F-18 Fluciclovine&#xD;
      is only minimally eliminated by the kidneys and therefore the image interpretation is not&#xD;
      affected by nonspecific urine activity in the ureters and bladder, which is advantageous for&#xD;
      pelvic imaging. Recent literature suggests that Fluciclovine PET has diagnostic potential for&#xD;
      a variety of solid tumors, thus, allowing new opportunities for noninvasive probing of&#xD;
      glutamine metabolism and clinical use in patient management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current literature indicates that amino acid transporters including that of glutamine are&#xD;
      upregulated in endometrial and cervical cancer so that Fluciclovine PET may have clinical&#xD;
      potentials. The hypothesis is that Fluciclovine PET provides better imaging properties and&#xD;
      greater diagnostic confidence and accuracy than FDG PET does in pelvic malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the lack of current clinical data, a pilot study providing a direct comparison of&#xD;
      Fluciclovine PET with FDG PET is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators seek to conduct a pilot study to evaluate the clinical utility of&#xD;
      Fluciclovine PET for staging of cervical cancer and endometrial cancer. This research will&#xD;
      focus on pelvic imaging comparing the diagnostic performance of the research Fluciclovine&#xD;
      PET/MRI with SOC FDG PET/CT as an exploratory endpoint. Dynamic PET imaging on a hybrid&#xD;
      PET/MR scanner will provide valuable pharmacokinetic information that can be used to identify&#xD;
      the optimal time window for the detection and characterization of the primary tumor and&#xD;
      pelvic nodal disease. Additional abdominal imaging will allow for further correlation with&#xD;
      FDG PET/CT in terms of nodal disease and distant metastasis detection. As previously&#xD;
      demonstrated in prostate cancer, the Fluciclovine uptake can be heterogeneous which may have&#xD;
      diagnostic and prognostic implications. Therefore, this pilot study will provide valuable&#xD;
      information on potential Fluciclovine heterogeneity in cervical and uterine cancer. Textural&#xD;
      heterogeneity of the primary will be compared between Fluciclovine and FDG PET. The initial&#xD;
      experience gained with this pilot study will provide valuable insights into the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and textural heterogeneity of Fluciclovine PET in cervical and uterine&#xD;
      cancers, and presents the first data on the potential strengths and weaknesses of&#xD;
      Fluciclovine PET/MR compared with FDG PET/CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The investigators hypothesize that Fluciclovine PET is non-inferior to FDG PET regarding&#xD;
           detection of the primary tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. It is hypothesized that nodal disease staging is more accurate with Fluciclovine than&#xD;
           with FDG PET because of the low level of nonspecific urinary bladder and ureter&#xD;
           activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. It is hypothesized that the dynamic uptake pattern of the primary lesion correlates with&#xD;
           the tumor grading on histopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. It is hypothesized that textural heterogeneity is different between Fluciclovine and FDG&#xD;
           PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the pharmacokinetics of Fluciclovine PET in women with cervical and uterine&#xD;
           cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize physiologic uptake pattern of the uterus and ovaries when these are not&#xD;
           affected by tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify the optimal time window for the quantitative analysis of Fluciclovine&#xD;
           primary and pelvic nodal disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate the time-activity curve pattern of the primary lesion with histopathologic&#xD;
           tumor grading&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare diagnostic performance of Fluciclovine PET and FDG PET&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare textural heterogeneity of the primary between Fluciclovine PET and FDG PET&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial experience gained with this pilot study will provide valuable insights into the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, lesion detectability and textural heterogeneity of Fluciclovine PET in&#xD;
      cervical cancer and uterine cancer. The study provides preliminary data on the potential&#xD;
      strengths and weaknesses of Fluciclovine PET/MR compared with the SOC FDG PET/CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluciclovine PET may provide a significant improvement in the TNM staging compared with FDG&#xD;
      PET as it is not affected by nonspecific urine activity in the ureters and bladder, which is&#xD;
      a common diagnostic problem for FDG PET. By combining the excellent soft-tissue contrast of&#xD;
      MRI with Fluciclovine PET, the hybrid PET/MR scanning could be a convenient and effective&#xD;
      one-stop imaging procedure providing both pelvic TNM staging and whole-body M staging.&#xD;
      Moreover, valuable prognostic information may be derived from Fluciclovine PET&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and heterogeneity assessment as well as multi-parametric PET/MR evaluation.&#xD;
