  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct an interventional, one year, randomized, double&#xD;
      blind, placebo-controlled trial with Liraglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes (diabetes&#xD;
      duration of &gt;6 months and &lt;10 years, HbA1c &lt;10%) to evaluate its effects on the peripheral&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system, as well as inflammatory markers, and measures of oxidative and&#xD;
      nitrosative stress.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to examine the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonist Liraglutide on&#xD;
      autonomic sudomotor function and endothelial and neurovascular functions as well as markers&#xD;
      of inflammation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The primary objective will&#xD;
      be changes in peripheral autonomic function using sudorimetry (Sudoscan) after 1 year of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives include changes on markers of inflammation and oxidative/nitrosative&#xD;
      stress including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), Interleukin 6 (IL6),&#xD;
      interleukin 12 (IL12), interleukin 10 (IL10), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF α), plasminogen&#xD;
      activator Inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), superoxide dismutase (SOD), nitrotyrosine,&#xD;
      carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and asymmetric&#xD;
      dimethylarginine (ADMA). Additional objectives include changes in neurovascular and&#xD;
      endothelial function, measured by continuous Laser Doppler assessment of skin blood flow in&#xD;
      response to different stimuli; and changes in sensory-motor peripheral nerve function,&#xD;
      measured by clinical neuropathy scores (NSS &amp; NIS), quantitative sensory testing and nerve&#xD;
      conduction testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to capture patients early in the disease process, when autonomic&#xD;
      dysfunction is still potentially reversible. Several studies have shown the presence of&#xD;
      autonomic imbalance in the early stages of diabetes and even in the pre-diabetic state&#xD;
      (impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, and metabolic syndrome). We&#xD;
      hypothesize that by treating type 2 diabetic patients with Liraglutide early in the disease&#xD;
      process (&lt;10 years of diagnosis), we will be able to improve peripheral autonomic imbalance,&#xD;
      endothelial and neurovascular function, and reduce inflammation and oxidative/nitrosative&#xD;
      stress. This will shed further insight into the mechanisms by which glucagon-like peptide-1&#xD;
      (GLP-1) exerts a neuroprotective role and improves the inflammatory process. The possibility&#xD;
      of improving autonomic imbalance, endothelial function and inflammation may have important&#xD;
      impact in the development of new potential therapeutic strategies to abrogate the&#xD;
      microvascular complications of diabetes&#xD;
