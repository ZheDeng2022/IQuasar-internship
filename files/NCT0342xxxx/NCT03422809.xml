  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to examine the influence of the menstrual cycle on&#xD;
      micronutrient concentrations and plasma volume in healthy, reproductive-age women with&#xD;
      regular cycles. The investigators aim to quantify changes in micronutrient biomarker&#xD;
      concentrations (zinc, copper, iron, and vitamin A) and plasma volume across the menstrual&#xD;
      cycle in healthy women.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal prospective study wherein all subjects will be examined at three time&#xD;
      points within a single menstrual cycle: the early follicular phase (~day 2), periovulation&#xD;
      (~day 12), and the luteal phase (~day 21)-based on an approximate 28-day cycle length. The&#xD;
      actual days of visits will be adjusted for the length of the woman's menstrual cycle. At&#xD;
      least 35 non-pregnant women ages 18 to 44 years will be recruited as a convenience sample of&#xD;
      eligible women in the State College area and surrounding towns within Centre County,&#xD;
      Pennsylvania, USA. If a woman responds to the recruitment, she will be asked a set of&#xD;
      pre-screening questions to determine eligibility. If a woman is thought to be eligible, she&#xD;
      will complete a verbal consent for the screening (and the actual screening will occur at the&#xD;
      first visit). Then she will be invited to the Clinical Research Center (CRC), a service unit&#xD;
      in Penn State's Clinical and Translational Science Institute, for full screening and&#xD;
      participation. Before scheduling the visit, the woman will be asked for the expected date of&#xD;
      the first day of her next menstrual period. The woman will then be tentatively scheduled for&#xD;
      her first visit at the CRC approximately 1 day after this date (avoiding weekend days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the preparation for study visits, the woman will be asked to fast the night before&#xD;
      her visit. Women will also be asked to avoid alcohol intake for 12 hours preceding their&#xD;
      scheduled visits to the CRC, and to drink plenty of water. On the morning of the visit, the&#xD;
      woman will arrive at the CRC, go through complete screening (including height, weight, blood&#xD;
      pressure, and pregnancy test). If eligible for the main study, the woman will then go through&#xD;
      the consent process for the main study. If the woman gives consent to participate, the&#xD;
      investigators will then proceed with study measurements (including a questionnaire and body&#xD;
      composition measurement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following these measurements, the study nurse or doctor will insert an IV into the vein of&#xD;
      one arm and an initial baseline blood draw will be taken (~15-20 ml, in several tubes). This&#xD;
      blood will be used for biomarker assessment (hemoglobin, hematocrit, vitamins, minerals, etc)&#xD;
      and as a blank sample before the dye injection. Next, indocyanine green (ICG) will be used to&#xD;
      measure plasma volume. A solution will be prepared using 25 mg of ICG lyophilized powder&#xD;
      dissolved in 10 ml of sterile water. The investigators will draw enough solution to inject&#xD;
      0.25 mg/kg body weight into a syringe. The syringe will be weighed to measure the exact&#xD;
      amount. Then the solution will be injected via the IV and flushed with saline. After 2&#xD;
      minutes, five ~3 ml blood samples will be drawn at intervals of 45 seconds over the next 3&#xD;
      minutes. Expected total volume of blood drawn at the visit will be &lt;35 mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of this first visit the participant will be given a home-based fertility monitor&#xD;
      to take home to track her cycle. She will be instructed on how to use the monitor at home but&#xD;
      the research team will maintain contact with her on a regular basis to ensure that she is&#xD;
      using the monitor correctly. She will conduct a daily urine test with the monitor, which uses&#xD;
      urine hormone concentrations to track the stage of the menstrual cycle for the participants&#xD;
      by displaying low, high, or peak fertility. The second and third visits will be scheduled&#xD;
      using an algorithm that takes into consideration the woman's menstrual cycle length and&#xD;
      results from a home-based urine fertility monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the third visit, the participant will return the monitor to the CRC and the urine test&#xD;
      results, which are stored in the monitor, will be retrieved. At the end of the third visit&#xD;
      her study participation is complete but the investigators will keep in contact with her to&#xD;
      record the first date of her next cycle (to calculate actual cycle length).&#xD;
