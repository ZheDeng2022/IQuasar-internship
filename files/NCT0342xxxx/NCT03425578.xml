  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amino acids play an important role in human metabolism. In aging individuals and in some&#xD;
      diseases, certain amino acids, such as glutamate, are at lower than normal levels. Glutamate&#xD;
      appears to be involved in providing energy and maintaining normal blood sugar (glucose)&#xD;
      levels, processes which both depend heavily on skeletal muscle. The maintenance of healthy&#xD;
      blood sugar levels, in particular, is tightly related to overall muscle mass and quality. To&#xD;
      better understand the link between glutamate and glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle, the&#xD;
      investigators will be using a nutritional approach to raise the body's glutamate levels with&#xD;
      monosodium glutamate (MSG) supplementation, and raise blood glucose levels with a sugary&#xD;
      drink. By altering the normal levels of glutamate and glucose in the blood and muscle tissue,&#xD;
      the investigators can gather more information about the role of glutamate in energy&#xD;
      metabolism. This will help the design of future studies investigating the function of&#xD;
      glutamate in aging and disease. During this study the investigators will increase the levels&#xD;
      of glutamate and glucose in the bloodstream by asking participants to ingest MSG along with a&#xD;
      sugary drink. The goal is to subsequently determine: A) the amount of glutamate and glucose&#xD;
      that ends up in the muscle; and B) whether normal skeletal muscle glucose metabolism, and the&#xD;
      behaviour of additional amino acids (other than glutamate) is altered. The hypothesis is that&#xD;
      when MSG and sugar drink are ingested together glucose uptake and metabolism within the&#xD;
      skeletal muscle will be elevated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glutamate is involved in several aspects of glucose metabolism in both muscle and liver,&#xD;
      however its role has not been fully defined. It is the primary amino acid taken up by resting&#xD;
      and exercising skeletal muscle, where it interacts with pyruvate (derived from glycolysis) to&#xD;
      produce the TCA cycle intermediate 2-oxoglutarate and the gluconeogenic precursor alanine.&#xD;
      Glutamate is also required for the production of glutamine, another gluconeogenic precursor,&#xD;
      via intramuscular reactions with ammonia. Given that skeletal muscle is responsible for 85%&#xD;
      of whole body glucose disposal, investigating the interplay between glutamate, its related&#xD;
      amino acids, and glucose homeostasis is of particular relevance. However, despite its many&#xD;
      links to energy provision, the role of glutamate in skeletal muscle glucose metabolism&#xD;
      remains poorly understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have manipulated circulating concentrations of both glutamate and glucose in&#xD;
      humans, and none have evaluated the effect of this unique manipulation in skeletal muscle&#xD;
      tissue. In healthy young adults, a dose of roughly 10 g monosodium glutamate (MSG)&#xD;
      transiently elevates plasma (700-800%) and intramuscular (30%) glutamate concentrations.&#xD;
      Acute MSG supplementation also stimulates modest increases in plasma concentrations of&#xD;
      aspartate, alanine, and glutamine (which are produced from glutamate within the muscle and&#xD;
      subsequently released into circulation). Intriguingly, insulin is secreted in response to MSG&#xD;
      supplementation, an effect that appears to be mediated by glutamate binding to an excitatory&#xD;
      amino acid receptor on the pancreas. In addition to its action on the pancreas, there is some&#xD;
      evidence to suggest that glutamate may function as a secondary messenger by enhancing&#xD;
      glucose-stimulated insulin secretion during periods of increased carbohydrate (CHO)&#xD;
      availability. However this secondary effect of glutamate on insulin is poorly understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability of glutamate to independently stimulate insulin secretion provides further&#xD;
      support for an association between glutamate and glucose metabolism, yet only two studies to&#xD;
      date have administered MSG during an oral glucose challenge to directly examine this&#xD;
      relationship. One study observed no effect of MSG on glucose tolerance, however peak plasma&#xD;
      glutamate was dramatically blunted in this study compared to previous reports (~ 80 vs.&#xD;
      400-500 ÂµM), likely due to glutamate being retained in the gut as a result of co-ingestion&#xD;
      with CHO. In a separate study, the authors developed a methodological approach to circumvent&#xD;
      this issue: by staggering the administration of MSG and CHO by 30 min, plasma glutamate and&#xD;
      glucose were both significantly and simultaneously elevated. Furthermore, MSG administration&#xD;
      improved glucose tolerance. In support of these findings, improvements in glucose clearance&#xD;
      following a high-fat meal combined with MSG has also been reported. Interestingly, not all&#xD;
      studies have observed enhanced insulin secretion with higher glutamate availability. This&#xD;
      suggests that the ability of carbohydrate to stimulate insulin secretion may overpower any&#xD;
      effect of glutamate on this hormone, but the specific mechanisms remain to be fully&#xD;
      elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, investigators have developed a cell culture model to show that glutamate stimulates&#xD;
      glucose uptake in rat L6 myotubes in the absence of insulin. This suggests that glutamate is&#xD;
      capable of acting directly on skeletal muscle, and supports previous findings of improved&#xD;
      glucose tolerance with acute MSG supplementation despite no further increase in insulin&#xD;
      secretion. Additionally, cell data demonstrates that glutamate-stimulated glucose uptake&#xD;
      results from increased glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation to the sarcolemma, via the&#xD;
      activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase&#xD;
      (MAPK). It is possible that these mechanisms underpin glutamate-mediated improvements in&#xD;
      glucose tolerance in humans. However, this - as well as the fate of glucose upon being taken&#xD;
      up by the muscle cell - has yet to be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a high degree of interplay between glutamate and glucose metabolism, but it remains&#xD;
      unclear whether elevated plasma concentrations of glutamate and glucose influence one&#xD;
      another's uptake into human skeletal muscle, as well as their subsequent respective&#xD;
      intramuscular metabolic reactions. Therefore, the overarching goal of this study is to&#xD;
      uncover the effects of acute MSG+CHO supplementation on plasma and intramuscular amino acid&#xD;
      concentrations, as well as aspects of skeletal muscle glucose metabolism, in healthy young&#xD;
      men in comparison to the ingestion of MSG and CHO alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will stagger the administration of MSG and CHO by 30 min to achieve&#xD;
      simultaneous peak circulating concentrations of glutamate and glucose. Under these&#xD;
      conditions, the aim is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quantify and compare changes in circulating glutamate and intramuscular glutamate&#xD;
           following MSG+CHO versus MSG alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the acute effects of MSG+CHO on the intramuscular free amino acid pool&#xD;
           (specifically aspartate, alanine, and glutamine) compared with MSG adminstration alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Confirm the findings of our previous study (7) which demonstrated that MSG+CHO&#xD;
           attenuates the rise in plasma glucose (but does not affect insulin or C-peptide&#xD;
           concentrations) compared with CHO alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine if MSG+CHO is associated with a greater or lesser degree of signaling through&#xD;
           the AMPK/p38 MAPK and/or insulin pathway in skeletal muscle compared to MSG and CHO&#xD;
           alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Explore whether aspects of skeletal muscle glucose uptake, storage, and/or utilization&#xD;
           are altered during MSG+CHO, relative to CHO alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that when glutamate and glucose are simultaneously available in&#xD;
      peak concentrations in circulation they will observe:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Lower circulating and intramuscular glutamate concentrations following MSG+CHO versus&#xD;
           MSG alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Similar intramuscular concentrations of aspartate, alanine, and glutamine in response to&#xD;
           MSG+CHO and MSG alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A blunted increase in plasma glucose (but no difference in insulin or C-peptide&#xD;
           concentrations) following MSG+CHO compared with CHO alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Elevated expression and activation of proteins related to both AMPK/p38 MAPK and insulin&#xD;
           signaling following MSG+CHO. However, AMPK/p38 MAPK signaling will be greatest following&#xD;
           MSG alone, with negligible activation of the insulin signaling pathway. Conversely,&#xD;
           insulin signaling will be greatest following CHO alone, with negligible signaling&#xD;
           through AMPK/p38 MAPK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enhanced skeletal muscle glucose uptake (i.e. increased GLUT4 translocation to the plasma&#xD;
      membrane) and utilization (i.e. increased rates of glycolysis and flux through the TCA&#xD;
      cycle), compared to the administration of CHO alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible young men who have consented to participate will visit the laboratory on 4 occasions&#xD;
      each separated by a washout period of approximately 1 week. Following a series of baseline&#xD;
      assessments to evaluate body composition, fitness etc.(Visit 1), participants will complete 3&#xD;
      trials (Visits 2, 3 and 4) in a randomized order. For each of the 3 trials, participants will&#xD;
      arrive by car or via public transportation at the laboratory after an 8-12 hour overnight&#xD;
      fast (no food or drink except for water after midnight the night before). A catheter will be&#xD;
      inserted into an antecubital vein and a fasting blood sample will be drawn (~8 mL).&#xD;
      Participants will then consume either 150 mg/kg body mass MSG or a placebo within 5 min.&#xD;
      Blood (~8 mL) will be drawn at the following time points: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 75, 90,&#xD;
      105, and 120 min. Immediately following the 30 min blood draw, participants will consume a 75&#xD;
      g carbohydrate (dextrose) beverage or a second placebo. After the last blood sample is&#xD;
      obtained the catheter will be removed. The total amount of blood drawn during each trial will&#xD;
      be ~88 mL.&#xD;
