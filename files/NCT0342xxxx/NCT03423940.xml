      Background: Functional communication training (FCT) is a commonly used intervention for&#xD;
      teaching appropriate communication skills to children with intellectual disabilities who&#xD;
      exhibit severe destructive behavior. Resurgence as Choice (RaC) Theory, a quantitative model&#xD;
      of behavior, may help to explain why treatment relapse often occurs after FCT. This project&#xD;
      will use the predictions of RaC to improve FCT treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To test the predictions made by RaC with human subjects who exhibit severe&#xD;
      destructive behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility: Children between the ages of 3 and 18 who display destructive behavior that is&#xD;
      maintained by social consequences, who have IQ and adaptive behavior scores between 35 and&#xD;
      70, who are on a stable psychoactive drug regimen (or drug free) for at least 10 half-lives&#xD;
      of each medication with no anticipated changes, and who have a stable educational plan and&#xD;
      placement will be be eligible to enroll.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with intellectual disabilities often display severe destructive behaviors that pose&#xD;
      significant risk to self or others and represent barriers to community integration. These&#xD;
      destructive behaviors are often treated with behavioral interventions derived from a&#xD;
      functional analysis (FA), which is used to identify the environmental antecedents and&#xD;
      consequences that occasion and reinforce (i.e., reward) the target response. One such&#xD;
      treatment is called differential reinforcement of alternative behavior (DRA), which involves&#xD;
      extinction (i.e., removal of rewards) of destructive behavior and reinforcement of an&#xD;
      alternative communication response with the consequence that previously reinforced&#xD;
      destructive behavior. Results from review studies indicate that interventions based on an FA,&#xD;
      like DRA, typically reduce problem behavior by 90% or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One commonly used DRA intervention is functional communication training (FCT). During FCT,&#xD;
      clinicians withhold reinforcement for destructive behavior and teach the individual a&#xD;
      functional communication response to access reinforcement. For instance, a clinician may&#xD;
      teach the child to exchange communication cards to express their wants and needs. However,&#xD;
      DRA interventions reported in the literature have typically been evaluated by experts in&#xD;
      controlled research settings, and treatment relapse often occurs in the natural environment&#xD;
      when a caregiver is unable reinforce the DRA response every time that the response occurs due&#xD;
      to competing responsibilities. Accordingly, a recent investigation of 25 applications of DRA&#xD;
      found that relapse of problem behavior occurred in 76% of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resurgence as Choice Theory helps to explain why treatment relapse occurs under these&#xD;
      circumstances and also provides mathematical equations that can be used to predict the&#xD;
      variables that increase and decrease the likelihood that treatment relapse will occur. In&#xD;
      this project, the investigators have used these equations to identify refinements to DRA that&#xD;
      are likely to decrease the probability that treatment relapse will occur when the DRA&#xD;
      response is not reinforced. In some cases, these refinements are at odds with what is&#xD;
      recommended in the clinical literature on DRA. Therefore, it is important to compare these&#xD;
      refinements that are derived from Resurgence as Choice Theory with current clinical practice&#xD;
      in order to determine the best way to implement DRA, so that treatment remains effective when&#xD;
      it is implemented with less than perfect precision by caregivers in the natural environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two predictions that are most relevant to our project are (a) resurgence of destructive&#xD;
      behavior will decrease with increased DRA treatment duration, and (b) reinforcement schedule&#xD;
      thinning show included slow, small decreases in reward deliveries (smaller than those&#xD;
      previously reported in the literature). Accordingly, our project will examine the effects of&#xD;
      different durations of DRA on resurgence and the effects of adjusting the schedule of&#xD;
      reinforcement for each session to include slow and small decreases to avoid resurgence.&#xD;
      Findings from this project could have vast clinical implications in that the investigators&#xD;
      will demonstrate that time in treatment affects relapse and that schedule thinning can be&#xD;
      accomplished without recurrence of destructive behavior. The investigators will compare&#xD;
      short, moderate, and extended durations of treatment with DRA to identify the optimal&#xD;
      duration of treatment to reduce the extent of relapse of destructive behavior. The&#xD;
      investigators will demonstrate that the degree of relapse may depend on the length of&#xD;
      treatment with DRA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use measurements of destructive behavior, appropriate behavior, and&#xD;
      reinforcer deliveries during each treatment session to inform the number of reinforcers that&#xD;
      will be available during upcoming treatment sessions, informed by both the Resurgence as&#xD;
      Choice (RaC) Theory and on the results of a coordinated study with nonhuman animals. The&#xD;
      investigators will demonstrate that this schedule thinning progression is efficacious at&#xD;
      maintaining an 85% reduction in problem behavior (i.e., relative to baseline) during each&#xD;
      treatment session.&#xD;

    <description>The goal of intervention for arm 1 is to examine the optimal duration of treatment with functional communication training (FCT). Investigators will treat each subject's behavior using FCT in three distinct contexts which will be associated with either short, moderate, or extended treatment durations. The investigators will counterbalance the order of treatment durations (short, moderate, and extended) across subjects, but each subject will receive treatment at each duration. Resurgence will be tested following each treatment duration.</description>

    <description>The goal of the intervention for arm 2 is to develop the optimal progression for reinforcement schedule thinning during functional communication training. The investigators will use measurements of destructive behavior, appropriate behavior, and reinforcer deliveries during each treatment session to inform the frequency of reinforcers that will be available during upcoming treatment sessions. The investigators will develop the schedule thinning progression by plugging these measurements into the quantitative model to describe the proper steps to schedule thinning to decrease the probability of a relapse of destructive behavior. The investigators will compare these results to those in the extant literature.</description>

    <description>During functional communication training (FCT), the social consequence (e.g., attention, toys, breaks from instructions) that heretofore reinforced destructive behavior (i.e., as determined through a functional analysis) is delivered contingent on an appropriate communication response, while destructive behavior is on extinction (i.e., reinforcers are no longer provided). For example, if a functional analysis shows that aggression is reinforced by escape from demands, FCT would typically involve (a) teaching the child to access breaks from demands via a functional communication response (FCR; e.g., saying, &quot;Break, please&quot;) and (b) placing destructive behavior on extinction (i.e., continuing with scheduled demands independent of destructive behavior).</description>

    <description>We will use the quantitative predictions of Resurgence as Choice (RaC) Theory to tailor a set of reinforcement-schedule thinning steps for each subject. This quantitative prediction will allow for dynamic decisions regarding how to conduct upcoming treatment sessions, as based on both the subject's recent response to treatment and the RaC equation.</description>
