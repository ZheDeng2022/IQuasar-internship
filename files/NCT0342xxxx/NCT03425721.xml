      This study will determine if HA dermal filler late occurring (&gt; 4 weeks and &lt;2 years) nodules&#xD;
      are associated with bacterial contamination (independent of filler type) and to characterize&#xD;
      the histological response.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have only received HA fillers (no limitation on the brand(s)/product(s) of HA filler&#xD;
             used; multiple product use is allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Present with an unresolved nodule (inflammatory or non-inflammatory) which was first&#xD;
             observed &gt; 4 weeks and &gt; 2 years after most recent HA filler treatment and is&#xD;
             determined to be greater than 3 millimeters (mm) in diameter by palpation&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received non-HA fillers (e.g. polyacrylamide, calcium hydroxyapatite,&#xD;
             poly-L-lactic acid, polymethylmethacrylate, silicone, expanded&#xD;
             polytetrafluoroethylene, collagen) including mixes with HA fillers anywhere in the&#xD;
             face.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are currently enrolled in a dermal filler clinical trial or previously enrolled in a&#xD;
             dermal filler clinical trial with randomized treatment in which the type of dermal&#xD;
             filler is unknown (i.e. non-HA filler arm of study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have history of keloid or hypertrophic scarring&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received intralesional intervention for the nodule (e.g. hyaluronidase,&#xD;
             corticosteroids, antibiotics, 5-fluorouracil).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are pregnant&#xD;
