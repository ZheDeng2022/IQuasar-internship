  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use disorders (AUD) and social anxiety disorder (SAD) are highly comorbid and&#xD;
      associated with significant impairment. Social anxiety comorbidity is associated with poorer&#xD;
      addiction treatment engagement and outcomes. Thus, addressing underlying SAD symptoms that&#xD;
      may lead to and maintain alcohol problems, as well as undermine successful treatment for AUD,&#xD;
      is warranted. This proposal aims to develop and evaluate a fully integrated outpatient&#xD;
      program for comorbid SAD and AUD that weaves evidence-based treatment for SAD (i.e.,&#xD;
      exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy) into a traditional, evidence-based treatment for&#xD;
      AUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, the investigators will develop the protocol for the fully integrated treatment (FIT).&#xD;
      The overarching goal of FIT will be to simultaneously deliver AUD and SAD treatment.&#xD;
      Development will be an iterative process guided by previous research (including our own), and&#xD;
      by input from clinicians, administrators, and patients in an outpatient substance use&#xD;
      disorder treatment clinic. After the protocol is developed, the investigators will use their&#xD;
      established clinician training procedures to train clinicians at their community partnered&#xD;
      clinic to competently deliver the intervention. After protocol development and clinician&#xD;
      training, the investigators will conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing&#xD;
      the efficacy of our fully integrated treatment (FIT) for comorbid alcohol use and social&#xD;
      anxiety disorders to usual care (UC) in the community substance use disorder specialty&#xD;
      clinic. The goals of the RCT will be to gather data regarding acceptability, feasibility, and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of the FIT protocol. The investigators will randomize treatment-seeking&#xD;
      participants (N = 60) who have comorbid SAD and AUD. The investigators will assess treatment&#xD;
      engagement, social anxiety outcomes, and alcohol use outcomes at baseline, 3-months, and&#xD;
      6-months from baseline. The investigators will also gather qualitative and quantitative&#xD;
      acceptability data from patients after completing FIT, which may guide final refinements of&#xD;
      FIT prior to testing in a larger-scale grant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The knowledge gained from this investigation has the potential to significantly improve the&#xD;
      treatment of alcohol use disorders and make a significant public health impact. The focus on&#xD;
      direct translation to community practice paradigms and the emphasis on full mental health and&#xD;
      addiction treatment integration significantly advance the field.&#xD;

      In this study, potential participants will be screened either by University of California,&#xD;
      Los Angeles (UCLA) staff or at the Matrix Institute on Addiction to determine whether they&#xD;
      may have social anxiety and alcohol use disorder symptoms. If they screen positive for these&#xD;
      symptoms, they will be invited to come in for a comprehensive baseline assessment consisting&#xD;
      of interviews, questionnaires, and a behavioral assessment. Eligible participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either receive standard Matrix treatment consisting of a 9-hour per week&#xD;
      Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) lasting approximate 2-3 months; or FIT, an Intensive&#xD;
      Outpatient Program (also 9 hours per week for approximately 2-3 months) consisting of&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for social anxiety disorder that is woven into the alcohol&#xD;
      recovery program. After treatment, participants will complete another assessment, and then&#xD;
      will complete one several months later.&#xD;

    <description>The Timeline Followback (TLFB), a gold standard semi-structured interview measure of alcohol consumption, will be used in order to obtain number of drinking days</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline Social Anxiety Symptoms in Situations at 3 and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Leibowitz Social Anxiety Scale-Self Report (LSAS-SR) will be used to assess the extent to which individuals are anxious in, and avoid, a variety of social situations, including performance based and social-interactional situations. Anxiety and avoidance are each rated from 1 (none/never) to 4 (extreme/always) Higher scores indicate greater severity of social anxiety.</description>
