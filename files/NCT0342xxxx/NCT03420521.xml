  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm open-label design study looking at Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab in patients&#xD;
      with Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors. Patients will be dosed Nivoluma 240mg IV over 60 minutes&#xD;
      every 2 weeks and Ipilimumab 1mg/kg IV over 30 minutes every 6 weeks. Once cycle will include&#xD;
      3 doses of Nivolumab and 1 dose of Ipilimumab. The objective of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      objective response rate of combination nivolumab and ipilimumab in advanced,&#xD;
      well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors. Durability of response, and PFS will also be&#xD;
      described.&#xD;
