    <textblock>
      Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of agonist treatment for opioid dependence and&#xD;
      alarming recent increases in overdose deaths, waiting lists for treatment persist. In a&#xD;
      Behavioral &amp; Integrative Treatment Development pilot study, the investigators demonstrated&#xD;
      the initial efficacy a novel Interim Buprenorphine Treatment (IBT) to mitigate the risks&#xD;
      (e.g., illicit opioid use, IV drug use) associated with treatment delays. However, consistent&#xD;
      with that R34 mechanism, our initial pilot study involved a limited sample size and was&#xD;
      conducted at a single academic, well-controlled research clinic with an extensive history of&#xD;
      research. It is important to replicate these very positive pilot results and begin to&#xD;
      evaluate whether they generalize to less-controlled rural environments that are being so&#xD;
      adversely impacted by the current opioid abuse epidemic. In this Stage II randomized parallel&#xD;
      two-group trial, the investigators will evaluate the efficacy of IBT using a larger sample of&#xD;
      100 waitlisted opioid-dependent adults (50 IBT, 50 WLC). UVM will serve as the coordinating&#xD;
      center and we will aim to partner with health centers and other convenience sites in rural&#xD;
      Vermont counties to conduct study visits while overcoming barriers commonly encountered in&#xD;
      rural areas (e.g., transportation issues, socioeconomic barriers). The proposed research&#xD;
      builds directly on the promising Stage I results and has the potential to substantially&#xD;
      reduce the vast individual and societal costs associated with opioid treatment delays.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of agonist treatment for opioid dependence and&#xD;
      alarming recent increases in overdose deaths, waiting lists for treatment persist.&#xD;
      Opioid-dependent individuals can remain on waitlists for months, during which they are at&#xD;
      substantial risk for illicit drug use, criminal activity, infectious disease, overdose and&#xD;
      premature death. One effort to reduce these risks has been to extend interim methadone&#xD;
      treatment (IMT; i.e., daily methadone without counseling) to individuals awaiting entry into&#xD;
      a methadone program. IMT significantly reduces illicit opioid use and criminality during&#xD;
      treatment delays. However, it is limited to licensed specialty clinics, requires daily&#xD;
      visits, prohibits take-home doses and cannot exceed a 120-day duration. These regulatory&#xD;
      restrictions have constrained the widespread use of IMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a Behavioral &amp; Integrative Treatment Development R34, the investigators have developed a&#xD;
      novel Interim Buprenorphine Treatment (IBT) to mitigate the risks associated with treatment&#xD;
      delays while surmounting the limitations noted above for methadone. It includes key&#xD;
      components to permit delivery of potentially life-saving pharmacotherapy while minimizing&#xD;
      nonadherence: (a) Buprenorphine (BUP) offers a regulatory and safety profile that is uniquely&#xD;
      compatible with interim dosing. Participants receive BUP maintenance with bi-monthly clinic&#xD;
      visits and the remaining doses dispensed at home via a secure computerized portable device&#xD;
      (Med-O-Wheel, Addoz, Finland). Participants also receive (b) nightly calls from an automated&#xD;
      Interactive Voice Response (IVR) phone system to assess any drug use, withdrawal and craving,&#xD;
      (c) IVR-generated random call-backs for urinalysis and pill counts, and (d) HIV+Hepatitis&#xD;
      education delivered via iPad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our Stage I pilot data strongly support the initial efficacy of this intervention. Among 50&#xD;
      waitlisted opioid-dependent adults randomized to IBT (n=25) or Waitlist Control (WLC; n=25)&#xD;
      conditions for 12 weeks, 85%, 84% and 68% of IBT participants are abstinent at 4, 8 and&#xD;
      12-week assessments vs. 0%, 0% and 0% of WLC participants (p&lt;.001). IBT participants also&#xD;
      reported significantly greater reductions in illicit opioid use and IV drug use frequency and&#xD;
      completing 96% of daily IVR calls and random call-backs. These outcomes represented a&#xD;
      substantial first step towards the development of an intervention that can reduce individual&#xD;
      and societal risks during delays to conventional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, consistent with the R34 mechanism, our initial pilot study involved a limited sample&#xD;
      size and was conducted at a single academic, well-controlled research clinic with an&#xD;
      extensive history of research and a brief treatment duration. It is important to replicate&#xD;
      these very positive pilot results and begin to evaluate whether they generalize to&#xD;
      less-controlled rural environments that are being so adversely impacted by the current opioid&#xD;
      abuse epidemic as well as over longer treatment durations. Important to underscore is that&#xD;
      our IBT components (i.e., Med-O-Wheel, IVR, HIV+Hepatitis application) are highly&#xD;
      transportable, which increases the potential of extending them to sites outside of the&#xD;
      university setting while retaining efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim: In this Stage II randomized parallel two-group trial, the investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of IBT using a larger sample of 100 waitlisted opioid-dependent adults&#xD;
      (50 IBT, 50 WLC). UVM will serve as the coordinating center and we will aim to partner with&#xD;
      health centers and other convenience sites in rural Vermont counties to conduct study visits&#xD;
      while overcoming barriers commonly encountered in rural areas (e.g., transportation issues,&#xD;
      socioeconomic barriers). Participants randomized to IBT will receive the intervention&#xD;
      described above for a duration of 24-weeks; WLC participants will remain on the waitlist for&#xD;
      their treatment of choice but complete monthly assessments. It is hypothesized that IBT&#xD;
      participants will achieve significantly greater illicit opioid abstinence relative to WLC&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research builds directly on the promising Stage I results and has the potential&#xD;
      to substantially reduce the vast individual and societal costs associated with opioid&#xD;
      treatment delays. By facilitating the eradication of waitlists, this project represents a&#xD;
      significant departure from the status quo and stands to produce a fundamental shift in how&#xD;
      treatment for opioid dependence is conceptualized and delivered.&#xD;
