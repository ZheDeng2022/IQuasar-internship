      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the United States, each year there are more than 30,000 cases of human papillomavirus&#xD;
      (HPV) associated cancers. Some of these cancers are often incurable and are not improved by&#xD;
      standard therapies. Researchers want to see if a new drug M7824, which targets and blocks a&#xD;
      pathway that prevents the immune system from effectively fighting the cancer can shrink&#xD;
      tumors in people with some HPV cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if the drug M7824 causes tumors to shrink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults age 18 and older who have a cancer associated with HPV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They will review their&#xD;
      symptoms and how they perform normal activities. They will have body scans. They will give&#xD;
      blood and urine samples. They will have a sample of their tumor tissue taken if one is not&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an electrocardiogram to evaluate their heart. Then they will get the&#xD;
      study drug through a thin tube in an arm vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get the drug every 2 weeks for 26 times (1 year). This is 1 course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the course, participants will be monitored but will not take the study drug. If their&#xD;
      condition gets worse, they will start another course with the drug. This process can be&#xD;
      repeated as many times as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will stop if the participant has bad side effects or the drug stops working.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study, participants will repeat some or all the screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After participants stop taking the drug, they will have a follow-up visit and repeat some&#xD;
      screening tests. They will get periodic follow-up phone calls.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metastatic or refractory/recurrent HPV associated malignancies (cervical, anal,&#xD;
           oropharyngeal cancers etc.) are often incurable and poorly palliated by standard&#xD;
           therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  TGF R1 pathway signaling and overexpression are significantly associated with HPV+&#xD;
                cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  PD-1 inhibitors have produced a 12-20% response rate for these diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  M7824 is a novel bifunctional fusion protein composed of monoclonal antibodies&#xD;
                against human PD- L1 and soluble extracellular domain of human TGF- receptor II&#xD;
                (TGF- RII), which functions as a TGF- &quot;trap.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Early data from a small cohort of patients with HPV associated malignancies in a&#xD;
                phase I trial of M7824 has shown promising activity (NCT02517398). As of May 30,&#xD;
                2017, 4 of 9 patients (44%) with HPV associated malignancies have had preliminary&#xD;
                evidence of clinical benefit including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient with metastatic cervical cancer with a 25% reduction in her disease at 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient with metastatic P16+ head and neck cancer with an unconfirmed partial response&#xD;
           (PR) at 6 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient with metastatic anal cancer with a durable PR ongoing 9 months after starting&#xD;
           treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient with metastatic cervical cancer with a durable complete response (CR) ongoing 15&#xD;
           months after starting treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Notably, the P16+ head and neck cancer patient with unconfirmed PR, anal cancer patient&#xD;
           with durable PR and cervical cancer patient with durable CR all have HPV+ disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Immune related adverse events with M7824 in the phase I trial to date have been on&#xD;
                par with other PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, suggesting a manageable safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  EMD Serono has an ongoing expansion cohort evaluating M7824 in patients with HNSCC&#xD;
                as well as in cervical cancer excluding neuroendocrine cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the objective response rate (ORR) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria&#xD;
      in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) in subjects with recurrent or metastatic HPV associated&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects with cytologically or histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
           HPV&#xD;
&#xD;
      associated malignancies including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-Neuroendocrine Cervical cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  P16+ Oropharyngeal cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anal cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vulvar, vaginal, penile, squamous cell rectal and neuroendocrine cervical cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors (e.g. lung, esophagus) that are known&#xD;
           HPV+&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subjects must have measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -This is a Phase II trial of M7824 in patients with recurrent or metastatic HPV associated&#xD;
&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients will be scheduled to receive 1,200 mg of M7824 IV every 2 weeks until off treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -There will be six cohorts: (1) Patients with anal cancer whose disease is na&quot;ve to&#xD;
      checkpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
      inhibition, (2) Patients with non-neuroendocrine cervical cancer na&quot;ve to checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibition,&#xD;
&#xD;
      (3) Patients with P16+ oropharyngeal cancers na&quot;ve to checkpoint inhibition, and (4) Patients&#xD;
      with other rare HPV associated tumors (e.g. squamous cell rectal, vulvar, vaginal, penile&#xD;
      cancer, neuroendocrine cervical) na&quot;ve to checkpoint inhibition, (5) Patients with any HPV&#xD;
      associated cancers whose disease is refractory to checkpoint inhibition. Patients who are&#xD;
      determined to be HPV negative after enrolling will be taken off of their previously assigned&#xD;
      cohort and reassigned to cohort 6 and their slot on their previously assigned cohort will be&#xD;
      replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Cohorts 1-5 of the trial will be conducted using a Simon two-stage phase II trial design.&#xD;

&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Pregnant women are excluded from this study because this drug has not been tested in&#xD;
        pregnant women and there is potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because&#xD;
        there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
&#xD;
        treatment of the mother with M7824, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is&#xD;
        treated with M7824.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior investigational drug, chemotherapy, immunotherapy or any prior&#xD;
             radiotherapy (except for palliative bone directed therapy) within the past 28 days&#xD;
             prior to the first drug administration except if the investigator has assessed that&#xD;
             all residual treatment-related toxicities have resolved or are minimal and feel the&#xD;
             patient is otherwise suitable for enrollment. Patients may continue adjuvant hormonal&#xD;
             therapy in the setting of a definitively treated cancer (e.g. breast).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery within 28 days prior to the first drug administration (minimally&#xD;
             invasive procedures such as diagnostic biopsies are permitted).&#xD;
&#xD;

             inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known active brain or central nervous system metastasis (less than 1 month out from&#xD;
             definitive radiotherapy or surgery), seizures requiring anticonvulsant treatment (&lt;3&#xD;
             months) or clinically significant cerebrovascular accident (&lt;3 months). In order to be&#xD;
             eligible patients must have repeat CNS imaging at least two months after definitive&#xD;
             treatment showing stable CNS disease. Patients with evidence of intratumoral or&#xD;
             peritumoral hemorrhage on baseline imaging are also excluded unless the hemorrhage is&#xD;
             grade less than or equal to 1 and has been shown to be stable on two consecutive&#xD;
             imaging scans.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Subjects requiring hormone replacement with corticosteroids are eligible if the&#xD;
                  steroids are administered only for the purpose of hormonal replacement and at&#xD;
                  doses less than or equal to 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent per day;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Administration of steroids for other conditions through a route known to result&#xD;
                  in a minimal systemic exposure (topical, intranasal, intro-ocular, or inhalation)&#xD;
                  is acceptable;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects on systemic intravenous or oral corticosteroid therapy with the&#xD;
                  exception of physiologic doses of corticosteroids (less than or equal to the&#xD;
                  equivalent of prednisone 10 mg/day) or other immunosuppressives such as&#xD;
                  azathioprine or cyclosporin A are excluded on the basis of potential immune&#xD;
                  suppression. For these subjects these excluded treatments must be discontinued at&#xD;
                  least 1 weeks prior to enrollment for recent short course use (less than or equal&#xD;
                  to 14 days) or discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment for long term&#xD;
                  use (&gt;14 days). In addition, the use of corticosteroids as premedication for&#xD;
                  contrastenhanced studies is allowed prior to enrollment and on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of serious intercurrent chronic or acute illness, such as&#xD;
             cardiac or pulmonary disease, hepatic disease, bleeding diathesis or recent (within 3&#xD;
             months) clinically significant bleeding events, or other illness considered by the&#xD;
             Investigator as high risk for investigational drug treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of non-HPV associated second malignancy within 3 years of enrollment except&#xD;
             localized malignancy which has been adequately treated or malignancy which does not&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with vulvar cancer originating from differentiated vulvar intraepithelial&#xD;
             neoplasia (d-VIN), as opposed to vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia of usual type, are&#xD;
             excluded. Vulvar squamous cell carcinoma originating from differentiated VIN (d-VIN)&#xD;
             is HPV negative; however, rare cases of HPV positive d-VIN can occur. Patients are not&#xD;
             excluded if their tumor has tested positive for HPV or there is no documentation of&#xD;
             prior VIN type.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known HPV negative malignancies based on comprehensive laboratory&#xD;
             testing (e.g. PCR based assay evaluating for HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 51, 52, 56,&#xD;
             58, 59, 66, 68). Patients with HPV associated malignancies and unknown HPV status&#xD;
