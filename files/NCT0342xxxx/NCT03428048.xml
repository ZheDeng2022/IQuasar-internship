  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Information gathered from the patients via a disease specific questionnaire will be married&#xD;
      to data from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR®). Details will be continuously&#xD;
      analyzed and used to direct quality of care at our center. The institution is categorized as&#xD;
      a low-volume institution for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for coronary artery&#xD;
      disease treatment as well as surgical and endocardial ablation for the management of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation (Afib). The association between operator volume and quality has primarily&#xD;
      focused on rare complications, such as mortality. The aim is to highlight the advantages of&#xD;
      receiving care close to home. A benefit of offering the procedures to treat diseases at&#xD;
      centers that have lower volumes is to improve patients' outcomes while also providing more&#xD;
      convenient access to quality care. The key outcome from the patients' experience is&#xD;
      alleviation of their symptoms while increasing function and quality of life. To date, there&#xD;
      have been no studies documenting the health status benefits of PCI and surgical / endocardial&#xD;
      ablation for coronary artery disease and Afib, respectively with low- volume operators. In&#xD;
      this study, the investigators sought to examine the feasibility of implementing&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes into clinical care and to demonstrate evidence of benefits, from&#xD;
      patients' perspectives, of receiving treatment by low-volume operators.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort, time series analysis of the routine procedures associated with&#xD;
      the catheterization and the electrophysiology lab through ten years post intervention. The&#xD;
      goal is to demonstrate clinical effectiveness with cardiac service line with low-volume&#xD;
      operators. A connection between NCDR with applied clinical research that directs continuous&#xD;
      quality improvement goals and objectives is the ideal setting for value-based, quality care.&#xD;
      The system of diagnosing, treating and tracking individuals with cardiovascular and pacing&#xD;
      disease has many facets which could benefit from continuous quality improvement and outcomes&#xD;
      analysis. The proposed Valley View NEXUS outcomes registry will bridge national data to local&#xD;
      clinical data. Clinical registries are a methodically sound instrument for measuring and&#xD;
      improving performance. Registries are efficacious for surveillance, measuring effectiveness&#xD;
      of quality improvement initiatives, identifying determinates of quality of life and function&#xD;
      while synergistically increasing the value of health care expenditures with respect to heart&#xD;
      disease, stroke, and arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ADVARRA formerly Schulman Institutional Review Board (IRB) reviewed our protocol, and&#xD;
      authorized the study. Once informed consent was obtained, eligible adults scheduled for&#xD;
      diagnostic angiography with possible PCI completed a baseline patient reported outcome&#xD;
      assessment and again at designated follow-up intervals (six months and annually thereafter&#xD;
      for up to ten years). Due to the urgent nature of STEMI- PCI procedures, it was determined&#xD;
      that informed consent prior to PCI was prohibitive; however after consideration, the protocol&#xD;
      was amended to capture baseline assessments immediately following PCI while the patient 's&#xD;
      status was in hospital with use of the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) and the Veterans&#xD;
      Rand 12-Item Health Survey (VR-12). The SAQ is recognized as a disease specific questionnaire&#xD;
      for coronary artery disease. The SAQ is a six item questionnaire that assesses patient's&#xD;
      function, symptoms, and satisfaction. A higher score translates to better outcomes. The VR-12&#xD;
      is a twelve item questionnaire used to assess quality of life. A lower score translates to a&#xD;
      higher quality of life in relation to a person's health and wellness. Combining data from a&#xD;
      disease specific questionnaire, quality of life assessment, and the NCDR's CathPCI® Registry&#xD;
      serves as a nexus between big data and the individual patient experience. From January 2015&#xD;
      through December 2017, twenty- two patients have been enrolled. Based on the data from the&#xD;
      first six patients to provide scores both at baseline and month six and with a study design&#xD;
      to have 90% power to detect a change in the overall SAQ score of 10 points at six months, it&#xD;
      was determined 49 patients will need to be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aforementioned methodology will be applied for surgical and endocardial ablations for&#xD;
      patients' with Afib. Presently, enrollment is open for Afib patients and data being captured&#xD;
      will be analyzed to determine sample size. Patients who receive intervention for management&#xD;
      Afib will complete the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality -of-life (AFEQT) Questionnaire&#xD;
      and the VR-12. Again the VR-12 is a twelve item questionnaire used to assess quality of life.&#xD;
      A lower score translates to a higher quality of life in relation to a person's health and&#xD;
      wellness. The AFEQT is recognized as a disease specific questionnaire for Afib. A higher&#xD;
      score translates to worse symptoms and limitations in daily function associated with Afib.&#xD;
      Combining the outcomes metric with NCDR's Afib Ablation Registry ® allows our institution&#xD;
      demonstrative effective outcomes for low-volume operators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data validation process applies to both PCI and surgical and/or endocardial ablation and&#xD;
      is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quality Assurance Plan Training for staff that populates both data registries is&#xD;
           ongoing. Staff will participate in the NCDR® applicable training modules. Documentation&#xD;
           of training will be maintained in the study coordinator's office. Agreeing to&#xD;
           participate with the NCDR®, an institution also agrees to random site monitoring and/or&#xD;
           audits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data Checks All patients who agree to participate in NEXUS outcomes registry and&#xD;
           subsequent statistical analysis will experience a complete date audit for both outcomes&#xD;
           assessments and NCDR® data elements. NCDR® has algorithm limits for both CathPCI®&#xD;
           Registry and Afib Ablation ® Registry. All registry elements require abstraction form&#xD;
           Meditech source documents. Reports are titled Cardiology Procedure Note and&#xD;
           Electrophysiology Procedure Note for PCI and Afib ablation, respectively.&#xD;
           Quality/outcome metrics will be sampled in paper form -the sources documents.&#xD;
           Information will then be populated into excel for scoring. All paper forms will be&#xD;
           maintained for the life of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data Dictionary Complete Data Dictionaries are provided by NCDR® with data element&#xD;
           numbers and associated limits and acceptable values for both Cath PCI ® and Afib&#xD;
           Ablation ® Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Standard Operating Procedures A complete NEXUS Registry Protocol will be on site held in&#xD;
           the Cardiovascular Innovation &amp; Research Institute at Valley View Hospital along with&#xD;
           all regulatory information, lab certifications, training documents, IRB documents,&#xD;
           license agreements, analytic agreements and process maps for informed consent for&#xD;
           outcomes research. Note NCDR® registries obtained a waiver for informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Sample Size Assessment The number of patients necessary to demonstrate an effect for&#xD;
           outcomes after PCI with low-volume operators is 49.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Presently, outcomes after surgical and/or endocardial ablation are being piloted to&#xD;
           determine sample size for a study powered at 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Missing Data Every attempt will be made to reach patients to ensure they are not lost to&#xD;
           follow-up. Statistical consult recommends last observation carried forward for missing&#xD;
           data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Statistical Analysis Plan. For the primary analysis, the 6-month change in mean SAQ will&#xD;
           be tested using a 1-sample upper 1-sided t-test. With 49 completers the t-test will have&#xD;
           90.4% power to detect an improvement in mean SAQ score of 10 points. A linear regression&#xD;
           model will be used for the secondary analysis to investigate factors which are&#xD;
           associated with the 6-month change (month 6 - baseline) in mean SAQ score. Factors which&#xD;
           will be investigated for inclusion in the model include sex, age, physician American&#xD;
           Society Anesthesiologists (ASA) class, physician volume, access site, and Charlson&#xD;
           comorbidity index. An all-possible regressions approach will be used during the model&#xD;
           building process in which all possible regression models are fit. The models will then&#xD;
           be evaluated using Mallows' Cp statistic where models with values of Cp less than p (the&#xD;
           number of parameters) will be considered as strong candidates for the final model. The&#xD;
           final model will be selected after considering both results from the model selection&#xD;
           process and subject matter knowledge. The regression analysis will have greater power&#xD;
           than the t-test used in the sample size justification due to the reduction in&#xD;
           variability of the outcome measure by including additional factors in a regression&#xD;
           model. Additional analyses include [need to add specifics here]. All analyses will be&#xD;
           conducted using SAS 9.4M4 or greater software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morbidity / Complications will be reported included but not limited to bleeding at access&#xD;
      site, hematoma, cardiac tamponade, vascular perforation, peripheral vascular injuries, post&#xD;
      procedure hematoma, and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Plan with Respect to Surgical and/ or Endocardial Ablation for Afib&#xD;
&#xD;
      This outcomes registry is in its early pilot analysis for Afib and hypothesis generating. For&#xD;
      the primary analysis, the six-month change in mean AFEQT scores will be analyzed.&#xD;
