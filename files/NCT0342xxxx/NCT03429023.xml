      This is an observational chart review of all patients with confirmed and probable diagnosis&#xD;
      of mucormycosis at 19 centers across Indian hospital. Data will collect using a standardized&#xD;
      CRF. All collected data will be entered into a database prior to analysis. Broadly data will&#xD;
      be collected on demography, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, treatment and outcome for&#xD;
      each patient. Patient will continue to receive treatment as per treating physicians advise.&#xD;
      Primary outcome for this study will be overall survival at 45 &amp; 90 days.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mucormycosis is a life threatening angio-invasive fungal infection generally occurring in&#xD;
      immunocompromised individuals. In recent years the incidence has increased globally and&#xD;
      alarmingly in India especially in patients with uncontrolled diabetes. Mucormycosis is&#xD;
      associated with very high morbidity and mortality. Mortality can be reduced with increased&#xD;
      awareness of the disease, and aggressive medical and surgical intervention. Though few case&#xD;
      series of mucormycosis are published from India, multiple gaps in knowledge exist regarding&#xD;
      epidemiology, diagnosis and management of the disease in this country. It is therefore&#xD;
      proposed to conduct this multicentric observational study in India to evaluate epidemiology,&#xD;
      mode of diagnosis, management practices and outcome in patients with mucormycosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To describe the epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment practices and outcome of mucormycosis in&#xD;
      India&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sites involved in mucormycosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Underlying disease and risk factors for mucormycosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spectrum of agents causing mucormycosis √ê mode of diagnosis of mucormycosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Observation chart review Study Sites: We have assembled a network of health center&#xD;
      across India called Mucormycosis Study Network (MSN), which consists of 19 centers across the&#xD;
      country. Listed in Appendix 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: We propose to conduct a single arm prospective observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working definition of Proven &amp; Probable mucormycosis used for this study. Proven case:&#xD;
      Presence of fungus in the tissue detected by direct microscopy (KOH, Calcoflor white) and&#xD;
      Histopathological examination or from any aspiration /tissue from sterile site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probable case: Clinical features of infection in organ-site with presence of mucorale in&#xD;
      tissue from non-sterile infected site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post enrollment, all patients will receive treatment as per the discretion of treating&#xD;
      physicians or local hospital protocol. Data on patients' clinical features, risk factors,&#xD;
      laboratory and radiological findings will be collected on standardize case report forms&#xD;
      (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the extent of disease will be evaluated with appropriate radiological&#xD;
      evaluation CT scan/ MRI (Brain, PNS, Thorax, abdomen etc.) Attempt will be made to collect&#xD;
      follow up data till 6 months after diagnosis unless the patient lost in follow up or died&#xD;
      before six months. All culture isolates will be sent to Mycology Reference Laboratory at&#xD;
      PGIMER, Chandigarh for final identification and drug susceptibility testing. Blocks of&#xD;
      histopathological specimen will be sent at reference mycology laboratory for patients with&#xD;
      histopathological diagnosis of mucormycosis for DNA extraction and species identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Overall survival at 45 &amp; 90 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cure: defined as complete resolution of clinical, radiological and mycological evidence&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Improved: Resolution of clinical features, radiological regression&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Grade III and IV toxicities of antifungal agents (Refer Appendix 2 for definition)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Data will collect using a standardized CRF. All collected data will be&#xD;
      entered into a database prior to analysis. Broadly data will be collected on demography,&#xD;
      clinical characteristics, diagnosis, treatment and outcome for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient characteristics: Demographics, Comorbidities (Diabetes, Solid organ Transplant, GVHD&#xD;
      requiring steroids, Febrile neutropenia, prolong neutropenia + Steroid therapy, Voriconazole&#xD;
      exposure, Immunocompetent patient, Nosocomial [Surgical site, wooden spatula, ECG lead etc],&#xD;
      history of road traffic accidents, tsunami, hurricane, Patients receiving immunosuppressives&#xD;
      for collagen diseases, Use of monoclonal antibodies for treatment of variety of medical&#xD;
      conditions, Iron overload and desferioxamine therapy, Burns patients), Organ dysfunction,&#xD;
      Bacterial super infections&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease characteristics: Site of disease (pulmonary, PNS, Brain, skin and soft tissue, GI,&#xD;
      Renal etc), number of lesions, species of mucormycosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. . Time to start antifungal drug after (a). Onset of disease i.e. first symptom (b).&#xD;
           Diagnosis of mucormycosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. . Dose and duration of antifungal agent&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. . Time to Surgical Treatment after (a). Onset of disease i.e. first symptom (b).&#xD;
           Diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. . Type of Surgical treatment: Radical surgery, Debridement, Repeated debridement&#xD;
           Adjuvant treatment used e.g. Deferasirox, posaconazole&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. . Posaconazole maintenance after completion of ABDC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall survival (OS): OS will be measured 2 ways: from onset of first symptoms as reported&#xD;
      by patient and from day of admission to last follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mortality Related to mucormycosis, not related to Mucormycosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Regimen:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will not interfere with management at any stage. Treating physician will determine&#xD;
      all process of patient management including diagnosis and treatment. Information on&#xD;
      antifungal agent used, dosage used and duration of treatment will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on surgical treatment will be collected i.e. time to surgical treatment after&#xD;
      diagnosis, debridement, numbers and frequency of debridement, extensive surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control of diabetes, reversal of metabolic parameters, management of immunosuppression will&#xD;
      be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up data will also be collected similarly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed during hospitalization for drug compliance and toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Event will be noted and graded according to standard grading system. Prior and&#xD;
      Concomitant Therapy The details of any prior, concomitant or follow up therapy like&#xD;
      deferasirox or Posaconazole will also be noted&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Plan Patient, disease and treatment characteristics will be summarized using&#xD;
      descriptive statistics. Differences in the primary outcome of survival according to patient,&#xD;
      disease and treatment characteristics will be assessed using a log-rank test and illustrated&#xD;
      using the Kaplan-Meir analysis. Differences in OS will be summarized as hazard ratio along&#xD;
      with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Differences in mortality and toxicities according to&#xD;
      patient, disease and treatment characteristics will summarized as risk ratio along with 95%&#xD;
      CI. All significance testing will be two sided and set at 5%.&#xD;
