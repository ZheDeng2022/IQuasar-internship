    <textblock>
      This study will test an investigational drug called AZD1390 in combination with radiation&#xD;
      therapy for the treatment of brain tumors. This is the first time AZD1390 is being given to&#xD;
      patients. This study will test safety, tolerability and PK (how the drug is absorbed,&#xD;
      distributed and eliminated) of ascending doses of AZD1390 in combination with distinct&#xD;
      regimens of radiation therapy&#xD;
    </textblock>

      This first time-in patients (FTIP), open-label, multicentre study of AZD1390 will be&#xD;
      conducted in the United States and in the United Kingdom, and it consists of three treatment&#xD;
      arms: Arm A, B, C. This Phase 1 study will assess safety and tolerability of AZD1390 in&#xD;
      combination with radiation therapy (RT) in brain malignancies. The combination cohorts have&#xD;
      been designed to assess escalating cumulative doses of AZD1390 in settings with 3 different&#xD;
      radiation treatment regimens:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A: 35 Gy over 2 weeks with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in patients&#xD;
           with recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arms B: 30 Gy over two weeks with whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT)/ partial brain&#xD;
           radiation therapy (PBRT) in patients with brain metastases. **Arm B has now closed to&#xD;
           recruitment**&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm C: 60 Gy over 6 weeks (IMRT) in patients with primary GBM Each arm provides standard&#xD;
           of care RT for the disease setting indicated with the experimental agent being&#xD;
           administered in dose escalating cohorts.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>AZD1390 will be administered to patients in three different Arms (A, B and C), with each arm receiving standard of care radiation therapy (RT) for their disease setting.&#xD;
In arms A and C, AZD1390 will be administered in three cycles: Cycle 0 (before RT), Cycle 1 (during RT) and Cycle 2 (after RT).&#xD;
In arm B, AZD1390 will be administered in cycle 1 only (during RT). Within each arm, AZD1390 will be administered in dose escalating cohorts, first in an intermittent and then in a consecutive fashion, to achieve daily administration prior to RT.&#xD;
**Arm B has now closed to recruitment**&#xD;
For Arm A, there is an optional food effect assessment during cycle 0. *Note: the optional food effect assessment is currently not open to recruitment*</intervention_model_description>
