    <description>In order to measure experimental pain sensitivity, a multimodal Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) battery will be completed: heat pain threshold (HPTH); heat pain tolerance (HPTO), pressure pain threshold (PPT), punctate mechanical pain (PMP), and Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM).&#xD;
To assess HPTH, heat stimuli were delivered to the participant's arm or knee using a computer-controlled TSAII NeuroSensory Analyzer. From a baseline of 32 degrees Celsius, the temperature increased by 0.5 degrees Celsius per second until the participants responded by pressing a button to stop heat stimuli. Participants were instructed to press the button when the sensation ''first becomes painful&quot; to assess the heat pain threshold (HPTH). The temperature at which participants pressed the button to indicate the sensation ''first becomes painful&quot; is reported.</description>

    <description>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) involves the application of weak direct electric current to the head in a noninvasive and painless manner. tDCS with a constant current intensity of 2 mA will be applied for 20 minutes per session daily for 2 weeks (Monday to Friday) via the Soterix 1x1 tDCS mini-CT Stimulator device. Participants will self-administer tDCS at their home or a private room for two weeks (Mondays-Fridays) under real-time supervision by the research staff.</description>

Participants complete the SF-MPQ-2 by rating the extent to which they experienced each of 22 pain descriptors in the past week using an 11-point numeric rating scale (0 = &quot;none&quot; to 10 = &quot;worst possible&quot;). The continuous pain subscale assesses throbbing pain, cramping pain, gnawing pain, aching pain, heavy pain, and tender, and total score on the continuous pain subscale ranges from 0-60, with a higher score indicating worse pain.</description>

        <title>Clinical Pain Intensity as Assessed by Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2 (SF-MPQ-2) - Continuous Pain Subscale</title>
        <description>The SF-MPQ-2 measures the quality as well as the intensity of pain. Participants complete the SF-MPQ-2 by rating the extent to which they experienced each of 22 pain descriptors in the past week using an 11-point numeric rating scale (0 = &quot;none&quot; to 10 = &quot;worst possible&quot;). The continuous pain subscale assesses throbbing pain, cramping pain, gnawing pain, aching pain, heavy pain, and tender, and total score on the continuous pain subscale ranges from 0-60, with a higher score indicating worse pain.</description>

        <title>Clinical Pain Intensity as Assessed by Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2 (SF-MPQ-2) - Affective Description Subscale</title>
        <description>The SF-MPQ-2 measures the quality as well as the intensity of pain. Participants complete the SF-MPQ-2 by rating the extent to which they experienced each of 22 pain descriptors in the past week using an 11-point numeric rating scale (0 = &quot;none&quot; to 10 = &quot;worst possible&quot;). The affective description subscale assesses tiring-exhausting, sickening, fearful, and punishing-cruel, and total score on the affective description subscale ranges from 0-40, with a higher score indicating worse pain.</description>

To assess HPTH, heat stimuli were delivered to the participant's arm or knee using a computer-controlled TSAII NeuroSensory Analyzer. From a baseline of 32 degrees Celsius, the temperature increased by 0.5 degrees Celsius per second until the participants responded by pressing a button to stop heat stimuli. Participants were instructed to press the button when the sensation ''first becomes painful&quot; to assess the heat pain threshold (HPTH). The temperature at which participants pressed the button to indicate the sensation ''first becomes painful&quot; is reported.</description>
