  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A common complication of advanced liver disease is a condition called hepatic encephalopathy,&#xD;
      which leads to confusion. The current treatment options cause side effects, are costly, and&#xD;
      do not always work. An abnormal population of bacteria in the intestines may be causing this&#xD;
      condition, and transplanting bacteria from the colon of a healthy person may treat it. In&#xD;
      this research study, the investigators will first find two healthy stool donors whose stool&#xD;
      donation improves the gut bacteria of patients with advanced liver disease and helps them&#xD;
      think more clearly. Then, in a randomized controlled trial, the investigators will compare&#xD;
      the ability of stool donation from these two best donors versus a placebo to improve the&#xD;
      neurological function of patients with advanced liver disease. If the investigators find the&#xD;
      expected results, there will be a new effective therapy for patients with advanced liver&#xD;
      disease and the very troublesome complication of hepatic encephalopathy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Decades of investigation demonstrate that hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a common complication&#xD;
      of cirrhosis characterized by impaired cognition, develops as a consequence of intestinal&#xD;
      microbial products reaching the brain. Recent investigation has found that cirrhotic&#xD;
      patients, especially those who have developed HE, have intestinal dysbiosis compared to&#xD;
      normal controls. Several plausible mechanisms explain how intestinal dysbiosis could lead to&#xD;
      HE. There is limited prior literature on the efficacy of FMT in cirrhosis. The largest&#xD;
      documented study of 10 cirrhotic patients receiving a single FMT enema found no significant&#xD;
      change in microbiome diversity as assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that aggressive manipulation of the microbial composition with fecal microbiota&#xD;
      transplant (FMT) will improve neurological function in patients with a history of cirrhosis&#xD;
      and HE. The investigators additionally hypothesize that five oral FMT capsule administrations&#xD;
      from a previously efficacious stool donor will significantly change the intestinal microbiome&#xD;
      composition of a cirrhotic patient. The study will consist of a 10-patient open-label pilot&#xD;
      study to identify efficacious stool donors, defined as donors who precipitate the largest&#xD;
      improvement in recipient neurological function and microbiome composition. The two most&#xD;
      efficacious pilot study stool donors will be selected to donate stool for the randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT). The 20-patient RCT will investigate the effect of FMT on neurological&#xD;
      outcomes in patients with cirrhosis and a history of HE. Subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive 5 doses of oral FMT capsules or placebo capsules over 21 days. Cognitive testing and&#xD;
      stool collections will occur at 4 time points, to assess for changes in neurological function&#xD;
      and microbiome composition. The primary outcome is change in neurological function after FMT.&#xD;
      The main secondary outcome is change in microbiome composition after FMT. This study could&#xD;
      provide valuable information about the ability of FMT to improve intestinal dysbiosis in&#xD;
      cirrhosis and treat HE.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Before the first administration of FMT (day 0) and one week after the last administration of FMT (day 28)</time_frame>
    <description>The PHES is a validated assessment tool specifically designed for HE trials to test cognitive and psychomotor processing speed and visuomotor coordination. The PHES is a battery of 5 pencil-paper tests, completed in 15-20 minutes. The primary outcome is the change in PHES score from immediately before FMT to 1 week after the last dose of FMT.</description>

    <time_frame>Adverse event reporting will take place on day 2, 4, 7, 14, 21, then 1, 4 weeks after the last FMT administration.</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Before the first administration of FMT (day 0) and one week after the last administration of FMT (day 28)</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroop Test evaluates psychomotor speed and cognitive flexibility by the interference between recognition reaction time to a colored field and a written color name. A smartphone application software called &quot;EncephalApp Stroop Test&quot; will be used, validated to identify cognitive dysfunction in cirrhosis and screen for covert hepatic encephalopathy.</description>

    <time_frame>Before the first administration of FMT (day 0) and one week after the last administration of FMT (day 28)</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a highly utilized quality of life questionnaire. There are 8 health concepts assessed by the survey, which includes physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. Each of these health concepts is scored on a scale from 0 to 100. 0 is considered the worst outcome and 100 is considered the most favorable health state on each subscale. There will be no total or summed score.</description>
