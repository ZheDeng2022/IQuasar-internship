  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Addition of nitrous oxide N2O towards the end of prolonged isoflurane anesthesia hastens&#xD;
      patients recovery. The hypothesis is that the addition of N2O at the end of prolonged&#xD;
      sevoflurane anaesthesia also hastens early recovery without increasing the frequencies and&#xD;
      intensity of PONV and improves quality of recovery.&#xD;

      The investigators will include 100 adult patients, American Society of Anesthesiologists&#xD;
      (ASA) physical status I-III, who will be scheduled for elective laparotomies or laparoscopic&#xD;
      surgeries under sevoflurane anesthesia lasting 120 minutes or longer. After written informed&#xD;
      consent participants will be randomized into two groups: GO2 - air in 30% oxygen and GN2O -&#xD;
      the same mixture until the last 30 minutes of surgery when 70% N2O in 30% oxygen will be&#xD;
      used. General anesthesia will be performed with propofol and fentanyl for anesthesia&#xD;
      induction, rocuronium for muscle relaxation and volatile anesthetic sevoflurane for&#xD;
      maintenance. The participants will be extubated in the operation room (OR) after they open&#xD;
      their eyes and follow commands. Postanesthetic recovery score by Aldrete, Ramsay sedation&#xD;
      scale (RSS), and Simplified postoperative nausea and vomiting impact scale score by Myles&#xD;
      (PONV ISS) will be used to assess recovery in PACU and surgical ward. Modified Aldrete score&#xD;
      assigns a score of 0, 1, or 2 to activity, respiration, circulation, consciousness, and&#xD;
      color, giving a maximal score of 10 ( score of 9 indicates recovery sufficient for the&#xD;
      patient to be transferred from the PACU). RSS [score 1-6] consists of six levels of sedation&#xD;
      [Awake levels: 1, anxious and agitated or restless or both; 2, co-operative, orientated, and&#xD;
      tranquil; 3,responds to commands only. Asleep levels are dependent on the response to a light&#xD;
      glabellar tap or loud auditory stimulus: 4, a brisk response; 5, a sluggish response; 6, no&#xD;
      response]. PONV ISS is the sum of the numerical responses to questions Q1 and Q2 ( Q1: The&#xD;
      vomiting or dry-retching count? 0 - 2 or 3 (three or more times); Q2: Severity of nausea -&#xD;
      interference with activities of daily living: score 0-3 [0 - not at all, 1-sometimes, 2-&#xD;
      often or most of the time, 3 - all of the time] and score ≥5 defines clinically important&#xD;
      PONV. Quality of Recovery questionnaire (QoR-40) on the first, second and third postoperative&#xD;
      days will be used for assessment of postoperative quality of recovery.The QoR-40 consists of&#xD;
      five clinically relevant dimensions: (i) physical comfort (12 items), (ii) emotional state (9&#xD;
      items), (iii) physical independence (5 items), (iv) psychological support (7 items), and (v)&#xD;
      pain (7 items). Each item is rated on a five-point Likert scale. The QoR-40 score ranges from&#xD;
      40 (extremely poor quality of recovery) to 200 (excellent quality of recovery). A 100 mm&#xD;
      visual analogue scale (VAS) [0= no pain, 10= maximal pain] and the use of postoperative&#xD;
      analgesics (opioids/non-opioids: yes or no, quantity in milligrams) shall be used for pain&#xD;
      assessment during the first 24 postoperative hours.The sample size for early recovery time&#xD;
      (primary endpoint) is based on the results of our recent study. The sample size was&#xD;
      calculated on the assumption that 15 (SD 7) min would be needed for early recovery for the&#xD;
      GO2 patients and that the GN2O patients would require four minutes less time (11 [SD 5] min).&#xD;
      We would need 38 participants in each group for the primary outcome to have a power of 0.8&#xD;
      and an alpha level of 0.05.&#xD;
