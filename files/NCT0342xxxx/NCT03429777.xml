    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to validate a quick, easy-to-use and administer smartphone&#xD;
      hearing-in-noise test. The Hearing-in-Noise Test (HINT) measures an individual's ability to&#xD;
      hear speech in quiet and in noise. HINTs are traditionally done testing both ears together as&#xD;
      binaural hearing ability is key in noisy settings and everyday, functional hearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The app (called HearMe) can potentially be used to easily and quickly collect&#xD;
      hearing-in-noise and speech-in-noise measurements. The smartphone app developed is a&#xD;
      hearing-in-noise test that presents the subject with a series of stimuli consisting of a&#xD;
      spoken three-digit sequence presented at a varying hearing-to-noise ratio. For each stimulus&#xD;
      presentation, the user tap the three-digit sequence. The duration of the app is less than 3&#xD;
      minutes. For this project the investigators will test at least 50 subjects with hearing loss&#xD;
      and 50 control subjects between the ages of 18-80. The subjects will be invited to take the&#xD;
      app. The approach for this pilot study is to characterize hearing-in-noise thresholds (also&#xD;
      referred to as a speech-reception threshold) as measured by the app in both subject groups,&#xD;
      and relate it to the phenotype of each group as a preliminary evaluation of the app as well&#xD;
      as a preliminary validation against their routinely collected measurements of hearing&#xD;
      function (pure-tone audiometry thresholds).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will assess the validity of the test construct in measuring hearing-in-noise&#xD;
      thresholds, and serve as a foundation for further iterative designs of the app and future&#xD;
      validation and characterization studies. This study seeks to validate a developed smartphone&#xD;
      HINT on an initial cohort of patients and controls. It is anticipated that patients with&#xD;
      hearing loss will display higher signal-to-noise ratio thresholds (as measured by the iPhone&#xD;
      app) compared to controls.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related hearing loss, or presbycusis, is highly prevalent among the elderly. It can have&#xD;
      a major impact on the quality of life due to progressive communication difficulties that may&#xD;
      lead to psychosocial dysfunction and in extreme cases to social isolation and depression.&#xD;
      Hearing aids and cochlear implants have evolved rapidly over the past decades and may&#xD;
      strongly improve quality of life in elderly with hearing loss. Nevertheless, it is estimated&#xD;
      that in the US and Europe only one out of five to six people with substantial hearing loss is&#xD;
      actually using hearing aids. In fact, nearly 50% of people with hearing loss never underwent&#xD;
      a hearing test at all. This may be due to denial of illness associated with aging or to&#xD;
      disbelieve in bene t from hearing aids or cochlear implants. Hearing screening could increase&#xD;
      awareness of hearing loss among elderly and identify those who might bene t from&#xD;
      amplification. However, classical audiometry (i.e. pure- tone thresholds and&#xD;
      speech-recognition in quiet) is not ideal for screening purposes as it is time consuming and&#xD;
      it requires expensive equipment including a soundproof booth and a calibrated audiometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past decades, several Speech-In-Noise tests were developed to get a better&#xD;
      assessment of a person's hearing ability in real-life situations. These tests generally&#xD;
      measure the speech reception threshold (SRT) in dB signal to noise ratio (SNR). SRT is&#xD;
      determined as the difference between the level of presented speech and background noise at&#xD;
      which the tested per- son can correctly reproduce 50% of words or sentences. It is now&#xD;
      generally recognized that the SRT is more representative of a patient's hearing ability in&#xD;
      real-life situations than pure- tone audiometry or speech recognition in quiet. The Speech-&#xD;
      In-Noise test, based on spoken sentences, is still being used in clinical practice. However,&#xD;
      its general use for a broad clinical population has been disputed because not every person is&#xD;
      able to understand and repeat complete sentences in noise, regardless of his hearing loss.&#xD;
      This test is there- fore considered as an assessment of the entire auditory system, including&#xD;
      memory and certain linguistic aspects, rather than of hearing loss alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2013, the Digits-In-Noise (DIN) test was developed, overcoming several shortcomings of the&#xD;
      previous telephone test. It uses, for example, wideband signals instead of the limited&#xD;
      telephone bandwidth and concatenating digits, spoken by a male voice. The DIN test requires&#xD;
      listeners to repeat three spoken numbers (a so-called digit triplet) presented through a&#xD;
      headphone, while a continuous noise is presented synchronously to the same ear. The response&#xD;
      is then scored correct or incorrect automatically by the computer. Depending on the test&#xD;
      setting, the response can either be imputed by the listener him- self or by an administrator.&#xD;
      By using simple digits in a closed set paradigm, the contribution of top-down processing and&#xD;
      thus the influence of cognitive status is thought to be minimized. For this test, no learning&#xD;
      effect was detected, low measurement errors were reported (0.7 dB SNR for normal-hearing&#xD;
      listeners) and high validity was claimed by comparing measured digit- triplet SRTs and&#xD;
      sentence SRTs. Although SRT-in-noise reflects different aspects of hearing acuity than&#xD;
      pure-tone thresholds, both measures are also highly correlated. Previously reported&#xD;
      correlation coefficients vary from 0.77 to 0.86. These studies included populations with a&#xD;
      wide range of hearing losses, varying from severe to no hearing loss at all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this relationship, the DIN test could potentially be used as a screening instrument&#xD;
      for hearing loss. However, these two studies did not report specifically on a population of&#xD;
      elderly subjects, and this is one of the main target groups for hearing screening. It is&#xD;
      important to validate the assumed relationship between SRT-in-noise and hearing loss for this&#xD;
      particular population with a smartphone, as it may be influenced by general aging, for&#xD;
      example, a decline in cognitive skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is to validate a quick, easy-to-use and administer smartphone&#xD;
      hearing-in-noise test. The app (called HearMe) can potentially be used to easily and quickly&#xD;
      collect hearing-in-noise and speech-in-noise measurements. The smartphone app developed is a&#xD;
      hearing-in-noise test that presents the subject with a series of stimuli consisting of a&#xD;
      spoken three-digit sequence presented at a varying hearing-to-noise ratio. For each stimulus&#xD;
      presentation, the user tap the three-digit sequence. The duration of the app is less than 3&#xD;
      minutes. For this project we will test at least 50 participants with hearing loss and 50&#xD;
      control subjects between the ages of 18-80. The participants will be invited to take the app.&#xD;
      The approach for this pilot study is to characterize hearing-in-noise thresholds (also&#xD;
      referred to as a speech-reception threshold) as measured by the app in both participant&#xD;
      groups, and relate it to the phenotype of each group as a preliminary evaluation of the app&#xD;
      as well as a preliminary validation against their routinely collected measurements of hearing&#xD;
      function (pure-tone audiometry thresholds).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this study, the investigators aim to evaluate the developed smartphone HINT/DIN test for&#xD;
      its ability to screen the elderly for hearing loss. The investigators hope to examine the&#xD;
      relationship between pure-tone thresholds and SRT-in-noise as measured by the HearMe&#xD;
      smartphone application.&#xD;
