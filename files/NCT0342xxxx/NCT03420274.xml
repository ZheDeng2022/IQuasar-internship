      Noninvasive prenatal genetic testing (NIPT) is an important new screening test option&#xD;
      provided to pregnant women in the first trimester of pregnancy. The advantage of this screen&#xD;
      is that is provides information about the risk of trisomy 13, trisomy 18, and trisomy 21 with&#xD;
      greater accuracy than conventional screens. At the same time, NIPT can produce information&#xD;
      about the risk of a cohort of other fetal genetic variants, including sex chromosome&#xD;
      aneuploidies and microdeletion syndromes. While not yet clinically available for whole exome&#xD;
      sequencing, the potential for this next clinical application already exists. The challenge is&#xD;
      that, while this is an important new test, there are little data about how to best structure&#xD;
      patient-centered decisions about its use, including decisions if to use this screen and how&#xD;
      the information may directly inform subsequent prenatal care decisions. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to gain formative data about current practice patterns with respect to how NIPT is&#xD;
      discussed in the clinical visit and to use these data to help inform best practices for its&#xD;
      continued use in the clinical setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Noninvasive prenatal genetic testing (NIPT), also known as cell-free fetal DNA screening, has&#xD;
      dramatically altered the delivery of prenatal care. Prior to NIPT, fetal aneuploidy risk was&#xD;
      assessed using conventional screens, most commonly maternal serum screens (MSS, e.g. the&#xD;
      Quadruple screen). While MSS provided information about the risk of trisomy (T) 21, T13, and&#xD;
      T18, its use led to many false positive results which required amniocentesis or chorionic&#xD;
      villus sampling to clarify. The risk of iatrogenic miscarriage from these diagnostic&#xD;
      procedures is low, but the possibility of this consequence is a major driver in how&#xD;
      healthcare providers and patients think about prenatal genetic risk and assessment. NIPT has&#xD;
      significantly changed this long-standing paradigm. While not diagnostic, NIPT offers&#xD;
      increased accuracy with lower false positive and false negative rates than MSS when screening&#xD;
      for common autosomal aneuploidies. Unlike conventional screens, NIPT provides information&#xD;
      never before a part of routine screening, such as the presence of sex chromosome aneuploidies&#xD;
      (SCAs), microdeletions, and fetal sex. Already the capability exists to utilize NIPT in&#xD;
      conjunction with whole exome sequencing to detect an unlimited number of fetal genomic&#xD;
      variants, many with undetermined significance. The list of conditions that NIPT can screen&#xD;
      for is expanding rapidly and has outpaced the rate at which evidence-based strategies for its&#xD;
      integration can be developed and implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expectant parents must be prepared to make informed decisions about NIPT, including whether&#xD;
      to use it and how to address the prenatal care decisions that result from that choice. For&#xD;
      some, information from NIPT may inform the decision to undergo additional tests and either&#xD;
      prepare for the birth of a child with a serious, potentially life-threatening condition, or&#xD;
      end the pregnancy if a condition is confirmed by diagnostic testing. While this has been the&#xD;
      case for all forms of prenatal testing, NIPT presents unique challenges to this&#xD;
      decision-making process because it provides information about a series of conditions with&#xD;
      variable phenotypic severity of which patients have little familiarity (e.g., Turner&#xD;
      syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome), as well as providing information about markers of&#xD;
      undetermined significance. As with conventional screening, there is the potential for a false&#xD;
      positive or false negative result for each of these findings. Furthermore, information gained&#xD;
      from NIPT may have unintended consequences by identifying maternal or paternal factors that&#xD;
      may be unwanted or unexpected. Previous studies have demonstrated that expectant parents&#xD;
      already face a number of challenges in obtaining accurate, unbiased in-formation and&#xD;
      decisional support when navigating conventional prenatal genetic screens and diagnostic tests&#xD;
      (abbreviated as &quot;prenatal testing&quot; in the rest of this document) and the consequences of&#xD;
      being un-prepared for a positive test result. This situation has been exacerbated with the&#xD;
      introduction of NIPT and will worsen with its expansion. Initially, NIPT was indicated for a&#xD;
      subset of the obstetric population, namely women considered high-risk for aneuploidy due to&#xD;
      advanced maternal age or reproductive history. Now, NIPT is becoming available for use by the&#xD;
      general obstetric population as a primary screen. Clinicians will have to provide&#xD;
      individualized counseling to pregnant patients about the advantages and dis-advantages of&#xD;
      NIPT compared to other prenatal testing options. As part of this process, they will need to&#xD;
      assist patients in placing this information in the context of their goals, values, and&#xD;
      beliefs about parenthood, disability, and termination. The magnitude of the resulting&#xD;
      challenge becomes evident when considering that over four million women receive prenatal care&#xD;
      in the U.S. annually10 and there are not enough prenatal genetic counselors (GC) or&#xD;
      maternal-fetal medicine specialists (MFM) to meet this demand, particularly in rural and&#xD;
      urban settings that already face poorer obstetric outcomes due to barriers in access to&#xD;
      prenatal care. It is unclear how the medical profession will respond to this unprecedented&#xD;
      challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current situation places a heavy burden on primary obstetric (OB) providers to play a&#xD;
      greater role in introducing patients to the option of NIPT and to facilitate decision-making&#xD;
      about its use. Already, there are growing numbers of OB providers ordering NIPT, either with&#xD;
      or without the involvement of a GC or a MFM, a trend that is expected to continue with the&#xD;
      ongoing expansion of NIPT.39 Thus, an urgent clinical problem has emerged: there is a lack of&#xD;
      evidence-based tools to guide OB providers in effective and individualized education and&#xD;
      decision support for NIPT. To date, the focus of interventions has been on the development of&#xD;
      decision aids and other educational resources to independently educate patients and OB&#xD;
      providers about prenatal genetic assessment. These tools may impart information and provide a&#xD;
      degree of decision support; however, they do not address the dynamic interaction that leads&#xD;
      to the exchange of such information during the clinical visit. Data accrued from our recent&#xD;
      work indicate that these strategies do not provide sufficient support or guidance about how&#xD;
      to structure effective shared decision-making (SDM) discussions between the patient and OB&#xD;
      provider. Studies, including work from our cur-rent R21, demonstrate that important barriers&#xD;
      exist for patients seeking the information and support needed to navigate their prenatal&#xD;
      testing options and make informed, value-reflective decisions about NIPT. While many women&#xD;
      are familiar with common autosomal aneuploidies such as T21, they have little knowledge of&#xD;
      SCAs and significantly less knowledge of microdeletion syndromes. Patients are over-whelmed&#xD;
      by the prospect of learning enough about each of the different conditions that NIPT can&#xD;
      detect. As a result, women increasingly rely upon guidance from OB providers with whom they&#xD;
      have an established relationship to help determine which, if any, prenatal testing option to&#xD;
      utilize. These are important discussions that take place in the clinical encounter and which&#xD;
      educational modules and decision aids alone cannot sufficiently replace. Barriers also exist&#xD;
      for OB providers, who report uncertainty about how to provide personalized, effective, and&#xD;
      patient-centered counseling about NIPT, particularly under conditions of limited time,&#xD;
      reimbursement for counseling, and resources to meet the needs of a diverse population of&#xD;
      patients with varying degrees of health literacy and knowledge of genetic conditions, as well&#xD;
      as different beliefs about parenthood, disability, and pregnancy termination. Current&#xD;
      educational and counseling efforts used by OB providers may not be meeting the self-reported&#xD;
      educational needs and decision-making preferences of patients considering NIPT, particularly&#xD;
      those pertaining to personal values. Moreover, both patients and providers are concerned&#xD;
      about being negatively judged or stereo-typed in discussing topics related to pregnancy&#xD;
      termination and infant/child disability, particularly as NIPT increasingly identifies&#xD;
      conditions with a range of phenotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The delivery of high-quality, evidence-based prenatal care and access to NIPT will only occur&#xD;
      if patients have information and support to make informed, values-based choices about their&#xD;
      prenatal testing options. Given the relationship of informed decision-making with healthcare&#xD;
      quality, access, and outcomes, it is critical to have effective, evidence-based mechanisms&#xD;
      that are responsive to the needs and priorities of patients, the day-to-day challenges faced&#xD;
      by providers, and the current scientific evidence and clinical practice guidelines about&#xD;
      NIPT. While it is recognized that providers should involve patients in healthcare by means of&#xD;
      a SDM process, how to achieve that level of communication within the constraints and&#xD;
      challenges of the practice of obstetrics remains unknown. Thus, the goal of this study is to&#xD;
      conduct a cluster, randomized trial to test an evidence-based tool termed NEST (for NIPT&#xD;
      Education Sup-port Tool) to support patients' decision-making, focusing on the communication&#xD;
      that takes place in the clinical encounter. The investigators will also identify aspects of&#xD;
      the patient-provider interaction that are key to implementing effective strategies responsive&#xD;
      to the challenges posed by the continued development of NIPT. Our hypothesis is that, by&#xD;
      focusing on the dynamic interaction between the patient and provider, NEST will result in a&#xD;
      SDM process that, in turn, will both increase patients' ability to make an informed choice&#xD;
      about NIPT and decrease the decisional conflict associated with that choice. The expected&#xD;
      outcome of this study is a clinically relevant, point-of-care tool that can be utilized among&#xD;
      a diverse group of patients and providers to facilitate decisions that are informed,&#xD;
      consistent with the patient's values, and with which patients do not experience decisional&#xD;
      conflict.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit three groups: 1) pregnant women, 2) partners of pregnant&#xD;
      women, and 3) prenatal healthcare providers. Randomization will occur at the level of the&#xD;
      healthcare provider. Pregnant women will be randomized per their prenatal healthcare provider&#xD;
      to NEST (intervention) or usual care (control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that this study's findings will ultimately contribute to&#xD;
      improving the quality of prenatal care by empowering pregnant women to make informed choices&#xD;
      that reflect their needs and preferences as individuals and parents. The investigators also&#xD;
      anticipate that OB providers will feel more prepared and confident when approaching&#xD;
      conversations about NIPT.&#xD;
