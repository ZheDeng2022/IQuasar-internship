  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep, specifically deep sleep, plays a central role in healthy brain function,&#xD;
      cardio-vascular processes, mood and quality of life. Auditory stimulation during one night of&#xD;
      sleep has previously been shown to improve deep sleep and along with memory formation in both&#xD;
      young and older adults. Yet, it remains unclear whether long-term auditory stimulation&#xD;
      considerably improves sleep quality over longer time periods and how it affects daytime&#xD;
      functioning such as cognition, mood, quality of life and peripheral functions (e.g.&#xD;
      cardio-vascular). Due to the importance of deep sleep for brain and body and the presence of&#xD;
      many conditions that involve reduced deep sleep (e.g. ageing) assessing the beneficial impact&#xD;
      of long-term sleep enhancement and its consequences is of central interest.This study will&#xD;
      assess the effect of auditory stimulation over two weeks (interleaved with a two weeks&#xD;
      washout period) in a cohort of healthy young and older adults using portable recording and&#xD;
      stimulation devices.&#xD;

    <measure>Sleep quality</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline period to study completion, assessed up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Objective information about sleep macro- and microstructure will be assessed including measures like sleep architecture, amount of slow wave activity (SWA), amount of spindles, awakenings during sleep, and sleep fragmentation. In addition, subjective sleep quality will be obtained by questionnaires every morning over the intervention period. These measures will show whether auditory stimulation enhanced overall sleep quality compared to sham.</description>
