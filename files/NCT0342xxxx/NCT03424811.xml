  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The high prevalence of mealtime difficulties and obesity among children with autism spectrum&#xD;
      disorder (ASD) calls for new and innovative ways to promote healthy eating and weight&#xD;
      development in this population. This project aims to develop and test an interactive mobile&#xD;
      health (mHealth) nutrition intervention, which incorporates core behavior change strategies&#xD;
      that have been empirically tested in family-based nutrition research and behavioral&#xD;
      interventions with children with ASD. The feasibility and efficacy of this mHealth&#xD;
      intervention to improve dietary outcomes in children with ASD will be tested in a&#xD;
      proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the fastest growing developmental disability affecting more&#xD;
      than 2 million US children and tens of millions worldwide. Children with ASD are 5 times more&#xD;
      likely to have mealtime challenges and be picky eaters, which in part has been attributed to&#xD;
      restrictive and ritualistic behaviors and heightened sensory sensitivity. These nutritional&#xD;
      difficulties pose significant every day challenges for caregivers when it comes to child&#xD;
      feeding and daily eating routines and call for new and innovative ways to promote healthy&#xD;
      eating in children affected by ASD. The use of mobile technologies is rapidly increasing in&#xD;
      children across all age groups. Children with ASD, in particular, often engage with mobile&#xD;
      devices on a daily basis and mobile health (mHealth) technology has been shown to be an&#xD;
      effective tool for improving behavioral, social, and communication skills in children with&#xD;
      ASD. The investigators aim to harness the lure of technology and develop and test, for the&#xD;
      first time, the feasibility and acceptability of an interactive mHealth nutrition&#xD;
      intervention for children with ASD. This intervention will build upon core behavior change&#xD;
      strategies that have been empirically tested in family-based nutrition research for over 3&#xD;
      decades. A second aim of this project is to test, in a 3-month randomized controlled trial,&#xD;
      the efficacy of the mHealth intervention on changing consumption of targeted healthy and less&#xD;
      healthy foods and beverages in 6- to 10-year-old children with ASD who are picky eaters.&#xD;
      Primary outcomes of this proof-of-concept trial will include 3-month changes in children's&#xD;
      daily intake of fruits and vegetables, salty and sugary snacks, and sugar-sweetened&#xD;
      beverages. Secondary outcomes will include parent and child engagement with the mHealth&#xD;
      technology, motivation, user friendliness and ease of use. If successful, the use of this&#xD;
      innovative mHealth nutrition intervention will offer new and powerful targets for&#xD;
      intervention in improving dietary intake and the fight against childhood obesity in this&#xD;
      especially vulnerable population of children.&#xD;
