      Cabozantinib is an oral, small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Its primary targets are&#xD;
      Hepatocyte growth factor receptor protein (MET), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor&#xD;
      1-3 (VEGFR1-3), RET, AXL, FLT3 and KIT. Cabozantinib has been approved by the FDA for&#xD;
      clinical treatment of progressive, metastatic medullary thyroid cancer. Recently published&#xD;
      trials have demonstrated activity for cabozantinib in patients with advanced renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Furthermore, in&#xD;
      preclinical models of urothelial carcinoma (UC) of the bladder, cabozantinib has demonstrated&#xD;
      the ability to inhibit tumor xenograft growth. It has been suggested that levels of soluble&#xD;
      Met ectodomain (sMet) can be measured in the urine as a useful biomarker to monitor the&#xD;
      efficacy of c-Met therapy in bladder cancer patients. Moreover, cabozantinib has demonstrated&#xD;
      activity in heavily pretreated, advanced bladder cancer patients, with a response rate of&#xD;
      19.5% and manageable toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase I of this study it is proposed to evaluate DLTs of niraparib and cabozantinib&#xD;
      combination and determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in patients with advanced urothelial&#xD;
      or renal cell carcinoma. In the phase II it is proposed to make a preliminary evaluation of&#xD;
      the efficacy of this combination in patients with urothelial cell carcinoma. Efficacy results&#xD;
      will be correlated with genomic alterations related to c-Met and Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase&#xD;
      (PARP) inhibitor activity.&#xD;

      Bladder cancer is the 9th most common cancer worldwide, with around 429.800 new cases&#xD;
      diagnosed in 2012 and the 5th most common cancer in Europe, with more than 151.000 new cases&#xD;
      diagnosed in 2012. Relating mortality figures, bladder cancer is the 13th most common cause&#xD;
      of cancer death worldwide, with around 165.100 deaths from bladder cancer in 2012 and the 9th&#xD;
      in Europe, with around 52.400.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cisplatin-based chemotherapy remains the standard treatment in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      urothelial carcinoma (UC).This regimen has been associated with a median survival of 14-15&#xD;
      months. The prognosis of patients who progress after a platinum-based regimen is dismal.&#xD;
      Several chemotherapy drugs tested in the second-line setting, such as taxanes, vinflunine and&#xD;
      pemetrexed, have demonstrated limited activity, with response rates of 5-20%, median&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) of 2-4 months, and median survival of 6-8 months. Thus, there&#xD;
      are significant unmet medical needs in the second-line setting. New therapeutic targets&#xD;
      should be tested in urothelial carcinoma to improve these results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapies targeting DNA repair pathways can exploit DNA repair defects in cancer cells to&#xD;
      generate synthetic lethality. Alterations in DNA repair pathways have been associated with&#xD;
      response to DNA-damaging agents. For example, defective homologous recombination (HR) plays a&#xD;
      crucial role in tumors where platinum agents are involved in therapeutic management, as well&#xD;
      as in those treated with PARP inhibitors, which have synthetic lethal effects when applied to&#xD;
      cells with defective HR. Targeted mutational profiling of HR genes using next-generation&#xD;
      sequencing has been used to identify mutations of key HR genes. Furthermore, HR-defective&#xD;
      tumors exhibit genomic instability, including loss of heterozygosity (LOH), telomeric allelic&#xD;
      imbalance (TAI) and large-scale state transitions (LST). A combined HR deficiency score&#xD;
      (myChoice homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) test from Myriad Genetics) defined as the&#xD;
      sum of LOH, TAI and LST has been developed. This score has been associated with response to&#xD;
      platinum-based chemotherapy and in ovarian cancer with the efficacy of niraparib in patients&#xD;
      without germline breast cancer gene (gBRCA) mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), the Cancer Genome Atlas project found&#xD;
      31% of alterations in BRCA1-2 genes, mainly related to copy number and overexpression. In&#xD;
      addition, a high percentage of tumors had alterations in other DNA repair genes. Recently, in&#xD;
      platinum-treated UC patients, 47% of mutations in DNA repair genes have been found, including&#xD;
      50% of mutations in HR, Fanconi anemia, and DNA-damage-response checkpoint pathways. The&#xD;
      presence of these mutations has been associated with survival. These results suggest a&#xD;
      potential role for PARP inhibitors in UC. Niraparib is a highly selective inhibitor of poly&#xD;
      (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP)1/2 nuclear protein. PARP enzymes are&#xD;
      involved in DNA repair through activation of the base excision repair (BER) pathway and&#xD;
      alternative end-joining pathways and inhibition of non-homologous end-joining. PARP&#xD;
      inhibition in cells with HR deficiency causes accumulation of unrepaired DNA double-strand&#xD;
      breaks, leading to cell death. For these reasons, PARP inhibitors are selectively lethal in&#xD;
      tumor cells with defective HR. Niraparib at the recommended oral dose of 300 mg daily has&#xD;
      demonstrated efficacy in platinum- sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer with defective HR. The&#xD;
      most significant toxicity was hematologic (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia). Among&#xD;
      non-hematologic toxicities, hypertension was detected in 8% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) is activated by its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor&#xD;
      (HGF), and induces increased proliferation, migration, motility, and invasion of bladder&#xD;
      cancer cells. c-Met is overexpressed in more than 60% of metastatic bladder cancer patients&#xD;
      and is linked to poor outcome. Furthermore, in bladder cancer, c-Met is co-expressed with&#xD;
      other RTKs, such as AXL and PDGFR. Some evidence suggests a relationship between c-Met and&#xD;
      AXL expression with DNA damage response and resistance to chemotherapy. For example, Balaji&#xD;
      et al have demonstrated that AXL inhibition leads to a defect in the HR pathway, sensitizing&#xD;
      cells to PARP inhibition. In a recently published study, a significant interaction between&#xD;
      c-Met and Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1) was detected in breast cancer cell lines.&#xD;
      c-Met activity can decrease response to PARP inhibitors, whereas treatment with c-Met&#xD;
      inhibitors renders cells more sensitive to PARP inhibition. Likewise, in in vivo models with&#xD;
      xenograft tumors, the combination of c-Met and PARP inhibitors showed a significant reduction&#xD;
      in tumor growth compared to either inhibitor alone. This interaction can be explained because&#xD;
      c-Met mediates PARP1 function through phosphorylation of PARP1 at Y907. These results raise&#xD;
      the possibility that bladder cancer patients with tumors overexpressing c-Met can benefit&#xD;
      from the combination of c-Met inhibitors and PARP inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cabozantinib is an oral, small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Its primary targets are&#xD;
      MET, VEGFR1-3, RET, AXL, FLT3 and KIT. Cabozantinib has been approved by the FDA for clinical&#xD;
      treatment of progressive, metastatic medullary thyroid cancer. The recommended dose of&#xD;
      cabozantinib has been established in phase I trials at 60 mg/day in 28-day cycles. Recently&#xD;
      published trials have demonstrated activity for cabozantinib in patients with advanced renal&#xD;
      cell carcinoma and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Furthermore, in&#xD;
      preclinical models of UC of the bladder, cabozantinib has demonstrated the ability to inhibit&#xD;
      tumor xenograft growth. It has been suggested that levels of soluble Met ectodomain (sMet)&#xD;
      can be measured in the urine as a useful biomarker to monitor the efficacy of c-Met therapy&#xD;
      in bladder cancer patients. Moreover, cabozantinib has demonstrated activity in heavily&#xD;
      pretreated, advanced bladder cancer patients, with a response rate of 19.5% and manageable&#xD;
      toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase I of this study it is proposed to evaluate DLTs of niraparib and cabozantinib&#xD;
      combination and determine MTD in patients with advanced urothelial or renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
      In the phase II it is proposed to make a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of this&#xD;
      combination in patients with urothelial cell carcinoma. Efficacy results will be correlated&#xD;
      with genomic alterations related to c-Met and PARP inhibitor activity.&#xD;
