      The overall objective of this Early Phase Clinical Trial is to begin defining the accuracy of&#xD;
      68Ga-PSMA-11 for detecting the location and size of clinically significant prostate cancer&#xD;
      lesions in low and intermediate risk disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A molecularly-targeted probe (68Ga-PSMA-11), coupled with an advanced clinical imaging system&#xD;
      (Siemens Biograph VisionPET-CT), will improve accuracy during biopsy and staging. We propose&#xD;
      detailed intra-lesion whole-mount pathologic analysis as the gold standard for critically&#xD;
      assessing PSMA PET accuracy in patients undergoing surgery, and blinded PSMA PET-CT&#xD;
      comparison with standard multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) for patients having biopsy on active&#xD;
      surveillance. This intensive testing of the accuracy and value of PSMA-based tracers requires&#xD;
      our unique collaboration of surgeons, radiologists, pathologists, and imaging scientists with&#xD;
      decades of experience and innovation.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, single arm, phase 2 clinical trial. This patient population will have&#xD;
      low (1 = Gleason 3 + 3) or intermediate risk (2 = 3 + 4; 3 = 4 + 3) prostate cancer. It will&#xD;
      also enroll those who are at high risk of significant prostate cancer (4Kscore &gt;20%,&#xD;
      SelectMDx &gt;20%, PSA density &gt;0.15). Patients will be scheduled for magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) as part of routine care for either surgical planning or for further biopsy. Following&#xD;
      the informed consent process, patients who enroll in the study will receive a PSMA positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET) study along with their standard of care (SOC) MRI on an integrated&#xD;
      PET-MRI. Registration of PET and MRI will be done using software to generate the PET-MRI&#xD;
      images. Patients receiving SOC MRI guided biopsy will receive additional PET guided biopsies&#xD;
      as indicated in a single session. The sensitivity and specificity will be evaluated along&#xD;
      with the ability of the tracer to inform the treatment planning. Patients receiving surgical&#xD;
      removal of the prostate will have a slice-by-slice whole mount analysis to assess the&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity the PSMA PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives Define the accuracy of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET-CT for detecting the location and&#xD;
      size of clinically significant prostate cancer lesions in low and intermediate risk disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives Evaluate how knowledge of the PSMA-PET might inform treatment planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives Generate pilot data for future larger clinical trials&#xD;
