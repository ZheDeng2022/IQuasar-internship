  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tracheal intubation is one of the most common medical procedures performed in hospitals. On&#xD;
      one hand, it is highly successful and easy to perform using a rigid laryngoscope. On the&#xD;
      other hand, hypoxic brain damage and death may result rapidly if it is unsuccessful. This&#xD;
      disastrous outcome happens when the airway cannot be secured by intubation and face mask&#xD;
      ventilation becomes difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Careful preoperative evaluation to identify patients in whom tracheal intubation and mask&#xD;
      ventilation may prove to be difficult can save lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past 40 years, different techniques of tracheal intubation have been introduced, the&#xD;
      most effective under different conditions being fiberoptic intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The flexible intubation video endoscope is a relatively new device which delivers clear,&#xD;
      pixel-free images without a Moiré pattern. The flexible intubation video endoscope can be&#xD;
      directly connected to the C-MAC® monitor. Due to the Distal Chip technology the user enjoys a&#xD;
      full-format direct video imaging with improved image quality with a resolution higher than&#xD;
      fiberoptic bronchoscopy which has another disadvantage of being Fragile where Fibres can be&#xD;
      broken or have transmission loss when wrapped around curves of only a few centimeters radius.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After ethics approval and informed consent from patients, 60 obese patients aging from 20-60&#xD;
      years will randomly allocated and divided into two groups each is (Thirty) patients in each&#xD;
      group, using flexible intubation video endoscope(FIVE) in (group1) and fiberoptic&#xD;
      bronchoscopy in (group 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will compare the techniques for time of intubation, hemodynamic (SBP, DBP and HR)&#xD;
      changes, success rate, number of attempts and complications in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      investigators expect from this study that flexible intubation video endoscope(FIVE) has&#xD;
      become a good alternative and associated with better visualization of laryngeal structures in&#xD;
      shorter time as compared to traditional flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy.&#xD;

      Airway management is considered a cardinal aspect of anesthetic practice and of emergency and&#xD;
      intensive care medicine. Endotracheal intubation is a simple, safe, rapid and nonsurgical&#xD;
      method that achieves all the objectives of airway management which include maintaining a&#xD;
      patent airway, lung protection from aspiration and allows leak free ventilation during&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation. Even though endotracheal intubation isn't a complication free&#xD;
      procedure, some of them life-threatening. It is important to anesthesiologists to be alert to&#xD;
      these complications and to have an effective plan to avoid and manage these complications&#xD;
      when they occur .&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a clear airway can't be guaranteed, it can be fatal. In 1990, an analysis of&#xD;
      anesthesia-related closed claims in the USA declared that respiratory system adverse outcomes&#xD;
      were the lone largest class of injury and that the percentage of death or catastrophic brain&#xD;
      insult associated with it was much higher than that associated with cardiovascular&#xD;
      problems.Since then, it became a priority to decrease the serious adverse outcomes associated&#xD;
      with airway management; major protocols for difficult airway management have been defined,&#xD;
      developing new reliable airway devices, and adequate monitoring of ventilation by pulse&#xD;
      oximetry and capnography have become a standard. Thanks to these efforts, the incidence of&#xD;
      these serious adverse outcomes is likely to be reduced, and airway management can now be&#xD;
      considered as a safe procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endotracheal intubation is still the &quot;gold standard&quot; in airway management . If with using&#xD;
      traditional techniques or video-assisted techniques which can be used when there is&#xD;
      intubation failure or anticipated difficult airway. Video-assisted techniques may help to&#xD;
      increase intubation success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video-assisted techniques allow to indirectly visualize the laryngeal structures with fiber&#xD;
      optical or camera chip technique and to show the video picture on an external or built-in&#xD;
      monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fiberoptic intubation has been considered for a long time the gold standard technique for&#xD;
      intubation when there is anticipated or known difficult airway or as a rescue device in can't&#xD;
      intubate but can ventilate scenarios . Fibreoptic intubation can be a hard skill to teach,&#xD;
      gain and keep.In this context, closed claims analysis has declared severe complications such&#xD;
      as catastrophic brain insult and death occurred with anticipated difficult airway management&#xD;
      and awake intubation. Therefore, it is considerable to develop simple, dependable, safe, and&#xD;
      effective intubation devices.&#xD;
