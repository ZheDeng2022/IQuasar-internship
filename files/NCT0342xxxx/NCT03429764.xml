  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the last decade, esthetics has become a major concern in the periodontal therapy. Modern&#xD;
      aesthetic dentistry involves not only the restoration of lost teeth, but increasingly the&#xD;
      management and reconstruction of the encasing gingiva. Interdental papilla not only acts as a&#xD;
      biological barrier in protecting the periodontal structures but also plays a critical role in&#xD;
      aesthetics. Numerous risk factors lead to the development of open gingival embrasures or&#xD;
      black triangle. These factors include periodontal disease, length of embrasure area, root&#xD;
      angulations, interproximal contact position, triangular shape crowns, and consequence of post&#xD;
      periodontal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interproximal soft tissue craters formation are the consequences of periodontal surgeries&#xD;
      like modified widman flap procedures, osseous surgery. Study shows higher percentage of&#xD;
      interproximal soft tissue craters in modified widman flap surgery as compared to osseous&#xD;
      surgery at six weeks. This creates difficulty for the therapist and patients in performance&#xD;
      and plaque control procedures, leading to persistent soft tissue inflammation and black&#xD;
      triangle formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary closure of interdental area is technically more demanding. In periodontal surgery,&#xD;
      the most common method of wound closure uses sutures. The primary objectives of suturing are&#xD;
      to stabilize and to secure tissues in their desired locations. Therefore choosing an&#xD;
      appropriate suturing technique, thread type, thread diameter and surgical needle as well as&#xD;
      using proper surgical knot for each thread material are also critical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proper management of supracrestal soft tissue flap along with interdental papilla during&#xD;
      suturing appears to be of critical importance in ultimate outcome of surgical periodontal&#xD;
      pocket management. Wound healing after periodontal flap surgery is achieved through four&#xD;
      precisely and highly programmed phases; hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation and&#xD;
      remodelling. Wound stability and undisturbed maturation of a fibrin clot adhering to root&#xD;
      surface is one of the prerequisite for optimum periodontal regeneration. Wound stability is&#xD;
      achieved by close approximation of wound margins for primary intention healing by proper&#xD;
      suturing. Wound integrity during the early healing phase rest primarily on the stabilization&#xD;
      of the gingival flaps offered by suturing with primary closure of the wound edges&#xD;
      inter-proximally while being maintained in maximum passive contact with the root to minimize&#xD;
      the intervening blood clot and to prevent wound contamination Mattress sutures are used for&#xD;
      greater flap security and control. They permit more precise flap placement, especially when&#xD;
      combined with periosteal stabilization. They also allow for good papillary stabilization and&#xD;
      placement. These mattress sutures can be internal or external. The internal mattress sutures&#xD;
      are used when it is desirable to have the papilla position more upright in the embrasure&#xD;
      space. Literature suggests that these sutures may be used in the anterior region when&#xD;
      esthetics ideally required that the papilla fill the entire interdental area Continuous&#xD;
      independent sling suture are used when multiple teeth are involved, provides greater&#xD;
      distribution of forces on the flaps, minimize need for multiple knots, and allow independent&#xD;
      placement of buccal and lingual flaps and permits precise flap placement and also secure&#xD;
      multiple interproximal papillae of one flap independently of the other flap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus the most suitable suturing technique to achieve healing by primary intention and&#xD;
      connective tissue reattachment/ periodontal regeneration and preservation of interdental soft&#xD;
      tissue needs to be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of the available literature does not reveal studies conducted to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of vertical mattress suture technique and Continuous independent sling suturing techniques on&#xD;
      maintaining the height of interdental papilla and periodontal wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the above mentioned suture technique to be best for primary closure and&#xD;
      regeneration as well as maintaining the supracrestal tissue at the desired location, the&#xD;
      present study is intended to determine the influence of internal mattress suture and&#xD;
      continuous independent sling suture on height of interdental papilla and periodontal healing&#xD;
      in the esthetic zone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECT POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants for the study will be selected from Outpatient Department Of Periodontology And&#xD;
      Oral Implantology at, Post Graduate Institute of Dental sciences (PGIDS), Rohtak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION AND DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of minimum of 40 systemically healthy patients aged 18 to&#xD;
      65 years with chronic periodontitis, pocket depth ≥ 5 mm after completed etiological&#xD;
      periodontal therapy, requiring open flap debridement in maxillary esthetic zone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized in to two groups (minimum 20 each) i.e test and control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control group (CG) -continuous independent sling sutures will be placed with minimum two&#xD;
           intact contact points at the surgical site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test group (TG) -- internal mattress suture will be placed with minimum two intact&#xD;
           contact points at the surgical site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All potential participants would be explained the need and design of the study. Only those&#xD;
      participant who consented for the study will be included after obtaining written and verbal&#xD;
      informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be randomly allocated to control and test groups. The study will be conducted as&#xD;
      follows-&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRESURGICAL THERAPY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 therapy-Oral hygiene instruction, patient education and motivation. Full mouth&#xD;
      supragingival and subgingival scaling and root planning with ultrasonic scaler (EMS Piezon&#xD;
      250, Switzerland), hand scaler and curettes (Hu-Friedy) will be completed. Patient will be&#xD;
      re-evaluated for periodontal condition after 6 weeks of phase 1 therapy. Sites with probing&#xD;
      depth ≥5 mm will be treated with periodontal surgery. Patient with good oral hygiene standard&#xD;
      (plaque index score &lt;1 and low level of residual infection (full mouth bleeding score FMBS&#xD;
      &lt;20%) will be considered for periodontal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PERIODONTAL SURGICAL PROCEDURE&#xD;
&#xD;
      After administration of local anaesthesia, open flap debridement will be done on both control&#xD;
      group and test group. Test group patients vertical internal mattress suture will be placed&#xD;
      and continuous independent sling suture will be placed in control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In internal mattress suture, the suture enters the facial tissue just apical to the base of&#xD;
      the papilla, runs across the top of alveolar crest, and penetrates the lingual tissue from&#xD;
      the inside-out apical to the base of the lingual papilla. The suture passes back through the&#xD;
      lingual papilla from the outside-in, 2 to 3 mm coronal to the previous point of suture&#xD;
      penetration, and courses back across the alveolar crest exiting through the facial papilla&#xD;
      from the inside-out at a point 2 to 3 mm coronal to the initial facial entry point. The&#xD;
      facial and lingual papillae are positioned together and the suture is tied on the facial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In continuous independent sling suture, the suture is passed through the most anterior facial&#xD;
      papilla from outside -in just coronal to the mucogingival junction and looped around the&#xD;
      lingual of tooth to engage the next facial papilla. The suture does not enter the lingual&#xD;
      flap at this time. The suture is looped around each successive tooth, penetrating the facial&#xD;
      papilla just coronal to the mucogingival junction.At distal end of flap, the suture is passed&#xD;
      through facial tissue and looped back around the lingual of terminal tooth and through the&#xD;
      interdental area mesial to the terminal tooth. The suture is then slung around the facial&#xD;
      surface of the terminal tooth towards the distal aspect of lingual flap. Wrapping the suture&#xD;
      around the terminal tooth in this fashion allows facial flap to be locked in placed and&#xD;
      positioned independently of the lingual or palatal flap. The suture is then looped back&#xD;
      around the facial surface of terminal tooth. The suture is passed through the interdental&#xD;
      area to engage next papilla on the lingual or palatal flap. The lingual flap is sutured in a&#xD;
      similar manner as the facial flap. The suture is tied anteriorly where the suture was&#xD;
      initially introduced into the facial tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POST OPERATIVE CARE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be given both verbal and written instructions about post operative care. He/she&#xD;
      will be advised:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To take antibiotic Amoxycillin 500mg 8 hourly for 5 days along with Ibuprofen 400 mg 8 hourly&#xD;
      for two days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sutures will be removed after 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;

      Intraoral periapical radiographs will be taken for diagnostic purpos PPD and CAL will be&#xD;
      measured using UNC 15 periodontal probe at six sites (mesiobuccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual,&#xD;
      distolingual, and median points at buccal and lingual aspect).&#xD;
&#xD;
      GI, PI will be measured using UNC 15 periodontal probe at four sites(distobuccal,&#xD;
      mesiobuccal, facial, lingual gingival margin)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Papillary height will be measured&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. apical aspect of contact point to tip of papilla and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. from tip of papilla to the mucogingival junction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The photographs of interdental papilla will be taken and linear measurements as mentioned&#xD;
      above will be done on the photographs with the help of Image J software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical parameters will be recorded at enrolment, baseline, 3 months, and 6 months of&#xD;
      periodontal surgery. Interdental papilla height will also be measured at 3 weeks of&#xD;
      periodontal surgery. The patients will be reinforced with oral hygiene instructions at every&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
