    <textblock>
      The ILLUMENATE Pivotal PAS is a continued follow-up study which will include 300 subjects&#xD;
      from forty-three (43) sites across the United States and Austria previously enrolled in the&#xD;
      ILLUMENATE Pivotal pre-market study to evaluate the Stellarex DCB compared to the PTA control&#xD;
      device for the treatment of de-novo or post-PTA occluded/stenotic or reoccluded/restenotic&#xD;
      (except for in-stent) SFA and/or popliteal arteries.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this continued follow-up of ILLUMENATE Pivotal Study subjects is to&#xD;
      demonstrate the long term safety and effectiveness of the Stellarex DCB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each enrolled subject will be followed for 5 years (60 months) after treatment. A follow-up&#xD;
      office visit will occur at 24 and 36 months. A follow-up telephone contact or an optional&#xD;
      office visit will occur at 48 and 60 months.&#xD;

          4. Will not undergo other planned vascular interventions within 14 days before and/or 30&#xD;
             days after the protocol treatment (successful treatment of ipsilateral and&#xD;
             contralateral iliac permitted prior to enrollment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Life expectancy &gt;1 year.&#xD;

&#xD;
             Study Subjects must fulfill the following angiographic criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. De novo or restenotic lesion (except for in-stent restenotic lesion) &gt;70% within the&#xD;
             SFA and/or popliteal artery in a single limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Single lesion which is ≥3 cm and ≤18cm in length (by visual estimation). NOTE: Tandem&#xD;
             lesions can be treated. A tandem lesion is defined as two distinct lesions with 3 cm&#xD;
             or less of healthy vessel separating the two diseased areas. The total cumulative&#xD;
             length of the tandem lesions, including the healthy vessel, must not exceed 18 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Lesion is treatable by no more than two (2) study devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Successful wire crossing of the lesion. The guidewire advancement should not be&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. Inflow artery is patent, free from significant lesion stenosis (≥50% stenosis is&#xD;
             considered significant) as confirmed by angiography. Treatment of a target lesion is&#xD;
             acceptable after successful treatment of inflow artery lesion(s). NOTE: Successful&#xD;
             inflow artery treatment is defined as attainment of residual diameter stenosis &lt;30%&#xD;
             without death or major vascular complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Target limb with at least one patent (less than 50% stenosis) tibio-peroneal run-off&#xD;
             vessel confirmed by baseline angiography or prior magnetic resonance (MR) angiography&#xD;

             days after the index procedure (successful treatment of ipsilateral and contralateral&#xD;
             iliac permitted prior to enrollment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Prior endovascular treatment of target lesion by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty&#xD;
             or any other means of previous endovascular treatment (e.g. stents/stent grafts,&#xD;
             cutting balloon, scoring balloon, cryoplasty, thrombectomy, atherectomy, brachytherapy&#xD;
             or laser devices) within six months of the index procedure, or any previous placement&#xD;

             Subject with any of the following angiographic criteria should be excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Significant contralateral or ipsilateral common femoral disease that requires&#xD;
