        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult male and female subjects ≥18 to ≤70 years of age, inclusive, at the time of&#xD;

                  hysterectomy, tubal ligation, or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) or&#xD;
                  postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea). Females&#xD;
                  of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of contraception&#xD;
                  during the study from clinical research unit (CRU) admission through Safety&#xD;

&#xD;
                  Adequate methods of contraception for subjects or partner include condom,&#xD;
                  diaphragm, or cervical cap used in conjunction with spermicidal gel, foam, cream,&#xD;
                  film, or suppository. Hormonal contraception is NOT acceptable in this study. If&#xD;
                  necessary, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) results &gt;40 IU/L at Screening are&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Nonsterile male subjects with sexual partners of childbearing potential must&#xD;
                  agree to use adequate methods of contraception from CRU admission through Safety&#xD;
                  Follow-up. Adequate methods of contraception for subjects or partner include the&#xD;
                  following: condom with spermicidal gel, diaphragm with spermicidal gel, coil&#xD;
                  (intrauterine device), surgical sterilization, vasectomy, oral contraceptive&#xD;

                  NuvaRing®, Ortho Evra®; if a subject is not sexually active, but becomes active,&#xD;
                  he or his partner should use medically accepted forms of contraception.&#xD;
