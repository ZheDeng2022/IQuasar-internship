    <textblock>
      This study evaluates beneficial effects of biofeedback therapy in reducing pain and increased&#xD;
      tension of muscles occurring in patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMD). During the&#xD;
      study Electromyography Biofeedback (EMG-Biofeedback)- assisted training lowering muscle&#xD;
      tension will be used. The patients will undergo 4 or 8 meetings of EMG-Biofeedback - assisted&#xD;
      training Than the patients will be reevaluated after 6 and 12 weeks.&#xD;

      1. The Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The aim of the study is to evaluate beneficial effects of biofeedback therapy in&#xD;
           reducing pain, increased tension of masticatory muscles occurring in patients with&#xD;
           myogenous TMD and if the therapy influences psychological and sleep parameters. Also to&#xD;
           verify if the effect of the therapy persists in time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Experimental group 1 - patients diagnosed with myalgia subjected to 4&#xD;
                EMG-Biofeedback trainings. The group will include approximately 20 adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Experimental group 2 - patients diagnosed with myalgia subjected to 8&#xD;
                EMG-Biofeedback trainings. The group will include approximately 20 adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Control group - patients diagnosed with myalgia subjected to physiotherapy (manual&#xD;
                therapy), stabilization splint usage and counseling (20 adults).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients diagnosed with masticatory muscles myalgia will be included in this study. All&#xD;
      participants will be evaluated in accordance to the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular&#xD;
      Disorders (DC/TMD). Intensity of pain in the masticatory muscles will be defined using the&#xD;
      Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). The pressure pain threshold (PPT) will be assessed with an&#xD;
      dolorimeter and noticed on DC/TMD pain drawing diagram. Each of the qualified patients will&#xD;
      also undergo the electromyography of temporal and masseter muscles. All participants will&#xD;
      fill in questionnaires (Graded Chronic Pain Scale (GCPS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index&#xD;
      (PSQI), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Perceived&#xD;
      Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10) and Somatic Symptom Scale-8 (SSS-8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients qualified to the experimental groups will be divided in to 2 subgroups composed of&#xD;
      20 participants each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group 1 will undergo a cycle of 4 meetings (1 per week) of 20 minute&#xD;
      EMG-Biofeedback- assisted training decreasing the masseter and temporalis muscle tension. 10&#xD;
      minutes of training for each group of muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group 2 will undergo a cycle of 8 meetings (1 per week) of 20 minute&#xD;
      EMG-Biofeedback- assisted training decreasing the masseter and temporalis muscle tension. 10&#xD;
      minutes of training for each group of muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postcycle examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the cycle, patients from the study group and control group will be&#xD;
      reevaluated. All participants will be evaluated in accordance to the Diagnostic Criteria for&#xD;
      Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD). Intensity of pain in the masticatory muscles will be&#xD;
      defined using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). The pressure pain threshold (PPT) will be&#xD;
      assessed with an dolorimeter and noticed on DC/TMD pain drawing diagram. Each of the&#xD;
      qualified patients will also undergo the electromyography of temporal and masseter muscles.&#xD;
      All participants will fill in questionnaires (Graded Chronic Pain Scale (GCPS), Pittsburgh&#xD;
      Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Beck Anxiety Inventory&#xD;
      (BAI) and Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10) and Somatic Symptom Scale-8 (SSS-8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The postcycle examination will take place after last planned training and during follow-ups -&#xD;
      6 and 12 weeks after completion of EMG-Biofeedback therapy.&#xD;

    <description>EMG-Biofeedback- assisted training is a method in which electrodes situated on the surface of the skin detect small voltage changes which arise from the working muscles (in this case masseter and temporalis muscles). The voltage is transformed into a visual or sound time-variable signal which gives the patient feedback as he willingly tries to change the muscle tension (in this case to lower the excessive masseter tension)</description>
