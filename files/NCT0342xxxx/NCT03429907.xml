    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn if starting a stress-reduction program before&#xD;
      treatment can affect your stress, mood, and physical symptoms during and after treatment for&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 140 participants will be enrolled in this study. All participants will be recruited at&#xD;
      MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a&#xD;
      coin) to 1 of 2 groups. You will have an equal chance of being in either group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 1, you will be asked to do daily mind-body exercises for 14 days,&#xD;
           beginning before you start receiving chemotherapy. The exercises are short, about 10&#xD;
           minutes per day. The exercises are presented on an online application (&quot;app&quot;) that runs&#xD;
           on your personal electronic device (such as a mobile phone or tablet). You will be&#xD;
           required to install the application on your personal device and to create an account.&#xD;
           The study staff will tell you how to perform the exercises, install the application, and&#xD;
           create an account. During the 14 days, you will receive automated daily reminders to do&#xD;
           the exercises. After you have finished the 14 days of mind-body exercises, you may&#xD;
           continue to use the application free of charge for the remainder of the year. After the&#xD;
           first year, if you want to keep using the application, you will have to pay for it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 2, you will not perform the mind-body exercises. You will be offered&#xD;
           one year of free access to the application described above at your last study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits - All Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you start chemotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete 10 questionnaires about your stress, mood, physical symptoms, and&#xD;
           personality. It should take about 45 minutes to complete all of the questionnaires. You&#xD;
           can decide to complete some of the questionnaires from home on a personal computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Information about you (such as age and race) and the disease will be collected from your&#xD;
           medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for testing of genes and biomarkers that may be&#xD;
           related to physical symptoms and mood. Biomarkers are found in the blood and tissue and&#xD;
           may help researchers measure the effects of the daily mind-body exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A hair sample will be taken to measure hormones that are commonly released during times&#xD;
           of stress. A lock of hair about the width of a pencil lead will be cut close to your&#xD;
           scalp.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You may be asked to complete a computer task in which you press buttons multiple times&#xD;
           in a set time limit. You will receive written instructions on how to complete the task.&#xD;
           It should take 15 minutes to complete this task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At about 15 days after you started the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Â°You will complete one question about your stress. You can complete this question in the&#xD;
      clinic or from home on a personal computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During chemotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At about the third month and the sixth month of chemotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete 6 questionnaires about your stress, mood, and physical symptoms. It&#xD;
           should take about 30 minutes to complete the questionnaires. You can decide to complete&#xD;
           these questionnaires from home on a personal computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If your schedule allows for it and you agree, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn&#xD;
           for biomarker testing. If you do not have time to complete this blood draw, it will not&#xD;
           affect your participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 6 months after you finish receiving chemotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete 8 questionnaires about your stress, mood, and physical symptoms. It&#xD;
           should take about 30 minutes to complete the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for biomarker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You may be asked to complete the computer task described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on this study will be over about 6 months after your last cycle of&#xD;
      chemotherapy. If chemotherapy will not be the first treatment you receive for your diagnosis,&#xD;
      then your participation on this study will be over at 2 weeks after the start of the study.&#xD;
