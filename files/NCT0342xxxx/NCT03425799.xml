  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if Tranexamic Acid can safely reduce bleeding in people&#xD;
      undergoing spinal fusion surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study comparing&#xD;
      tranexamic acid (test) to placebo (control) for reduction of perioperative blood loss after&#xD;
      complex spinal fusion surgery (defined as T2 to Pelvis/Sacrum and greater than 4 Functional&#xD;
      Spinal Units (4 discs/motion segments=5 Vertebral segments)). In addition to test and control&#xD;
      treatments, all patients undergoing spinal fusion surgery will receive anesthesia and&#xD;
      standard of care for blood loss including colloid/crystalloid fluid replacement and packed&#xD;
      red cells, if necessary, according to a common multi-institutional protocol. Anesthesia will&#xD;
      keep the mean arterial pressure as low as safe for the patient during exposure of surgery&#xD;
      (estimated at 60-80 MAP). Patients will be randomized to receive either 30 mg/kg tranexamic&#xD;
      acid as a one hour infusion (3 mL/kg) loading dose prior to start of procedure and as an&#xD;
      infusion at 3 mg/kg/h (0.3 mL/kg/h) of tranexamic acid throughout the surgery in the test&#xD;
      group; or, a one hour infusion at 3 mL/kg of 0.9% saline prior to start of the procedure and&#xD;
      an infusion of 0.9% saline at 0.3 mL/kg/h in the control group. The maximum total dose will&#xD;
      be 50 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active phase of the study will be until discharge postoperatively for efficacy&#xD;
      measurements and at 6 weeks for safety follow-up. The randomization will be open only to the&#xD;
      statistician generating the randomization sequence. All PI(s), study conduct and monitoring&#xD;
      staff, as well as the subjects will be completely blinded to the treatments except in the&#xD;
      case of emergency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be terminated if â‰¥5/12 or 10/36 patients enrolled in the study are diagnosed&#xD;
      with treatment related serious adverse events.&#xD;
