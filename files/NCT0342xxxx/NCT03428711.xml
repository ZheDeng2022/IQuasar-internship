      The objective of the study is to demonstrate the superiority of the mesoglycan (Prisma®),&#xD;
      compared to placebo, in reducing the incidence of thromboembolic complications (relapse /&#xD;
      extension of superficial venous thrombosis (SVT), deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism (PE)) in patients who have completed the cycle of therapy of the acute phase after&#xD;
      superficial vein thrombosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: SVT is a relatively common clinical condition, with recent evidence of association&#xD;
      with the development of DVT and / or pulmonary embolism that has changed the perception of&#xD;
      the risk of this disease (with conflicting data in the literature: 3-33 %). Previous natural&#xD;
      history studies have observed that thromboembolic complications (relapse / extension of SVT,&#xD;
      DVT, PE) can affect up to 10-15% of subjects at 3-6 months from the initial event, despite&#xD;
      adequate treatment of the acute phase. There are no literature studies that have&#xD;
      prospectively investigated the usefulness of drug therapy in secondary prevention of SVT once&#xD;
      the initial therapeutic cycle is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To demonstrate the superiority of the mesoglycan (Prisma®), compared to placebo,&#xD;
      in reducing the incidence of thromboembolic complications (relapse / extension of superficial&#xD;
      venous thrombosis (SVT), deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE)) in patients&#xD;
      who have completed the cycle of therapy of the acute phase after superficial vein thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators: 18 Italian centers with proven experience in the treatment and prevention of&#xD;
      venous thromboembolic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II, multicentre, randomized, double-blind superiority study comparing mesoglycan&#xD;
      (Prisma®) 50 mg and placebo, both in double oral daily intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental drug: mesoglycan (Prisma®), already used in the treatment of chronic venous&#xD;
      ulcers, is a complex mucopolysaccharide, composed of a mixture of glycosaminoglycans (mainly&#xD;
      heparan-sulphate, dermatan sulfate), inhibitors of thrombin and of Factor Xa and active in&#xD;
      restore flow-mediated vasodilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Used in oral formulation, hard capsules, 50 mg, twice-a-day, for 12 months. Reference&#xD;
      therapy: placebo, organoleptically indistinguishable from the experimental drug, twice-a-day,&#xD;
      for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Masking: the study is conducted in &quot;double-blind&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology and phases of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written Consent Collection: the investigator will inform the interested party that&#xD;
      participation in the study is voluntary and that the refusal will not lead to the loss of any&#xD;
      benefit or in any way affect the relationship with the doctor. Furthermore, it will be&#xD;
      announced that withdrawal from the study is possible at any time without having to provide a&#xD;
      specific reason. Before being enrolled in the study, each subject will receive a complete&#xD;
      explanation of the nature and purpose of the study by the investigator, along with a&#xD;
      description of the benefits and risks associated with participation. Insurance coverage will&#xD;
      also be mentioned and related procedures in case of injuries will be explained. A clear&#xD;
      information sheet will be delivered to the subject covering all the important aspects of the&#xD;
      study. Once read, the subject will have the opportunity to ask questions and sufficient time&#xD;
      will be given to consider the various aspects presented, before being asked to sign and date&#xD;
      the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The original copy of the signed and dated informed consent form will be kept by the&#xD;
      investigator in the &quot;study file&quot; kept in the Center. The subject will receive a copy of the&#xD;
      informed consent form signed and dated for future reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening: after obtaining written informed consent, all potential subjects will complete the&#xD;
      screening visit. If they satisfy the prefixed inclusion and exclusion criteria, they will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study and will be subjected to ultrasound study using by color-coded duplex&#xD;
      ultrasonography (CCDU) of the lower limbs (investigation in standard clinical practice&#xD;
      because at the end of the treatment of the acute phase), to exclude a concomitant involvement&#xD;
      of the deep venous circle, or an extension of the initial SVT, which would imply the&#xD;
      extension of parenteral anticoagulant therapy. A blood test will be performed to determine&#xD;
      complete blood count, ALT, AST, creatinine, PT-INR, aPTT and PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: centralized, through a specific application of the EDC website, with 1: 1&#xD;
      allocation (stratified by age &lt;60 /&gt; = 60 years old and gender, in blocks of variable size,&#xD;
      random of 4 and 6 units) between placebo and mesoglycan. It is estimated that enrollment was&#xD;
      completed in 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scheduled visits: check-ups at 3, 6, 9, 12 months during treatment and at 24 months with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  overall clinical evaluation and treatment compliance,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  collection of information on any thromboembolic events and / or adverse events,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluation of rVCSS and VEINES / Sym-QoL scores,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  at 12 months, CCDU and blood sampling for complete blood counts, ALT, AST, creatinine,&#xD;
           PT-INR, aPTT and PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  at 24 months, blood sampling for complete blood counts, ALT, AST, creatinine, PT-INR,&#xD;
           aPTT and PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will be instructed to be present at any time for a clinical check in case of&#xD;
      signs / symptoms suggestive of thromboembolic events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the treatment period on days: 30, 60, 135, 225, 315 (+ -5 days) from the&#xD;
      randomization, and in the follow-up period after 3, 6 and 9 months from the end of the&#xD;
      treatment and then every 6 months until the end of the study, the subjects will be contacted&#xD;
      by telephone by trained personnel to assess their compliance with treatment, the possible use&#xD;
      of drugs not allowed and the onset of adverse events and / or end-points of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concomitant use of oral or parenteral anticoagulants, phlebotropics, NSAIDs in chronic&#xD;
      and continuous treatment (except for the occasional symptomatic use of NSAIDs),&#xD;
      double-anti-aggregation or ASA&gt; 160 mg / day, centrally acting painkillers is not permitted&#xD;
      during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The contemporary use of elasto-compressive therapy, of which there is no evidence of real&#xD;
      effectiveness, is left to the clinician's judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will exit permanently from the study if it occurs: one of the primary&#xD;
      end-points, the onset of one of the exclusion criteria, a serious adverse event (SAE) that&#xD;
      achieves one of the exclusion criteria, the withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary efficacy end-point: Cumulative occurrence of the first event, with instrumental&#xD;
      confirmation, occurring during the study treatment between: recurrence or extension of,&#xD;
      asymptomatic or symptomatic, SVT, new DVT (proximal asymptomatic or symptomatic / symptomatic&#xD;
      isolated distal), pulmonary embolism (fatal or symptomatic non-fatal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary efficacy end-points: Cumulative occurrence of the first event between: recurrence&#xD;
      or extension of, asymptomatic or symptomatic, SVT, new proximal / distal DVT (asymptomatic or&#xD;
      symptomatic), pulmonary embolism (fatal or symptomatic non-fatal); modification of the rVCSS&#xD;
      score (efficacy) and VEINES / Sym-QoL (quality of life) in treatment and in the following 12&#xD;
      months; recanalization of the vein involved in the primary thrombotic event; new development&#xD;
      of deep and / or superficial venous reflux; impact of elasto-compressive therapy;&#xD;
      contribution of PCR levels in predicting the onset of the primary end-point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Security End-Point: Serious adverse events, Total adverse events. Hemorrhagic AEs are&#xD;
      classified as major or minor (ISTH Guidelines).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A copy of the Diagnostic Report of the first event considered will be compulsorily collected&#xD;
      and transmitted to the coordinating center for the validation of the event.&#xD;
