  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PNI (Peripheral Nerve Injury) occurs in 5-15% of patients in cardiac surgery. So far, the&#xD;
      mechanism of injury has never been researched. In this study, we will compare minimally&#xD;
      invasive cardiac surgery with conventional cardiac surgery using a novel portable SSEP device&#xD;
      to pinpoint the mechanism and timing of PNI during cardiac surgery.&#xD;

      General objectives The general objective of this study is to identify the causative insults&#xD;
      during various kinds of cardiac surgeries. To attain this objective, we have three specific&#xD;
      aims. Firstly, surgical insults such as excessive or asymmetric sternal retraction have long&#xD;
      been regarded as the main causes of PNI. Therefore, we will investigate this by comparing&#xD;
      cardiac surgeries with sternotomy to the ones without sternotomy. Secondly, more and more&#xD;
      cardiac surgeons utilize minimally invasive techniques these days. In the current study, we&#xD;
      will investigate the incidence, mechanisms and patterns of PNI in minimally invasive cardiac&#xD;
      surgeries by comparing conventional surgeries to minimally invasive surgeries. Thirdly,&#xD;
      recent studies have suggested systematic insults such as ischemia, inflammation, and&#xD;
      underlying neuropathy might play more prominent roles in the mechanism of PNI. In this study,&#xD;
      we will analyze various factors such as intraoperative hemodynamics and baseline patient&#xD;
      characteristics to pinpoint the most responsible factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background The studies regarding mechanisms of PNI in cardiac surgeries have not been done&#xD;
      over the past few decades. With respect to minimally invasive cardiac surgeries, no studies&#xD;
      have been done to investigate the mechanism of PNI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the device used in this study The conventional SSEP device is large in size,&#xD;
      invasive, and requires expertise to interpret. These characteristics have prevented its use&#xD;
      in the operating room. This new portable SSEP device is devoid of these properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance Identification of causative insults will help clinicians to recognize and&#xD;
      possibly prevent PNI during cardiac surgeries.&#xD;
