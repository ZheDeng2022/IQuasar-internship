      This research study is studying two immunotherapy drugs as a possible treatment for advanced&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ipilimumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nivolumab&#xD;
    </textblock>

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of investigational drugs to learn whether the drugs work in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drugs are being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved ipilimumab for this specific&#xD;
      disease but it has been approved for other uses, including for patients with advanced&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved nivolumab as a treatment option&#xD;
      for this disease. However, nivolumab it is not approved in combination with ipilimumab to&#xD;
      treat NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab and ipilimumab are both types of immunotherapy. Immunotherapy works by stimulating&#xD;
      the body's own immune system to attack cancer cells. The combination of ipilimumab with&#xD;
      nivolumab may or may not increase anti-cancer activity by further boosting the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are investigating if the combination of ipilimumab&#xD;
      and nivolumab is effective in treating advanced NSCLC. The investigators are also&#xD;
      investigating whether there are certain DNA or protein markers in the blood or tumor tissue&#xD;
      that may indicate whether the combination will work in future patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed stage IV NSCLC, with no prior systemic anti-cancer therapy of&#xD;
             any kind (including EGFR and ALK inhibitors). Prior definitive chemoradiation for&#xD;
             locally advanced disease is permitted as long as the last administration of&#xD;
             chemotherapy or radiation (whichever was given last) occurred at least 6 months prior&#xD;
             to enrollment. Prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy for early stage lung cancer&#xD;
             is permitted if completed at least 6 months prior to initiating study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for&#xD;
             non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as ≥20 mm with conventional&#xD;
             techniques or as ≥10 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. See&#xD;
             Section 11 for the evaluation of measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 1 (see Appendix A)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 2.5 × institutional ULN, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 5 × institutional ULN if liver metastases are present&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × institutional ULN, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with serum creatinine&#xD;
                  levels above 1.5 × institutional ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have a tumor tissue sample available (formalin-fixed paraffin&#xD;
             embedded [FFPE] tissue block or unstained slides); may be newly obtained or obtained&#xD;
             within 6 months prior to enrollment (without systemic therapy given after the sample&#xD;
             was obtained). Participants without sufficient archival tissue may be enrolled&#xD;
             following successful completion of the pre-treatment tumor tissue biopsy. Tissue must&#xD;
             be a core needle biopsy, excisional, or incisional biopsy. Fine needle aspirates (FNA)&#xD;
             or malignant effusions are not adequate. Bone biopsies without a soft tissue component&#xD;
             are not adequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of nivolumab and ipilimumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For&#xD;
             this reason, women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to follow instructions&#xD;
             for acceptable contraception from the time of signing consent, and for 23 weeks after&#xD;
             their last dose of protocol-indicated treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she&#xD;
             should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this&#xD;
             protocol who are not azoospermic who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to&#xD;
             follow instructions for acceptable contraception from the time of signing consent, and&#xD;
             for 31 weeks after their last dose of protocol-indicated treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be able and willing to undergo a pre-treatment tumor tissue biopsy.&#xD;
             Participants must also be willing to undergo an on-treatment tumor tissue biopsy if&#xD;
             clinically feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements. All subjects must have&#xD;
             been tested for EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement prior to study entry, unless they&#xD;
             are known to have a KRAS mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2,&#xD;
             anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell&#xD;
             co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who received prior non-CNS directed palliative radiation therapy within 7&#xD;
             days of the date of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known untreated brain metastases should be excluded from this&#xD;
             clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop&#xD;
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic&#xD;
             and other adverse events. Subjects are eligible if CNS metastases are adequately&#xD;
             treated and subjects are neurologically returned to baseline (except for residual&#xD;
             signs or symptoms related to the CNS treatment) for at least 2 weeks prior to study&#xD;
             entry. Subjects must be either off corticosteroids, or on a stable or decreasing dose&#xD;
             of ≤10 mg daily prednisone (or equivalent) for at least 2 weeks prior to first study&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to ipilimumab or nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with previous malignancies are excluded unless a complete remission was&#xD;
             achieved at least 2 years prior to first treatment and no additional therapy is&#xD;
             required or anticipated to be required during the study period as judged by the&#xD;
             treating investigator. Exceptions include non-melanoma skin cancers, and in situ&#xD;
             cancers of any type (e.g. bladder, gastric, colon, cervical/dysplasia, melanoma, or&#xD;
             breast carcinoma in situ).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with any other active malignancy requiring concurrent intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with an active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with&#xD;
             type I diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement, skin&#xD;
             disorders (such as vitiligo, psoriasis, or alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment,&#xD;
             or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are&#xD;
             permitted to enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a condition requiring systemic treatment with corticosteroids of &gt;&#xD;
             10 mg daily prednisone (or equivalent), or subjects requiring other immunosuppressive&#xD;
             medications within 14 days of first treatment. Inhaled, topical, ophthalmologic, local&#xD;
             steroid injections, and adrenal replacement steroid &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone or&#xD;
             equivalent are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with interstitial lung disease that is symptomatic or may interfere with&#xD;
             the detection or management of suspected drug-related pulmonary toxicity in the&#xD;
             opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
             (HIV), or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known positive test for hepatitis B or C indicating acute or chronic&#xD;
             infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with ≥ Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ipilimumab and nivolumab are both&#xD;
             agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is&#xD;
             an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with ipilimumab or nivolumab, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with ipilimumab or nivolumab. A negative serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test is required prior to study entry.&#xD;
