      This study evaluates a health theory based mobile health behavioral intervention to reduce&#xD;
      blood pressure (BP) among hypertensive patients evaluated in a community Emergency Department&#xD;
      (ED) setting.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is the most important modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the&#xD;
      leading cause of mortality in the United States. African Americans have the highest&#xD;
      prevalence of hypertension of any race/ethnic group in the United States which largely&#xD;
      contributes to their increased burden of stroke compared to non-Hispanic whites. In addition,&#xD;
      uncontrolled hypertension is more common among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations&#xD;
      than their counterparts. To improve health equity, new approaches to hypertension treatment&#xD;
      focusing on health care systems and difficult-to-reach populations are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Emergency Department (ED) represents a missed opportunity to identify and treat&#xD;
      hypertension in difficult-to-reach populations. Currently, there are 136 million ED visits&#xD;
      per year and nearly all have at least one blood pressure measured and recorded. African&#xD;
      Americans and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients are disproportionally represented in&#xD;
      the ED patient population and both are increasing. In the age of electronic health records&#xD;
      and mobile health, the ED can feasibly become an integral partner in chronic disease&#xD;
      management by programming the electronic health record to identify hypertensive patients and&#xD;
      dispense a mobile health behavioral intervention. Facilitating ED follow up at primary care&#xD;
      clinics is a key feature of the proposed intervention. Thereby leveraging the strengths of&#xD;
      the ED and its large patient volume of uncontrolled, difficult-to-reach, hypertensive&#xD;
      patients, with the strengths of the primary care clinics, continuity of care is the key to&#xD;
      improving community wide utilization of health services and receipt of guideline concordant&#xD;
      medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study looks to determine which behavioral intervention components best contribute to a&#xD;
      reduction in systolic blood pressure at one year through a multi-component theory based&#xD;
      mobile health behavioral intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      We originally planned to enroll approximately 960 patients into the eligibility phase. From&#xD;
      this group, we estimate that 480 participants will report qualifying BPs and will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of the eight intervention arms. We anticipate 240 participants will fully&#xD;
      complete the 12 month, in person follow up visits. However, after accruing approximately 400&#xD;
      randomized participants, we noted lower than expected retention at 6 month visits. Therefore,&#xD;
      we adjusted the maximum total number of enrollments and randomizations upwards by 50% each.&#xD;
      The overall intention is to achieve approximately 240 protocol completers (attendees at&#xD;
      12-month visit). We will continue to monitor accrual and retention in order to achieve this&#xD;
      target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will fit a linear regression model with the outcome of SBP change&#xD;
      (baseline minus 12 months) and main effect-coded binary predictors of healthy behavior texts&#xD;
      (yes vs. no), prompted BP self-monitoring frequency (high vs. low), and primary care provider&#xD;
      visit scheduling and transportation (active vs. passive). Initial analyses will focus on the&#xD;
      main effects. Additional analyses will include all the two-way interactions of the three&#xD;
      intervention components (only considering interactions where at least one of the factors in&#xD;
      the interaction demonstrates a sufficiently large main effect).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main secondary analyses will use time-to event (Cox Proportional Hazards) and logistic&#xD;
      regression. For the endpoint of interest, (either time to first primary care visit, or the&#xD;
      binary variable indicating attendance at two or more primary care visits within 1 year of&#xD;
      randomization), the investigators will fit an adjusted regression model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extension Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reach Out Cognition which will extend Reach Out data collection past the current 12 months to&#xD;
      15 and 18 months. During Reach Out Cognition, we aim to assess novel approaches to mobile&#xD;
      health (mHealth) self-administered cognition and blood pressure (BP) measurements. These&#xD;
      approaches may include cognitive assessments via mobile applications (apps) and Web-based&#xD;
      surveys, and wireless BP measurements via Bluetooth-enabled blood pressure cuffs and apps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population for Reach Out Cognition will be drawn from Reach Out participants who&#xD;
      complete the Reach Out intervention and are defined as: participants who complete the&#xD;
      12-month outcome assessment. We anticipate about 240 participants will have completed Reach&#xD;
      Out's 12-month outcome assessment and will be eligible for Reach Out Cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to evaluate acceptability, feasibility and satisfaction.&#xD;
      The de-nominator is the number of Reach Out participants who complete the 12 month&#xD;
      assessments. Regarding feasibility, we will separately determine the feasibility by mHealth&#xD;
      measure (i.e. cognition vs. BP), phone type (i.e. smartphone vs. feature phone) and operating&#xD;
      system type (iOS vs. Android vs. Windows) as a continuous and dichotomous (&gt;50% completion of&#xD;
      each assessment type) measure. The satisfaction scale will be assessed for all participants.&#xD;
      Given the difference in procedures by phone type, we will compare satisfaction between the&#xD;
      smartphone and feature phone users using a Kruskal-Wallis test.&#xD;
