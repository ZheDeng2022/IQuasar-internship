    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Aerodentis System for&#xD;
      orthodontic tooth movement in an open label, two-arms, non-inferiority clinical study. This&#xD;
      open-label, two-arm study will follow 45 patients for up to fifteen months. Thirty&#xD;
      participants will wear the Aerodentis device, and fifteen participants will wear Invisalign,&#xD;
      a commonly used clear appliance. Patients will be assigned to participate in the treatment&#xD;
      group using the Aerodentis device at home for 10 hours daily or in the control group using&#xD;
      clear correctors for the duration of up to 15 months. Outcome assessments will be performed&#xD;
      every 4 weeks. Assessments will include tooth movement and quality of life assessments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Aerodentis system is intended for the treatment of tooth malocclusion and is treated by&#xD;
      applying force, over time, to teeth requiring alignment. Traditionally, the force has been&#xD;
      created by attaching brackets to the teeth and creating tension through the stretching of&#xD;
      flexible wire connected between the brackets. Alternatively, aligners are used for the&#xD;
      treatment of tooth malocclusion. In these devices, a series of mouthpieces are used, where&#xD;
      the force created by each mouthpiece on the treated teeth is designed to push the teeth in&#xD;
      small, one step increments, toward the desired result.The Aerodentis system is comprised of a&#xD;
      plastic mouthpiece containing an inflatable balloon that provides pressure (force) on the&#xD;
      selected teeth designated to be moved to a final treated state. The inflatable balloon is&#xD;
      inflated to the desired pressure using an electrical air pump unit that is programmed by the&#xD;
      dental practitioner using Dror Orthodesign proprietary software; thus creating a course&#xD;
      treatment specially designed for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A participant is required to wear the Aerodentis device or conventional clear correctors.&#xD;
      Initial photos of participants will be reviewed to establish a pool of eligible potential&#xD;
      participants. Then participants will be randomly selected for one of the two groups. Those&#xD;
      wearing the Aerodentis device will be asked to answer a quality of life questionnaire.&#xD;
      Follow-up assessments will be conducted every 4 weeks for both Aerodentis participants and&#xD;
      clear corrector participants. During these assessment's we will look at movement of teeth,&#xD;
      any side effects or discomfort the individual may be facing, patient assessment of whether&#xD;
      the Aerodentis device is used regularly. Both intraoral and extraoral photos will be taken of&#xD;
      patients, during certain time points of the study, as requested by PI or sponsor. If a&#xD;
      participant enters and completes the entire study, then that individual will be in the study&#xD;
      for up to 15 months.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Movement was recorded by capturing the start and end point of the 6 anterior teeth before and at the completion of the treatment respectively. Changes was compared and assessed. The duration of the treatment was an average of 10 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The Litter's Index of Displacement score is the primary clinical endpoint used to judge patient success. Tooth alignment is assessed by Litter's Index of Displacement. It is performed at the five contact points for the teeth located in lower 1's through 3's. This index is the sum of the numbers recorded at each of the 5 points which are in millimeters.&#xD;
Subjects were followed for a total of up to 15 months or until achieving a Little's index of &lt;1.5, whichever came first. The Litter's Index was performed at the baseline and the end-point of the study.&#xD;
Data was analyzed by comparing the Baseline Little's Index with statistical analysis between investigational and control groups, and the Final Little's Index between investigational and control groups. Comparison of change in Little's Index from baseline to final was also done between investigational and control groups.&#xD;
A negative change in from baseline to the end-point represent a decrease in the degree of anterior irregularity.</description>

        <title>Litter's Index (Change in Little's Index Mean Total Score From Baseline)</title>
        <description>The Litter's Index of Displacement score is the primary clinical endpoint used to judge patient success. Tooth alignment is assessed by Litter's Index of Displacement. It is performed at the five contact points for the teeth located in lower 1's through 3's. This index is the sum of the numbers recorded at each of the 5 points which are in millimeters.&#xD;
Subjects were followed for a total of up to 15 months or until achieving a Little's index of &lt;1.5, whichever came first. The Litter's Index was performed at the baseline and the end-point of the study.&#xD;
Data was analyzed by comparing the Baseline Little's Index with statistical analysis between investigational and control groups, and the Final Little's Index between investigational and control groups. Comparison of change in Little's Index from baseline to final was also done between investigational and control groups.&#xD;
A negative change in from baseline to the end-point represent a decrease in the degree of anterior irregularity.</description>
        <time_frame>Movement was recorded by capturing the start and end point of the 6 anterior teeth before and at the completion of the treatment respectively. Changes was compared and assessed. The duration of the treatment was an average of 10 months.</time_frame>

            <title>Aerodentis System</title>
            <description>30 patients was systematically assigned to the treatment group (wearing Aerodentis Device).&#xD;
Aerodentis system: The Aerodentis system is intended for the treatment of tooth malocclusion and is treated by applying force, over time, to teeth requiring alignment. It is an individually-fitted, plastic dental mouthpiece that is inserted and worn by the patient according to the dental practitioner's treatment plan. The Aerodentis system is comprised of a plastic mouthpiece containing an inflatable balloon that provides pressure (force) on the selected teeth designated to be moved to a final treated state. The inflatable balloon is inflated to the desired pressure using an electrical air pump unit that is programmed by the dental practitioner using Dror Orthodesign proprietary software; thus creating a course treatment specially designed for each patient.</description>

Invisalign clear aligner system: Clear aligners are used for the treatment of tooth malocclusion. In these devices, a series of mouthpieces are used, where the force created by each mouthpiece on the treated teeth is designed to push the teeth in small, one step increments, toward the desired result.</description>
