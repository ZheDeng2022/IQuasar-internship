  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A significant proportion of patients who undergo liver surgery to remove bowel cancer that&#xD;
      has spread to the liver (metastases) develop disease recurrence and die from the disease. A&#xD;
      previous small study (the EMT study) suggested a possible survival benefit in patients who&#xD;
      took the naturally-occurring omega-3 fatty acid EPA (a fish oil supplement) before liver&#xD;
      surgery. The EMT2 study is a larger study which will recruit 448 men and women with liver&#xD;
      metastases from bowel cancer. Trial participants will receive either Icosapent Ethyl (pure&#xD;
      EPA derived from fish oil) or placebo (dummy capsules). EMT2 will investigate whether&#xD;
      patients who take this supplement before liver surgery and for up to four years after&#xD;
      surgery, remain free of recurrence for longer than those who take placebo (dummy capsules)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite significant advances in diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC), it&#xD;
      remains the second most common cause of cancer-related death in the UK. The majority of&#xD;
      deaths from CRC are related to distant metastasis, predominantly to the liver. Overall 5-year&#xD;
      survival following liver resection and adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer liver&#xD;
      metastases (CRCLM) is, at best, 40-60%. Despite surgery with curative intent, up to 60% of&#xD;
      patients develop recurrence within 2 years of surgery. The preliminary EMT study was a Phase&#xD;
      II RCT of EPA 2 g daily in patients (n=88) undergoing liver resection surgery for CRCLM.&#xD;
      Although there was no difference in the primary endpoint (tumour proliferation index),&#xD;
      metastases from the EPA arm had a lower vascularity score (suggesting possible&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic activity) than placebo-treated tumours. Although EPA (or placebo) treatment&#xD;
      was limited to the pre-operative period, overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival&#xD;
      (DFS) were specified as exploratory end-points on the basis that oral dosing with EPA before&#xD;
      liver surgery would provide tissue EPA exposure in the immediate peri-operative period with&#xD;
      prolonged bioavailability in the post-operative period due to the slow tissue 'washout'&#xD;
      kinetics of EPA. Survival analysis demonstrated that the median DFS in the EPA group was 22.6&#xD;
      months compared with 14.7 months in the placebo group. Any DFS benefit was explained by a&#xD;
      reduction in CRC recurrence from 12 months after surgery onwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EMT2 study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, phase III&#xD;
      trial of the omega-3 fatty acid (O3FA) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) as the ethyl ester&#xD;
      (icosapent ethyl [IPE; Vascepa®]) in patients undergoing liver resection surgery for&#xD;
      colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRCLM) with curative intent designed to determine whether&#xD;
      EPA treatment improves Progression-Free Survival (PFS). A key secondary objective is overall&#xD;
      survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will recruit adult individuals listed for CRCLM resection with curative intent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be 1:1 to receive either IPE capsules or placebo capsules. 4 capsules per&#xD;
      day containing IPE (equivalent to 4 g EPA-ethyl ester [EE] daily) or 4 placebo capsules per&#xD;
      day. Participants will start treatment a prior to CRCLM surgery and will continue to receive&#xD;
      treatment for a minimum of 2 years and a maximum of 4 years post-liver resection.&#xD;
      Participants are followed up for 60 days beyond the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are clinically assessed 6 months post-operatively (from liver resection) and at&#xD;
      6-monthly intervals thereafter for disease progression/recurrence.&#xD;
