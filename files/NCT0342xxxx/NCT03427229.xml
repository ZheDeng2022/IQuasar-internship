  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is acknowledged as a highly effective treatment for&#xD;
      recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Usually single fecal infusion achieves&#xD;
      satisfactory cure rates of recurrent CDI). However, several retrospective studies show that&#xD;
      severe clinical picture of recurrent CDI is a risk factor for the failure of single-infusion&#xD;
      FMT, suggesting that multiple fecal infusions are required to cure this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label randomized clinical trial aiming to assess if multiple-infusion FMT is&#xD;
      more effective than single-infusion FMT in curing severe CDI&#xD;

      Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is acknowledged as a highly effective treatment for&#xD;
      recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Usually single fecal infusion achieves&#xD;
      satisfactory cure rates of recurrent CDI). However, several retrospective studies show that&#xD;
      severe clinical picture of recurrent CDI is a risk factor for the failure of single-infusion&#xD;
      FMT, suggesting that multiple fecal infusions are required to cure this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label randomized clinical trial aiming to assess if multiple-infusion FMT is&#xD;
      more effective than single-infusion FMT in curing severe CDI&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' study is an open-label randomized controlled trial, enrolling patients&#xD;
      with recurrent and refractory C. difficile infection with a severe clinical picture of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At enrollment, C. difficile infection is defined as diarrhoea (at least 3 loose or watery&#xD;
      stools per day for 2 or more consecutive days, or at least 8 loose stools in 48 hours) and&#xD;
      positivity in the C. difficile toxin stool test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrent C. difficile infection is meant as the reappearance of clinical symptoms and&#xD;
      positivity of C. difficile toxin test within 8 weeks after the end of the previous therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Refractory CDI is defined as CDI unresponsive to the antimicrobial treatment, namely&#xD;
      persistence of diarrhoea with CD toxin positive or persistent diarrhoea with toxin negative&#xD;
      in the absence of other possible causes of diarrhoea (e.g. IBS, IBD, non-CDI&#xD;
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea) Severe CDI is defined, according to the latest ESCMID&#xD;
      guidelines, as: Episode of CDI with one or more specific clinical (fever, haemodynamic&#xD;
      instability, respiratory failure which needs mechanical ventilation, signs and symptoms of&#xD;
      peritonitis, signs and symptoms of colonic ileus), laboratory (marked leukocytosis, rise in&#xD;
      serum creatinine and lactate, marked decrease of serum albumin), radiological (colon&#xD;
      distension, colonic wall thickening) or endoscopic (pseudomembranous colitis), symptoms and&#xD;
      signs of severe colitis or complicated course of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' stool are screened for detection of parasites and enteric bacterial pathogens to&#xD;
      exclude other infective pathogens. Patients with former colectomy, inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      diseases (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), viral hepatitis, AIDS or syphilis will be&#xD;
      excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are instructed and invited to signal recurrent symptoms and diarrhea after&#xD;
      treatment. Monthly clinical and lab checks are performed for a period of 2 months after the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients start therapy with vancomycin for 3 days before of stratification, with random&#xD;
      allocation (1 to 1, through statistical software) to one of the two treatment schemes: 1)&#xD;
      single-infusion FMT by colonoscopy, with the infusion in the cecum - through the biopsy&#xD;
      channel - of 60-120 gr (depending on production) of donated feces, obtained from the donor&#xD;
      within 6 hours from transplantation, and manually homogenized in 100/200 ml of physiological&#xD;
      solution; colonoscopy will be performed by an expert endoscopist; preparation for colonoscopy&#xD;
      (four liters of a solution with saline laxatives) will be provided 2) multiple-infusion FMT&#xD;
      (with the same protocol of the other arm, but with repeated fecal infusions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patient will be instructed on hygiene rules to be followed at the patient's domicile to&#xD;
      avoid re-infections at home. Stool donors will be selected following recommendations from the&#xD;
      European FMT Working Group Consensus Conference.&#xD;
