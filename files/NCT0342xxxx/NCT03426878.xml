  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CHARM (Cancer Health Assessment Reaching Many) study will assess the utility of clinical&#xD;
      exome sequencing and how it affects care in diverse populations. The study population&#xD;
      includes adults at risk for hereditary cancer syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to implement a hereditary cancer risk assessment program in healthy&#xD;
      18-49 year-olds in primary care settings within a vertically integrated health delivery&#xD;
      system (Kaiser Permanente) and a federal qualified health center (Denver Health). The&#xD;
      investigators will assess clinical exome sequencing implementation and interpretation, as&#xD;
      well as tailored interactions for low health literacy including a contextualized consent&#xD;
      process, and a modified approach to results disclosure and genetic counseling. The&#xD;
      investigators will also assess the clinical utility (healthcare utilization and adherence to&#xD;
      recommended care) and personal utility of primary and additional results from clinical exome&#xD;
      sequencing, and evaluate the ethical and policy implications of considering personal utility&#xD;
      of genomic information decisions for health care coverage.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1. Implement a hereditary cancer risk-assessment program in healthy 18-49-year-old adults&#xD;
      in primary care settings, with stakeholder input, and offer exome sequencing to clarify risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1A. Identify and recruit 880 adult participants at-risk of a hereditary cancer syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1B: Generate medical exome sequence data and interpret variants. Aim 1C: Disclose&#xD;
      findings from medical exome sequencing, incorporate results into the electronic medical&#xD;
      record (EMR), and facilitate downstream patient management and coordination of care with the&#xD;
      provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1D. Engage stakeholders to tailor and optimize the program in diverse populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Evaluate and tailor for diverse populations the critical interactions in the program,&#xD;
      including the consent process, choices for reporting additional findings, and the response to&#xD;
      results disclosure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2A. Design, implement, and assess a contextualized consent process to support informed&#xD;
      decision-making about participation in research about medical exome sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2B. Design, implement, and compare a novel decision aid in the second half of the study&#xD;
      for selecting the optional categories of additional findings with the approach we developed&#xD;
      in CSER1 that offered a category checklist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2C. Design, implement, and compare a modified (communication-focused) approach to results&#xD;
      disclosure, genetic counseling, and decision making with a standard (information-focused)&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Evaluate the clinical utility (including personal utility) of using exome sequencing&#xD;
      to diagnose individuals with hereditary cancer syndromes and provide additional findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3A: Measure the yield of reportable findings for hereditary cancer syndromes and&#xD;
      additional findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3B: Evaluate subsequent healthcare utilization for all study participants and adherence&#xD;
      to recommended care among individuals who are identified with a hereditary cancer syndrome in&#xD;
      diverse settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3C. Assess the personal utility of exome sequencing, including primary and additional&#xD;
      findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4. Address pragmatic and ethical challenges to the integration of genomic medicine into&#xD;
      clinical and health systems decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4A: Develop and pilot a system that integrates genomic, clinical, and healthcare&#xD;
      utilization data to inform clinicians and patients acting on genomic information and to&#xD;
      reduce care gaps in patient management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4B: Advance the analysis of the ethical and policy implications of incorporating personal&#xD;
      utility of genomic information into the decision framework for healthcare coverage.&#xD;
