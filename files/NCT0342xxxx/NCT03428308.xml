  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Denmark, around 2 % of the population live with severe mental disease. People with severe&#xD;
      mental disease live 15-20 years less than the general population. The majority of the years&#xD;
      of life lost are a consequence of the excess mortality due to somatic disease. The high&#xD;
      prevalence of somatic disease among people with severe mental disease can be largely&#xD;
      attributed to physical inactivity, unhealthy diet and side effects from psychopharmacological&#xD;
      drugs. Apart from the impacts of unhealthy lifestyle and medication side effects, research&#xD;
      suggests that individuals with severe mental disease do not receive the same treatment for&#xD;
      their somatic diseases as do the rest of the population. The inequality in diagnostics and&#xD;
      treatment can be attributed to stigmatization from healthcare providers and patients' lacking&#xD;
      awareness of symptoms and reluctance to seek medical care. Further, the increasing&#xD;
      specialization within both somatic and psychiatric care has led to a division between these&#xD;
      two treatment systems (8,9). Patients with severe mental disease who simultaneously have one&#xD;
      or more somatic diseases need their treatment to be coordinated; such treatment should span&#xD;
      general practice, the municipality and the psychiatric and somatic hospital. Accordingly, the&#xD;
      following elements are necessary to create effective and coordinated treatment trajectories:&#xD;
      detailed preparation, qualitative process evaluation as an integrated part of the courses of&#xD;
      treatment, and involvement of all stakeholders from the start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of the project is to optimize the detection of selected chronic somatic&#xD;
      diseases, including cardiovascular disease (ischaemia and heart failure), diabetes,&#xD;
      hypertension and high cholesterol, in individuals with schizophrenia, schizoaffective&#xD;
      disorder or bipolar disorder; to initiate medical treatment; and to ensure treatment&#xD;
      compliance among patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, the project has the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop an intervention targeting individuals with schizophrenia, schizoaffective&#xD;
           disorder or bipolar disorder that can optimize the detection of selected chronic somatic&#xD;
           diseases, including cardiovascular disease (ischaemia and heart failure), diabetes,&#xD;
           hypertension and high cholesterol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test whether the developed intervention can optimize the detection of cardiovascular&#xD;
           disease (ischaemia and heart failure), diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol in&#xD;
           individuals with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project's hypotheses are that an interdisciplinary and intersectoral intervention&#xD;
      targeting individuals with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder can&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  optimize detection of cardiovascular diseases (ischaemia and cardiac insufficiency),&#xD;
           diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol by systematic screening in general practice&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  lead to initiation and maintenance of relevant medical treatment. Moreover, we&#xD;
           hypothesize that the complete intervention in a long-term perspective will lead to&#xD;
           decreased mortality within the target group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Design, materials and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is divided in two phases. In Phase 1 the project's intervention is developed; in&#xD;
      Phase 2 the intervention is tested. Phase 2 will be conducted as a feasibility study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on experience from previous studies, we know the target group can be difficult to&#xD;
      recruit and maintain in a course of treatment. We expect that 10-15 patients belonging to&#xD;
      each provider-number will meet the project's inclusion criteria. To obtain sufficient&#xD;
      patients for the project, we aim to include 20 general practitioners (individual&#xD;
      provider-numbers). Accordingly, it is realistic to assume that around 75 patients undergo&#xD;
      screening in general practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of general practitioners will be done by sending written information about&#xD;
      project participation and an invitation to participate. Only general practitioners who have&#xD;
      one or several practice nurse(s) will be invited. The written invitation will be followed by&#xD;
      a telephone call to all invitees to identify those practitioners wishing to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Development of intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of Phase 1 is to design an intervention based on the experiences and perspectives of&#xD;
      the involved stakeholders regarding how to optimize detection and treatment of somatic&#xD;
      disease among persons with severe mental disease. The project rests on the fundamental idea&#xD;
      that it is crucial to involve all relevant stakeholders as early as in the development phase&#xD;
      if the intervention is to be effective and feasible to implement in practice. This phase&#xD;
      includes 1) meetings with key stakeholders in the field, 2) observations and interviews&#xD;
      within the Mental Health Centre Copenhagen and Copenhagen Municipality, 3) multiple project&#xD;
      meetings involving all sectors in the project as well as on-going monitoring by the project&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Testing of the intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is divided in two parts: a screening intervention and a treatment&#xD;
      intervention. The testing of the interventions is conducted as a feasibility study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation is twofold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluation of the effect of the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluation of the implementation process&#xD;
