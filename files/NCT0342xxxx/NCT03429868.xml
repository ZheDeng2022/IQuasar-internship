  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) differs from other head and neck malignancies terms of its&#xD;
      epidemiology, pathology, and treatment outcome. Integrated PET/MRI is a new imaging modality,&#xD;
      which can simultaneous acquire PET and MRI images. Considering lack of reports in the use of&#xD;
      hybrid PET/MRI system in the prognosis prediction in NPC, we conduct this prospective study&#xD;
      to investigate on the roles of integrated PET/MRI parameters for predicting treatment outcome&#xD;
      and prognosis in patients with NPC.&#xD;

      1. Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has a higher local tumor control rate but a higher&#xD;
           incidence of distant metastasis compared with squamous cell carcinomas of other regions&#xD;
           of the head and neck. Thus, it's usually considered a distinct study group. A reliable&#xD;
           clinical prognostic factor for NPC patients is still lacking. Positron emission&#xD;
           tomography (PET) with 2- [fluorine- 18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG)/computed&#xD;
           tomography (CT) has been used extensively for diagnosis and assessment of prognosis in&#xD;
           NPC in recently years. Several PET-derived imaging parameters such as standardized&#xD;
           uptake value (SUV), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), or total lesion glycolysis (TLG) have&#xD;
           been proposed as potential prognosticators in NPC. MRI functional parameters also play a&#xD;
           role to assess the cellular or molecular change of had and neck cancer.&#xD;
           Diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) is a technique, which can quantify the diffusion of&#xD;
           water molecules in tissues using apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). ADC is inversely&#xD;
           correlated with cellular density. Dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion MR imaging&#xD;
           (DCE-MRI) is another MRI technique that based on sequential imaging obtained during the&#xD;
           passage of a contrast of agent through the tissue. It enables probing the microvascular&#xD;
           environment in the tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Integrated PET/MRI is a new imaging modality, which can simultaneous acquire PET and MRI&#xD;
           images. Traditionally, PET and MRI images were acquired on different dates and were&#xD;
           fused by the commercial software. Problems caused by a separate system include SUV or&#xD;
           MRI parameters were reported to be different if the scans were acquired on different&#xD;
           days. Simultaneous acquisition of PET and MRI images would solve these problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aim: We conduct this prospective study to investigate on the roles of integrated PET/MRI&#xD;
           imaging parameters for predicting treatment outcome and prognosis in patients with NPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:All patients receive whole-body 18F-FDG PET/MRI following 18F-FDG-PET/CT on the same&#xD;
      day. For tumor staging, the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer&#xD;
      (AJCC)/Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) cancer staging system is used. Our&#xD;
      patients with stage I disease were treated with definitive radiation therapy alone, while&#xD;
      patients with stage II-IVB are treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Patients with&#xD;
      metastatic disease (stage IVC) are treated with standard platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18F-FDG PET/CT: All study patients fast for at least 6 h before 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging. Scans&#xD;
      are performed using a Biograph mCT scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions, Malvern, PA, USA)&#xD;
      consisting of a four-ring PET scanner (axial field-of-view [FOV] = 22.1 cm, transaxial FOV =&#xD;
      70 cm) and a 40-section CT scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole-body 18F-FDG PET/MRI: PET/MRI is performed on a Biograph mMR (Siemens Healthcare,&#xD;
      Erlangen, Germany) following the PET/CT scan on the same day. The PET/MRI system is equipped&#xD;
      with a 3-T magnetic field strength, total imaging matrix coil technology covering the entire&#xD;
      body with multiple integrated radiofrequency surface coils, and a fully functional PET system&#xD;
      with avalanche photodiode technology embedded in the magnetic resonance gantry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Image interpretation: The PET/CT and PET/MRI data sets are evaluated on dedicated&#xD;
      workstations (Syngo.via, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). The readers interpret the&#xD;
      (1) MR images from PET/MRI, (2) 18F-FDG PET/MRI images, and (3) 18F-FDG PET/CT images&#xD;
      independently. They are aware of the study protocol, but are blinded to the results from the&#xD;
      other imaging modalities. Imaging parameters including SUV, MTV, TLG, ADC, Ktrans, Ve, and Vp&#xD;
      are calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) serve as the&#xD;
      main outcome measures. OS is calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of death or&#xD;
      censor at the date of the last follow- up for surviving patients. RFS is defined as the time&#xD;
      between the end of treatment and the date of recurrence (tumor relapse or death) or censor at&#xD;
      the date of the last follow-up. The cutoff values for the clinical variables and imaging&#xD;
      parameters in survival analysis are determined using the log-rank test based on the RFS and&#xD;
      OS rates observed in the entire study cohort. Survival curves are plotted using the&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier method. The effect of each individual variable is initially evaluated using&#xD;
      univariate analysis. Cox regression models are used to identify the predictors of survivals.&#xD;
      Two-tailed P values &lt; 0.05 are considered statistically significant.&#xD;
