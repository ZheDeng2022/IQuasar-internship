  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ICU patients are at risk for catheter associated urinary tract infection. Frequently patients&#xD;
      can't tell clinicians if they need to void if the catheter is removed. If clinicians know&#xD;
      that an accurate volume measurement s of urine volume in the bladder can be obtained when the&#xD;
      catheter is removed, catheters could be removed earlier and more frequently and thus possibly&#xD;
      avoid an infection. For this study, measures with ultrasound (directly visualizing the&#xD;
      bladder to measure), bladder scanner (partially blind measure with placement of scanner over&#xD;
      the expected bladder location on the skin) and urine catheterized volume will be obtained.&#xD;
      The investigators also want to know if the technology is user dependent. The study will&#xD;
      include 2 levels of nurses RN and advanced practice RN (APRN) perform the bladder scanner. An&#xD;
      APRN and MD will conduct the ultrasound. Ultrasound is technology primarily used by&#xD;
      physicians but APRNs are using the technology technology more frequently. After these 4&#xD;
      measurements, the patient's nurse will perform an intermittent straight catheterization&#xD;
      (catheter inserted, urine drained, and catheter removed) as the gold standard comparison.&#xD;

      The purpose of this correlational descriptive study is to compare measured bladder volumes&#xD;
      with a bladder scanner (Verathon Prime), 3D ultrasound (Sono-Site II) and straight&#xD;
      catheterization in ICU patients with low urine output receiving dialysis and in ICU patients&#xD;
      unable to void.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon consent of patient or LAR, patient's age, gender and BMI with the assigned study code&#xD;
      number will be recorded on enrollment log. Study code number, patient initials and unit will&#xD;
      be written on bedside data collection sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence of 4 non-invasive (1-4) measurement will vary from day to day (see below)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. MD performs bladder ultrasound and records volume on data collection sheet and places in&#xD;
           envelope&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. APRN performs bladder scanner and records volume on data collection sheet and places in&#xD;
           envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. APRN performs bladder ultrasound and records volume on data collection sheet and places&#xD;
           in envelope&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Bedside RN performs bladder scanner and records volume on data collection sheet and&#xD;
           places in envelope&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The study team will record the data from the straight catheterization that is performed&#xD;
           as part of clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. APRN or research nurse will retrieve catheterization urine volume measurement from RN or&#xD;
           from chart and record on data collection sheet&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each enrolled patient will have these 4 measurements performed only on one day. Each&#xD;
      clinician research team member will record their result on a data collection form with the&#xD;
      study number, patient initials, day of week, clinician initials, observation of abdominal&#xD;
      fluid, and comment section for any other observations. The clinician research team member&#xD;
      will place the completed form for their measurement in an envelope with the study number on&#xD;
      the outside while the next clinician is in the room obtaining the next measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection is complete after catheter volume is recorded.&#xD;
