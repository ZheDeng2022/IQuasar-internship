      Mayo Clinic's Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Model System Center (TBIMSC) will capitalize on&#xD;
      longstanding collaborations with the non-profit Minnesota Brain Injury Alliance (MN BIA) and&#xD;
      Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) to test a new way of delivering medical and social&#xD;
      services. This trial will address chronic unmet needs expressed by individuals with TBI and&#xD;
      their families in the U.S. pertaining to the ineffective connection to specialized medical&#xD;
      and community resources in the transition from hospital to community-based care, limited&#xD;
      access to TBI experts, and lack of primary care provider (PCP) knowledge about the complex&#xD;
      needs of individuals with TBI. Target populations for this study are: 1) individuals with TBI&#xD;
      eligible for MN BIA provided Resource Facilitation (RF), 2) their families, and 3) their&#xD;
      PCPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial will use a theory-driven complex behavioral intervention that integrates&#xD;
      the medical-rehabilitation, therapy, and TBI expertise of Mayo's Brain Rehabilitation Clinic&#xD;
      (BRC) with MN BIA's highly developed RF program (a free two-year telephone support service&#xD;
      offering assistance in navigating life after brain injury). Mayo Clinic's&#xD;
      medical-rehabilitation expertise will be integrated with RF services to deliver direct&#xD;
      clinical care remotely using telemedicine and other information and communication technology&#xD;
      to test whether outcomes over time are better in a group receiving this model of care&#xD;
      compared to a group that receives usual care in their communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Costs between usual care and intervention groups will be compared in collaboration with the&#xD;
      MDH. The overarching goal is development of a replicable, sustainable, and cost effective&#xD;
      model of telemedicine care that integrates TBIMS Centers and BIAs nationwide and builds TBI&#xD;
      expertise and capacity among PCPs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This Integrated Medical and Resource Facilitation Intervention (MRFI) trial will address: 1)&#xD;
      The ineffective connection of individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and their&#xD;
      families to specialized medical and community resources after hospital-based care; 2) Limited&#xD;
      access to TBI experts, and; 3) A lack of knowledge by primary care providers (PCP) about the&#xD;
      complex needs of individuals with TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial will test a theory-driven complex behavioral intervention that integrates&#xD;
      the medical and TBI expertise of Mayo's Brain Rehabilitation Clinic (BRC) with Minnesota&#xD;
      Brain Injury Alliance's (MN BIA) highly developed Resource Facilitation (RF) program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target populations for the proposed study are: 1) Individuals with TBI eligible for MN&#xD;
      BIA RF services; 2) Their families or caregivers; and 3) Their PCPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research uses a community-based pragmatic clinical trial (PCT) to test a complex&#xD;
      behavioral intervention. A PCT: 1) Compares multiple clinically relevant interventions rather&#xD;
      than comparing an intervention of interest against a placebo or control condition; 2)&#xD;
      Includes a heterogeneous population of participants in multiple experimental settings as&#xD;
      opposed to a narrowly controlled homogeneous sample in practice settings of a single kind;&#xD;
      and 3) Measures a broad range of health care outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active elements in the proposed trial define a 'complex behavioral intervention'. The&#xD;
      intervention's integrated MRFI model of care consists of: multiple components within the&#xD;
      experimental and control interventions that interact; multiple and complex behaviors&#xD;
      associated with those delivering and receiving the intervention; multiple target populations;&#xD;
      multiple outcome measurements; and, adapting the intervention based on need and context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At trial's end, the investigators will estimate the difference in the use of health care&#xD;
      resources between individuals with TBI who receive the intervention versus those who receive&#xD;
      usual care, by completing a cost-effectiveness analysis. True success of a clinical&#xD;
      intervention is achieved when its benefits are realized at a similar or diminished cost&#xD;
      compared to an alternative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims Specific Aim 1: To assess the effectiveness of a medical/RF intervention&#xD;
      provided remotely in improving participation outcomes of individuals with TBI when compared&#xD;
      to a similar group receiving usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Participants receiving the trial intervention will show greater improvement in&#xD;
      participation outcomes when compared to those receiving usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To test for the differences in caregiver burden and quality of life in the&#xD;
      families of individuals with TBI involved in each arm of this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: The family members of individuals with TBI receiving the trial intervention&#xD;
      will report lower caregiver burden and higher quality of life when compared to family members&#xD;
      of individuals with TBI receiving usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To measure differences in efficacy and mastery among PCPs in caring for&#xD;
      individuals with TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: PCPs for individuals with TBI receiving the trial intervention will report&#xD;
      higher self-efficacy and mastery, when compared to providers for individuals with TBI&#xD;
      receiving usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4: To compare the cost-effectiveness of the integrated service intervention arm&#xD;
      of the trial with the usual care arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4: Cost-effectiveness will be the same or less overall for individuals with TBI&#xD;
      receiving the trial intervention when adjusted for covariates compared to those individuals&#xD;
      receiving usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Sample Minnesota has statutory authority to identify individuals discharged from&#xD;
      hospitals with TBI for epidemiological surveillance and to connect them with the MN BIA to&#xD;
      offer RF. During subsequent RF intake, the recruitment and consent process will commence with&#xD;
      RF staff introducing the study. A list of interested individuals will be securely submitted&#xD;
      to the Mayo Research Coordinator; these individuals will then be contacted for consent and&#xD;
      randomized. If the individual with TBI is unable to consent based on a cognitive screen,&#xD;
      their legal representative will be approached. Participants will not be required to have a&#xD;
      family member or PCP enrolled to be eligible for the study, but will be strongly encouraged&#xD;
      to involve both. A consented participant's family and PCP will be contacted for consent as&#xD;
      research participants. They will be assigned to the same group as the individual with TBI.&#xD;
      Randomization to ensure representation of known prognostic factors where age (â‰¤65 and &gt;65),&#xD;
      gender, and residence (rural or urban) will be used as stratification factors, with treatment&#xD;
      assignment balanced in blocks of 4. Because a simple random scheme may limit enrollment of&#xD;
      rural participants the investigators will over-sample in a ratio of 2:1 rural/urban.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Power Calculations For Specific Aim 1, a sample size of 500 individuals is&#xD;
      considered desirable based on power calculations as described. By achieving this sample size&#xD;
      a minimum difference of at least 0.25 standard deviations can be detected between groups for&#xD;
      each continuous outcome of interest, with 80% power based on a two-sample t-test. In 2014,&#xD;
      3,868 people 15 years old or older were hospitalized with TBI in MN and 1,108 people with TBI&#xD;
      received RF in MN in 2016. The investigators plan a 24-month enrollment period, so 2,216&#xD;
      individuals with TBI will be potentially eligible. The minimum detectable difference between&#xD;
      the groups based on a two sample t-test will be 0.25 standard deviations. The sample size of&#xD;
      250 per group will have 80% power to detect a correlation of 0.18 or larger between any two&#xD;
      continuous outcomes within the group. For an assessment of associations between group and&#xD;
      other categorical variables, there would exist 80% power to detect a difference of 11% or&#xD;
      larger for the presence of a categorical outcome (15% among participant with usual care&#xD;
      versus 25% among participants receiving the study intervention) based on a Chi-square test of&#xD;
      two proportions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention All intervention components will be delivered remotely: there will be no&#xD;
      face-to-face interaction with the research participants. The complex intervention being&#xD;
      tested is comprised of the clinical, educational, and supportive services of the Mayo BRC&#xD;
      integrated with the MN BIA RF program. The specific ICT modes used to interact with&#xD;
      intervention participants, and the specific clinical services that are provided by these&#xD;
      modes, will be determined by clinical need, individual preference, and technological&#xD;
      capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with TBI, their family members and PCPs assigned to the usual care group will&#xD;
      receive care and provide services as usual in their communities. Individuals with TBI&#xD;
      assigned to the usual care group will receive RF as routinely provided by MN BIA. For&#xD;
      individuals with TBI, their families and PCPs assigned to the intervention group, their&#xD;
      health, social, community, education, support, resource, and care coordination needs will be&#xD;
      assessed. Individuals with TBI assigned to the intervention group will receive RF as&#xD;
      integrated into the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every intervention group participant in all target populations will receive a unique&#xD;
      combination of services. It is expected that the composition of each participant's integrated&#xD;
      team will vary based on individual needs, preferences, and technological capacity. Ideally,&#xD;
      all teams will include a PCP. If a PCP is not already established, the Advanced Practice&#xD;
      Registered Nurse will help facilitate this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRFI intervention expands on a previously established web-based platform and other ICT,&#xD;
      incorporating synchronous direct clinical care (telemedicine). Other synchronous and&#xD;
      asynchronous intervention will be delivered as needs indicate. Participants will use their&#xD;
      own devices and internet access for any and all interactions with Mayo Clinic providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Data for continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics.&#xD;
      Frequencies and percentages will be calculated for categorical variables. Baseline&#xD;
      characteristics and demographic variables will be compared using two sample t-test or&#xD;
      Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables and using Chi-square test or Fisher's exact&#xD;
      test for categorical variables of interest. Associations between continuous variables within&#xD;
      each group will be estimated using Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficient. Comparison of&#xD;
      correlations across the groups of interests will be performed using the Fisher's r-to-z&#xD;
      transformation, which calculates a value of z that can be applied to assess the significance&#xD;
      of the difference between two correlation coefficients. All the statistical tests will be&#xD;
      2-sided with an alpha level of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis for Specific Aim 1 For each individual outcome measure the investigators&#xD;
      will first compute percent change from baseline to last follow-up measurement to account for&#xD;
      baseline measurements. Further analysis will be performed using these percent changes.&#xD;
      However, analyzing effectiveness using each individual measure will not provide a single&#xD;
      p-value to measure the intervention's overall effect on participation outcomes. Therefore,&#xD;
      the investigators will perform the analysis using a composite endpoint that will allow us to&#xD;
      assess the global impact of the intervention using single comparisons performed as two sample&#xD;
      t-tests or a Wilcoxon rank sum test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses will be performed on an intent-to-treat basis. If there are any baseline&#xD;
      covariate imbalances between the groups, the investigators will perform linear regression&#xD;
      analyses, where summed ranks for each individual will be an outcome of interest and the&#xD;
      primary predictor variable will be group, adjusting for those covariates that had imbalances&#xD;
      among the groups at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis for Specific Aims 2 and 3 The primary goal of these Aims is to measure&#xD;
      caregiver burden and family needs, and efficacy and clinical mastery in PCPs. Percent change&#xD;
      from baseline will be reported as mean and standard deviation or median as appropriate.&#xD;
      Comparisons of percents between the groups assigned to intervention versus usual care will be&#xD;
      performed using two sample t-tests or Wilcoxon rank sum test as appropriate. If there is&#xD;
      imbalance in any baseline covariates of interest, analysis will be performed using linear&#xD;
      regression adjusting for those covariates of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis for Specific Aim 4 In order to assess the cost-effectiveness of the&#xD;
      proposed intervention, the trial patients will be linked to the Minnesota All Payers Claims&#xD;
      Database (MN-APCD) developed and maintained by MDH. Both healthcare utilization and cost&#xD;
      outcomes will be compared between the participants in the intervention and usual care arms.&#xD;
      Adjustments will be made to account for different payment levels between governmental and&#xD;
      commercial payers. Descriptive statistics of these outcomes including mean, median, and&#xD;
      standard deviation will be provided. If any difference between the intervention and usual&#xD;
      care groups in terms of their baseline characteristics is observed, multivariate adjustments&#xD;
      will be conducted; due to expected skewness of underlying distribution, utilization outcomes&#xD;
      will be analyzed using count regression (e.g., negative binomial regression) while cost will&#xD;
      be analyzed using generalized linear modeling with gamma distribution for cost, and&#xD;
      logarithmic link. In order to meet the confidentiality terms of the data submitters to&#xD;
      MN-APCD, trial participants' records will be matched by applying the same MN algorithms to&#xD;
      generate the hashed identifiers used to link claims for the same person through the following&#xD;
      set of identifiers: name (first, middle, and last name), 5-digit zip code, age, gender, and&#xD;
      date of birth. To carry out this linkage and avoid the possibility of participant&#xD;
      re-identification, the creation of the analytic dataset from MN-APCD and subsequent analyses&#xD;
      will be conducted by the MDH staff. The match rate of the trial participants to the MN-APCD&#xD;
      will be reported.&#xD;
