  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In palliative care, the relief of the dyspnea is necessary. Medications for the reduction of&#xD;
      dyspnea have side effects. High-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC) is a new way to&#xD;
      deliver oxygen. Investigators hypothesize that HNFC is an acceptable technic for the patient&#xD;
      with dyspnea in palliative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study with 30 patients will be conducted. Acceptability of HNFC will be studied by&#xD;
      the time of use by patients of the HNFC during one week. The effectiveness of HNFC in&#xD;
      relieving dyspnea will be studied using Borg scale.&#xD;

      Pilot study for acceptability of high flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy in palliative care&#xD;
      Population: 30 patients in palliative care (for lung cancer, terminal respiratory failure)&#xD;
      who suffer from dyspnea and have oxygen therapy. Patients with curative care are excluded and&#xD;
      patients who require non invasive ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An oral consent is asked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: acceptability of HNFC in patients with dyspnea in palliative care during&#xD;
      one week&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tolerance of HNFC at short term (1h and 24h) and long term (7 days) after initiation of&#xD;
           HNFC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficiency of HNFC at short term&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: duration of use of the HNFC during 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tolerance: noise of the system of HNFC, side effects of high flow (nasal dryness..)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficiency: evaluation of dyspnea by Borg scale and measure of respiratory rate and&#xD;
           saturation of oxygen one hour after initiation of HNFC&#xD;

It will then be noted the stop time and recovery of the device for a week, which will know the time of use and acceptability. If the patient wishes to permanently stop the use of the device, the stop time will be raised.</description>
