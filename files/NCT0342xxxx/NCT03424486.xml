    <textblock>
      The Impact of cystic fibrosis (CF) on psychological and emotional functioning has been the&#xD;
      focus of several studies over the past 20 years. The results from a current meta-analysis&#xD;
      indicated that depressed patients were three times more likely to be noncompliant with&#xD;
      treatment recommendations than nondepressed patients with chronic illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, most studies of the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms have been limited by small&#xD;
      sample size; reliance on samples of convenience that are potentially biased in term of rates&#xD;
      of symptomatology, and measures that contain legitimate symptoms that are part of the&#xD;
      respondent's chronic disease. Estimating the prevalence of depression and anxiety has become&#xD;
      important as new evidence indicates that these symptoms may have a significant impact on&#xD;
      health outcomes, including adherence to medical treatments, utilization of health care&#xD;
      services, and rates of morbidity and mortality. More depressive the symptoms are associated&#xD;
      with poorer lung function, and that in the absence of depression, poor lung function is&#xD;
      minimally associated with lower patient ratings of quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the current study is to estimate the regional, and if possible the national&#xD;
      prevalence of depressive and anxious symptoms in children and adults with CF and parents&#xD;
      caregivers. Patients with CF ages 14 to 17, and parents of children ages 14 to 17, will&#xD;
      complete and depression/anxiety screening measure at a routine clinic visit. These will then&#xD;
      be linked with demographic and medical variables reported to the CF registry and analyzed&#xD;
      cross sectionally. Adults with CF ages 18 and older will also complete the depression /&#xD;
      anxiety screening measure at a routine clinic visit. Efforts will be made to recruit a&#xD;
      representative sample of patients from each clinic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies have demonstrated that patients with chronic illnesses are at increased risk&#xD;
      for depression and anxiety. In large, well-controlled epidemiological studies, rates of&#xD;
      depression in medical populations have ranged from 17% to 50% compared to 5% to 17.5% in&#xD;
      healthy populations. Reporting on a community-based sample, Wells and colleagues concluded&#xD;
      that individuals with a chronic medical condition have a 41% increase in the risk of having a&#xD;
      psychiatric disorder as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with chronic illnesses, depression and anxiety have been shown to have direct and&#xD;
      indirect consequences for health outcomes, and this has been addressed in a recent ATS/ERS&#xD;
      consensus statement on pulmonary rehabilitation. Depressed patients are less compliant with&#xD;
      medical regimens, less likely to follow dietary regimes, more likely to cancel or miss clinic&#xD;
      appointments, report worse functioning on several quality of life domains, have increased&#xD;
      health care utilization and higher health care costs, and are also more likely to engage in&#xD;
      risky behaviors, such as smoking, drinking and drug use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, studies of the impact of depression and anxiety in patients with CF have been&#xD;
      limited by small samples sizes, samples of convenience that may provide biased estimates of&#xD;
      symptom rates, and have used measures that confound symptoms of depression with those of a&#xD;
      chronic illness. Given the importance of identifying and treating these symptoms, and their&#xD;
      implications for long-term health outcomes, the current study proposes to conduct the first&#xD;
      national prevalence study of depression and anxiety in CF patients and parent caregivers.&#xD;
      Furthermore, we plan to examine the impact of these psychological symptoms on health&#xD;
      outcomes, such as pulmonary exacerbations and nutritional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Anxiety and Depression are common in Cystic Fibrosis, but their exact prevalence is&#xD;
           unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific Aim 1: To estimate the prevalence of depression and anxiety in patients with CF&#xD;
           ages 14 to 17 and parent caregivers of those adolescents&#xD;
&#xD;
           Of the few studies of school-age children and adolescents with CF, one reported a rate&#xD;
           of depression ranging from 11% to 14.5% in contrast to a rate of 2-6% in the general&#xD;
           pediatric population. Published rates of anxiety have ranged from 5% to 9% which may&#xD;
           approximate that of the general childhood population. Furthermore, the rate of&#xD;
           depression in parent caregivers is also high compared to parents of healthy children. In&#xD;
           a multi-site adherence intervention trial of 88 parents of young children with CF, ages&#xD;
           1 to 11, 29% of parents scored in the clinical range on a depression screening tool.&#xD;
           This is similar to a study of role strain in parents of young children with CF, in which&#xD;
           36.4% of the mothers' depressive symptoms fell within the clinical range. Furthermore,&#xD;
           even higher rates of depression were reported in a study of parents soon after the&#xD;
           diagnosis, with 64% of mothers and 43% of fathers scoring in the clinical range.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Previous estimates of the prevalence of depression and anxiety in patients with CF have&#xD;
           been hampered by serious methodological limitations, such as small sample size,&#xD;
           convenience sampling that is potentially biased, and the use of diagnostic screening&#xD;
           instruments that attribute somatic symptoms to a depressive disorder which may be due to&#xD;
           having a chronic illness like CF (e.g., fatigue). Furthermore, studies of depression and&#xD;
           anxiety in pediatric CF populations have not considered developmental and gender&#xD;
           differences in depression that emerge in the general population during adolescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identifying patients and parents at risk for depression and anxiety disorders is&#xD;
           important, but risk factors in the CF population are not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific Aim 2: To identify risk factors associated with symptoms of depression and&#xD;
           anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study was cross-sectional, making it impossible for the authors to distinguish&#xD;
           whether psychological symptoms preceded or followed patients' employment status, or how&#xD;
           either of these might have been related to changes in health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Anxiety and depression probably lead to worse clinical outcomes in CF, but this has not&#xD;
           been evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To evaluate how depression and anxiety influence health outcomes&#xD;
      (particularly number of exacerbations and hospitalizations, FEV1 and nutritional measures)&#xD;
      over the ensuing year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is wide variability in the progression of disease in patients with CF, as reflected in&#xD;
      the distribution of age at diagnosis, age-related pulmonary function, and age at death&#xD;
      (Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry, 2004). This variability is partially explained&#xD;
      by CFTR mutation and gene modifiers, but environmental and sociodemographic factors, and&#xD;
      variations in the use of various healthcare interventions are of equal or greater importance&#xD;
      in explaining this variability in health outcomes.&#xD;
