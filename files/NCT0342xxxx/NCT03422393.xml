  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate whether the combination of venetoclax and&#xD;
      ibrutinib (administered up to 840 mg per day) might be useful for the treatment of CLL or SLL&#xD;
      that is not responding or no longer responding to treatment with ibrutinib alone. The study&#xD;
      will evaluate whether this regimen can reduce the amount of cancerous cells in your body. If&#xD;
      you agree, you will receive ibrutinib at a dose of up to 840 mg a day by mouth, as well as&#xD;
      venetoclax. Although both of these agents are approved by the FDA for the treatment of CLL or&#xD;
      SLL, the combination and the dosing schedule of ibrutinib are considered experimental.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is phase 1 study for patients with CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) experiencing&#xD;
      disease progression on single ibrutinib. This study will evaluate the optimal ibrutinib dose&#xD;
      (including doses higher than 420 mg) when combined with venetoclax&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening period, patients will continue on ibrutinib at their previous tolerated&#xD;
      dose, unless required to stop (e.g.: by a preceding clinical trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On cycle 1, day 1, the dose of ibrutinib will be assigned based on the dose cohort. Patients&#xD;
      in cohort 1 will receive ibrutinib 420 mg PO daily. Patients in cohort 2 will receive&#xD;
      ibrutinib 560 mg PO daily. Cohort 3 will be 840 mg PO daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On cycle 1, day 1, patients will initiate venetoclax. The dose of venetoclax will ramp-up&#xD;
      from 20 mg PO daily to 400 mg PO daily over a 5 week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary safety endpoint is determination of DLTs during the first 35 days (completion of&#xD;
      dose ramp up). The primary efficacy endpoint of overall response rate will be assessed on&#xD;
      approximately Cycle 7, Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: The optimal management of patients that progress on ibrutinib, including those&#xD;
      with acquired Btk or PLCg2 mutations, is not determined. In other cancers, continued&#xD;
      treatment with small molecule inhibitors beyond disease progression provides significant&#xD;
      benefit, with additional agents or adjustments to ablate the resistant subclone. Venetoclax&#xD;
      is approved for the treatment of patients with CLL, and is well-tolerated and effective in&#xD;
      high-risk disease, and so is an appropriate agent for this trial.&#xD;
