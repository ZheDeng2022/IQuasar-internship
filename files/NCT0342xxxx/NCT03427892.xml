    <textblock>
      We will conduct an 8-week, non-randomized, open label study of brexpiprazole in 20 persons&#xD;
      with bipolar disorder. Primary Aim will be to determine if brexpiprazole is associated with a&#xD;
      reduction in depressive symptom severity using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale&#xD;
      (MADRS) in outpatients with bipolar disorder, depressed mood state. Secondary Aims will be:&#xD;
      1) Assess manic symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder receiving brexpiprazole, 2) Assess&#xD;
      cognition in patients with bipolar disorder receiving brexpiprazole, 3) Assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of brexpiprazole in patients with bipolar disorder, 4) Assess quality of life in&#xD;
      patients with bipolar disorder receiving brexpiprazole. Subjects will be discontinued from&#xD;
      the study if any of the following conditions occurs: change in diagnosis to other than&#xD;
      bipolar I or II disorder, development of active suicidal or homicidal ideation with plan and&#xD;
      intent, worsening in mood symptoms, that in the opinion of the investigators requires&#xD;
      discontinuation, pregnancy, development of severe or life-threatening medical condition,&#xD;
      involuntary psychiatric hospitalization or incarceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline: This visit will be split into two portions: Baseline 1 and Baseline 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Baseline 1 (~3 hours), the psychiatric diagnosis will be confirmed by the structured&#xD;
      clinical interview for DSM-5 (SCID), mood assessed via the Montgomery-Asberg Depression&#xD;
      Rating Scale (MADRS), depression via the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report&#xD;
      (IDS-SR30), mania via the Young Mania Rating Scale, and quality of life via the Quality of&#xD;
      Life in Bipolar Disorder (QOLBD). Blood will be drawn for complete blood count (CBC),&#xD;
      Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP, includes a liver panel with AST, ALT, as well as lipids),&#xD;
      and high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-CRP). A urine sample for drug screen and&#xD;
      pregnancy test (if applicable), psychiatrist assessment, physical exam, collection of weight&#xD;
      and vitals will be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Baseline 2 (~2 hours), recent depressive symptoms will be assessed via the IDS-SR30 and&#xD;
      MADRS, mania via the YMRS, current mood via Internal State Scale (ISS), suicidal ideation&#xD;
      will be assessed via the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS), safety and side&#xD;
      effects will be assessed with the SAFTEE, the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS),&#xD;
      Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS) and Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS). Subjects will also complete the&#xD;
      The Ray Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) to assess word memory, the Stroop test to&#xD;
      measure attention, speed, and accuracy of thinking, and The Trail Making Test (TMT) to&#xD;
      measure attention, speed and accuracy. A urine sample for drug screen and pregnancy test (if&#xD;
      applicable) will also be completed. Brexpiprazole capsules will be initiated at 0.5 mg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline 2 to Week 1: Subjects will be given the ISS to fill out at home. Subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to complete the scale at home on 7 consecutive days between Baseline 2 and Week 1&#xD;
      visits and return the filled out scales to the researcher's office. The scale will take&#xD;
      approximately 3-5 minutes to fill out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 1, 2, 3, 6 (~1.5 hours each): Subjects will complete the MADRS, YMRS, IDS-SR30, ISS,&#xD;
      SAFTEE, CSSRS, AIMS, BAS, SAS, and a urine sample will be collected for a drug screen.&#xD;
      Subjects will meet with the psychiatrist for weekly assessment and vitals will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 4 (~2 hours): Subjects will complete the MADRS, IDS-SR, YMRS, SAFTEE, ISS, C-SSRS, AIMS,&#xD;
      BAS, SAS, RAVLT, Stroop, TMT, vital signs, a urine sample for a drug screen and a urine&#xD;
      pregnancy test, and visit the doctor for a psychiatric evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 8 (final visit ~2.5 hours): Subjects will complete the MADRS, IDS-SR, YMRS, SAFTEE, ISS,&#xD;
      C-SSRS, AIMS, BAS, SAS, RAVLT, Stroop, TMT, QOLBD, vital signs, a urine sample for drug&#xD;
      screen, take a urine pregnancy test, have blood drawn for clinical testing (CBC, CMP,&#xD;
      hs-CRP), and visit the doctor for a psychiatric evaluation and physical exam. During this&#xD;
      visit, participants will also be provided with aftercare referral information and will begin&#xD;
      their medication taper. The medication taper schedule is described below under &quot;Study&#xD;
      Medication and Intervention Description&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Phone Call (~15 min): Participants will receive a phone call from researchers 7-10&#xD;
      days following their Week 8 study visit (at the end of their tapering schedule). During this&#xD;
      phone call, the researchers will assess any withdrawal effects or adverse events and check on&#xD;
      the status of the aftercare referrals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be paid for their time and inconvenience per visit as follows: $60 at&#xD;
      Baseline 1, Baseline 2, weeks 1, 2, 3, 6; $70 at week 4; $90 for week 8. Participants will&#xD;
      also be paid for each ISS scale they bring back at the rate of $1 per scale (maximum $7).&#xD;
      These payments will be processed during Week 1 visit. These payments will be completed via&#xD;
      the ClinCard system. Bus or rail passes will be provided. After study completion, standard&#xD;
      psychiatric care will be provided until referral is arranged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Medication and Intervention Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be initiated on a 0.5 mg/day brexpiprazole dose (week 0/baseline); after&#xD;
      one week the dose will be increased to 1 mg/day (week 1), after another week to 2 mg/day&#xD;
      (week 2). If any dose appears to be poorly tolerated, the dose titration can be slowed or&#xD;
      stopped based on clinician judgment. If response in weeks 3-6, defined as a 50% reduction in&#xD;
      the MADRS, has not been achieved, and the current dose is well tolerated, then additional&#xD;
      dose increases to 3 mg/day and 4 mg/day (maximum allowed dose in protocol) will occur with at&#xD;
      least a one week interval between dose increases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the last study visit (Week 8), participants will be gradually tapered off the&#xD;
      medication every 2 days until they stop taking the medication completely. For example, if a&#xD;
      participants takes 4 mg of brexpiparzole at Week 8, then he/she will take 3 mg for 2 days,&#xD;
      then 2 mg for 2 days, then 1 mg for 2 days, and then 0.5 mg for 2 days. At the end of the&#xD;
      tapering period (7-10 days depending on the highest brexpiprazole dose at the end of the&#xD;
      study), participants will receive a safety phone call from a research staff member to assess&#xD;
      any withdrawal symptoms and check on the status of the aftercare referrals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biostatistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim: Determine if brexpiprazole is associated with a reduction in depressive symptom&#xD;
      severity in outpatients with bipolar disorder, depressed mood state.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The MADRS will be the primary outcome measure with the IDS-SR as a secondary outcome&#xD;
           measure. Weekly scores on the MADRS and IDS-SR will be assessed using one-way repeated&#xD;
           measures. Analysis of Covariance (rm-ANCOVA), controlling for age and sex as potential&#xD;
           confounding variables, with time as the main effect. Participants will be included if&#xD;
           they complete one post-baseline assessment (intent-to-treat sample). In addition, rates&#xD;
           of depression response (≥ 50% reduction from baseline) and remission (≤10 on the MADRS&#xD;
           and ≤12 on the IDS-SR) will be assessed. A significance level of 0.05 will be set for&#xD;
           all analyses, with all tests being two-tailed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess manic symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder receiving brexpiprazole. YMRS&#xD;
           scores will be assessed as with the primary aim above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess cognition in patients with bipolar disorder receiving brexpiprazole. Scores on&#xD;
           the RAVLT, Stroop and TMT will be assessed at baseline compared to weeks 4 and 8&#xD;
           separately using paired t-tests or paired-sample Wilcoxon Signed Rank test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assess the safety and tolerability of brexpiprazole in patients with bipolar disorder.&#xD;
           Scores on the SAFTEE, C-SSRS, AIMS, BAS and SAS will be assessed as with the primary&#xD;
           aim.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assess quality of life in patients with bipolar disorder receiving brexpiprazole. The&#xD;
           QOLBD will be assessed as above for cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Assess peripheral inflammation in patients with bipolar disorder receiving&#xD;
           brexpiprazole. Values on hs-CRP will be compared between baseline and exit as with&#xD;
           cognition above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Assess relationships between changes in outcomes measures. Correlations between outcome&#xD;
           measures (e.g. depressive symptoms and cognition, depressive symptoms and inflammation)&#xD;
           will be assessed using Pearson's or Spearman's correlation coefficients.&#xD;

    <measure>The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale is used to assess depressive symptom severity. There are 10 items and each item is rated from 0 to 6 (increasing severity) based on the assessment of symptoms within the past 7 days. Scoring is assisted by descriptive anchors that serve as useful guides at 0,2,4, 8. Odd numbers (1,3,5) between the descriptive anchors are also meant to be scored. Highest possible MADRS score is 60. Lowest possible MADRS score is 0. MADRS is scored by taking the sum of the scores for each item. A higher score is indicative of more acute depressive symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Young Mania Rating Scale is an observer-rated measure of mania symptoms. It has 11 items and each items has 5 defined anchor points with increasing severity that describe the symptom characteristics. YMRS is scored by taking sum of the scores for the 11 items. A higher score indicative of more acute manic symptoms. Seven of the items are scored between 0 and 4. Four items allow for scoring between anchor points (ranging 1 to 8). Maximum score is 60 and minimum score is 0.</description>

    <measure>Rey Auditoy Verbal Learning Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) is a test of verbal learning and declarative memory. During the test, 15 nouns that are read aloud for 5 consecutive trials. Each trial is followed by a free recall test (participant is asked to recall the words that were just read to them). The sum of correctly recalled words across 5 trials is called the total raw score. On completion of Trial 5, an interference list of 15 words (List B) is presented, followed by a free recall test of that list. After a 20-min delay, the examinee is again required to recall the words from list A - this is called the delay raw score. The raw scores on both the total recall and the delay trials (number of words correct across trials 1-5) are converted to standardized T-scores (Mean=50; SD=10; range 20-100) based on participant age and gender. The scores below are presented as T-scores, with higher scores indicative of better performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroop Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroop task evaluates attention, speed, and accuracy of thinking. Stroop task consists of three separate trials: word, color, and color-word (CW) naming. For each trial, a raw score (correct number of words named) is recorded. The raw score for each trial is converted to a T-score based on participant's age and education level. The possible T-scores range from 15-85 for the word trial, 8-92 for the color trial, and 3-98 for the color-word trial. The interference score (Inter) is also derived from the color-word score, with T-scores ranging from 21-80. Higher numbers indicate better performance. The entered values represent T-scores.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trail Making Test (TMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Trail Making Test (TMT) measures attention, speed, and accuracy. TMT consists of two parts: Trails A and Trails B. The performance on each test is measured in seconds and represents how quickly a participant can connect the numbers (Trails A) and the numbers and letters (Trails B) together. The number of seconds it takes to complete each part of TMT is converted to a T-score based on gender, age, race, and education. The T-scores range from 0-100 with higher scores indicating better (faster) performance. The entered data are presented as T-Scores.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Systematic Assessment For Treatment Emergent Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Effects (SAFTEE) is a self-report scale used in clinical trials and is designed to evaluate the degree to which each possible side effect is bothersome to a participant. There are 55 items on the scale (each item represents a different side effect), with each item rated on a 4-point scale such as &quot;not bothersome - 0 (zero)&quot;, &quot;mildly bothersome - 1&quot;, &quot;moderately bothersome - 2&quot;, &quot;severely bothersome - 3&quot;. The total possible range of scores on the scale is 0-165. The higher scores indicate a higher degree of being bothered by various side effects.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) is a structured interview and rating scale used to measure suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Actual attempts, interrupted attempts, and aborted attempts are measured as positive integers (zero and above). The minimum value for the actual, interrupted, and aborted attempt is zero (reflecting no past suicidal behavior). There is no maximum scale value, as the number of attempts differs for each participant. The entered values represent the average number of actual, interrupted, and aborted attempts in the group. Higher values reflect a higher number of attempts experienced by each participant (equivalent to a worse outcome).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) is an assessment of movements to determine any long-term drug induced movement disorders.There are 10 items on the scale with scores ranging from 0-4 (0 None/Normal, 1 minimal, 2 mild, 3 moderate,4 severe). 4 items assess facial and oral movements, 2 items measure extremity movements, 1 item measures trunk movements, and 3 items measure global judgments regarding symptoms assessed. A total score is the sum of scores for items assessing facial and oral movements, extremity movements, and trunk movement (scores ranging from 0-28), with 0 being the lowest score, and 28 being the highest score. A higher score is indicative of a higher severity in symptomatology.</description>

        <title>The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)</title>
        <description>The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale is used to assess depressive symptom severity. There are 10 items and each item is rated from 0 to 6 (increasing severity) based on the assessment of symptoms within the past 7 days. Scoring is assisted by descriptive anchors that serve as useful guides at 0,2,4, 8. Odd numbers (1,3,5) between the descriptive anchors are also meant to be scored. Highest possible MADRS score is 60. Lowest possible MADRS score is 0. MADRS is scored by taking the sum of the scores for each item. A higher score is indicative of more acute depressive symptoms.</description>

            <groups_desc>Primary Aim is to determine if brexpiprazole is associated with a reduction in depressive symptom severity in bipolar disorder outpatients. A sample size of 17 provides 80% power for a paired t-test to compare baseline to exit change scores on the MADRS of 7 (SD 10) (a more conservative change than with even the low 1 mg dose of brexpiprazole in Thase et. al.

        <description>Young Mania Rating Scale is an observer-rated measure of mania symptoms. It has 11 items and each items has 5 defined anchor points with increasing severity that describe the symptom characteristics. YMRS is scored by taking sum of the scores for the 11 items. A higher score indicative of more acute manic symptoms. Seven of the items are scored between 0 and 4. Four items allow for scoring between anchor points (ranging 1 to 8). Maximum score is 60 and minimum score is 0.</description>

        <title>Rey Auditoy Verbal Learning Test</title>
        <description>Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) is a test of verbal learning and declarative memory. During the test, 15 nouns that are read aloud for 5 consecutive trials. Each trial is followed by a free recall test (participant is asked to recall the words that were just read to them). The sum of correctly recalled words across 5 trials is called the total raw score. On completion of Trial 5, an interference list of 15 words (List B) is presented, followed by a free recall test of that list. After a 20-min delay, the examinee is again required to recall the words from list A - this is called the delay raw score. The raw scores on both the total recall and the delay trials (number of words correct across trials 1-5) are converted to standardized T-scores (Mean=50; SD=10; range 20-100) based on participant age and gender. The scores below are presented as T-scores, with higher scores indicative of better performance.</description>

        <description>The Trail Making Test (TMT) measures attention, speed, and accuracy. TMT consists of two parts: Trails A and Trails B. The performance on each test is measured in seconds and represents how quickly a participant can connect the numbers (Trails A) and the numbers and letters (Trails B) together. The number of seconds it takes to complete each part of TMT is converted to a T-score based on gender, age, race, and education. The T-scores range from 0-100 with higher scores indicating better (faster) performance. The entered data are presented as T-Scores.</description>

There are 55 items on the scale (each item represents a different side effect), with each item rated on a 4-point scale such as &quot;not bothersome - 0 (zero)&quot;, &quot;mildly bothersome - 1&quot;, &quot;moderately bothersome - 2&quot;, &quot;severely bothersome - 3&quot;. The total possible range of scores on the scale is 0-165. The higher scores indicate a higher degree of being bothered by various side effects.</description>

        <description>The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) is a structured interview and rating scale used to measure suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Actual attempts, interrupted attempts, and aborted attempts are measured as positive integers (zero and above). The minimum value for the actual, interrupted, and aborted attempt is zero (reflecting no past suicidal behavior). There is no maximum scale value, as the number of attempts differs for each participant. The entered values represent the average number of actual, interrupted, and aborted attempts in the group. Higher values reflect a higher number of attempts experienced by each participant (equivalent to a worse outcome).</description>

        <description>The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) is an assessment of movements to determine any long-term drug induced movement disorders.There are 10 items on the scale with scores ranging from 0-4 (0 None/Normal, 1 minimal, 2 mild, 3 moderate,4 severe). 4 items assess facial and oral movements, 2 items measure extremity movements, 1 item measures trunk movements, and 3 items measure global judgments regarding symptoms assessed. A total score is the sum of scores for items assessing facial and oral movements, extremity movements, and trunk movement (scores ranging from 0-28), with 0 being the lowest score, and 28 being the highest score. A higher score is indicative of a higher severity in symptomatology.</description>

        <description>The Quality Of Life in Bipolar Disorder (QOLBD) is a measure of the quality of life in patients with bipolar disorder. All questions on the scale ask about a range of experiences, behaviors, and feeling related to the quality of life. For each question, a participant is asked to indicate how much they agree with each question. The scale consists of 12 questions, with each question measured on a 5-point scale, such as &quot;strongly disagree - 1&quot;, &quot;disagree - 2&quot;, &quot;neutral - 3&quot;, &quot;agree - 4&quot;, &quot;strongly agree - 5&quot;. The total possible range of scores on the scale is 12-60. Higher scores indicate better quality of life.</description>
