  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project, the investigators propose to use high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) to measure blood perfusion in different groups of calf muscle. This imaging approach is&#xD;
      standard of care for evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD), and has never been&#xD;
      successfully applied to PAD. Preliminary results show distinct patterns of muscle perfusion&#xD;
      between healthy and PAD patients, and thus great promise of the technique. The investigators&#xD;
      will first verify the reproducibility of the technique, and then compare the calf muscle&#xD;
      perfusion measures in PAD patients against healthy age-matched controls. This comparison will&#xD;
      test the feasibility of detecting functional abnormality in PAD patients. After the baseline&#xD;
      scans, the PAD patients will opt to undergo a 12-week supervised exercise therapy, and then a&#xD;
      post-therapy MRI scan. Comparison of the pre- and post-therapy measurements will indicate how&#xD;
      the therapy improves the calf-muscle perfusion, and how this perfusion change correlates with&#xD;
      increases in patient's walking ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long term goals of this project are to develop an improved diagnostic test for patients&#xD;
      with PAD to predict who will benefit from therapeutic intervention. The MRI perfusion studies&#xD;
      of calf muscle can be performed in conjunction with routine peripheral MR angiography to&#xD;
      assess the functional significance of vascular stenosis.&#xD;

    <description>The therapy will be conducted three times each week for 12 weeks. Each session takes 1 hour, consisting of 5 minutes of warmup activities, 50 minutes of intermittent exercise, and 5 minutes of cool-down activities. Exercise consists of walking on a treadmill initiated at 2 mph and 0% grade, until claudication pain becomes moderately severe. After claudication pain subsides, the subject will restart the walk. At the end of the session, the total exercise duration will be recorded. After a patient is able to walk 8-10 minutes at the initial workload, the grade is increased by 1-2%, or the speed is increased by 0.5 mph as tolerated.</description>
