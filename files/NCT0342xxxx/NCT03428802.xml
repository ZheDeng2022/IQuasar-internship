  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in treating participants with cancer&#xD;
      that has spread to other places in the body, has come back or has spread to nearby tissues or&#xD;
      lymph nodes. Monoclonal antibodies such as, pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of&#xD;
      tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the response rate of pembrolizumab in participants with evidence of genomic&#xD;
      instability who have solid tumors with POLE and POLD1 mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the response rate of pembrolizumab in participants with evidence of genomic&#xD;
      instability who have solid tumors with BRCA1/2 mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the complete and partial response rate, and response durability (immune related&#xD;
      progression free survival), to historical cohort information of unselected patients treated&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response in the tumor microenvironment and peripheral&#xD;
      blood of patients treated on this study as well as the frequencies,&#xD;
      activation/differentiation, functionality, and co-inhibitory molecule expression of immune&#xD;
      cell populations in peripheral blood and tumor, before and after treatment with systemic&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To measure PD-L1 expression in pretreatment tumor biopsies and in post treatment tumor&#xD;
      tissue, as well as on biopsies taken at progression, to capture data on the relationship&#xD;
      between PD-L1 expression and patient outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To perform deep sequencing for detection of PD-1 and PD-L1 polymorphisms that may&#xD;
      correlate with clinical outcomes as well as identification of mutations in immunoregulatory&#xD;
      genes that are potential predictors of response to these therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To perform exome sequencing of pre-treatment tumor specimens to determine if the presence&#xD;
      of immunogenic neoantigens is associated with response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To perform ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing to determine if expression of checkpoint&#xD;
      genes, immune-regulatory modules, or non-coding RNAs including repetitive RNAs and&#xD;
      retroelements are associated with response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses&#xD;
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Participants with disease progression may continue pembrolizumab for up to 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days then every 12&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
