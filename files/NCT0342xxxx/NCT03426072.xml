  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the program is to advance knowledge translation science in order to&#xD;
      improve clinical and staff related outcomes in long term care facilities (nursing homes) in&#xD;
      western Canada. SCOPE will assess the effect of Care Aide led Quality Improvement efforts on&#xD;
      staff quality of work life as well as resident quality of care. A key element of SCOPE is a&#xD;
      leadership development stream which introduces complexity science and education on quality&#xD;
      improvement which aims to support front line teams with their improvement initiative&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effects of a facilitation-based improvement&#xD;
      intervention on three primary performance outcomes: (1) staff reported use of best practices,&#xD;
      (2) measures of staff work engagement and job satisfaction, and (3) resident quality of care.&#xD;
      Within the context of the Translating Research in Elder Care study (Pro00037937), the&#xD;
      influence of staff characteristics related to work performance and unit context scores&#xD;
      (leadership, culture, resources) on the three primary outcomes will be assessed Background&#xD;
      Translating Research in Elder Care (TREC) is an ongoing applied research program that began&#xD;
      in 2007. TREC is focused on practical solutions that will improve quality of care provided to&#xD;
      nursing home residents, enrich the work life of their caregivers, and enhance system&#xD;
      efficiencies and effectiveness. In TREC 1, teams of researchers worked together with decision&#xD;
      makers from the residential long term care (LTC) sector on multiple studies in Manitoba,&#xD;
      Saskatchewan, Alberta and to a lesser extent, British Columbia (SCOPE pilot only). Data were&#xD;
      collected from approximately 4000 care providers and residents using the Resident Assessment&#xD;
      Index Minimum data Set (RAI-MDS) 2.0 in participating TREC nursing homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREC has already established its value to the health system by demonstrating improvements in&#xD;
      resident care, clinical outcomes, and staff well-being. Information data collected from over&#xD;
      100,500 resident assessments combined with the staff and facility surveys now forms the TREC&#xD;
      Measurement System (TMS Project). This wealth of data has informed the SCOPE pilot project in&#xD;
      2010 and SCOPE was conceived as a result of this data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SCOPE intervention is designed as a randomized controlled trial (RCT). For our primary&#xD;
      outcome measure (change in Conceptual Research Use (CRU)between pre and post intervention&#xD;
      periods) a sample size of 34 units per arm is adequate to detect an effect size of 0.67 or&#xD;
      greater (using the standard deviation for the change in CRU between pre and post intervention&#xD;
      periods for intervention and non-intervention from the SCOPE pilot data at 80% power, with an&#xD;
      alpha 0.05, for a 2-tailed comparison of independent samples. The intervention will take&#xD;
      place in as many as 45 of the facilities involved in the TMS project (Pro00037937) to take&#xD;
      account of drop -outs. Each facility will have a Senior Sponsor (generally the Director of&#xD;
      Care or Exec Director). Participants in the intervention teams will be from a single unit in&#xD;
      each intervention facility and will include 3 Health Care Aides who will lead the team, as&#xD;
      well as 2 other members of that unit which can include other allied professional staff,&#xD;
      nurses, and Occupational Therapist /Rec Aides. One member of the team must be the Team&#xD;
      sponsor (generally the unit's care manager) removes obstacles for the team.&#xD;
