  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if durvalumab and trametinib can help to&#xD;
      control microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancer. The safety of these drugs will also be&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Durvalumab is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of previously treated advanced bladder cancer. Trametinib is FDA approved in&#xD;
      combination with another drug called dabrafenib for the treatment of unresectable or&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or BRAF V600K.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is investigational to use durvalumab and trametinib to treat MSS colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 56 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cycle is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will take trametinib tablets by mouth every day with at least 8 ounces of water.&#xD;
      Each dose should be taken at about the same time each day, 1 hour before or 2 hours after a&#xD;
      meal. Participant should not crush, cut, or chew the tablets. If participant misses a dose of&#xD;
      trametinib, participant may take the tablets as soon as participant remembers but only if&#xD;
      participant's next scheduled dose is at least 12 hours later. If participant's next scheduled&#xD;
      dose is less than 12 hours, participant should wait and take participant's next dose as&#xD;
      scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will take trametinib alone for the first 7 days of the study and then participant&#xD;
      will begin receiving it in combination with durvalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 4 weeks, participant will receive durvalumab by vein over about 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will be able to receive the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in&#xD;
      participant's best interest. Participant no longer will take the study drugs if intolerable&#xD;
      side effects occur or if the study doctor decides that the drugs are no longer working.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that participation in this study may last about 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will be over after follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 12, and then every 4 weeks after that (Weeks 16, 20, 24, and so&#xD;
      on):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system testing, and&#xD;
           biomarker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participant had a biopsy at screening, participant will have another biopsy during&#xD;
           Week 4 to check the status of the disease and for biomarker testing. Depending on when&#xD;
           participant joins the study, this biopsy may be optional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Week 8:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system testing, and&#xD;
           biomarker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Week 16 and then every 8 weeks after that (Weeks 24, 32, 40, and so on),&#xD;
      participant will have a CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 28 days after participant's last dose of study drugs, participant will have a physical&#xD;
      exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After participant's end-of-treatment visit, participant will be called by the study staff&#xD;
      every 3 months for up to 18 months to ask how participant is doing. Each call should last&#xD;
      about 5-10 minutes.&#xD;
