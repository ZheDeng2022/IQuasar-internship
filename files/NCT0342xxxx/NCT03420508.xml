    <description>The screening portion of the trial will test archival tumor material for the presence of ALKATI using a Nanostring-based RNA assay for any patients deemed to be current or future candidates for this trial. This will require approximately 5 formalin-fixed paraffin- embedded (FFPE) slides of 5-8 micron thickness. For the treatment portion of the study, all patients will receive ensartinib orally at a dose of 225mg daily.</description>

    <description>Ensartinib will be given at a dose of 225mg daily in the form of 100mg and 25mg capsules. Patients will receive treatment continuously in 28 day cycles. Patients will then have the same tumor specimen biopsied again at day 15. Treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient choice to discontinue therapy.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        For Screening Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients ≥18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed advanced malignant melanoma, regardless of subtype&#xD;
&#xD;
        For Treatment Phase, as above and in addition:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Progression following PD-1 based checkpoint inhibitor therapy, with or without&#xD;
             ipilimumab. Tumors harboring BRAF V600 alterations must also have received prior&#xD;
             therapy with BRAF inhibitors (with or without a MEK inhibitor). Patients with uveal&#xD;
             melanoma are exempt from PD-1 based progression since there is no accepted standard&#xD;
             frontline therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumors must harbor an alteration in ALK using a CLIA-certified laboratory, including,&#xD;
             but not limited to, ALKATI, ALK fusions, or ALK mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease must be measurable according to RECIST 1.1. Disease that has undergone local&#xD;
             therapy in the past 30 days is not considered measurable unless the investigator has&#xD;
             documented progression despite the local therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             ° If a patient has consented to the pre-screening portion, has been determined to have&#xD;
             ALK alterations, but has no measurable disease, the trial may be favored later, and&#xD;
             the patient should be consented (or re-consented) to the treatment portion of the&#xD;
             trial at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Asymptomatic untreated brain metastases are allowed. Symptomatic metastases that have&#xD;
             undergone local therapy with RT or surgery and have not required an increase in&#xD;
             steroid dose in prior 2 weeks are allowed. Disease that has undergone local therapy is&#xD;
             not considered measurable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status&#xD;
             (PS) of 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acceptable liver, renal, and hematological function:&#xD;
&#xD;

                  Syndrome must have bilirubin ≤3x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) ≤3&#xD;
                  x ULN (≤5x if liver metastases are present)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 30 mL/min using a cancer-specific&#xD;
                  GFR Model; the calculator found at:&#xD;
                  http://tavarelab.cruk.cam.ac.uk/JanowitzWilliamsGFR/&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Neutrophils ≥1.5 x 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets ≥100 x 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prothrombin time, international normalized ratio [INR], and/or activated partial&#xD;
                  thromboplastin time within ≤1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;

             day of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior RT or clinically relevant major surgery (e.g. craniotomy, metastasectomy) within&#xD;
             2 weeks prior to first day of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other active malignancy other than melanoma that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, would interfere with study participation.&#xD;

               -  o Arrhythmia or conduction abnormality requiring medication. Note: patients with&#xD;
                  atrial fibrillation/flutter adequately controlled by medication in the opinion of&#xD;
                  the treating physician and arrhythmias controlled by pacemakers are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Severe/unstable angina, coronary artery/peripheral bypass graft, or myocardial&#xD;
                  infarction.&#xD;
