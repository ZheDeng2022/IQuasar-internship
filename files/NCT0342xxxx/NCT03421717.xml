  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peri-implantitis is defined as inflammation in the mucosa surrounding an oral implant with&#xD;
      loss of supporting bone. The goals of peri-implantitis treatment are to resolve inflammation&#xD;
      and to arrest the progression of disease. It is important to systematically gather&#xD;
      information on the effect of surgical peri-implant treatment and to assess different&#xD;
      protocols regarding chair-side maintenance of peri-implant tissue after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this clinical investigation are to evaluate the clinical, microbiological and&#xD;
      radiographic outcomes of surgical treatment of peri-implantitis and to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      of 2 supportive treatment protocols based on the use of titanium cyrettes or by the use of a&#xD;
      flexible, biodegradable chitosan brush. Furthermore, to evaluate the impact of this therapy&#xD;
      on selected biochemical markers associated with chronic inflammation and bone tissue&#xD;
      destruction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about the effect of chair-side maintenance of dental implants after&#xD;
      peri-implantitits surgery. Traditionally, the maintenance has been performed by titanium&#xD;
      curettes to remove microbiological deposits from the submucosal area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Labrida biodegradable brush is a novel debridement device intended for use on dental&#xD;
      implants. The concept of using a biodegradable material is related to the suggested problems&#xD;
      with leaving remnants on the treated implant surface which would be negative from a bone&#xD;
      regenerative aspect. The use of a flexible brush relates to the access problems when treating&#xD;
      dental implants both related to the threads as well as due to the prosthetic supra&#xD;
      construction hindering access for debridement with regular instruments developed for teeth.&#xD;
      The material used in the brush will be Chitosan which is a natural polysaccharide, chitosan&#xD;
      (poly-N-acetyl glucosaminoglycan), which is a nontoxic and bioabsorbable (REK-approval&#xD;
      2012/791 polymer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: It is possible to maintain peri-implant health after surgical peri-implantitis treatment.&#xD;
      There is no short- or long term clinical or radiographical differences between patients&#xD;
      surgically treated for peri-implantitis maintained by the use of titanium cyrettes or with&#xD;
      the Labrida brush in chair-side supportive care&#xD;
