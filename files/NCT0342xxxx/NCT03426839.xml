      Comparative study on efficacy of haemostatic therapy guided either by standard laboratory&#xD;
      coagulation parameters or point-of-care testing in patients undergoing vascular surgical&#xD;
      procedures. We investigate the amount of perioperative bleeding and the number of blood&#xD;
      product used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria Patients scheduled for elective and acute open aorta surgery or undergoing&#xD;
      acute aorta surgery with minimally invasive techniques and were provided treatment in the&#xD;
      operating theatre and/or ICU attached to perioperative care, they must be at least 18 years&#xD;
      of age and written informed consent was obtained from the patient or his/her legal&#xD;
      representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation technique Patients will be randomly assigned to each of two treatment groups&#xD;
      using sealed envelopes. In group 1 (G1) haemostasis strategy guided by conventional&#xD;
      coagulation tests, while in group 2 (G2) transfusion algorithms guided by point-of-care (POC)&#xD;
      tests will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling techniques and measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      For assessment of monitored parameters shall be used arterial or venous blood depending on&#xD;
      the catheter placed preoperatively. In case of the above mentioned vascular surgical&#xD;
      procedures, all patients will receive arterial cannula routinely, and, depending on the&#xD;
      extension of procedure, as appropriate, a central venous catheter will be inserted as well.&#xD;
      Sampling in the patient groups shall be performed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pre- and postoperative evaluation of standard laboratory parameters in all patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluation of standard laboratory parameters and arterial Astrup test during and after&#xD;
           surgery in group 1, if the blood loss volume reaches 1,5 ml/kg/minute during 20 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in case of elective surgery: thromboelastometry and arterial Astrup test during and&#xD;
           after surgery in group 2 if the blood loss volume reaches 1,5 ml/kg/minute during 20&#xD;
           minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in case of acute surgery: thromboelastometry and arterial Astrup test before, during and&#xD;
           after surgery in group 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in case of positive anamnesis, preoperative platelet aggregation test in both groups&#xD;
           Besides the above samplings, routine lab tests (blood gas, blood count, sodium (Na),&#xD;
           potassium (K), parameters of renal and liver function, clotting and inflammation, lactic&#xD;
           acid, blood sugar) will be performed every day as usual during intensive therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the fact that interventional therapy of vascular lesions (endovascular and hybrid&#xD;
      procedures) is becoming more and more common, angioplasties involving major vessels have to&#xD;
      be still managed as surgical procedures associated with extreme high demand for transfusion,&#xD;
      this applies especially to acute rupture of aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection,&#xD;
      aortobifemoral bypass and certain elective procedures where conventional open surgery is the&#xD;
      only therapeutic option. Due the generalised atherosclerosis typical for most vascular&#xD;
      surgical patients as well as the vulnerability of vessel wall, major blood loss has to be&#xD;
      taken in account even during elective surgeries with minimally invasive techniques. In the&#xD;
      event that excessive bleeding would occur, conversion to open surgery may be necessary, for&#xD;
      this reason the preparation and perioperative care of patients undergoing interventional&#xD;
      surgery have to be performed in the same manner as its is prescribed for open aorta&#xD;
      operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bleeding risk associated with the above surgical procedures is increased by the fact that&#xD;
      the majority of patients affected are on a single or in some cases on double antiplatelet&#xD;
      therapy, and/or receive prolonged anticoagulation treatment. Discontinuation of the&#xD;
      treatments is expensive and, in case of indication for acute surgery, may not always be&#xD;
      carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous bleeding history, current drug therapy, evaluation of coagulation status&#xD;
      (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, fibrinogen) and&#xD;
      blood count screening using conventional laboratory tests are part of preoperative&#xD;
      preparations. Control of platelet function is always indicated in case of positive anamnesis&#xD;
      (inherited or acquired thrombocytopathy, anamnestic information on bleeding complication,&#xD;
      skin symptoms suggesting haemophilia), but is not performed routinely. Preoperative&#xD;
      normalization of possible abnormalities as well as optimalization of drugs affecting&#xD;
      haemostasis, so the reduction of bleeding risk to the minimum are of essential importance,&#xD;
      however, we do not always have enough time for it. In cardiovascular surgery, withdrawal of&#xD;
      aspirin and/or clopidogrel therapy increases the risk of thrombosis; continuation of aspirin&#xD;
      and/or clopidogrel therapy increases the risk of bleeding. In our own practice, in case of&#xD;
      elective vascular surgical procedures, aspirin therapy will be continued, but clopidogrel&#xD;
      will be stopped 5-7 days prior to surgery, according to the European recommendations. When a&#xD;
      patient with prolonged anticoagulant therapy is at high risk for embolism, his medication&#xD;
      will be switched to low molecular weight heparin. In case the surgery is performed under&#xD;
      ongoing antiplatelet therapy, transfusion of thrombocyte concentrate may also be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the European guidelines, the application of transfusion algorithms and protocols&#xD;
      incorporating predefined intervention triggers to guide haemostatic intervention during&#xD;
      preoperative bleeding are recommended, as well as viscoelastic point-of-care tests (POCT). In&#xD;
      lack of the latter, the Hungarian recommendation suggests the application of conventional&#xD;
      monitoring assays, however, they give an poor assessment picture with associated with&#xD;
      significant time delay, therefore have to be considered inadequate in case of excessive&#xD;
      bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At first, it has to be definitely cleared whether the blood loss is caused by haemostatic or&#xD;
      surgical source. In the meantime, however, maintenance of normothermia, prevention of&#xD;
      acidosis and normalisation of ionized calcium level are of significant importance. In case of&#xD;
      active bleeding the targeted value of systolic blood pressure is 80-100 mmHg, that of&#xD;
      haemoglobin concentration 7-9 g/dl. The restrictive transfusion strategy is aimed at&#xD;
      decreasing the number of allogeneic transfusions which are regarded as a form of tissue&#xD;
      transplantation to the possible minimum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first step for optimal restoration of the function of haemostasis system has to be the&#xD;
      regulation of the concentration of fibrinogen in the blood plasma, using either conventional&#xD;
      laboratory tests or point-of-care testing. Fibrinogen is synthesized in the liver and will&#xD;
      not be stored; it has the highest concentration among all coagulation factors (3 g/l). During&#xD;
      blood loss, its concentration decreases and reaches the crucial level (&lt;2 g/l) most rapidly.&#xD;
      It is essential that besides erythrocyte (RBC) concentrate fresh frozen plasma (FFP) has also&#xD;
      to be given (RBC:FFP=2:1) in a timely manner, in a fixed proportion. In case of excessive&#xD;
      blood loss and transfusion, administration of thrombocyte concentrate is also necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study Comparative study on efficacy of haemostatic therapy guided either by&#xD;
      standard laboratory parameters or point-of-care testing in patients undergoing vascular&#xD;
      surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Prospective randomised clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;

      years of age and written informed consent was obtained from the patient or his/her legal&#xD;
      representative.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to each of two treatment groups using sealed envelopes:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Assessment of parameters Conventional coagulation laboratory tests In the preanalytical phase&#xD;
      consisting of steps within and outside the laboratory we have to face a great number of&#xD;
      influence factors which can be of critical importance concerning the result of the lab test&#xD;
      (e.g. quality of blood sampling tube, method of sampling, appropriate amount of sample,&#xD;
      haemolysis, lipaemia). The time-consuming nature of these tests may cause problems primarily&#xD;
      in case of massive bleeding. It is not the same blood that circulates in the patient's&#xD;
      organism by the time we receive the result. Another disadvantage is that only a few steps of&#xD;
      coagulation cascade are investigated. The tests are performed using the plasma separated by&#xD;
      centrifugation of blood. Information regarding reactions on the surface of activated&#xD;
      platelets, fibrin polymerisation, clot firmness and fibrinolysis cannot be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routinely monitored parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prothrombin time (PT)/ International normalized ratio (INR): extrinsic coagulation&#xD;
           pathway and final common pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT): intrinsic coagulation pathway and final&#xD;
           common pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thrombin Time (TI): reflects the speed of conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fibrinogen: amount of fibrinogen in the blood plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood count (platelet number ) Point-of-care methods Point-of-care tests using whole&#xD;
           blood provide information within a short time, including the patient's haemostatic&#xD;
           status. These benefits are associated with many advantageous features such as small&#xD;
           place demand, simply use, no need of maintenance; centrifugation is not required, the&#xD;
           reagents are ready to use, some tests can be stored at room temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Viscoelastic tests Viscoelastic tests used for global haemostasis assays are&#xD;
      thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM). The original method has&#xD;
      been developed by Harter in 1948 in Heidelberg, initially for analysis of not anticoagulated&#xD;
      blood. Viscoelastic tests provide information on primary haemostasis (platelet adhesion and&#xD;
      aggregation), thrombin generation, thrombus formation and fibrinolysis, thus, on every steps&#xD;
      of haemostasis. Informative analysis in case of patients who are on prolonged heparin therapy&#xD;
      can also be accomplished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disadvantages of viscoelastic coagulation POC tests include indirectly obtained information&#xD;
      on the platelet function, furthermore, the role of endothelium is not recognizes and the&#xD;
      characteristics of blood flow are disregarded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During TEG/ROTEM analysis a pin is dipped into a sample of whole blood - to be given in a&#xD;
      cuvette of not physiological surface - and the coagulation becomes activated. Cuvette and&#xD;
      sensor move relative to each other. In TEG, the movement is initiated from the cup, in ROTEM&#xD;
      the pin is oscillated and the cuvette remains fixed. Increasing viscosity of blood and&#xD;
      enhancing stability of clot being formed induce a change of elasticity. This process affects&#xD;
      the motion of the sensor that is detected by light reflection changes. The two methods are&#xD;
      equivalent and can be considered as mutual alternatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tested parameters provide information on the starting time of clotting process, the clot&#xD;
      formation, stabilisation and quality as well as fibrinolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of viscoelastic POC tests have been confirmed by several clinical studies,&#xD;
      primarily in the field of cardiac surgery, liver transplantation, and traumatology. As per&#xD;
      the published data, the number of allogeneic transfusions and postoperative blood loss&#xD;
      decreased significantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters of ROTEM analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clotting time (CT): Time elapsed from beginning of test until the starting time of&#xD;
           clotting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clot formation time (CFT): Time to reach 20 mm amplitude from the starting time of&#xD;
           clotting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximum clot firmness (MCF): Provides information on firmness of clot.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximum lysis (ML): Provides information on loss of clot firmness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of platelet aggregation Platelet aggregation inhibitors (e.g. aspirin&#xD;
      [acetylsalicylic acid], ticlopidine, clopidogrel), significantly decrease the aggregation&#xD;
      ability of platelets or may even completely terminate it. During examination, several&#xD;
      platelet aggregation agents will be added to the platelet-rich plasma prepared appropriately&#xD;
      and the aggregation induced this way will be measured using an impedance aggregometer. The&#xD;
      device measures the change of electric resistance between the two electrodes dipped into the&#xD;
      blood sample in relation to time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most commonly it is applied for adjustment of antiplatelet therapy and monitoring the&#xD;
      efficacy of the substance. It is suitable for highly sensitive detection of aspirin,&#xD;
      clopidogrel, prasugrel and IIb/IIIa-receptor antagonists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Now there are literary data also in respect of its efficacy in respect of predicting the&#xD;
      probability of coronary stent thrombosis, as well as that of bleeding and the need of&#xD;
      transfusion in cardiac surgery. Still, it is not recommended to routinely use this device in&#xD;
      the perioperative care of any and all patients. At the same time, however, in case of&#xD;
      patients at risk (e.g. positive bleeding anamnesis, treatment with platelet-aggregation&#xD;
      inhibiting drugs) it is able to identify and to help diagnose a possible platelet&#xD;
      disfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routinely monitored parameter:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Area Under the Curve (AUC): Indication of platelet activity. The results calculated by the&#xD;
      software are the mean values of data of the several curves.&#xD;
