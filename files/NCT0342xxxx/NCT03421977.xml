      This is a long term, safety follow up study of patients in the AVXS-101-CL-101 gene&#xD;
      replacement therapy clinical trial for SMA Type 1 delivering onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi.&#xD;
      Patients will roll over from the parent study into this long-term study for continuous safety&#xD;
      monitoring for up to 15 years. The last visit of the parent study or early discontinuation&#xD;
      from the parent study may serve as the visit at which the informed consent form process is&#xD;
      conducted for the AVXS 101-LT-001 long term follow-up safety study. Patients will return&#xD;
      annually for follow up study visits for five (5) years, and then will be contacted via phone&#xD;
      annually for ten (10) years. Additionally, patient record transfers from their local&#xD;
      physician and/or neurologist will be requested in conjunction with the annual study visits&#xD;
      and phone contacts for review by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is unable to return to the original investigative site, the sponsor will&#xD;
      arrange with the patients' local established physician to serve as an additional investigator&#xD;
      to conduct the required assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial information was submitted voluntarily under the applicable law and,&#xD;
      therefore, certain submission deadlines may not apply. (That is, clinical trial information&#xD;
      for this applicable clinical trial was submitted under section 402(j)(4)(A) of the Public&#xD;
      Health Service Act and 42 CFR 11.60 and is not subject to the deadlines established by&#xD;
      sections 402(j)(2) and (3) of the Public Health Service Act or 42 CFR 11.24 and 11.44.).&#xD;
