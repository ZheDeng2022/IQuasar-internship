  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EGFR (ErbB1) mutations define a lung cancer subtype with exquisite sensitivity to EGFR&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). While in-frame deletion in exon 19 (Del19) and a point&#xD;
      mutation (L858R) in exon 21 are the two most common sensitizing EGFR mutations in NSCLC,&#xD;
      approximately 10% of EGFR mutation-positive tumors harbor uncommon mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These mutations represent a heterogeneous group of rare molecular alterations (or&#xD;
      combinations) within exons 18-21, whose oncogenicity and sensitivity to EGFR TKIs may vary&#xD;
      and has not been prospectively studied. Recently, a retrospective analysis reported that&#xD;
      overall response rate of EGFR TKI (gefitinib or erlotinib) treatment was about 10% or less in&#xD;
      Korean NSCLC patients with uncommon EGFR mutation other than del19, L858R and T790M [11]. In&#xD;
      preclinical data, the potency of AZD9291 against uncommon EGFR mutants other than exon 20&#xD;
      insertion mutation was fairly good.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the result, in this study, we try to evaluate the efficacy of AZD9291, the potent&#xD;
      irreversible inhibitor, in NSCLC patients with harboring uncommon EGFR mutations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy of AZD9291 (experimental) NSCLC&#xD;
      patients with uncommon EGFR mutation. The primary endpoint of the study is objective response&#xD;
      rate. Recently, a retrospective analysis reported that overall response rate of EGFR TKI&#xD;
      (gefitinib or erlotinib) treatment was about 10% or less in Korean NSCLC patients with&#xD;
      uncommon EGFR mutation other than del19, L858R and T790M (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we expect an objective response rate of about 30% for the experimental arm&#xD;
      (AZD9291 therapy) compared to that of about 10% in the historical control based on previous&#xD;
      studies. A sample size of 33 efficacy-evaluable patients would provide a power of 90% for&#xD;
      testing the null hypothesis of 10% ORR vs. alternative hypothesis of 30% using a single-arm&#xD;
      exact binomial test with a 1=sided significance level of 5%. The experimental therapy will be&#xD;
      rejected if 6 or fewer patients out of 33 respond. Allowing for a follow-up loss rate of 10%,&#xD;
      the total sample size is 37 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated 80 mg/day of AZD9291 orally (1 cycle for 21 days). Subjects (with&#xD;
      the exception of subjects with insulin dependent diabetes) must fast for ≥1 hours prior to&#xD;
      taking a dose to ≥2 hour post dose. Water is permitted during this fasting period. Cycles&#xD;
      were repeated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or until the patient or the&#xD;
      investigator requested therapy discontinuation. If the efficacy will be proven, the patient&#xD;
      could receive the treatment continuously.&#xD;
