  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transfers between interfaces of care are recognized as a source of medication discrepancies,&#xD;
      medication errors (MEs) and potentially adverse drug events. ME are very common at hospital&#xD;
      and may have important clinical and economic consequences. The lack and loss of medication&#xD;
      information and communication between health professionals at points of care transition may&#xD;
      often lead to ME. According to the literature, up to two thirds of medication histories&#xD;
      contain at least one error. Some studies have compared pharmaceutical team with physician or&#xD;
      nurse on the detection of UMD or ME and have reported that pharmacists were one of the best&#xD;
      health care providers to establish medication history. To improve medication safety and&#xD;
      decrease MEs rate, several institutions have recommended to develop medication reconciliation&#xD;
      at all transition points such as admission, transfer and discharge. Medication reconciliation&#xD;
      is the process that compares a patient's medication order to all medications that the patient&#xD;
      has been taking and should take at admission, transfer and discharge of hospitalization.&#xD;
      Medication reconciliation programs led by pharmacists are effective to reduce medications&#xD;
      discrepancies. However, studies evaluating the efficacy of medication reconciliation program&#xD;
      are very heterogeneous in terms of populations, definitions and methodology. Thus, proportion&#xD;
      of ME differs enormously between studies, ranging from under 10% to over 60% at admission of&#xD;
      hospitalization. Elderly patients with their numerous comorbidities associated with&#xD;
      polypharmacy, such as patients of internal medecin unit, are at high risk of ME and at risk&#xD;
      of safety issues. However, medication reconciliation process is very time consuming with an&#xD;
      average of 30 minutes by patient. Thereby, review of all inpatients within 24 hours of&#xD;
      admissions is very difficult or impossible. Targeting &quot;high-risk situation&quot; and &quot;high-risk&#xD;
      patient&quot; are crucial to detect ME before causing harm. Therefore, evaluating the risk of MEs&#xD;
      and their potential consequences in specific population of internal medicine unit using a&#xD;
      validated medication reconciliation process seems of utmost importance for internal medicine&#xD;
      specialist clinical practice and the decrease of ME rate. Consequently, the aim of our study&#xD;
      was to (i) evaluate the prevalence of ME in an internal medicine unit at admission of&#xD;
      hospitalization, (ii) determine the type of medication involved and the potential clinical&#xD;
      impact of ME and (iii) identify factors associated with a risk of ME and serious ME.&#xD;
