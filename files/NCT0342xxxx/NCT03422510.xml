      This is a multicenter, open label, randomized study investigating two dose titration regimens&#xD;
      of CXA-10 in subjects at least 18 years of age with primary FSGS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed at approximately 25 study centers across the United States of&#xD;
      America (USA). The recruitment period is anticipated to be up to approximately 16 months.&#xD;
      Approximately 30 subjects will be randomized to ensure 26 subjects complete the study. An&#xD;

      Study participation for each subject will last up to 5 months. The study will consist of a&#xD;
      screening period not to exceed 30 days (1 month), 90-day (3 month) treatment period, and an&#xD;
      approximate 28-day (1 month) follow-up period after the last dose of study medication. An&#xD;

             comply with study-related procedures).&#xD;
