      Surgery induced sterile inflammation leaves behind a biomolecular footprint measurable by&#xD;
      various pro-inflammatory markers e.g. IL-6, CD(Cluster of differentiation)19B,&#xD;
      HsCRP(High-sensitivity CRP) etc. Music is a non-pharmacological means in attenuating this&#xD;
      inflammatory pathway thereby improving Health related quality of life measurable by improved&#xD;
      postoperative convalescence. Correct timing of music application is a lacuna in the&#xD;
      knowledge. This research aims at evaluating the effect of preoperative music on sterile&#xD;
      inflammation induced by index Laparoscopic Surgery (Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy) and its&#xD;
      proposed beneficial effects on patient reported outcomes. A total of 50 patients divided into&#xD;
      2 groups (test and control) will be evaluated in this triple blind randomized controlled&#xD;
      study aiming at evaluating the biomolecular signatures of sterile inflammatory response and&#xD;
      its correlation with improved postoperative convalescence. All the patients will be followed&#xD;
      up for a period of 1 month postoperatively to assess for overall improvement in health&#xD;
      related quality of life. Collected data will be analysed using updated SPSS software and a p&#xD;
      value of less than 0.05 will be taken as statistically significant in support of the measured&#xD;
      indices.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Historically, surgery was seen as the last resort to preserve life. Even today,&#xD;
      the popular acceptance of surgery is premised upon it being either as the only treatment&#xD;
      option or as the last option after all nonsurgical treatments have been unsuccessful. This is&#xD;
      attributable to the patient anxiety about the protracted convalescence, besides its clinical&#xD;
      morbidity. Over last two centuries, surgery has evolved from being misery alleviating to&#xD;
      being life-saving and then to being limb-preserving and finally function preserving as well.&#xD;
      Last 30 years have witnessed the introduction of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) into&#xD;
      surgical practice. Application of MIS in various surgical domains has achieved clinical&#xD;
      equivalence with the established benchmarks of the conventional surgery. The spectrum of&#xD;
      clinical equivalence besides positive outcomes includes the whole spectrum of the established&#xD;
      various morbidity indicators like procedure specific complications, length of hospital stay&#xD;
      and long-term morbidity. The focus for further evolution in surgery has marched from being&#xD;
      clinical outcome based on the patient-reported outcome (PRO) specific. The improvement in&#xD;
      PRO's has been attributed to attenuated postoperative inflammatory response, which has been&#xD;
      studied by the changes in cytokine pathways. This cytokine-mediated inflammatory response is&#xD;
      shown to be subdued after MIS as compared to conventional surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parallel to emphasis on PROs, surgery evolved with considerations for early and speedier&#xD;
      convalescence. This led to the concept of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) being the&#xD;
      current stated objective. Postoperative convalescence (POC) is a function of the inflammatory&#xD;
      response following surgery. This postoperative inflammatory response consists of a sterile&#xD;
      inflammation apart from classical inflammation if any infection coexists. Sterile&#xD;
      inflammation determines outcomes like postoperative fatigue (POF), postoperative pain (POP),&#xD;
      postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and circadian disturbances leading to compromised&#xD;
      quality of sleep. All these factors directly influence postoperative convalescence as well as&#xD;
      PROs. Patient perspective has been classically described by the aphorism &quot;Surgery leaves&#xD;
      scars on the mind as well&quot;. This sentiment now has scientific resonance, as now it is&#xD;
      understood that the mediators of sterile inflammation are influenced temporarily and by&#xD;
      neurohumoral pathways. Sterile inflammation is mediated by various cytokine and&#xD;
      immunosuppressive pathways. It is primarily driven by danger associated molecular proteins&#xD;
      (DAMP), also known as alarmins. These alarmins trigger a biocellular response by expansion of&#xD;
      many cell lines. The CD19B cell line is known to expand the most. These biocellular responses&#xD;
      then initiate a cascade of cytokines of which IL6 is the most dominant. It is the balance of&#xD;
      these two, that determines the severity of sterile inflammation hence the POC. Current&#xD;
      scientific discourse is on modulating this sterile inflammatory pathway. Pharmaceutical&#xD;
      interventions by anti-inflammatory drugs are already known to attenuate this pathway and make&#xD;
      the patient feel better but are not free of side effects. Non-pharmaceutical interventions&#xD;
      have recently been studied for the same effect with an additional benefit of avoiding side&#xD;
      effects of drugs. Perioperative music has been shown to improve both POC as well as PROs.&#xD;
      However, this benefit has been reported for preoperative &amp; peroperative music for surgeries&#xD;
      under local or locoregional anaesthesia. Effect of preoperative music has not been studied&#xD;
      for outcomes of surgeries done under general anaesthesia. The biocellular and biomolecular&#xD;
      basis of this effect of music has not been clearly established. The most beneficial timing of&#xD;
      music i.e. preoperative or peroperative is also not scientifically clear. The studies showing&#xD;
      benefits of preoperative music are based upon surgeries under local-locoregional anaesthesia&#xD;
      In a recent study done at our institution, study, peroperative music has been found to be&#xD;
      beneficial. This study was done on the index MIS i.e. laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC)under&#xD;
      general anaesthesia (GA). Peroperative music was found to have a biocellular as well as&#xD;
      biomolecular signature. It causes attenuation of sterile inflammation by controlling the&#xD;
      expansion of CD19 cell population&amp;, limiting the suppression of NK cell population and&#xD;
      moderating the IL6 surge. Music-induced fall in IL6 as the beneficial biomolecular response&#xD;
      has already been known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this background of established benefits of perioperative music but no study having&#xD;
      tested preoperative music for surgery under GA, and an established known biocellular -&#xD;
      biomolecular basis of peroperative / postoperative music for surgeries done under GA&#xD;
      benefits, the investigator hypothesize that preoperative music could also have similar&#xD;
      benefits for surgeries done under and GA, and a biomolecular basis for the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REVIEW OF LITERATURE Historically, practice of surgery started as the last resort for&#xD;
      preservation of life. Over the last two centuries it has improved with progressive reduction&#xD;
      in not only mortality but and significant improvements in clinical morbidity. With the advent&#xD;
      of MIS, not only the clinical benchmarks of the conventional era were expected to be achieved&#xD;
      matched with heightened community expectations. The practice of MIS was initially driven by&#xD;
      its popular appeal despite the absence of any supportive level I evidence. The benefits of&#xD;
      MIS were primarily based upon PROs. The benefits included reduced wound morbidity both in&#xD;
      short-term (wound infections) as well as long-term (an incisional hernia). Other popular&#xD;
      advantages included shorter hospital stay, less postoperative pain, lesser analgesia usage,&#xD;
      early return to activity and better patient-reported health-related quality of life (HrQoL).&#xD;
      All these made MIS popular both with society as well as with profession.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application of MIS to most of the surgical domains was aided by paralleled advances in&#xD;
      technological technology advances and innovations. In last 30 years of MIS experience, the&#xD;
      clinical and PRO outcomes have stabilized. Current scientific discourse is on improving POC.&#xD;
      Postoperative convalescence is akin to side effects of medicines in non-surgical practice.&#xD;
      Postoperative convalescence is dependent upon various factors. Postoperative pain, PONV, POF,&#xD;
      sleep disturbances and analgesia required are some of these factors. Postoperative&#xD;
      convalescence is variable for similar surgeries. Prolonged POC leads to personal suffering,&#xD;
      functional impairment, delayed return to work, and significant societal and economic costs.&#xD;
      Postoperative convalescence has been defined as the &quot;process to regain control over physical,&#xD;
      psychological, social and habitual functions, and return to preoperative levels of&#xD;
      independence and psychological well-being&quot;. It marks a shift from conventional recovery&#xD;
      indicators e.g. length of hospital stay, to PROs like the absence of symptoms, the ability to&#xD;
      perform regular activities, return to work, and regain quality of life. Major determinants of&#xD;
      slow POC are fatigue, pain and resulting functional impairment. Fatigue is the key sickness&#xD;
      behaviour fined as &quot;an indefinable weakness throughout the body requiring sitting or lying&#xD;
      down after minor tasks&quot;. The POC delaying factors are a clinical manifestation of an&#xD;
      inflammatory process induced by surgery and stress of surgery. This inflammatory process&#xD;
      happens in absence of any infective agent hence is called 'Sterile inflammation'. This&#xD;
      sterile inflammation is a result of various cellular, biomolecular, immune changes induced by&#xD;
      surgery. These are mediated by signalling that involves the production of cytokines,&#xD;
      expansion of certain cell populations and contraction of some cell population. These changes&#xD;
      happening within 24 hrs and are strongly associated with the speed of POC. Surgery induces a&#xD;
      local immune response which leads to systemic proinflammatory and immunosuppressive phases&#xD;
      which are temporally related and proportionate in magnitude. This response is mediated by a&#xD;
      battery of cytokines of which IL6 is not only the beginner but also most dominant. Tissue&#xD;
      injury is sensed by a group of protein receptors known as pattern recognition receptors&#xD;
      (PRR). These PRRs can be activated by pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and DAMP.&#xD;
      The surgery induced sterile inflammation has no PAMP hence the DAMP is primary driver of the&#xD;
      inflammatory cascade. Various pharmaceutical interventions (anti-inflammatory agents) have&#xD;
      been used to attenuate or abort this sterile inflammation towards the goal of enhancing POC,&#xD;
      but they are not free of side effects &amp; contraindications. Music has been shown to have a&#xD;
      positive influence on POC and PROs with supportive robust Level 1 evidence. Yet there is&#xD;
      debate on many issues-&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relative efficacy of preoperative music under general anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Choice of music, whether patients or surgeons.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of music, classical or otherwise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The timing of music, whether preoperative or peroperative or both.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether patient alone or the entire OT team. These issues are pertinent because some&#xD;
           surgeons accept the benefits to their patients but distracting to their staff. Some&#xD;
           colleagues demand evidence better than the available Level 1 A evidence and consider it&#xD;
           potential disruptor of communication&amp; dangerous for patient safety. They find support&#xD;
           from studies giving a scientific camouflage in concluding that music may contribute to&#xD;
           decreasing in auditory processing function see music as noise in the OT. These naysayers&#xD;
           have had robust rebuttals from other colleagues. Giving the choice of music to the&#xD;
           patient has been shown to increase add to preoperative anxiety and compromise its&#xD;
           benefits but some studies have advocated patient choice. But none of the studies has&#xD;
           tested preoperative music for surgery done under GA. The investigator has earlier&#xD;
           studied the effect of peroperative music and found it to be beneficial. It is not known&#xD;
           whether preoperative music will have similar benefits or not? Hence, the investigator&#xD;
           hypothesized to study this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits of music are related to attenuation of sterile inflammation and the inflammation&#xD;
      is measurable with cytokine - immunosuppressive pathways. These pathways need to be studied&#xD;
      for the effect of DAMPS. Thermal energy has a specific DAMP known case of heat called heat&#xD;
      shock protein (HSP). The thermal energy specific sterile inflammation and its impact on PROs&#xD;
      / POC have been reported earlier. This HSP related inflammatory component and its attendant&#xD;
      cytokine response have also been studied and reported. As thermal component has its specific&#xD;
      signature, any study of sterile inflammation induced by non-HSP DAMPs requires the surgery to&#xD;
      be done without application of thermal energy. Hence an MIS procedure that is done without&#xD;
      energy has to be subject to study. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be done safely, without&#xD;
      an application of energized dissection by thermal energy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is an&#xD;
      index MIS surgery for any innovations or PRO based studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study of biomolecular changes and their effect on PROs, and POC in a setting of an HSP&#xD;
      milieu, is thus an appropriate model to study the effect of preoperative music. Hence, the&#xD;
      investigator proposes to study the biomolecular (IL6, TNF alpha, HSCRP, procalcitonin) and&#xD;
      PROs (POP, PONV, POF, postoperative sleep quality, HrQoL and quantitative analgesia usage) in&#xD;
      an HSP DAMP driven surgical milieu of an index MIS i.e. LC without the usage of surgical&#xD;
      energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is already known?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perioperative Peroperative and postoperative music are beneficial in improving&#xD;
           'postoperative convalescence' and 'patient reported outcomes' following surgery under&#xD;
           all kinds of anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  These benefits are demonstrable in unaware (under GA) peroperative phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The peroperative music related benefits have a quantitative biomolecular footprint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lacunae in our knowledge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effect of preoperative music on 'postoperative convalescence' and 'patient reported&#xD;
           outcomes' following surgery under GA has not been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biomolecular response specific to preoperative music in surgeries done even under&#xD;
           locoregional anaesthesia (without GA) has not been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS • Preoperative music could have beneficial effects on 'postoperative&#xD;
      convalescence' and 'patient reported outcomes' following laparoscopic surgery under general&#xD;
      anaesthesia GA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS AND OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To study the effect of preoperative music on 'postoperative convalescence' and 'patient&#xD;
      reported outcomes' following laparoscopic surgery under general anaesthesia'&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To study the biomolecular response specific to preoperative music.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  STUDY SITE- Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TIME &amp; Duration of the study- From October 2017 until January 2019&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  STUDY DESIGN-Triple-blinded Randomized Study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SAMPLE SIZE - A reduction in pain scores (between 6-24 hours after surgery) from 48.04&#xD;
           (SD 11.07) to 26.54[16] (10.03) with a p-value of 0.000 has been seen in the&#xD;
           investigator's previous study on the effect of peroperative music in the similar study&#xD;
           population. To study the similar benefit of preoperative music with a confidence&#xD;
           interval of 99% and an alpha error of 0.01 and power of 90%, a sample size of 16 i.e. 8&#xD;
           patients in each arm is required. With possible trial deviates attrition of 33%, the&#xD;
           sample size required will be 24 (12 in each group). Given the window of time available,&#xD;
           a minimum of 24 patients (12 in each group) but the desirability of population size&#xD;
           similar to our last study with peroperative music, the investigator intends to have a&#xD;
           sample size of 50 (25 in each group). An intention to treat analysis will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RANDOMIZATION- Computer generated randomization by an independent external research&#xD;
           coordinator and will be telecommunicated to the nurse in preoperative area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants found eligible and compliant with inclusion criteria will be enrolled for&#xD;
      the study. Demographic and clinical data of the participants will be recorded in a standard&#xD;
      proforma (Annexure II). A standard protocol for perioperative medicines including&#xD;
      Anaesthesia, antibiotics, chemoprophylaxis and analgesia etc. will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be allocated to either study or control group by an independent&#xD;
      external research co-coordinator (based upon a random sequence computer generation). The&#xD;
      external coordinator will inform about the group allocation to the nurse in preoperative hold&#xD;
      area (POHA), by phone or any web-based media network (SMS and/or WhatsApp).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard post-operative recovery clinical pathway compatible with ERAS and protocol for&#xD;
      'fast track surgery', will be followed by the discharge ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of shifting of the patient, from the ward to POHA, a Bluetooth Headphone will be&#xD;
      applied put on the participants. Once in POHA, an independent nurse will either start the&#xD;
      music or not, as per the random group assigned. The participants will stay for 60 to 90&#xD;
      minutes in POHA. They will be shifted with the headphones to the operation theatre. The&#xD;
      headphones will be removed at the time of induction of anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An EEG will be done in the ward before transfer to POHA, during surgery and 24 hours after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be drawn at the time of transfer from the ward to POHA i.e. prior to&#xD;
      application of headphones (HT0), at the time of before induction of anaesthesia (TH1), at 6&#xD;
      hours after surgery (TH2) and at 24 hours after surgery (TH3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Premedication- All participants will receive premedication with alprazolam (0.25 mg) the&#xD;
      night before surgery and ranitidine (150 mg per oral, the night before surgery and 120 min&#xD;
      before surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive pre-induction fentanyl citrate 2 micrograms /kg. Routine&#xD;
      monitoring (Pulse Oximetry, EKG, NIBP) will be applied. A bi-spectral index (BIS) sensor for&#xD;
      monitoring the depth of Anaesthesia, using the BIS monitoring module, will also be applied&#xD;
      over the participant's forehead according to the manufacturer's instructions prior to the&#xD;
      induction of anaesthesia. After pre-oxygenation, anaesthesia will be induced with propofol up&#xD;
      to 2.0mg/kg body weight to the point of loss of verbal contact. Atracurium besylate will be&#xD;
      administered 0.5mg/kg to facilitate tracheal intubation. General Anaesthesia will be&#xD;
      maintained with sevoflurane (1-2%) and 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen titrated to maintain a BIS&#xD;
      value between 40-60. Fentanyl citrate 0.5 microgram/kg will be administered every 30 minutes&#xD;
      intraoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively, paracetamol 1 gm I.V. will be administered if the visual analogue scale&#xD;
      (VAS) score is &gt;30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hemodynamic markers of the depth of Anaesthesia like pulse, blood pressure, saturation of&#xD;
      peripheral oxygen (SpO2), and end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) concentration will be recorded&#xD;
      in a standard proforma (Annexure III). Standard four-port technique of LC without energized&#xD;
      dissection will be followed [35].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical procedure will be video-recorded for prospective anatomical analysis and&#xD;
      retrospective reference. Duration of surgery will be recorded with reference to the different&#xD;
      stations of intervention i.e. induction of anaesthesia, first surgical incision, complete&#xD;
      separation of GB from liver bed and extubation. Peroperative surgical data will be recorded&#xD;
      in a standard proforma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative clinical data will be recorded in a standard proforma. This post-operative protocol&#xD;
      will be followed by the surgical nurses in the common post-operative area where all the&#xD;
      operated cases are managed. Standard criteria based discharged protocol will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be discharged after clearance from with protocol-based consensus of the&#xD;
      anaesthesia team, nursing team and surgical team. A standard discharge advice will be given&#xD;
      to the participants incorporating the various post-operative diary protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PRO's and the clinical outcome will be analyzed by Clavien and Dindo classification of&#xD;
      surgical complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis The prospectively collected data will be entered into an excel sheet&#xD;
      (Windows Microsoft 8 or higher version). The data will be analyzed using the latest version&#xD;
      of SPSS (statistical package for social science). Qualitative data will be compared using&#xD;
      Chi-square test and quantitative data using Student's t-test, or any other appropriate&#xD;
      statistical tool. A p-value less than 0.05 will be considered significant. An intention to&#xD;
      treat analysis will be done.&#xD;
