  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an empagliflozin&#xD;
      dosing regimen and one dose of linagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes who are aged 10&#xD;
      to below 18 years and are currently taking metformin, insulin or both drugs (DINAMO TM) or&#xD;
      who are treatment naïve or not on active treatment after metformin withdrawal (DINAMO TM&#xD;
      MONO) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Empagliflozin and linagliptin are both approved for use in adult patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. This study will assess how well empagliflozin and linagliptin work by finding out&#xD;
      how these treatments affect blood glucose (sugar) levels compared to placebo (a pill that&#xD;
      contains no active drug), in children and adolescents. Empagliflozin and linagliptin are&#xD;
      considered investigational products in this study since while they have been approved for use&#xD;
      in adults, they have not been approved for children and adolescents due to lack of clinical&#xD;
      studies in this specific population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with type 2 diabetes have higher levels of blood glucose (sugar) than patients who&#xD;
      do not have this disease. The high level of sugar in the blood can lead to serious short-term&#xD;
      and long-term medical problems. The main goal of treating diabetic patients is to lower blood&#xD;
      glucose to a normal level. Lowering and controlling blood glucose help prevent or delay&#xD;
      complications of diabetes such as heart disease, kidney, eye and nerve diseases, and the&#xD;
      possibility of amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Empagliflozin is a drug that helps to reduce blood glucose (sugar) levels by causing glucose&#xD;
      to be excreted in the urines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linagliptin works by increasing the production of insulin (a hormone that controls the level&#xD;
      of blood glucose) after meals when blood glucose (sugar) levels are too high. This helps to&#xD;
      lower blood sugar levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will either receive one of the active study drugs or a placebo. This study will&#xD;
      be double blind; this means that neither the subject, nor the study doctor will know which&#xD;
      treatment the subject will receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Which treatment the subject receives is decided by a computer, purely by chance; this is&#xD;
      called a &quot;random assignment&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, there will first be a screening visit, followed by a 2-week placebo run-in&#xD;
      period (all subjects will take placebo once daily). This run-in period is designed to ensure&#xD;
      subjects are able to take the study drugs as described in the study protocol. Thereafter&#xD;
      there will be a 26-week treatment phase (week 1-week 26) and a 26-week safety extension&#xD;
      period (week 27-week 52). Following this there will be a follow-up visit at week 55.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 after the placebo run-in phase, the subject will be randomly assigned to receive one&#xD;
      of the 3 treatments: empagliflozin 10 mg, linagliptin 5 mg or placebo in a blinded manner.&#xD;
      This treatment will continue up to week 14. Then after week 14, the subject will be assigned&#xD;
      to receive one of the following 4 treatments: empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg,&#xD;
      linagliptin 5 mg or placebo in a blinded manner. The drugs assigned after week 14 will be the&#xD;
      same drugs as on Day 1 but some subjects will receive a higher dose of empagliflozin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of the 26-week treatment period, the subject will enter a 26-week safety&#xD;
      extension period. The same active treatment that the subject had been assigned to at week 14&#xD;
      visit will be continued. Subjects assigned to placebo on Day 1 will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive one of the 3 active treatments: empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg or&#xD;
      linagliptin 5 mg in a blinded manner. This safety extension period is primarily designed to&#xD;
      provide additional information on how well empagliflozin and linagliptin are tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the treatment phases, there will be a follow-up visit at week 55&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention model description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects with HbA1c of 6.5% to 10.5% at screening will be randomized in a 1:1:1&#xD;
      ratio to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, linagliptin 5 mg or placebo. HbA1c assessment will be&#xD;
      performed at Week 12. All subjects with Week 12 HbA1c &lt; 7% will remain on previously assigned&#xD;
      randomized treatment. Subjects taking empagliflozin with Week 12 HbA1c &gt;= 7% will be&#xD;
      re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to continue on the low dose treatment (empagliflozin 10 mg) or&#xD;
      up-titrate to the high dose treatment (empagliflozin 25 mg). Subjects taking linagliptin or&#xD;
      placebo with Week 12 HbA1c &gt;= 7% will remain on previously assigned treatment. All subjects&#xD;
      will get new medication kits dispensed at Week 14 to maintain the blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 26, all subjects previously assigned to placebo will be re-randomized in a 1:1:1:&#xD;
      ratio to receive one of the active treatments: empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg or&#xD;
      linagliptin 5 mg. All subjects will get new medication kits dispensed at Week 14 to maintain&#xD;
      the blinding.&#xD;
