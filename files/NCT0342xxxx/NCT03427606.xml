      This prospective randomized pilot study is aimed to verify if the operative time of a&#xD;
      standard laparoscopic sacral colpopexy associated to subtotal hysterectomy for the treatment&#xD;
      of POP could be further reduced using a continuous locked suture vs. conventional single&#xD;
      5-points suture for anterior mesh fixation.&#xD;

      Introduction Pelvic-organ prolapse, in which the pelvic organs (uterus, bladder, and bowel)&#xD;
      protrude into or past the vaginal introitus, is a condition often treated with surgery. Women&#xD;
      have an 11 percent risk of surgery for prolapse or urinary incontinence by 80 years of age,&#xD;
      and of this 11 percent, almost one third of the women have a second surgery. This fact points&#xD;
      to the need for improved treatment of pelvic-floor disorders. Numerous surgical procedures&#xD;
      have been described for the management of POP. Vaginal surgery may be associated with less&#xD;
      postoperative pain and a more rapid return to daily living than abdominal repair. However, in&#xD;
      a randomised study, sacrocolpopexy was twice as likely to result in optimal anatomical&#xD;
      outcome as vaginal surgery. Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy provides the potential to combine the&#xD;
      success rates of an abdominal approach with the faster recovery associated with a minimally&#xD;
      invasive technique. Tissue dissection and mesh placement may also be facilitated by the&#xD;
      magnification and field of view permitted by the laparoscopic approach. These benefits must&#xD;
      be balanced against a longer operating time from 150 to 250 minutes according to surgeons'&#xD;
      experience. In addition, this procedure is often associated to subtotal hysterectomy (LSH)&#xD;
      for the reasons of prevention (post-menopause age) or uterine diseases, which improve still&#xD;
      more the operating time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective randomized pilot study is aimed to verify if the operative time of a&#xD;
      standard laparoscopic sacral colpopexy associated to subtotal hysterectomy for the treatment&#xD;
      of POP could be further reduced using using a continuous locked suture vs. conventional&#xD;
      5-points single suture for anterior mesh fixation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endopoints of this comparison are incidence of intra- or postoperative&#xD;
      complications estimated blood loss, postoperative pain (evaluated by VAS), days of&#xD;
      hospitalization and costs for the health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis and Study Design This is a single Institution prospective randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial conducted at the Pia Fondazione Panico of Tricase, Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To have an imbalanced results and to reduce any bias, a randomization list has been checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probability (p) values will be considered to be statistically significant at the &lt;0.05 level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be recruited 20 patients to treat using continuous locked suture and 20 patients&#xD;
      to treat with standard 5-points single suture for mesh fixation comparing these two&#xD;
      techniques in terms of operative time, estimated blood loss and other intra- or post&#xD;
      operative complications, postoperative pain, days of hospitalization, costs. All patients&#xD;
      will be adequately informed and inserted in the study only after having read and signed an&#xD;
      informed consent. Diagnostic, clinical and surgical data of each patient will be&#xD;
      prospectively recorded. At the end of the procedure, a schedule will be compiled with&#xD;
      intraoperative data. All clinical and histologic data will be recorded prospectively using a&#xD;
      database. Pain associated with the procedure will be evaluated by a subjective assessment&#xD;
      (analysis of VAS scale values reported by patients at 8 and 24 hours after surgery).&#xD;
      Post-operative complications will be evaluated during the first 30 days after surgery&#xD;
      according to Dindo's classification.&#xD;
