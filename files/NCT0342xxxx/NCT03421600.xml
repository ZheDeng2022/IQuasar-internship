      The adenoma detection rate by colonoscopy for asymptomatic individuals aged 50 years and&#xD;
      older is estimated to be at least 25%. It is known that during colonoscopy, lesions may be&#xD;
      missed. Image enhanced endoscopy techniques have been evaluated for the detection and&#xD;
      differentiation of colonic polyps. Narrow band imaging (NBI), is one such technique. The&#xD;
      common classification systems used predict histology is the NICE and the Sano and JNET&#xD;
      classification. The NICE classification can be used without optical magnification; it&#xD;
      evaluates the color of the lesion, regularity of the overlying vessels and regularity of the&#xD;
      surface pattern. The Sano and JNET classification requires optical magnification in order to&#xD;
      assess the capillary patterns such as whether there is dilation, irregularity or loss of&#xD;
      irregular capillaries over the lesion. In the context of adenoma detection, the results are&#xD;
      more contentious. A meta-analysis of randomized studies examining the utility of the first&#xD;
      generation NBI system when compared to high definition WLI showed no difference in detection&#xD;
      rates. A criticism of the NBI system had been the dark endoscopic view; this is a result of&#xD;
      the optical filter, and can limit the far view. A second generation NBI system has since been&#xD;
      developed. It is characterized by much brighter illumination despite the optical filter, and&#xD;
      thus the far view is improved. A recent randomized controlled study compared the&#xD;
      second-generation NBI system with high definition WLI. NBI was shown to improve polyp and&#xD;
      adenoma detection rates compared to WLI. Blue laser imaging (BLI) is another form of narrow&#xD;
      bandwidth imaging developed by Fujifilm Corporation (Tokyo, Japan). Instead of using an&#xD;
      optical filter for white light to produce narrow bandwidths, the BLI system has a unique&#xD;
      feature of illumination using two lasers and a white light phosphor to accomplish the visual&#xD;
      enhancement of surface vessels and structures. This study aims to determine whether BLI can&#xD;
      increase the detection rate of colonic polyps and adenomas when compared to white light&#xD;
      endoscopy, with the null hypothesis being no difference in detection rates. This study will&#xD;
      also examine the use of NICE and Sano/ JNET classification systems to predict histology with&#xD;
      the BLI system.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND The adenoma detection rate by colonoscopy for asymptomatic individuals aged 50&#xD;
      years and older is estimated to be at least 25%. It is known that during colonoscopy, lesions&#xD;
      may be missed. The miss rates for lesions depend on its size. In a meta-analysis, the overall&#xD;
      miss rates for colonic polyps of any size was 22% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 19 - 26%)&#xD;
      but based on size of adenomas, the miss rates ranged from 26% (95% CI: 21 - 30%) for lesions&#xD;
      1 - 5mm, to 13% (95% CI: 8 - 20%) for lesions 5 - 9mm and 2 (95% CI: 1 - 8%) for lesions&#xD;
      larger than 10mm. Factors implicated in missed lesions include poor bowel preparation, short&#xD;
      withdrawal time, lack of meticulous examination, and possibly subtle mucosal changes,&#xD;
      especially for small or flat adenomas, that may be easily missed on white light imaging&#xD;
      (WLI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Image enhanced endoscopy techniques have been evaluated for the detection and differentiation&#xD;
      of colonic polyps. Narrow band imaging (NBI), developed by Olympus Corporation (Tokyo, Japan)&#xD;
      is one such technique and is a function available in all colonoscopies as a press button.&#xD;
      When NBI is activated, an optical filter is applied to the white light source, such that only&#xD;
      the narrow bandwidths of blue (440 - 460 nm) and green (540 - 560 nm) wavelengths are&#xD;
      transmitted. These narrow bandwidths enhance the visualization of blood vessels and mucosal&#xD;
      pit patterns. This technique has been shown to be useful in predicting colonic polyp&#xD;
      histology and depth of mucosal invasion in the context of intra-mucosal cancer. The two&#xD;
      common classification systems used predict histology is the NICE and the Sano classification.&#xD;
      The NICE classification can be used without optical magnification; it evaluates the color of&#xD;
      the lesion, regularity of the overlying vessels and regularity of the surface pattern. The&#xD;
      Sano classification requires optical magnification in order to assess the capillary patterns&#xD;
      such as whether there is dilation, irregularity or loss of irregular capillaries over the&#xD;
      lesion. In the context of adenoma detection, the results are more contentious. A&#xD;
      meta-analysis of randomized studies examining the utility of the first generation NBI system&#xD;
      when compared to high definition WLI showed no difference in detection rates; it was only&#xD;
      superior when compared to non high definition WLI, which may not be so relevant now since&#xD;
      most new systems use high definition WLI. A criticism of the NBI system had been the dark&#xD;
      endoscopic view; this is a result of the optical filter, and can limit the far view. A second&#xD;
      generation NBI system has since been developed. It is characterized by much brighter&#xD;
      illumination despite the optical filter, and thus the far view is improved. A recent&#xD;
      randomized controlled study compared the second-generation NBI system with high definition&#xD;
      WLI. NBI was shown to improve polyp and adenoma detection rates compared to WLI (adenoma:&#xD;
      48.3% vs. 34.4%, p = 0.01; polyps: 61.1% vs. 48.3%, p = 0.02).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blue laser imaging (BLI) is another form of narrow bandwidth imaging developed by Fujifilm&#xD;
      Corporation (Tokyo, Japan). It is a function integrated into the colonoscopy systems and can&#xD;
      be activated and alternated with white light endoscopy by a push button. There is also&#xD;
      optical magnification capability, thereby allowing detailed examination of micro-surface and&#xD;
      micro-capillary structures. Instead of using an optical filter for white light to produce&#xD;
      narrow bandwidths, the BLI system has a unique feature of illumination using two lasers and a&#xD;
      white light phosphor to accomplish the visual enhancement of surface vessels and structures.&#xD;
      A laser with a wavelength of 450nm stimulates the phosphor to irradiate a white-color&#xD;
      illumination. The other laser, with a wavelength of 410nm, is used to enhance the blood&#xD;
      vessels at shallow depth in the mucosa. Early data has shown its usefulness in predicting the&#xD;
      histology of mucosal lesions. A comparative study showed that BLI had a greater far view&#xD;
      compared to NBI due to its much brighter illumination. Thus far there has been no study to&#xD;
      determine whether the use of BLI will increase the detection rate of colonic polyps and&#xD;
      adenomas when compared to WLE. In addition, there has been no prior study of applying the&#xD;
      NICE and Sano classifications developed using NBI to BLI. Recently in Japan a workgroup has&#xD;
      proposed the JNET classification system to characterize polyps. This has not been applied&#xD;
      using the BLI system either, being developed under NBI. Similar to Sano classification, this&#xD;
      uses optical magnification. The main difference between the JNET and San classification&#xD;
      systems is that in JNET classification system, Sano 2 is named JNET 2A, and Sano 3A is&#xD;
      subsumed under JNET 2B, and Sano 3A becomes JNET 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM This study aims to determine whether BLI can increase the detection rate of colonic&#xD;
      polyps and adenomas when compared to white light endoscopy, with the null hypothesis being no&#xD;
      difference in detection rates. This study will also examine the use of NICE and Sano and JNET&#xD;
      classification systems to predict histology with the BLI system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS This is a prospective randomized controlled study. Patients will be randomized in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio in blocks of 10 to undergo either BLI or WLI colonoscopy. Randomization will be&#xD;
      carried out by computer-generated random sequences. Once informed consent is obtained, the&#xD;
      research assistant will disclose the assigned imaging technique (BLI or WLI) to the&#xD;
      responsible endoscopist before the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technique of colonoscopy and imaging All patients will be given dietary instructions before&#xD;
      colonoscopy and will be prescribed four litres of polyethylene glycol in a split dose for&#xD;
      bowel cleansing 1 day before colonoscopy. The Fujifilm colonoscope with WLI and BLI&#xD;
      functions, and optical magnification capability (EC-L590ZW) and Fujifilm LASERO video&#xD;
      endoscopy system, which supports WLI and BLI functions of the colonoscope, will be used.&#xD;
      Colonoscopy will be performed under conscious sedation with intravenous midazolam and/or&#xD;
      fentanyl. In the BLI group, insertion to cecum will be performed under WLI and once the cecum&#xD;
      is reached, the BLI mode is switched on during withdrawal of endoscope for complete colonic&#xD;
      examination. In the WLI group, WLI will be used during both insertion and withdrawal.&#xD;
      Withdrawal time is defined as the time of the initiation of cecal inspection to the time when&#xD;
      the colonoscope is completely removed from anus. The time for polypectomy will not be&#xD;
      included. A dedicated research assistant measured the withdrawal time by using a stopwatch.&#xD;
      The withdrawal time is set to a minimum of 6 min even in patients in whom no polyps are&#xD;
      found. Bowel preparation of the whole colon will be graded according the Boston Bowel&#xD;
      Preparation Scale which is routinely used in clinical practice and captured in the electronic&#xD;
      reporting system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sizes and locations of all colonic polyps will be recorded contemporaneously. The&#xD;
      locations of colonic lesions will be identified by anatomical landmarks or by&#xD;
      transillumination. The size of colonic lesions will be measured against the span of an opened&#xD;
      biopsy forceps. Regardless of the assigned group, once a polyp is detected during withdrawal,&#xD;
      prior to removal, the surface structure of each polyp detected will be first assessed without&#xD;
      optical magnification under BLI using the NICE classification. Thereafter optical&#xD;
      magnification will be applied and the polyp will be classified using the Sano and JNET&#xD;
      classification. Images will be captured electronically and stored in the electronic medical&#xD;
      reporting system and can be retrieved for audit and verification and study of inter-observer&#xD;
      agreement. All lesions will be resected or biopsied and labelled for histological&#xD;
      examination. If more than 5 polyps are detected, the largest 5 polyps will be used for&#xD;
      endoscopic-histological correlation. All procedures will be performed by either experienced&#xD;
      endoscopists who have performed at least 1,000 colonoscopies or by endoscopy fellows under&#xD;
      direct supervision of the experienced specialists. All endoscopists will have prior&#xD;
      experience with image enhanced endoscopy using the NBI system. Prior to the start of the&#xD;
      study, the NICE and Sano and JNET classifications will be formally reviewed with all&#xD;
      participating endoscopists to ensure familiarity with these classifications for polyp&#xD;
      assessment. To familiarize endoscopists with the BLI system, all endoscopists will be asked&#xD;
      to carry out at least five examinations with the BLI system before performing study cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions Complete colonoscopy is defined as successful cecal intubation. All colonic&#xD;
      polyps removed during each examination will be sent for histological examination with clear&#xD;
      labelling of location. Histological interpretation of all polyps will follow the World Health&#xD;
      Organization system. Advanced adenoma will be defined as adenoma ≥ 10 mm in diameter, with&#xD;
      any villous histology, high-grade dysplasia, or invasive carcinoma. Adenoma detection rate&#xD;
      and polyp detection rate will be defined as the proportion of patients with at least one&#xD;
      adenoma and one polyp respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes The primary outcomes of this study will be the differences in adenoma (overall and&#xD;
      flat) and polyp detection rates of BLI with WLI during diagnostic colonoscopy. Sub-analysis&#xD;
      will be performed for the utility of NICE and Sano and JNET classification systems to predict&#xD;
      histology with the BLI system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics We estimate the overall prevalence of colorectal adenoma in the WLI colonoscopy&#xD;
      group to be 25%. In order to show a clinically important improvement of adenoma detection by&#xD;
      BLI, the new system should increase the adenoma detection rate by 15%. With a statistical&#xD;
      power of 80% and a two-sided significance level of 0.05, 152 patients will be needed in each&#xD;
      study arm (total 304).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adenoma detection rate or polyp detection rate will be calculated on the actual number of&#xD;
      patients randomized to each group. Adenoma miss rate or polyp miss rate will be based on the&#xD;
      percentage of patients who had completed the second colonoscopy. Bowel preparation will be&#xD;
      regrouped into satisfactory (excellent to good) and unsatisfactory (fair to poor) for&#xD;
      statistical analysis. The differences in detection rates between the BLI and WLI groups will&#xD;
      be compared by the student's t-test. Statistical significance is taken as a two sided p value&#xD;
      &lt; 0.05. Factors associated with adenoma detection on first colonoscopy will be first&#xD;
      identified by univariate analysis. Factors with a P value &lt; 0.1 on univariate analysis will&#xD;
      be further entered into forward stepwise logistic regression analysis. The adjusted odds&#xD;
      ratio with 95% CI will be used to describe the influence of various factors on adenoma&#xD;
      detection rate. All the above statistical analysis will be performed by SPSS statistics&#xD;
      software (version 19.0, SPSS, Chicago, IL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using histology as gold standard, we will calculate the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity,&#xD;
      and negative and positive predictive values for each component of the NICE and Sano and JNET&#xD;
      classifications and for the overall prediction by using these classification systems. The&#xD;
      differences in performance characteristics between the NICE and Sano and JNET classifications&#xD;
      will be compared. To evaluate inter-observer variability in the diagnosis of colonic polyps&#xD;
      using the NICE and Sano and JNET classifications a set of endoscopic digital images of&#xD;
      histologically confirmed colonic polyps will be reviewed independently by the participating&#xD;
      endoscopists. The k statistic, a measure of interobserver agreement over and above chance,&#xD;
      will be calculated using the statistical software StatsDirect version 2.6.2 (Stats-Direct,&#xD;
      Cheshire, UK). The strength of agreement is defined as follows: very good agreement: k more&#xD;
      than 0.8 but less than 1; good agreement: k more than 0.6 but less than 0.8; moderate&#xD;
      agreement: k more than 0.4 but less than 0.6; fair agreement: k more than 0.2 but less than&#xD;
      0.4; poor agreement: k less than 0.2.&#xD;
