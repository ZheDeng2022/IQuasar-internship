  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single centre, randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, three doses,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, exploratory efficacy and safety study. The objective of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the efficacy and safety of a single intrathecal injection of Paracetamol 3% (30&#xD;
      mg/mL) administered at 3 doses to 3 active treatment groups, as compared to placebo, for&#xD;
      post-operative analgesia in knee procedures up to 40 min duration performed under spinal&#xD;
      anaesthesia with Chloroprocaine HCl 1%.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients undergoing elective short-duration knee procedures up to 40 min duration&#xD;
      will be randomised into 4 treatment groups (15 patients per group) to receive either one of&#xD;
      the 3 single doses of Paracetamol 3% (D1: 30 mg, D2: 60 mg, D3: 90 mg) or the placebo&#xD;
      solution (P: 0.9% saline solution) by intrathecal injection (IT), according to the&#xD;
      randomised, parallel-group design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after IT paracetamol or placebo administration, all patients will receive a&#xD;
      single IT dose of Chloroprocaine HCl 1% (Non-investigational medicinal product, NIMP)&#xD;
      according to the Summary of Product Characteristics indications. The time interval between&#xD;
      paracetamol IT and chloroprocaine IT injections should not exceed 2 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include a screening phase (Visit 1, Day -21/-1), a treatment phase (IMP IT&#xD;
      administration, anaesthesia and surgical procedure: Visit 2, Day 1) and a follow-up phase&#xD;
      including an observation period (Visit 3), a final visit and two follow-ups (24 h post-dose&#xD;
      and day 7Â±1).&#xD;

In this way only one intrathecal puncture will be performed. Lumbar puncture will be done according to the standard hospital procedures.</description>

30 mg Paracetamol 3% (1 mL): Single administration by intrathecal injection just before spinal anaesthesia.&#xD;
The injection will be performed according to the hospital procedures. For the intrathecal injection of Paracetamol followed by the intrathecal injection of the anaesthetic, two needles will be used: one introducer needle, which will serve to introduce the second needle through the skin, plus one intrathecal Pencil point needle (27-G or 25-Gauge or Reganesth or Nizell needle) to which the first syringe containing Paracetamol will be attached first, followed by the second syringe with the anaesthetic. In this way only one intrathecal puncture will be performed. Lumbar puncture will be done according to the standard hospital procedures.&#xD;
NIMP: Chloroprocaine HCl 1% (10 mg/mL), solution for injection: Immediately after intrathecal administration of the Paracetamol dose or Placebo, all patients will receive a single intrathecal dose of Chloroprocaine HCl 1% according to the Summary of Product Characteristics indications. Time interval between the 2 administrations should not exceed 2 min.</description>

The injection will be performed according to the hospital procedures. For the intrathecal injection of Paracetamol followed by the intrathecal injection of the anaesthetic, two needles will be used: one introducer needle, which will serve to introduce the second needle through the skin, plus one intrathecal Pencil point needle (27-G or 25-Gauge or Reganesth or Nizell needle) to which the first syringe containing Paracetamol will be attached first, followed by the second syringe with the anaesthetic. In this way only one intrathecal puncture will be performed. Lumbar puncture will be done according to the standard hospital procedures.&#xD;
NIMP: Chloroprocaine HCl 1% (10 mg/mL), solution for injection: Immediately after intrathecal administration of the Paracetamol dose or Placebo, all patients will receive a single intrathecal dose of Chloroprocaine HCl 1% according to the Summary of Product Characteristics indications.

NIMP: Chloroprocaine HCl 1% (10 mg/mL), solution for injection: Immediately after intrathecal administration of the Paracetamol dose or Placebo, all patients will receive a single intrathecal dose of Chloroprocaine HCl 1% according to the Summary of Product Characteristics indications. Time interval between the 2 administrations should not exceed 2 min.</description>

        <title>Time to Onset of Spinal Block (i.e. Time to Readiness for Surgery)</title>
        <description>Spinal block/Readiness for surgery is defined as the presence of an adequate motor block (Bromage's score â¥ 2) and loss of Pinprick sensation, according to the Investigator's opinion. Time to readiness for surgery is defined as the time from the spinal injection (time 0 h) to achievement of readiness for surgery.</description>

The injection will be performed according to the hospital procedures. For the intrathecal injection of Paracetamol followed by the intrathecal injection of the anaesthetic, two needles will be used: one introducer needle, which will serve to introduce the second needle through the skin, plus one intrathecal Pencil point needle (27-G or 25-Gauge or Reganesth or Nizell needle) to which the first syringe containing Paracetamol will be attached first, followed by the second syringe with the anaesthetic. In this way only one intrathecal puncture will be performed. Lumbar puncture will be done according to the standard hospital procedures.&#xD;
NIMP: Chloroprocaine HCl 1% (10 mg/mL), solution for injection: Immediately after intrathecal administration of the Paracetamol dose or Placebo, all patients will receive a single intrathecal dose of Chloroprocaine HCl 1% according to the Summary of Product Characteristics indications. Time interval between the 2 administrations should not exceed 2 min.</description>

30 mg Paracetamol 3% (1 mL): Single administration by intrathecal injection just before spinal anaesthesia.&#xD;
The injection will be performed according to the hospital procedures. For the intrathecal injection of Paracetamol followed by the intrathecal injection of the anaesthetic, two needles will be used: one introducer needle, which will serve to introduce the second needle through the skin, plus one intrathecal Pencil point needle (27-G or 25-Gauge or Reganesth or Nizell needle) to which the first syringe containing Paracetamol will be attached first, followed by the second syringe with the anaesthetic. In this way only one intrathecal puncture will be performed. Lumbar puncture will be done according to the standard hospital procedures.&#xD;
NIMP: Chloroprocaine HCl 1% (10 mg/mL), solution for injection: Immediately after intrathecal administration of the Paracetamol dose or Placebo, all patients will receive a single intrathecal dose of Chloroprocaine HCl 1% according to the Summary of Product Characteristics indications. Time interval between the 2 administrations should not exceed 2 min.</description>
