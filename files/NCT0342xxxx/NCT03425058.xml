  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer (GC) is a leading global health problem and is the third most common cause of&#xD;
      cancer related death. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) followed by surgery is the&#xD;
      mainstay treatment for locally advanced gastric cancer, and variable degrees of tumor&#xD;
      regression are observed after nCRT. Treatment strategies, including close surveillance&#xD;
      without immediate surgery, have been investigated to spare patients with complete tumor&#xD;
      regression from potentially adverse outcomes of radical surgery. However, clinical and&#xD;
      radiological assessment of treatment response does not deliver an ideal accuracy of patients&#xD;
      identification with complete response. In the present study, we focused on the clinical&#xD;
      courses of patients who have developed locally advanced gastric cancer, and investigated the&#xD;
      potential clinical utility of the detection of deficient MMR(dMMR), microsatellite&#xD;
      instability(MSI) status and the decreasing level of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and&#xD;
      circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as promising biomarkers for the diagnosis and prediction of GC&#xD;
      during treatment progress. Twenty milliliters of plasma were collected at 3 time points:&#xD;
      before nCRT; after 2 cycles of nCRT; and after surgery. Firefly ctDNA NGS assays were used to&#xD;
      track ctDNA mutations previously characterized in paired tumor tissue by massively parallel&#xD;
      sequencing (MPS). We investigated whether circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) detection can reflect&#xD;
      tumor response to nCRT and detect minimal residual disease(MRD) after surgery. We compared&#xD;
      CTC and ctDNA levels to clinical, radiological and pathological assessment modalities for&#xD;
      nCRT response. The results will provide lots of information which may contribute to promote&#xD;
      the treatment of GC patients. We want to introduce these strategies into clinical practice if&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center observational study on a patient cohort of at least 80 patients&#xD;
      with histologically-confirmed locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC). The protocol used in&#xD;
      this study is approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Cancer Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate. The secondary&#xD;
      endpoints are the overall survival (OS) and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the best treatment for early and mid-stage LAGC patients is resection but even&#xD;
      with successful treatment, most patients still relapse and the 5-year survival rate is less&#xD;
      than 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with cT4a/T4bN+M0, including T4b、Bulky-N2, primary lesions are not always fully&#xD;
      excised during treatment and prognosis for these patients is generally poor. Recent studies,&#xD;
      however, have suggested that the inclusion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) can improve&#xD;
      patient outcomes by: 1) downstaging tumors and increasing the likelihood of curative&#xD;
      resection, 2) reducing the prevalence of micro metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, Oxaliplatin and s-1 combination therapy has been shown to be well-tolerated in&#xD;
      patients with recurrent or metastatic gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To best evaluate the treatment response of NCT, we plan to investigate the effect of new&#xD;
      technologies and assays on the successful prediction of patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), fragmented DNA with an average size of 166 bp, is released by&#xD;
      cancer cells into circulation. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are rare malignant cells&#xD;
      detached from tumors which enter the bloodstream. Both these biomarkers can be used for&#xD;
      prognosis and the dynamic monitoring of disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the MAGIC trial, patients with tumor that are MSI-H or MMRD, had survival rates superior&#xD;
      to those with MSS/MSI-L or MMRP tumors when treated with surgery alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will combine dMMR/MSI status with the dynamic evaluation of CTCs and ctDNA using liquid&#xD;
      biopsy technology to determine whether changes in tumor burden in response to NTC can&#xD;
      identify potential treatment responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequential peripheral blood samples for CTCs and ctDNA analysis will be taken before and&#xD;
      after NCT, as well as one week after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor assessments will be performed after 2 cycles NCT based on RECIST v1.1 criteria using&#xD;
      CT/MRI scan.&#xD;
