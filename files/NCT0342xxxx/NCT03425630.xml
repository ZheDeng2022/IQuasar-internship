      The aim of this study was to assess the lipid-lowering activity and safety of a dietary&#xD;
      supplement containing monacolin K, L-arginine, coenzyme Q10 and ascorbic acid (vitamin C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty both gender caucasian outpatients aged 18-75 yrs with serum LDL-C between130-180&#xD;
      mg/dL, not significantly modified by an appropriate dietetic regimen assumed two different&#xD;
      dietary supplements (Argicolina [trade mark]: A; Normolip 5 [trade mark]: N) both containing&#xD;
      monacolin K 10 mg for 8 weeks each separated by a 4-week wash-out period in a single center,&#xD;
      controlled, randomized, open-label, cross-over clinical study. Exclusion criteria were&#xD;
      pregnancy or breast-feeding; known liver, renal or muscle diseases; serum triglycerides (TG)&#xD;
      greater than 350 mg/dL; previous cardiovascular events; concomitant neoplastic or&#xD;
      immunodepressive disease; use of lipid-lowering drugs or dietary supplements within the last&#xD;
      three weeks; concurrent use of thiazide diuretics, oral contraceptives containing estrogen or&#xD;
      progestogen, systemic corticosteroids; use of psycho-active substances, drug or alcohol&#xD;
      abuse; neurological or psychiatric diseases that could affect consent validity or impair the&#xD;
      patient's adherence to the study protocol. Evaluation criteria were Tot-C, LDL-C,&#xD;
      HDL-cholesterol, TG, fasting blood glucose, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine&#xD;
      aminotransferase, creatinkinase, gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase, humeral blood pressure and&#xD;
      heart rate measured at the start and a the end of each treatment period. Safety was monitored&#xD;
      through the study.&#xD;

      Between July 2016 and April 2017 eligible patients were recruited among the outpatients&#xD;
      attending the Obesity Center of the Endocrinology Unit 1, Cisanello Hospital, Pisa, Italy.&#xD;
      Patients aged 18-75 years with serum LDL-C between130-180 mg/dL, not significantly modified&#xD;
      by an appropriate dietetic regimen were considered eligible for the study. Thirty patients,&#xD;
      all Caucasian, were screened. Ten were excluded during the screening process because they did&#xD;
      not fulfill all the inclusion criteria (screening failure). Twenty patients were thus&#xD;
      randomized, 10 to the A&gt;N sequence and 10 to the N&gt;A sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The study was conducted in a single center according to a controlled,&#xD;
      randomized, open-label, cross-over design. Each patient had to assume, in a randomized&#xD;
      sequence, both treatments (A, 1 sachet/day; N, 1 capsule/day) for 8 weeks each separated by a&#xD;
      4-week wash-out period. The study plan included the initial screening visit (V1), an entry&#xD;
      visit at start of the first treatment period (V2), a visit at the end of the first treatment&#xD;
      period (V3, 56 ±5 days after V2), a wash-out period of 4 weeks (±5 days), a visit at start of&#xD;
      the second (crossed over) treatment period (V4), and a visit at the end of the second&#xD;
      treatment period (V5, 56 ±5 days after V4) (Figure 1). Tot-C, LDL-C, HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C),&#xD;
      TG, fasting blood glucose, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),&#xD;
      creatinkinase (CK), gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase (GGT), humeral blood pressure and heart&#xD;
      rate were measured at V1, V3, V4 and V5. Blood analyses were centrally performed in the&#xD;
      laboratory of the Endocrinology Unit using standard enzymatic techniques; LDL-C was measured&#xD;
      directly. Clinical safety was monitored throughout the study. If required, the patient could&#xD;
      be re-evaluated at any time during the study, aside of the visits scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods The minimum level of statistical significance was set to p&lt;0.05&#xD;
      two-sided, therefore 95% confidence limits (95%CIs) were calculated. All reported p-values&#xD;
      and CIs are two-sided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy variable was the LDL-C change between the start and the end of each&#xD;
      treatment period, expressed as a percentage of the initial value. Therefore, mean and 95%CIs&#xD;
      of changes within treatment periods (from V2 to V3 and from V4 to V5) for the experimental&#xD;
      and the control treatment, irrespective of sequence, were calculated. The main analysis was&#xD;
      the determination of the two-sided 95%CI of the between-treatment mean difference in the&#xD;
      primary variable. Setting 0.10 (i.e. 10% of the initial value) as the minimum clinically&#xD;
      relevant difference, the two treatments were considered equivalent if the two-sided 95%CI of&#xD;
      the difference in their LDL-C change from baseline was entirely between -0.10 and +0.10.&#xD;
      Parallel calculations were carried out on absolute, rather than relative to baseline, LDL-C&#xD;
      changes. Tot-C and HDL-C were analysed as described above for LDL-C; for TG levels (which&#xD;
      were approximately log-normally distributed) analogous calculations were performed on&#xD;
      logarithmic transformations and changes were expressed as ratios. Between-treatment&#xD;
      comparisons were expressed as A-N differences for cholesterol values and as A/N ratios for TG&#xD;
      values. The effects on LDL-C were additionally tested in sensitivity multivariate analyses:&#xD;
      split-plot analysis of variance for cross-over studies on final-baseline changes, and&#xD;
      analysis of covariance on the difference between the final values adjusted for sequence and&#xD;
      for the difference between the baseline values. Efficacy analyses had to be performed in the&#xD;
      intention-to-treat population, i.e. all patients with at least one post-baseline control). A&#xD;
      sensitivity analysis of the primary variable was also planned in the per-protocol population,&#xD;
      i.e. all patients without major protocol violations. Safety results had to be reported in all&#xD;
      patients who had assumed at least one dose of one study drug. Statistical analyses were&#xD;
      performed by the Studio Associato Airoldi Cicogna and Ghirri, Milan, using the SAS Software&#xD;
      version 9.4 (SAS Inc, Cary, NC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size The sample size was calculated for the main efficacy analysis described above,&#xD;
      i.e. the determination of the two-sided 95% CI of the between-treatment mean difference in&#xD;
      the LDL-C change from baseline. Assuming a standard deviation (SD) of the difference no&#xD;
      greater than 0.12, based on a previous cross-over study for the difference between monacolin&#xD;
      K and placebo [11], it was estimated that 18 patients were required to prove the equivalence&#xD;
      with a power of 0.80. This figure was rounded to 20 enrolled patients allowing for possible&#xD;
      exclusions from the analysis.&#xD;
