  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TP-0184 is a potent inhibitor of ALK2 or ACRV1 kinase, a constitutively active&#xD;
      serine/threonine receptor kinase due to activating mutations or upregulated upstream&#xD;
      signaling pathways. This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation, safety, pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamic study, with a purpose of determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of oral TP-0184 administered once weekly for 4 weeks in&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of oral&#xD;
      TP-0184 administered once weekly for 4 weeks, over a range of doses in patients with advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the pharmacokinetics of orally administered TP-0184&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To observe patients for any evidence of antitumor activity of TP-0184 by objective&#xD;
           radiographic assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the pharmacodynamics of TP-0184 therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) for future studies with TP-0184&#xD;

    <description>A DLT is defined as any one of the following events observed within Cycle 1 regardless of investigator attribution unless there is a clear alternative explanation:&#xD;
Grade 3 or greater febrile neutropenia&#xD;
Grade 4 neutropenia for ≥7 consecutive days&#xD;
Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding or that requires a platelet transfusion&#xD;
Grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic AEs including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and electrolyte imbalances persisting for more than 48 hours despite optimal medical management&#xD;
Dosing delays ≥1 week due to treatment emergent adverse events or related severe laboratory test values</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD)</measure>
    <time_frame>20 months</time_frame>
    <description>If a patient experiences a DLT, up to three additional patients will be treated at that dose level. If no additional DLTs are observed in the expanded six-patient cohort, the dose will be escalated in a new cohort of three patients. If two or more patients at a given dose level experience a DLT during the first cycle, then the MTD will have been exceeded and up to a total of six patients will be treated at the next lower dose level. If 0 or 1 of 6 patients experiences a DLT at this previous lower dose level, this dose will be declared the MTD.</description>
