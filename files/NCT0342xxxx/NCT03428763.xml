    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to explore whether the effectiveness of home-based disease activity&#xD;
      monitoring via a home-based (eHealth) intervention is superior to standard clinical disease&#xD;
      activity assessment in obtaining and maintaining a low(er) disease activity in patients with&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of RA therapy is to reduce disease activity, joint destruction, symptoms, and&#xD;
      disability. The prevailing therapeutic approach is an aggressive pharmacological disease&#xD;
      control, with readily available conventional synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs&#xD;
      (csDMARDs) in first line. The csDMARDs goes a long way towards reductions in disease&#xD;
      activity, symptoms, and disability. However, if satisfactory disease control is not achieved&#xD;
      by csDMARDS, addition of biologic medicines can be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the efficacy of all these pharmacological options and the current view on&#xD;
      &quot;Treat-to-Target&quot; (T2T), RA patients should have excellent prospects. However, despite the&#xD;
      evidence to support a T2T strategy it is anticipated that many patients across various&#xD;
      countries in Europe have active disease and suffer from increasing disability; this might be&#xD;
      a consequence of bad access to optimal care, as well as possibly a lack of reimbursement of&#xD;
      biological agents. Currently, the proposed T2T strategies are managed in the clinic by&#xD;
      physicians, nurses and biometricians, which is expensive and time consuming for both patients&#xD;
      and health care professionals (HCPs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telemonitoring and eHealth solutions for assessing patients with chronic illnesses as&#xD;
      diabetes, asthma and hypertension have previously shown great advantages in better disease&#xD;
      control and improvement of symptoms. A similar eHealth solution for patients with RA is&#xD;
      expected to be advantageous both for patients and the health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current trial is designed to assess if an eHealth solution for homebased disease activity&#xD;
      monitoring is superior to the standard clinical disease monitoring strategy with respect to&#xD;
      T2T goals. The main research question is whether the effectiveness of home-based disease&#xD;
      activity monitoring via a home-based (eHealth) intervention is superior to standard clinical&#xD;
      disease activity assessment in obtaining and maintaining a low(er) disease activity in&#xD;
      patients with RA.&#xD;

    <description>The Disease Activity Score (DAS) is a combined index that has been developed to measure the disease activity in patients with RA. It is a composite of standard clinical, laboratory data, and patient-reported data. The DAS28-CRP requires a standard blood sample (20 ml) to be drawn and analysed.</description>

The SF-36 is a patient-reported survey of patient health. It consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability.</description>

    <measure>Brief illness perception questionnaire (IPQ-B)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Generic questionnaire developed to measure illness perception. The IPQ-B contains eight items and one causal scale. Items 1-8 are rated using a 0-to-10 response scale, item 9 is a memo field. Five of the items assess cognitive illness representations: consequences (Item 1), timeline (Item 2), personal control (Item 3), treatment control (Item 4), and identity (Item 5). Two of the items assess emotional representations: concern (Item 6) and emotions (Item 8). One item assesses illness comprehensibility (Item 7).&#xD;
A low score on items number 1,2,5,6 and 8 indicates that the illness is perceived as benign while a low score on the items 3, 4 and 7 indicates that the illness is perceived as threatening. By reversing these three items it is possible to compute an overall score. A higher score reflects a more threatening view of the illness.</description>

These procedures represent a &quot;virtual visit&quot;.&#xD;
The participants are instructed to have &quot;virtual visit&quot; (self-monitoring) every month from allocation. The scheduled &quot;virtual visits&quot; include&#xD;
