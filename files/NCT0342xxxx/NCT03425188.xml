      This Post Approval Study is a multi-center, prospective, single arm cohort study to evaluate&#xD;
      the long-term safety, long-term effectiveness, and survival rate in subjects implanted with&#xD;
      the remedē System from the remedē System Pivotal Trial. Only subjects who were implanted and&#xD;
      actively being followed as part of the remedē System Pivotal Trial are eligible. An&#xD;
      individual subject's participation is expected to continue to five years post remedē System&#xD;
      implant.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>5-Year Survival Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Through 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of survival in subjects with moderate to severe central sleep apnea being treated with the remedē System. The 5-year survival rate was estimated from Kaplan-Meier anlaysis, using time from implant to death, study exit or last contact. This analysis used all subjects enrolled in the original remede System Pivotal Trial.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Device-related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Through Three and Five Years</measure>
    <time_frame>Through 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of long-term safety via a summary of anticipated or unanticipated device-related SAEs. Proportion of subjects experiencing a device related SAE through the time point of interest. This analysis combined data from the original pivotal trial and this post approval study.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Therapy-related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Through Three and Five Years</measure>
    <time_frame>Through 3 and 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of the safety of the remedē System by evaluating anticipated or unanticipated therapy-related SAEs. Proportion of subjects experiencing a therapy related SAE through the time point of interest.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) Change From Baseline at 5 Years</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Change in AHI = Year 5 index - Baseline index. The Apnea-Hypopnea Index is a measurement obtained from an overnight sleep study used to indicate the severity of sleep apnea. It is represented by the number of apnea and hypopnea events per hour of sleep. The events were scored according to the 2007 &quot;American Academy of Sleep Medicine manual for the scoring of sleep and associated events: rules, terminology and technical specifications&quot; (Iber, et. al).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) Change From Baseline at 5 Years</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Change in ESS = Year 5 score - Baseline score. The ESS is an assessment to measure a subject's general level of daytime sleepiness. Scores can range from 0-24, with higher scores indicating higher level of daytime sleepiness.</description>

      <recruitment_details>151 subjects enrolled in the original pivotal trial of the remede system. 94 were ongoing at the time of trial closure and therefore eligible to participate in this continuation post approval study. Pivotal trial sites with subjects ongoing at the time of study closure were invited to participate in this long-term continuation study. Subjects needed to re-consent to participate. Due to sites or subjects declining participation, not all subjects participated in this continuation study.</recruitment_details>

          <description>The number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep.&#xD;
An apnea is defined by 3 characteristics:&#xD;
There is a drop in the peak thermal sensor excursion or alternate nasal air pressure transducer (inspiratory effort) by &gt; 90% of baseline&#xD;
The duration of the event lasts at least 10 seconds&#xD;
At least 90% of the event's duration meets the amplitude reduction criteria for apnea&#xD;
Hypopnea defined as 30% reduction in airflow (or alternative hypopnea sensor) for ≥10 seconds over at least 90% of the event's duration that is associated with a &gt;4% fall in oxygen saturation from baseline.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The original pivotal trial of the remede System (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01816776) enrolled 151 subjects and was closed following FDA approval of the PMA submission. This post approval study was initiated as a separate study to continue following as many of the 94 patients ongoing at the time of pivotal trial closure. Due to some sites declining to participate and multiple subjects declining to re-consent, the number of enrolled subjects was less than originally planned.</limitations_and_caveats>
