      Objective: The study aimed to assess the effect of topical application of an amino acid +&#xD;
      sodium hyaluronate acid gel after lower third molar extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: 136 patients requiring lower third molar extraction were enrolled. An amino&#xD;
      acid + sodium hyaluronate acid (HA) gel was applied to the sockets of the patients in the&#xD;
      treatment group immediately following extraction; the sockets of the controls were simply&#xD;
      flushed with a sterile saline solution. 7 and 14 days after surgery, patients' outcomes and&#xD;
      postoperative complications were evaluated. Cumulative incidence of dehiscence and secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures were analyzed using a chi-square test.&#xD;

      A lower third molar was extracted under local anesthesia generally involving an inferior&#xD;
      alveolar nerve block associated with a buccal nerve block (2% mepivacaine with 1:100,000&#xD;
      epinephrine, Optocain, Molteni Dental, Italy), plus sedation as necessary. All the surgical&#xD;
      tools and materials as well as the surgical field were sterile. A full-thickness flap was&#xD;
      raised and, if necessary, osteotomy and tooth sectioning were performed using a straight&#xD;
      handpiece with dedicated burs under copious irrigation with sterile saline solution. The&#xD;
      extraction was completed with curved and straight extractors, the socket was closely&#xD;
      inspected and the dental follicle was removed. The bone edges were refined to remove the bone&#xD;
      spurs with a bone lime and then irrigated with abundant sterile 0.9% saline solution.&#xD;
      Depending on the group to which the patient was assigned, one of the following procedures was&#xD;
      carried out: the socket was filled with a topical amino acid + sodium hyaluronate gel&#xD;
      (Aminogam®, sterile syringe 2 ml) or the socket was flushed, using a 2ml sterile syringe&#xD;
      similar to one utilized to apply the gel, with sterile physiological solution. The flap was&#xD;
      then repositioned and sutured (Novosyn 4.0, B. Braun AG, Melsungen, Germany) to allow healing&#xD;
      by primary intention. After surgery, the patients were prescribed antibiotics (amoxicillin&#xD;
      clavulanate 1 g every 12 hours for 6 days, or clarithromycin 250 mg every 12 hours for 6&#xD;
      days) and painkillers (paracetamol 1000 mg every 8 hours was recommended). The patients were&#xD;
      also provided standard postoperative recommendations regarding activity, diet, and smoking.&#xD;
      The following data were registered at the time of surgery: the range of pre-operative mouth&#xD;
      opening measurement (assessed by measuring the distance between the incisors), the type of&#xD;
      sedation utilized, if osteotomy or root resection was carried out, the quantity of&#xD;
      peri-operative bleeding, the amount of time between incision and suture (surgical procedure&#xD;
      time).&#xD;
