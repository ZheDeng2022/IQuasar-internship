  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the relative bioavailability of naproxen sodium/diphenhydramine hydrochloride&#xD;
      (DHP HCL) 220/25 mg soft capsules (Test) versus naproxen sodium/DPH HCl 220/25 mg tablets&#xD;
      (Reference) after a single oral administration (2 x naproxen sodium 220 mg and DPH HCl 25 mg&#xD;
      combination product) under fed conditions in healthy adult subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the safety and tolerability of the investigational products in terms of adverse&#xD;
      events (AEs) and clinical parameters (systolic/diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, physical&#xD;
      examination, clinical and laboratory testing).&#xD;
