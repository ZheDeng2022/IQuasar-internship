  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial Light Therapy involves non-invasive and invisible beams of light that increase&#xD;
      energy metabolism in the brain. Transcranial light therapy has been found to promote brain&#xD;
      metabolism which may help people with anxiety. The research team proposes a novel approach to&#xD;
      treating anxiety by using transcranial light therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if using Transcranial Light Therapy (TLT), also called&#xD;
      near- infrared light, helps improve symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized at a 1:2 ratio into 2 groups: pulse light (TLT) and sham. The sham group&#xD;
      will be randomized after 8 weeks at a 1:1 ratio in to TLT and sham.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves 1 screening visit which may last up to 3 hours, 16 weekly study visits,&#xD;
      and one follow-up visit. There are 2 in-office treatment visits, during which a clinician&#xD;
      applies transcranial light therapy to the participant's head for about 30 minutes. The other&#xD;
      study visits involve assessments with a study clinician. The participants will administer the&#xD;
      treatment once daily at home during the 16-week treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant qualifies for the study, the study team assigns the participant by chance to&#xD;
      receive either active transcranial light therapy or sham transcranial light therapy&#xD;
      treatment. During sham transcranial light therapy visits, the transcranial light therapy&#xD;
      device will not produce near infrared waves (e.g., light energy that cannot penetrate the&#xD;
      skin and cranium). Participants have more than an equal chance of being assigned to the&#xD;
      active transcranial light therapy or the sham transcranial light therapy over the course of&#xD;
      the study. Neither the participant, nor the clinician, nor any research staff other than the&#xD;
      study statistician will know which study group the participant belongs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomized a second time after 8-weeks in the study. If the participant were&#xD;
      in the sham group the first 8-weeks, that participant may receive the active transcranial&#xD;
      light therapy treatment after re-randomization. If the participant were already in the active&#xD;
      transcranial light therapy group during the first 8-weeks the participant continues receiving&#xD;
      the active treatment. All in all, participants have a 2 in 3 chance of receiving the active&#xD;
      transcranial light therapy treatment at some point during the study.&#xD;

    <time_frame>8 weeks - Sequential-parallel comparison design</time_frame>
    <description>This instrument is completed by the clinician based on his/her assessment of the patient's anxiety symptoms, using a structured interview, specific instructions, and defined anchor points. Answers to the questions are rated on a scale of 0-4, with higher scores indicating more severe pathology. Scores range between 0 to 56; &lt;17 indicates mild severity, 18-24 mild-to-moderate severity, and 25-30 moderate to severe.</description>

    <description>These two instruments are scored 1-7 by the clinician based on assessment of the subject's overall clinical status. They measure, based on history and scores on other instruments: (a) symptom severity (CGI-S) and (b) clinical improvement (CGI-I).</description>
