      Background In hemodialysis (HD) patients, impaired gut barrier and alteration in microbiota&#xD;
      in the gut is thought to increase the risk of bacterial translocation and chronic&#xD;
      inflammation. Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) is an acute-phase reactant that&#xD;
      mediates immune responses triggered by microbial products. Our aim is to investigate the&#xD;
      relationship between circulating levels of LBP, inflammatory markers and incident&#xD;
      atherosclerotic vascular events in HD patients and follow-up this defined cohort for 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods A total of 300 HD patients will be recruited. The LBP and inflammatory markers will&#xD;
      be determined using immuoassay methods annually. A bioimpedance spectroscopy device will used&#xD;
      for body fat composition measurement and measurements will be done annually. Arterial&#xD;
      stiffness is evaluated by measuring PWV in the heart-femoral segment using an automatic&#xD;
      waveform analyzer.&#xD;

      Study Design and Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be included in the study, patients have to be at least 20-years-old and on outpatient&#xD;
      hemodialysis (HD) for at least 3 months. Patients are excluded if they had an acute infection&#xD;
      or malignancy. A total of 300 long-term HD patients are randomly invited and agreed to&#xD;
      participate in the study. The medical record is thoroughly reviewed for each subject by a&#xD;
      collaborating physician in the study. Information such as underlying kidney disease,&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease history, and other comorbid illnesses will be abstracted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predialysis blood samples are obtained on a mid-week day. Within 30 min after sampling, the&#xD;
      remaining blood is centrifuged at 3,000 g for 10 min, immediately aliquoted and frozen at&#xD;
      -70°C until further analysis. Total serum cholesterol is measured through the reaction of&#xD;
      cholesterol esterase/cholesterol oxidase/peroxidase, using Hitachi 747 (Hitachi, Bohemia, NY,&#xD;
      USA). HDL cholesterol is quantified after precipitation with polyethylene glycol at room&#xD;
      temperature. Serum glucose concentrations are measured by the glucose oxidase method.&#xD;
      Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is calculated using the Friedewald formula. Total serum&#xD;
      triglycerides are measured through the reaction of glycerol/phosphate/oxidase and peroxidase.&#xD;
      The serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) are measured using a Behring&#xD;
      Nephelometer II (Dade Behring, Tokyo, Japan). Plasma levels of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and&#xD;
      soluble CD14(sCD14) are measured by a commercially available enzyme linked immunosorbent&#xD;
      assay (ELISA) (Quantikine HS Immunoassay kit, R&amp;D System, Minneapolis, MN). Concentrations&#xD;
      Interleukin-6(IL-10), and Tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-α) are simultaneously determined by&#xD;
      the Multiplex® (R&amp;D Systems, Minnesota, MN, USA). Serum levels of LBP will be measured using&#xD;
      a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (HK315-02, HyCult Biotech Inc., Uden, the&#xD;
      Netherlands) as per manufacturer's instructions. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of&#xD;
      LBP variation are &lt;5 and &lt;10%, respectively. Besides, serum from 40 normal control subjects&#xD;
      will be used for interassay variation. Both the intra- and the interassay coefficients of&#xD;
      variation were &lt;8.0%. All samples will be measured in duplicates and the mean value is&#xD;
      reported in μg/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percent fat is measured with Bioelectric Impedance Spectroscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole-body bioelectric impedance spectroscopy (BIS) measurement using a body composition&#xD;
      monitor (BCM: Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homburg, Germany) is performed on each of the&#xD;
      participants enrolled in the study as described previously [28]. Briefly, measurements were&#xD;
      taken on the day before dialysis with the patient calm, supine, and relaxed in the dialysis&#xD;
      bed for 10 minutes. Four electrodes were placed on the patient's hand and foot on the side&#xD;
      contra lateral to their arteriovenous fistula. The basic principle of this machine is the use&#xD;
      of the bioimpedance spectroscopy which determines the fluid content of the body by measuring&#xD;
      the serial values of electric impedance by applying small microAmp electric currents at 50&#xD;
      different frequencies between 5 and 1000 kHz. These impedance data are used to obtain the&#xD;
      amount of total body water, intracellular water and extracellular water through a special&#xD;
      fluid model and information about other body compositions, such as fat tissue or lean tissue,&#xD;
      through a physiological body composition model [29]. The major estimates the body composition&#xD;
      measured by BCM-BIS are as follows: (1) lean tissue mass (LTM -mainly muscle), fat mass&#xD;
      (FAT), and adipose tissue mass (ATM-mainly fat with its relevant hydration)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of arterial stiffness&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial stiffness is evaluated by measuring PWV in the heart-femoral segment using an&#xD;
      automatic waveform analyzer.&#xD;
