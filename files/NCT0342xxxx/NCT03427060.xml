      Coversin in Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) in patients with resistance to&#xD;
      Eculizumab due to complement C5 polymorphisms.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coversin, a small protein complement C5 inhibitor which prevents the cleavage of C5 by C5&#xD;
      convertase into C5a and C5b, will be used in an open label, non-comparative clinical trial in&#xD;
      patients with PNH and proven resistance to eculizumab due to C5 polymorphisms. Patients will&#xD;
      be treated with Coversin by daily subcutaneous injection for 6 months in order to determine&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of the drug in these circumstances. If satisfactory control of the&#xD;
      PNH is achieved, and at the discretion of the Principal Investigator (PI), patients will have&#xD;
      the option of remaining on Coversin and being entered into the long term follow-up study.&#xD;

    <description>The FACIT Measurement System is a collection of quality of life questionnaires targeted to the management of chronic illness. Change in FACIT-F score, measured on a scale from 0 - 4 (0 = Not at all, 1 = A little bit, 2 = Some-what, 3 = Quite a bit, 4 = Very much).</description>

    <measure>Change in EuroQol 5 Dimensional 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 180</time_frame>
    <description>The descriptive questionnaire comprises of five sections: Mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each section has 5 levels: No problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that section. The digits for the five sections can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>
