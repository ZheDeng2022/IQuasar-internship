    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers want to learn more about head and neck disorders. Understanding these disorders&#xD;
      could help them find better treatments. To do this, they are collecting tissue samples for&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To create a repository of tissue samples and data to better study conditions of the head and&#xD;
      neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who had or will have tissue samples taken because of a head or neck disorder. They&#xD;
      must be ages 3 and older and not pregnant to join Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a questionnaire, medical history, and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1. Participants will give permission for any of their tissue samples leftover from&#xD;
      private care or other research protocols to be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants tissue did not contain normal tissue or if they have a condition that&#xD;
      suggests a genetic issue, they will be invited to join Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Participants will have additional samples collected. These could be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood: Blood is drawn through a needle in the arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cheek swab or brushing: A cotton swab or small brush is rubbed inside the cheek.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Saliva: They rinse their mouth with water and spit into a tube or cup.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin biopsy: They are injected with a numbing drug. A biopsy tool removes a small piece&#xD;
           of skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mucosal biopsy: They are injected in the mouth with a numbing medication. A small piece&#xD;
           of tissue from the inside of the cheek is removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants samples will be used for future research, including genetic testing.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) investigators are&#xD;
      studying the natural history and treatment of diverse conditions of the head and neck&#xD;
      affecting hearing, balance, smell, taste, swallowing, voice and speech at the National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health (NIH). These studies require the collection of biospecimens for research&#xD;
      purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: To create a biorepository of diseased and normal tissue specimens for research&#xD;
      purposes. The samples will be obtained:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Part 1) From surgical waste materials from participants of all ages in NIH protocols who&#xD;
      have head and neck disorders, as well as from patients treated at the Johns Hopkins Suburban&#xD;
      Hospital Head and Neck Surgery Clinic (JHSH), and the Johns Hopkins Otolaryngology/Head and&#xD;
      Neck Surgery Clinic Bethesda(JHOCB), Johns Hopkins Hospital (Broadway Baltimore, Greenspring&#xD;
      and Bayview), George Washington University Hospital (GWUH), MedStar Georgetown University&#xD;
      Hospital and archived lung and laryngotracheal tissue from outside institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Part 2) Participants aged 3 and older may have collection of blood, saliva, and/or oral&#xD;
      swabs. Participants aged 18 and older, may undergo oral mucosal biopsies and skin biopsies,&#xD;
      taken from subjects with head and neck disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specimens will be shared with the NCI Frederick Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) team,&#xD;
      other approved protocols or may be used under this protocol to conduct analysis of cellular,&#xD;
      molecular, genetic and genomic biology of normal processes and disorders. These laboratory&#xD;
      studies may support development of future protocols that include new therapeutic agents,&#xD;
      novel treatment approaches, and new prognostic and diagnostic models for subjects with&#xD;
      disorders of the head and neck affecting human communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects must be diagnosed with a disorder of the head and neck region&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 1000 subjects will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1. Participants of all ages with head and neck disorders will be asked to share waste&#xD;
      material from surgical procedures to create a biorepository of diseased and normal specimens&#xD;
      for research. The participants will be enrolled prior to the surgery or they may be enrolled&#xD;
      retrospectively and asked to share pathology specimens and slides previously collected that&#xD;
      are no longer required for their medical care. Participants will be recruited from surgical&#xD;
      protocols at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center or from subjects being&#xD;
      treated at JHSH or the JHOCB, Johns Hopkins Hospital (Broadway Baltimore, Greenspring and&#xD;
      Bayview), George Washington University Hospital (GWUH), MedStar Georgetown University&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Participants aged 3 and older who have agreed to share surgical waste material may be&#xD;
      asked to provide additional blood, saliva, and/or oral swabs. In addition, oral mucosal or&#xD;
      skin biopsies may be obtained from adult participants aged 18 and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No investigational or experimental therapy will be given as part of this protocol.&#xD;
