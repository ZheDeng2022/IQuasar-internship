    <textblock>
      The investigator proposes an evaluation of a randomized, sustainable intervention in 8&#xD;
      intervention and 8 control pantries. We will enroll 272 clients at baseline and follow them&#xD;
      for 1 year to assess changes in overall diet quality (the primary outcome).&#xD;

      Evaluate the health impact of an intervention targeting the hunger relief network and the&#xD;
      clients with food insecurity it serves. The long-term goal of this work is to reduce&#xD;
      nutrition-related health disparities by intervening on a system that serves individuals at&#xD;
      high risk for chronic disease. In 2014, an estimated 14% of U.S. households experienced food&#xD;
      insecurity (i.e., they lacked access to enough food for an active, healthy life for all&#xD;
      household members). Large numbers of low-income, racial/ethnic minority, and immigrant&#xD;
      families who experience food insecurity rely on a hunger relief network that includes food&#xD;
      banks and food pantries. Pantry clients have demonstrated poor nutritional outcomes, high&#xD;
      chronic disease rates, and dissatisfaction with the quality and cultural-appropriateness of&#xD;
      food offered. Unlike other food assistance programs, there are currently no standards on the&#xD;
      nutritional quality of pantry offerings, but recent work by our study team demonstrated the&#xD;
      need to improve the healthfulness of hunger relief network inventory. We proposed an&#xD;
      evaluation of a randomized, sustainable intervention in 8 intervention and 8 control&#xD;
      pantries. We will enroll 272 clients at baseline and follow them for 1 year to assess changes&#xD;
      in overall diet quality (the primary outcome). Working with our food bank partners, the&#xD;
      intervention at the pantry level targets the supply of nutritious foods. At the client level,&#xD;
      the intervention targets healthy food demand. Measured outcomes include overall diet quality&#xD;
      (the primary outcome), as assessed by the Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI), the nutritional&#xD;
      quality of foods selected at the food shelf visit, and cardiovascular disease health&#xD;
      (assessed by the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7 scores). The study will also&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of a multilevel intervention on the nutritional quality of pantry&#xD;
      offerings. The study also aims to improve implementation of practices that promote a&#xD;
      nutrition-focused hunger relief network, as assessed by survey and key informant interviews.&#xD;
      As an exploratory aim, the study will evaluate the cultural appropriateness of pantry foods&#xD;
      and services, given the burden of poor food access on minority, immigrant, and refugee&#xD;
      families.&#xD;
