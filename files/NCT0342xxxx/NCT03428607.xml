  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single arm, multi-center phase II study of AZD6738 and olaparib combination&#xD;
      therapy in patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) as a second or third line&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive AZD6738 and olaparib combination therapy. The arm is composed of 45&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZD6738 160mg QD per os administered for 7 days and olaparib 300mg BID per os administered&#xD;
      daily. One cycle is considered of 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumour evaluation using RECIST 1.1 will be conducted at screening (within 28 days prior to&#xD;
      first dose) and every 8 weeks relative to the date, up to week 56, then every 12 weeks until&#xD;
      objective disease progression (within a window of ± 7 days of the scheduled date).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment will be continued until objective disease progression (unless other criteria&#xD;
      for treatment discontinuation are met). Patients may continue AZD6738 and olaparib beyond&#xD;
      progression (according to RECIST 1.1), at the discretion of the investigator if they are&#xD;
      clinically benefiting from the treatment and they do not meet any other discontinuation&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient discontinues study treatment prior to disease progression, they should continue&#xD;
      to be assessed using RECIST 1.1 until disease progression and then followed up for survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments for survival should be made every 8 weeks following objective disease&#xD;
      progression. The details of first and subsequent therapies for cancer, after discontinuation&#xD;
      of AZD6738 and olaparib treatment, will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The imaging modalities used for RECIST 1.1 assessment will be CT or MRI scans of chest,&#xD;
      abdomen and pelvis. RECIST 1.1 scans will be analysed by the investigator on site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may also be requested to provide tumour samples from the primary or metastatic&#xD;
      tumours on progression to understand resistance mechanisms. Sample provision is optional and&#xD;
      depend on the patient's will.&#xD;
