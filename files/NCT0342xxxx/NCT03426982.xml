      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from porcine intestinal&#xD;
      mucosa that enhances the inhibitory activity of the natural anticoagulant antithrombin&#xD;
      towards most activated clotting factors (F), particularly FXa and FIIa (thrombin) . Despite&#xD;
      the growing interest for low molecular weight derivatives (LMWH), UFH is still widely used&#xD;
      for different indications including the treatment of acute thrombosis including venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism, coronary syndromes (ACS), and other thrombotic diseases. UFH is administered&#xD;
      by parenteral route either intravenous (IV) or sub-cutaneous (SC).Actually, there is evidence&#xD;
      that the risk of recurrence of thrombosis is increased when heparin levels fells below the&#xD;
      lower limit of the therapeutic range, while the hemorrhagic risk increases with heparin&#xD;
      levels above the upper limit of the therapeutic range. Moreover, the anticoagulant response&#xD;
      to UFH is highly variable for one individual to another. As the clinical efficacy of heparin&#xD;
      is dependent on maintaining an anticoagulant effect above a minimum level, careful laboratory&#xD;
      monitoring of UFH treatment is mandatory. For that purpose, two options are offered to the&#xD;
      clinicians: i) to evaluate either the prolongation of a global clotting assay, the activated&#xD;
      partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and ii) to measure the heparin-enhanced inhibitory&#xD;
      activity of AT toward purified activated factors such as FIIa and FXa using chromogenic&#xD;
      substrate-based assays. UFH therapy is still widely monitored by the aPTT, a global clotting&#xD;
      assay, that reflects the ability of heparin to enhance the inhibitory activity of AT against&#xD;
      FIIa, FXa, and other activated factors. The therapeutic range of aPTT prolongation is highly&#xD;
      dependent on the reagent and analyzer used. As the consequence, it must be defined by each&#xD;
      laboratory in its own technical conditions (for each reagent batch) to correlate with heparin&#xD;
      levels between 0.20 and 0.40 U/mL (protamine sulfate titration), corresponding to anti-FXa&#xD;
      activity between 0.30 and 0.70 IU/mL. In that connection, the prolongation of aPTT&#xD;
      corresponding to antiFXa activity between 0.30 - 0.70 IU/mL is highly variable depending of&#xD;
      the reagents e.g.between 1.6 - 2.7 x control for weakly sensitive reagents and between 3.7 -&#xD;
      6.2 x control for highly sensitive reagents. The use of aPTT has advantages as it is&#xD;
      easy-to-perform, quick, inexpensive but faces numerous challenges due to the significant&#xD;
      influence of the technical conditions (reagent/instrument) on the test result, to lot-lot&#xD;
      variation in reagent sensitivity, to the need of studies to evaluate the therapeutic range,&#xD;
      to limited therapeutic range, and also to non-specific prolongation in the case of lupus&#xD;
      anticoagulant, factors deficiency, inhibitors or shortening in the case of high factor&#xD;
      levels, particularly FVIII.In contrast, the use of chromogenic anti-Xa assays has many&#xD;
      advantages particularly a published therapeutic range for UFH i.e. between 0.30 and 0.70&#xD;
      IU/mL, a specificity to its interaction with AT (no Heparin Cofactor II interference by using&#xD;
      bovine FIIa or short incubation time) and faces few challenges such as limited availability&#xD;
      in some area and a cost that is slightly higher than that of aPTT. In addition, anti-Xa&#xD;
      assays allow accurate measurement of all heparin(s) derivatives and particularly LMWHs and&#xD;
      fondaparinux.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the first reports in the mid-eighties, some small sized studies have compared the two&#xD;
      monitoring strategies mainly retrospectively designed (7-11). Even though, one single&#xD;
      prospective randomized management study evaluated the comparison between the two monitoring&#xD;
      strategies with clinical end-points i.e. recurrence of thrombosis and bleeding complication&#xD;
      in a cohort of 131 patients with VTE . All concluded to a trend toward higher, or at least&#xD;
      similar, safety/efficacy/efficiency when patients were monitored using antiXa activity vs.&#xD;
      aPTT. Even though differences were not significant due to the lack of power of these studies.&#xD;

      Aim of the study Based on available data, a randomized trial aimed at comparing the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of monitoring UFH treatments using aPTT and anti-FXa activity in patients treated&#xD;
      with fulldoses of UFH could validly be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary objectives: safety and efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objectives: efficiency and cost effectiveness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary evaluation criteria: bleeding complications (n, %) and thrombotic complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary evaluation criteria: percentage of test results within the therapeutic&#xD;
           range,number of tests perfomed per day, number of daily dose adjustments, total dosage&#xD;
           of heparin given to the patients, mean time to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation,&#xD;
           transfusion rates, health economics analysis (total treatment cost)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calculation of number of patients to be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the only randomized study published to date (A), the bleeding rate was 1.5%&#xD;
      (n=1/65) in the group of patients monitored using Anti-FXa activity vs. 6.1% (n=4/66) in&#xD;
      theaPTT group. The difference was not significant (p=0.36) due to the lack of power of the&#xD;
      study (n=131 patients). Taking into account these bleeding risks and 0.05 as the alpha risk&#xD;
      and 0.20 (0.05) as the beta risk, the number of patients to be included would be 323 (506) in&#xD;
      each treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the two monitoring strategies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients should be randomized to be monitored using either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anti-Xa activity (heparin levels) with the therapeutic range between 0.30 and 0.70IU/mL&#xD;
           (corresponding to 0.2 to 0.4 protamine sulfate titration assay) (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  aPTT wIth the usual therapeutic range of 1.5 to 2.5 fold the control time, which was the&#xD;
           usually used therapeutic range in the institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Example of nomogram for heparin dose-adjustment when monitored using aPTT or anti-Xa activity&#xD;
      (12)Practical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mechanism of randomization: electronic&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After randomization, the patients must be monitored using either anti-Xa activity or&#xD;
           aPTT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only that specific test should be prescribed by the ward, and only that the corresponding&#xD;
      test result be given by the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ideally, fresh patients samples should be evaluated for both Anti-Xa activity and aPTT,&#xD;
           data being recorded, but only the prescribed test should be given to the ward. In&#xD;
           addition, it would be necessary to store aliquots (0.5-1.0 mL each) of plasmas samples&#xD;
           frozen at -70°C for control purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be follow-up at 3-months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data to be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients demographical data (sex, age), indication of UFH therapy (VTE, ACS,&#xD;
      other…),comorbidity (cancer, pregnancy, postoperative period, other…), concomitant therapy&#xD;
      (medication such as oral contraceptive…) , previous history of thrombosis (DVT, ACS,stroke,&#xD;
      other…) Duration (in hours) and total dosage (IU) of heparin therapy before randomization (if&#xD;
      any) Route of administration (IV, SC), daily heparin dosage (IU), duration of treatment, time&#xD;
      to achieve therapeutic range, number of dosage change per day, laboratory test results&#xD;
      (anti-Xa activity or aPTT) Outcome: death (any cause (to be recorded), description of any&#xD;
      bleeding complication (when, localization, classification as major or minor…) or recurrence&#xD;
      of thrombosis (when,localization…) while on UFH therapy and within the 3-month follow-up.&#xD;
