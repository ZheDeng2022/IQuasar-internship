  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conventionally, ICSI was initially developed and has been shown to be an effective treatment&#xD;
      for male factor infertility. It is increasingly being used for patients without a male factor&#xD;
      diagnosis, despite the lack of clinical evidence to support its use. Moreover, ICSI is an&#xD;
      invasive and expensive procedure. This multi-center, randomized, controlled, parallel-group&#xD;
      trial will be conducted to compare the effectiveness of ICSI versus conventional IVF in&#xD;
      infertile couples scheduled for IVF treatment, in whom the male partner has normal sperm.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients undergoing IVF/ICSI will be treated with a GnRH antagonist protocol. Recombinant&#xD;
      FSH (Puregon, MSD) will be given on day 2 or day 3 of menstrual cycle for 5 days. The&#xD;
      starting dose is individualized for each patient based on the following criteria: AMH &lt;0.7&#xD;
      ng/mL, dose 300 IU/day; AMH 0.7-2.1 ng/mL, dose 200 IU/day; AMH &gt;2.1 ng/mL, dose 150 IU/day.&#xD;
      After that, investigators can titrate the dose based on their clinical judgment. Follicular&#xD;
      development will be monitored by ultrasound scanning and measurement of estradiol and&#xD;
      progesterone levels, starting on day 5 of stimulation. Scanning and hormonal measurement will&#xD;
      be repeated every 2 to 3 days, depending on the size of follicles. An antagonist is routinely&#xD;
      used on day 5 until the day of triggering. Criteria for triggering, by hCG (Ovitrelle 250 mg,&#xD;
      Merck, Germany) will be the presence of at least three leading follicles of 17 mm. In women&#xD;
      with excessive follicular response (≥15 follicles ≥12 mm), 0,2 mg Triptorelin (Diphereline,&#xD;
      Ipsen Beaufour, France) will be used when there are at least two leading follicles of 17 mm.&#xD;
      Oocyte retrieval will be performed 36 hours after triggering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and allocation of participants to study groups will be performed on the day of&#xD;
      egg pick up, after having obtained the semen from the husband. Eligible participants that&#xD;
      have provided informed consent will be randomised to either ICSI or conventional IVF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In ICSI group, insemination will be performed by using ICSI, 3 - 4 hours after oocyte&#xD;
      retrieval. OCCs will be stripped by using hyaluronidase. Only matured oocytes will be&#xD;
      inseminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conventional IVF group, insemination will be performed by conventional IVF. Two hours&#xD;
      after retrieval, collected OCCs will be inseminated for another 2 hours, at a concentration&#xD;
      of 100,000 motile sperm/ml. Inseminated OCCs will be cultured overnight in culture medium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, fertilization check will be performed under inverted microscope at period of&#xD;
      16-18 hours after insemination. On day 3, embryo evaluation will be performed at fixed time&#xD;
      point 66±2 hours after fertilization, using the Istanbul consensus. Embryo transfer will be&#xD;
      performed on day 3 under ultrasound guidance. A maximum of 2 embryos will be transferred into&#xD;
      the uterus. The remaining grade 1 and 2 embryos will be frozen. Luteal-phase support will be&#xD;
      done with estradiol (Valiera 2mg) 8mg/day and vaginal progesterone 800mg/day (Cyclogest&#xD;
      400mg) until 7th week of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there are contra-indications for fresh embryo transfer, a freeze-all strategy will be&#xD;
      applied, using Cryotech technique. Indications for freeze-all include: risk of ovarian&#xD;
      hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), premature progesterone rise (≥1.5 ng/ml), thin endometrium&#xD;
      (&lt;7 mm), fluid in cavity on day of embryo transfer, endometrial polyp, hydrosalpinx that have&#xD;
      not removed before oocyte retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the next cycle, endometrium will be prepared by using estradiol (Valiera 2 mg, 8 mg/day)&#xD;
      orally, starting from day 2-3 of menstrual cycle. When the endometrium thickness reaches 8 mm&#xD;
      or more, patients will start using progesterone vaginally (Cyclogest 400 mg, 800 mg/day).&#xD;
      Embryo transfer will be performed 3 days after using progesterone. On the day of embryo&#xD;
      transfer, embryos will be thawed. In the frozen/thawed cycle, the best embryos will be&#xD;
      utilized first, as in fresh transfer. Two hours after thawing, a maximum of 2 surviving&#xD;
      embryos will be transferred into the uterus under ultrasound guidance. Luteal phase support&#xD;
      will be provided with estradiol (Valiera 2mg) 8mg/day and vaginal progesterone 800 mg/day&#xD;
      (Cyclogest 400 mg) until the seventh week of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, clinicians who perform embryo transfer, either fresh or frozen cycles, will&#xD;
      be blinded to the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A serum hCG will be measured 2 weeks after embryo transferred, and if positive, an ultrasound&#xD;
      scan of the uterus will be performed at gestational weeks 7 and 12. At 11 - 12 weeks of&#xD;
      gestation, participants will be referred to the Outpatient clininc, O&amp;G Department, My Duc&#xD;
      hospital or An Sinh hospital for prenatal care until giving birth.&#xD;

Oocyte retrieval will be performed 36 hours after triggering.&#xD;
Insemination will be performed by conventional IVF. Two hours after retrieval, collected OCCs will be inseminated for another 2 hours (100,000 motile sperm/ml). Inseminated OCCs will be cultured overnight in culture medium.&#xD;
Fertilization check will be performed at period of 16-18 hours after insemination. Embryo transfer will be performed on day 3. A maximum of 2 embryos will be transferred. The remaining grade 1-2 embryos will be frozen.</description>

    <description>In ICSI group, insemination will be performed by using ICSI, 3 - 4 hours after oocyte retrieval. OCCs will be stripped by using hyaluronidase. Only matured oocytes will be inseminated.</description>
