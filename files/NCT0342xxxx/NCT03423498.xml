  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of conservative treatment of hallux valgus deformity has not been&#xD;
      sufficiently explored yet. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the&#xD;
      toe-spread-out exercise on the amplitude and frequency pattern in a surface electromyographic&#xD;
      examination in patients with hallux valgus and in people without the deformity. An additional&#xD;
      objective is the assessment of nerve conduction in an electroneurography and the assessment&#xD;
      of range of motion in a clinical examination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design was based on an interventional model (clinical trial). The participants were&#xD;
      assigned to two research groups (A - with diagnosis of hallux valgus and B- without the&#xD;
      deformity) that received therapeutic intervention of the TSO exercise performed unilaterally.&#xD;
      The unexercised feet could have caused a synergistic effect and falsified the results, thus&#xD;
      the unexercised feet were excluded from the control group. Nevertheless, a small control&#xD;
      group which did not undergo any hallux therapy was created to check if any changes in&#xD;
      analysed parameters are actually related to the intervention. These control group patients&#xD;
      were examined twice at an interval of 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hallux deformities were assessed on the basis of X-ray images taken in weight-bearing&#xD;
      conditions, in a standing position in the anterior-posterior projection. On all X-rays the&#xD;
      hallux valgus angles (HVA) and the first intermetatarsal angles (FIA) were designated and&#xD;
      measured by one radiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, each patient with hallux valgus was assessed according to the Hallux&#xD;
      Metatarsophalangeal-Interphalangeal scale (HMP-IP scale) developed by the AOFAS (American&#xD;
      Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of the exercises were assessed using a comparison of the outcomes of two&#xD;
      examinations: before and after therapy (research group A and B). For this purpose, a surface&#xD;
      electromyographic examination (sEMG) recorded from the abductor hallucis (AbdH) muscle was&#xD;
      performed. The following parameters of electromyography were analysed in three phases of TSO&#xD;
      exercise: amplitude and frequency pattern. Additionally, the motor fibres of the tibial nerve&#xD;
      and the sensory fibres of the sural nerve function in electroneurographic examination (ENG)&#xD;
      and range of motion of hallux using goniometer were assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sEMG recorded from the AbdH muscle and the ENG were performed with the use of the&#xD;
      KeyPoint System (Medtronic A/S, Skovlunde, Denmark) and appropriate to the type of&#xD;
      neurophysiological studies and set of electrodes (surface electrodes, bipolar stimulating&#xD;
      electrode, and grounding electrode).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the analysis of the bioelectrical activity of the AbdH the standard disposable Ag/AgCl&#xD;
      surface electrodes with an active surface of 5mm2 were applied. The active electrode&#xD;
      (cathode) was located on the belly muscle and the reference electrode (anode) was attached 3&#xD;
      cm distally from the active electrode. For the purpose of the sEMG examinations, the time&#xD;
      base on 80ms/D and sensitivity of the recording of 0.5mV/D were set. 10kHz upper and 20Hz&#xD;
      lower filters of the recorder amplifier were used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sEMG recordings were performed during three phases of the TSO exercise. The following&#xD;
      parameters were analysed: amplitude of motor unit action potential (MUAP) measured in mV, and&#xD;
      the frequency pattern of the MUAP recruitment of AbdH muscle activity. The sEMG tests with&#xD;
      maintaining each phase of the TSO exercise were performed three times in order to obtain more&#xD;
      objective results. The first test was treated as a training trial. The other two were taken&#xD;
      into account to assess the amplitude and the frequency pattern. Only the trial with the&#xD;
      highest amplitude and the most interference pattern was analysed as the result of the most&#xD;
      effective recruitment of the MUAPs. The minimal and maximal amplitude values were&#xD;
      automatically measured by the KeyPoint System after the marking of the MUAP amplitude peaks.&#xD;
      An 'on-line' evaluation of the frequency of the MUAP recruitment during a maximal muscle&#xD;
      contraction was a subjective visual assessment made by one experienced neurophysiologist. It&#xD;
      was based on the following classification patterns presented by Buchthal et al. and by&#xD;
      Stalberg and Falck: interference, intermediate, poor, and straight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the ENG the following parameters of the CMAP (compound muscle action potential) from the&#xD;
      tibial nerve and of the SNAP (sensory nerve action potential) from the sural nerve were&#xD;
      analysed: amplitude (measured from a negative inflection to the baseline in mV or in ÂµV),&#xD;
      latency (measured in ms) and conduction velocity (measured in m/s). During the ENG the time&#xD;
      base on 5ms/D and sensitivity of the recordings on 2mV/D were set. 10Hz upper and 10kHz lower&#xD;
      filters of the recorder amplifier were used. In order to record the compound muscle action&#xD;
      potentials (CMAP) evoked from the AbdH muscle, the same location of surface electrodes as in&#xD;
      the EMG was used. The electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve was applied in two points:&#xD;
      below the medial malleolus and in the popliteal fossa. The ground electrode was located in&#xD;
      the plantar part of the foot. Single rectangular stimuli with duration of 0.2ms were&#xD;
      delivered via bipolar electrode at 1Hz frequency while their intensity ranged from 30mA to&#xD;
      the value evoking the supramaximal CMAP. For recordings of SNAP from the sural nerve&#xD;
      antidromic and repetitive electrical stimulation with an intensity of 20 mA was required.&#xD;
      Recording electrodes were placed near the lateral malleolus while the stimulation point was&#xD;
      15 cm proximally at the external border of the Achilles tendon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical examination with the use of a goniometer was performed in the supine position of&#xD;
      the patient. The investigator measured the range of the motion of the plantar and dorsal&#xD;
      flexion in the first metatarsophalangeal joint and plantar flexion in the hallux&#xD;
      interphalangeal joint.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>toe-spread-out exercise</intervention_name>
    <description>The therapeutic intervention lasted 14 days and focused on doing the TSO exercise. This exercise was performed unilaterally under the supervision of a qualified physiotherapist. The starting position of the TSO exercise was the sitting position with the knee joint and hip bent at 90 degrees. The exercise consisted of 3 consecutive phases: dorsiflexion of the toes keeping the metatarsal heads and the heel on the ground, moving the fifth toe down and in a lateral direction, moving the big toe down and abduction. The final position needs to be maintained for 5 seconds. The whole sequence was repeated 200 times a day.</description>
