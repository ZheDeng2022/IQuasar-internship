      Open-label, Prospective, Study to Evaluate the Cutera excel V laser at 532 nm in a low&#xD;
      fluence, high repetition rate mode and the Micro-Lens Array attachment used with excel V&#xD;
      laser at 1064 nm and 532 nm for the improvement of skin quality.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, prospective, study in approximately 60 male or female subjects, age 18&#xD;
      to 65 years who desire laser treatment for the improvement of rhytides, lentigines,&#xD;
      pigmentation, erythema, telangiectasia, pore size and skin texture. Subjects may undergo a&#xD;
      2mm punch biopsy a treatment area up to 72 hours post treatment and at a designated follow-up&#xD;
      period per Investigator discretion. Subjects will receive up to 6 laser treatments, spaced 6&#xD;
      weeks (± 4 weeks) apart. Subjects will be contacted by phone 7 days (± 2 days) after their&#xD;
      first treatment for follow-up. Subjects will return to the site after final study treatment&#xD;
      for two follow-up visits: 6 and 12 weeks (± 4 weeks).&#xD;
