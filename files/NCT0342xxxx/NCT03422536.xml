  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well ficlatuzumab with or without cetuximab work&#xD;
      in treating patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma that has come back or spread&#xD;
      to other places in the body and resistant to cetuximab treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such&#xD;
      as ficlatuzumab and cetuximab, may block growth signals that lets a tumor cell survive and&#xD;
      reproduce, and helps the immune system recognize and fight head and neck squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the efficacy of ficlatuzumab, with or without concurrent cetuximab, in patients&#xD;
      with cetuximab-resistant, recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)&#xD;
      as measured by progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe toxicity and patient-reported quality of life. II. To evaluate response rate&#xD;
      and overall survival in both treatment arms. III. To evaluate the relationship between&#xD;
      clinical outcomes (PFS, response rate [RR]) and candidate tumoral, genomic, peripheral, and&#xD;
      immune biomarkers, including: HGF/cMet, EGFR/EGFR, and EGFR/HER2 dimers; mutations in PIK3CA,&#xD;
      PTEN, and HRAS; peripheral serum biomarkers including VeriStrat, HGF, soluble HGF, and IL6;&#xD;
      peripheral lymphocyte populations; archived and baseline immune infiltrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive ficlatuzumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes every 2 weeks in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 60 -120 minutes and ficlatuzumab IV over 30-60&#xD;
      minutes every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity. Courses&#xD;
      repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;
