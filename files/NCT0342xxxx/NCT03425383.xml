      Chronic inflammation plays a crucial role in the genesis of atherosclerosis and at the same&#xD;
      time promotes acute cardiovascular events. Periodontal and pulpal inflammation are two major&#xD;
      low grade chronic inflammatory infectious disease of oral cavity. Apical periodontitis is an&#xD;
      inflammatory process, most often chronic in nature, of endodontic origin usually occurring at&#xD;
      or near apex of the tooth root. The scientific literature has failed to provide the potential&#xD;
      connection between endodontic infection and CV risk. Few studies have found the possible&#xD;
      association, yet few studies does not suggest any link. The association between chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory lesions and endothelial dysfunction can be detected using inflammatory, invasive&#xD;
      and non-invasive markers. Inflammatory markers such as hs-CRP and Interleukins are not cost&#xD;
      efficient and invasive markers- Angiography and Plethysmography are unethical to use on&#xD;
      asymptomatic subjects. Non-invasive markers such as Flow mediated dilatation (FMD) and&#xD;
      carotid intima media thickness (c-IMT) are inexpensive, fast and safe. The rationale of our&#xD;
      study is to check the possible association between endodontic infection and CVD using&#xD;
      non-invasive markers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is the primary non-communicable cause of global mortality&#xD;
      killing more than 7 million people per year. Chronic inflammation plays a crucial role in the&#xD;
      genesis of atherosclerosis which further leads to cardiovascular disease. Apical&#xD;
      periodontitis is &quot;an acute or chronic inflammatory lesion around the apex of a tooth caused&#xD;
      by bacterial infection of the pulp canal system&quot;. Histologically, it is represented by a&#xD;
      periapical inflammatory response that arises after resorption of adjacent supporting bone and&#xD;
      local infiltration of inflammatory cells. In response to chronic inflammation, endothelium&#xD;
      dysfunction occurs which leads to switch from a Nitric Oxide environment to a reactive oxygen&#xD;
      dominated (ROS)-dominated inflammatory environment. The nitric oxide environment of the&#xD;
      normal functional endothelium helps to maintain an equilibrium in the circulating system by&#xD;
      inhibiting platelet aggregation, monocyte adhesion and vascular smooth muscle cell&#xD;
      proliferation. Coronary endothelial dysfunction is considered an early stage of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis and is associated with an increased risk of ischaemic cardiovascular&#xD;
      outcomes. Several cross-sectional and longitudinal studies has shown the association of&#xD;
      Apical periodontitis and Cardiovascular disease. Yet some studies states that there is no&#xD;
      correlation and some showing the result is inconclusive making this link very controversial.&#xD;
      All the studies are either hospital record based studies or they used inflammatory biomarkers&#xD;
      for evaluating the association between endodontic infection and CVD which are very expensive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically, vasoregulation has been measured in both the coronary and peripheral circulation,&#xD;
      using changes in vessel diameter as an index of conduit vessel endothelial function. The&#xD;
      three most common clinically used techniques are-(a) Angiography, (b) Flow mediated&#xD;
      dilatation (FMD), (c) and Venous plethysmography. Due to the invasive nature of angiography&#xD;
      and plethysmography, these methods are unsuitable to be used on asymptomatic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, the non-invasive nature of the FMD allows repeated measurements over time&#xD;
      to study the effectiveness of various interventions that may affect vascular health. The&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of FMD is 95% and 37% respectively. Impaired&#xD;
      endothelium-dependent dilatation in the coronary circulation is associated with coronary&#xD;
      atherosclerosis and coronary risk factors and improves with risk reduction therapies. It has&#xD;
      been shown FMD was an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease. Thus, brachial artery&#xD;
      flow-mediated dilation prove useful to assess cardio- vascular risk, guide therapy, and judge&#xD;
      the potential utility of new interventions for cardiovascular disease. FMD, which is most&#xD;
      widely used non-invasive ultrasound method to assess endothelial function has been used in&#xD;
      various interventional and cross-sectional studies depicting the link between periodontitis&#xD;
      and endothelial dysfunction. But no such studies has been done evaluating the link between&#xD;
      endodontic infection and endothelial dysfunction using these markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another commonly used non-invasive marker these days is Carotid Intima-media thickness (IMT).&#xD;
      c-IMT is increasingly used as a surrogate end point of vascular outcomes in clinical trials&#xD;
      aimed at determining the success of interventions that lower risk factors for atherosclerosis&#xD;
      and associated diseases (stroke, myocardial infarction and peripheral artery diseases). This&#xD;
      observer dependable technique, which serves both as an early detector and a follow up tool,&#xD;
      provides information about common carotid (CCA), bifurcation, internal (ICA) and external&#xD;
      carotid arteries. It has been established that abnormal baseline and rapid progressive CIMT&#xD;
      are correlated to more cardiovascular and stroke events. Every 0.1 mm increase in the CIMT&#xD;
      was associated with a 10-15% increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, and in the same&#xD;
      line, a 13-18 % increase in stroke events. Many interventional and cross-sectional studies&#xD;
      have shown the link between periodontitis and c-IMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No prospective observational trial, to the best of our knowledge, has been done till date&#xD;
      depicting the link between endodontic infection and cardiovascular disease using FMD and&#xD;
      c-IMT. The aim of the present study is to depict that endodontic infection is also one of the&#xD;
      novel risk factor of CVD using a non-invasive techniques i.e. Flow mediated dilatation (FMD)&#xD;
      and c-IMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS AND OBJECTIVES To depict that Endodontic infection is associated with endothelial&#xD;
      dysfuction by measuring flow mediated dilatation (FMD) of brachial artery and carotid intima&#xD;
      media thickness (c-IMT) of common carotid artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will be done in the department of Radiology, PGIMS, Rohtak and Department&#xD;
      of Cardiology, PGIMS, Rohtak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be obtained from the pool of OPD patients in the Department of&#xD;
      Conservative dentistry and Endodontics, PGIDS, Rohtak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY 35 patients who consecutively registered for a dental checkup at the OPD and&#xD;
      fulfilled the previously mentioned criteria will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional 35 patients who were free from clinical and radiographic evidence of AP and met&#xD;
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study will be included as contols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All individuals aged will underwent a complete CV assessment including medical history,&#xD;
      physical examination, blood pressure measurement and 12-lead electrocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A complete dental examination will be performed on each patient in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DENTAL EXAMINATION A panoramic radiograph will be examined and used as initial screening . It&#xD;
      will be followed by selected periapical radiographs taken on teeth suspected of presenting AP&#xD;
      and in all teeth with root canal treatments or presenting extensive restorations (including&#xD;
      prosthetic restorations) with or without previous endodontic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periapical radiographs were taken with a radiographic unit by using a long cone paralleling&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By using both radiographic and intraoral evaluations the following parameters were recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Number of teeth present&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Number and location of restored teeth&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Number of endodontically treated teeth&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Number and location of teeth affected by carious processes&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Soft tissue assessment (presence and location of swelling/sinus tracts)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Periodontal probing&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Number and location of teeth with AP&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. State of the upper and lower jaws Brachial Artery Assessment Patient preparation 1) Fast&#xD;
           at least 8-12 hours before study. 2) Should not exercise, should not ingest substances&#xD;
           like caffeine, high fat foods, vit C or tobacco at least 4-6 hours before study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Procedure The diameter of the target artery (right brachial artery) was measured&#xD;
      from two- dimensional ultrasound images, with a 70 MHz linear array transducer and a standard&#xD;
      128XP/10 system (Acuson, Mountain View, California, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient is placed in supine position with arm comfortably placed. Right brachial artery will&#xD;
      be imaged above antecubital fossa in longitudinal plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each study 4 scans will be taken:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scan1 (At rest) The subject lay at rest for at least 10 min before a first resting scan will&#xD;
      be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then diameter of the artery will be measured from anterior to the posterior &quot;m&quot; line (the&#xD;
      interface between intima media and intima adventitia)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial flow velocity will be measured, by means of a pulsed doppler signal at a 70deg angle&#xD;
      to the vessel in the centre of the artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scan 2 (Endothelium dependent FMD) Increased flow was then induced by inflation of a&#xD;
      pneumatic tourniquet to a pressure of at least 50 mm Hg above systolic pressure for 4-5 min&#xD;
      (reactive hyperaemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second scan was taken for 30 s before and 90 s after cuff deflation, including a repeat&#xD;
      flow velocity recording for the first 15 s after cuff release.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brachial Artery diameter will be taken 45-60 sec after cuff deflation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scan3 (Again at rest) At least 10 min of rest is needed after reactive hyperaemia before&#xD;
      another image is acquired to reflect the re-established baseline conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third scan is taken at this point of time. Scan4 (Endothelium independent FMD) Then 0.4 mg of&#xD;
      nitroglycerine (GTN) is given sublingually. (GTN will be omitted if the patient refuse or if&#xD;
      the patient had a history of migraine headaches, systolic blood pressure &lt;100 mm Hg, previous&#xD;
      adverse reaction to nitrates, or critical carotid artery stenosis) After 4 min fourth and&#xD;
      final scan will be taken. Carotid intima-media thickness (c-IMT) Common carotid artery (CCA)&#xD;
      will be used because of its convenience and high reproducibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c-IMT will be assessed by M-mode ultrasonography via a vivid 7 MHz linear array transducer&#xD;
      and a standard 128XP/10 system (Acuson, Mountain View, California, USA) with participants in&#xD;
      the supine position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CCA will be scanned on longitudinal two-dimensional planes. Images will be obtained at the&#xD;
      level of distal 1.0 cm of the right CCA. When an optimal image will be obtained, it was&#xD;
      frozen on the R wave of the electro- cardiogram and stored on videotape.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each segment, the c-IMT of the posterior wall will be measured automatically over 200&#xD;
      pixels with computer-assisted electronic callipers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximal right CCA thickness will be measured and used for analysis. Primary Outcome variable&#xD;
      The primary outcome variables observed for the study will be the difference in the FMD and&#xD;
      c-IMT of the test group and control group.&#xD;
