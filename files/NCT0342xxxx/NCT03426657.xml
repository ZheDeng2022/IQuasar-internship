      First-line treatment of locally advanced HNSCC with double checkpoint blockade and&#xD;
      radiotherapy dependent on intratumoral CD8+ T cell Infiltration.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label, prospective, non-randomized Phase II clinical trial of&#xD;
      locally advanced HNSCC with double checkpoint blockade and radiotherapy dependent on&#xD;
      intratumoral CD8+ T cell Infiltration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will initially be treated with the PD-L1 inhibitor Durvalumab (1500 mg q4w) and&#xD;
      the CTLA-4 Inhibitor Tremelimumab (75 mg q4w / since Amendment 3 (01.04.2020): 300 mg&#xD;
      absolute dose d5) and one cycle with Cisplatin (30mg/m² d1-3) and Docetaxel (75mg/m² d1).&#xD;
      Treatment response will be evaluated clinically by endoscopy with biopsy. Changes of the CD8+&#xD;
      T cell density in the second biopsy compared to the first one before therapy will be used for&#xD;
      patient selection. Patients with a stable or decreased CD8+ tumor infiltrating immune cell&#xD;
      density or clinical progressive disease will receive standard CRT outside the trial. For&#xD;
      these patients toxicity will be monitored until the first dose of the subsequent standard&#xD;
      CRT. Patients with an increased CD8+ tumor infiltrating immune cell density and at least&#xD;
      clinically stable disease will receive radioimmunotherapy with the PD-L1 Inhibitor Durvalumab&#xD;
      and the CTLA4-Inhibitor Tremelimumab (altogether 4 doses q4w including the induction dose)&#xD;
      followed by maintenance therapy with Durvalumab (8 additional doses q4w). The primary&#xD;
      endpoint is feasibility. Feasibility criteria are receiving the protocol treatment until&#xD;
      cycle 6 of antibody treatment and absence of any of the DLT defined in the protocol. A&#xD;
      feasibility rate of ≥80% is expected. The efficacy of radioimmunotherapy and predictive&#xD;
      character of changes of CD8+ tumor infiltrating immune cells after induction&#xD;
      chemo-immunotherapy are further endpoints. The follow up period will be two years after the&#xD;
      completion of radiotherapy.&#xD;
