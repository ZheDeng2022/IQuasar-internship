  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The United States (US) faces a crisis of pain management. According to the 2012 National&#xD;
      Health Interview Survey, almost 50 million adults in the US reported having significant&#xD;
      chronic or severe pain (Nahin 2015). Doctors in the US still prescribe opioids across the&#xD;
      board for pain despite a growing recognition of an epidemic of opioid overdose and use&#xD;
      disorder. Few solutions have been successfully proposed and implemented. Placebos represent a&#xD;
      novel and potentially fruitful means of addressing this issue. However, clinicians often use&#xD;
      placebos deceptively and with little rationale or evidence of benefit, making their use&#xD;
      ethically problematic. In contrast with their typical current use, a provocative line of&#xD;
      research suggests that placebos can be intentionally exploited to extend analgesic&#xD;
      therapeutic effects. Recently, we reviewed a database of placebo studies including 22 studies&#xD;
      in both animals and humans hinting of evidence that placebos may work as a dose extender of&#xD;
      active painkillers. Placebos given after repeated administration of active treatments can&#xD;
      acquire medication-like effects based on learning mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, we will test if dose-extending placebos are effective in relieving clinical acute pain&#xD;
      in opioid patients with traumatic pain. Patients will be randomized to three arms. Arm 1 will&#xD;
      be a Full Dose (FD) group, which will receive all NSAIDs as described in the Guidelines for&#xD;
      NSAID use in Orthopedic Patients and Oxycodone (5mg). Arm 2 will be a Partial Reinforcement&#xD;
      (PR) group, which will receive NSAIDs, Oxycodone (5mg), and placebos to reach a 50% reduction&#xD;
      of the total intake of opioids. Finally, Arm 3 will be a Control (C) group receiving NSAIDs&#xD;
      and placebos. Patients will be assigned to one of three arms according to a 1:1:1 schedule of&#xD;
      randomization. Study IDs will be generated by the pharmacy and blinding will occur by&#xD;
      ensuring that oxycodone and placebos look, smell, and taste identical. Rescue therapy will be&#xD;
      provided as needed. This novel prospect of placebo use has the potential to change our&#xD;
      general thinking about painkiller treatments, the typical regimens of painkiller&#xD;
      applications, and the ways in which treatments are evaluated.&#xD;

      Overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will screen 500 patients from the Shock Trauma Center to recruit a total of 159 (53 per&#xD;
      arm) to participate in a pilot study aimed at reducing use of opioids. Participants will meet&#xD;
      all of the eligibility criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. After enrollment,&#xD;
      participants will be blindly allocated to one of three randomization arms by means of&#xD;
      de-identified Study IDs corresponding to treatment arms. Study IDs will be generated by the&#xD;
      pharmacy and blinding will be ensured by creating study drugs that look, smell, and taste&#xD;
      identical. The pharmacy will create and dispense identical study drugs in terms of&#xD;
      appearance, smell, and taste. Only the blinding coordinator will know the identity of&#xD;
      patients in each treatment arm. Arm 1 will be a Full Dose (FD) group, which will receive&#xD;
      Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), dosed in accordance with the University of&#xD;
      Maryland Shock Trauma Center (STC) Guidelines for NSAIDs and Oxycodone (5mg). Arm 2 will be a&#xD;
      Partial Reinforcement (PR) group, which will receive NSAIDs, Oxycodone (5mg), and placebos to&#xD;
      reach a 50% reduction of the total intake of opioids. Finally, Arm 3 will be a Control (C)&#xD;
      group receiving NSAIDs and placebos. Patients will be assigned to one of these three arms&#xD;
      according to a 1:1:1 schedule of randomization. The patient will start receiving study&#xD;
      medication as part of his or her pain management as soon as possible after admission to the&#xD;
      hospital and enrollment in the study (ideally as their first dose of pain-management&#xD;
      medication). Rescue therapy will be provided as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled patients will receive an Adult Pain Management Service (APMS) consult. APMS will&#xD;
      work with the study and clinical teams to ensure that all treatment protocols are met, and be&#xD;
      available to address any issues that may arise. The APMS provider will work with the primary&#xD;
      service to determine the most effective NSAID as described in their guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other than the study medication (Oxycodone and placebo), all participants will be treated in&#xD;
      accordance with the current standard of care at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma&#xD;
      Center. This includes intravenous Toradol every 8 hours for 24 hours followed by oral NSAIDs&#xD;
      round the clock until pain is minimal. The timing of administration will be the same for&#xD;
      participants in all three arms - they will receive their arm's treatment (Oxycodone,&#xD;
      Oxycodone alternating with placebo, or no additional medication beyond standard of care&#xD;
      NSAIDs) round the clock for the first 24 hours followed by every hours for the remainder of&#xD;
      hospitalization. All patients will receive intravenous Dilaudid every hour for rescue or&#xD;
      break through pain. In addition, all patients will be discharged on Oxycodone tablets (5mg)&#xD;
      every 3 hours as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Arm 2, the first four doses of study drug will be Oxycodone (5mg) to condition them to its&#xD;
      effects. Afterwards, they will receive alternating Oxycodone (5mg) and placebo according to&#xD;
      one of four repeating sequences. During data analysis, we will test whether the sequence of&#xD;
      administration has an effect on outcomes. Participants in Arm 2 will never receive more than&#xD;
      2 doses of placebo in a row. This administration schedule will be repeated for the remainder&#xD;
      of hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to patients' enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intent of this study is to enroll 159 patients with trauma into this study to compare&#xD;
      strategies to reduce opioid use during the management of acute pain. Patients will be&#xD;
      screened on admission to the Shock Trauma Center. Eligible patients will meet all of the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. Patients with trauma will be&#xD;
      considered for enrollment and be flagged for screening. A plan by the primary service to&#xD;
      adhere to The Shock Trauma Protocol for NSAID use is also a requirement for enrollment.&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be informed and have the opportunity to discuss the nature of the&#xD;
      study, potential for treatment allocation, and risk/benefits. For those who agree to&#xD;
      participate, the approved Informed Consent Form and HIPAA authorization form will be signed.&#xD;
      The research staff will explain to the participant what tasks they are expected to complete&#xD;
      during this study, answer any questions they may have, and ensure comprehension by completing&#xD;
      the Informed Consent Checklist, which asks participants to verbally report their&#xD;
      understanding of the study purpose and procedures, among other key points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation to treatment group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the participant discusses and signs the consent form, a staff member will call the&#xD;
      pharmacy to inform them of the participant's de-identified Screening number. The pharmacy&#xD;
      will then randomly assign that participant a Study ID corresponding randomly to one of the&#xD;
      three treatment groups and handle drug logistics (sourcing, processing, and administration)&#xD;
      for the remainder of Phase I. The patient will start receiving the study drug within 24 hours&#xD;
      of being able to take narcotics, ideally as his/her first narcotic medication. All staff&#xD;
      involved with the protocol will be fully trained on it and will be given study team member&#xD;
      emergency contacts in case of incident.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxycodone and Placebo will be identical in terms of appearance, taste, and smell so as to&#xD;
      keep both the investigators and participants blind to their treatment allocation. Oxycodone&#xD;
      and placebo oral suspensions will be manufactured by the IDS. Oxycodone solution will be made&#xD;
      from tablets to ensure blinding. In this way, both Oxycodone and placebo will look identical&#xD;
      for taste, color, and smell. This will help not only to blind the study, but also facilitate&#xD;
      study drug administration given that patients may be intubated. All research personnel, aside&#xD;
      from the pharmacists and team members responsible for final review and write-up of the study,&#xD;
      will be blinded to participants' treatment groups. The pharmacy will dispense medications for&#xD;
      each participant that will correspond with their allocated treatment group. For participants&#xD;
      in the Partial Reduction group (Arm 2), the pharmacy will dispense the study drug. In&#xD;
      summary, participants in Arm 2 will receive four doses of Oxycodone (5mg) followed by one of&#xD;
      four repeating schedules of administration alternating between Oxycodone (5mg) and placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospitalization window (Enrollment - End of Hospitalization):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain ratings will be recorded as usual within 20 to 90 minutes after each study drug&#xD;
      administration. Also, participants will be given the option to complete a set of&#xD;
      psychological questionnaires during the time in the hospital or by the time of their first&#xD;
      follow-up visit. Questionnaires unrelated to pain will be optional. Although we cannot change&#xD;
      the wording of our validated pain questionnaires, staff will be trained to use the phrasing&#xD;
      such as &quot;how well they are able to perform their daily activities, how well they are able to&#xD;
      interact with visitors/family, and how well they are sleeping&quot; whenever possible, and that&#xD;
      surveys andquestions during the follow-up phase will also take this non-pain-centric&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discharge:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be monitored for subsequent use of opioids at the first post-discharge&#xD;
      visit (at approximately 2 weeks) and within month 1, 3, and 6 for follow-ups. The research&#xD;
      team via calls, letters, emails, or texts. REDCap, Qualtrics / MetricWire will be used to&#xD;
      facilitate the communication via text and emails. The team member will ask the participant&#xD;
      questions about their health and medication use. In addition, a phone application may be&#xD;
      developed or the data collection system Qualtrics used to gather information about&#xD;
      participants' medication use and health during the follow-up period. Although the wording of&#xD;
      the validated Pain Questionnaires we will use during hospitalization cannot be changed,&#xD;
      during the follow-up phase we will aim to frame questions about pain intensity and&#xD;
      interference with function in such a way as to avoid nocebo effects (i.e. asking how well&#xD;
      they are able to perform their daily activities, how well they are able to interact with&#xD;
      visitors/family, and how well they are sleeping instead of how much pain are they&#xD;
      experiencing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the clinical trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospitalization window (starting as soon after admission as possible for a projected minimum&#xD;
      of 2 days), with follow-up at approximately 2 weeks (coinciding with their first&#xD;
      post-discharge visit with their clinician), and months 1, 3, and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have the same rescue medicine available for break through pain; intravenous&#xD;
      Dilaudid every hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in each of the three randomization arms will have access to opioid rescue&#xD;
      medication (Dilaudid) as needed via a standing order for breakthrough pain rated as Severe.&#xD;
      The rate of use pf rescue therapy will be evaluated as a primary endpoints. Participants who&#xD;
      request more than 3 doses of rescue medication in a row will be withdrawn from the study and&#xD;
      referred to APMS for further pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary outcomes. To be measured daily during hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.) Acute clinical and functional pain / acute pain improvement; opioid intake; rate of&#xD;
      request of rescue therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary outcomes. To be measured daily during the follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Use (frequency and intensity) of opioid prescriptions&#xD;
