    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease (CHD) poses a major health burden in the Gulf countries. It is the&#xD;
      leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the world and poses an enormous societal burden&#xD;
      in the Gulf countries. Early detection of disease is imperative to reduce the health care&#xD;
      burden and financial costs associated with CHD. Knowledge of novel genetic and proteomic&#xD;
      markers of CHD will provide more precise estimates of risk while defining the pathways&#xD;
      important in individual patients, revealing new targets for intervention, and ultimately&#xD;
      enabling an individualized approach to care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To translate recent advances in genomics and proteomics into clinical practice, these newly&#xD;
      discovered biomarkers will need to be evaluated in patients of diverse ethnic groups with&#xD;
      varying characteristics, environmental factors, and medication use. The investigators propose&#xD;
      to establish a biorepository of plasma and Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) linked to demographic&#xD;
      and clinical variables to facilitate biomarker studies of CHD risk, progression, and outcome.&#xD;
      The overarching goal in developing the Qatar Cardiovascular Biorepository (QCBio) is to&#xD;
      create a resource that fosters research aimed at identifying novel biochemical and genetic&#xD;
      markers of CHD. A biorepository with linkage to clinical data will also provide an invaluable&#xD;
      resource for cardiovascular research, including genomic and proteomic studies of CHD and&#xD;
      development of biomarkers for early detection of disease and personalized drug therapy&#xD;
      (pharmacogenetics and pharmacoproteomics).&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prediction of Coronary heart disease (CHD) events is based on conventional risk factors for&#xD;
      atherosclerosis such as age, sex, blood pressure, diabetes, lipid levels, and smoking status.&#xD;
      Because these risk factors are prevalent in much of the population, available risk prediction&#xD;
      algorithms lack desired sensitivity and specificity. For instance, Cooper et al showed that&#xD;
      the algorithms correctly predicted just ~11% of the CHD events occurring within 10 years.&#xD;
      Thus, there is an urgent need to develop and validate new biomarkers for early detection of&#xD;
      disease and more accurate risk stratification. According to the World Health Organization&#xD;
      (WHO) estimates, cardiovascular disease will be the leading cause of morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      by the year 2020. Developing countries including the Gulf States will be the major&#xD;
      contributors to this increased death and disability. A recent report by McKinsey &amp; Company&#xD;
      forecast that the Gulf region will face an unparalleled and unprecedented rise in demand for&#xD;
      health care over the course of the next two decades, with an estimated total health care&#xD;
      spending of US$ 60 billion in 2025, up from US$ 12 billion today.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge of novel genetic and proteomic markers will provide more precise estimates of risk&#xD;
      while defining the pathways important in individual patients, revealing new targets for&#xD;
      intervention, and ultimately enabling an individualized approach to care. A biorepository of&#xD;
      Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), serum, and plasma samples will enable investigation of the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of CHD in Qatari adults, and provide an invaluable resource for preventive&#xD;
      cardiovascular research and development of biomarkers for early detection of CHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE Significant recent progress has been made in identifying genetic susceptibility&#xD;
      variants as well as circulating proteomic markers of atherosclerotic vascular disease.&#xD;
      However, the generalizability of these results to patients belonging to diverse ethnic groups&#xD;
      is unclear. To translate recent advances in genomics and proteomics into clinical practice,&#xD;
      these newly discovered biomarkers will need to be evaluated in patients of diverse ethnic&#xD;
      groups with varying characteristics, environmental factors, and medication use. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to establish a biorepository of plasma and DNA linked to demographic&#xD;
      and clinical variables to facilitate biomarker studies of CHD risk, progression, and outcome.&#xD;
      The overarching goal in developing the Qatar Cardiovascular Biorepository (QCBio) is to&#xD;
      create a resource that fosters research aimed at identifying novel biochemical and genetic&#xD;
      markers of CHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are leveraging the following resources available for this proposal:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The infrastructure and patient referral patterns of the cardiac catheterization&#xD;
           laboratory at Hamad Hospital, Doha, Qatar, where several thousand patients are seen&#xD;
           annually for coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Electronic Medical Record (EMR) at Hamad Hospital that includes risk factors, drug&#xD;
           therapy, relevant laboratory data, and vital status; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A multidisciplinary investigative team with significant experience and expertise in&#xD;
           biorepository science, including ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI),&#xD;
           laboratory information management systems, informatics, and mining of the EMR to&#xD;
           annotate biospecimen with relevant clinical covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS AND OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establish a DNA and plasma biorepository (QCBio) of Qatari CHD cases and&#xD;
           ethnicity-matched controls to enable investigation of genomic and proteomic biomarkers&#xD;
           for early detection and prognostication as well as identification of new targets for&#xD;
           drug development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Annotate the biorepository with a) demographic, laboratory, and clinical variables&#xD;
           derived from the EMR using electronic phenotyping algorithms, and b) detailed&#xD;
           information regarding history of cardiovascular diseases and risk factors derived from&#xD;
           surveys of the study subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Develop processes to promote use of the biorepository by Qatari investigators by&#xD;
           facilitating access to the biorepository for biomarker research, while maintaining the&#xD;
           highest ethical standards with emphasis on patient confidentiality and stewardship of&#xD;
           the biospecimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Tracking Recruitment: A Patient Numbering Program (PNP) is being used to de-identify&#xD;
           subjects enrolled in the study and track patient recruitment. The program contains&#xD;
           demographic information and an assigned Personal Identification Number (PIN) for each&#xD;
           participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting: Potential subjects are being identified by the study coordinators after review of&#xD;
      catheterization laboratory (Cath lab) and blood bank schedules. The study coordinator is&#xD;
      explaining the consent form and the study questionnaire to each participant. Wherever&#xD;
      possible, the investigators are attempting to collect blood specimens in the fasting state&#xD;
      before the receipt of any treatment and avoid the burden of additional venipuncture. For&#xD;
      those eligible ones, the study coordinator will provide the details regarding the objectives&#xD;
      of the study, risks and potential benefits from participation, the storage, future use and&#xD;
      privacy of the samples. In addition, the study coordinator is informing the participants&#xD;
      about the lack of immediate benefit for health and their right to withdrawal from the study&#xD;
      any time after consenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection and Processing of Blood Samples: Twenty-five milliliter of blood is being obtained&#xD;
      at the time of a procedure in the Cath lab, during admission in the Coronary care unit (CCU)&#xD;
      or at the time of the blood donation. Samples are collected from the special study area close&#xD;
      to the Cath Lab/CCU and the Blood Bank, respectively. Blood is being drawn into the&#xD;
      appropriate collection tubes, labeled with a hospital generated barcode Identification&#xD;
      number, and sent to the Molecular Genetics laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Freezer Monitoring: All freezer temperatures are being monitored round the clock by a&#xD;
      combination of project management facilities and Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) Security.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Assurance: Accurate sample handling is being achieved by adherence to Standard&#xD;
      Operating Procedures (SOPs) by following general laboratory quality assurance and control&#xD;
      standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specimen Tracking: Sample tracking will be accomplished by a Laboratory Information&#xD;
      Management System (LIMS) program that is currently being used by the Lead PI's research&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Confidentiality: The investigators will use informatics and data security features to&#xD;
      maintain patient confidentiality. The Patient Numbering Program (PNP) will be used to&#xD;
      de-identify patients enrolled in QCBio and to track patients after recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical, Legal, and Regulatory Issues in DNA Biorepositories: The consent form is including&#xD;
      separate check-off boxes to seek permission for the collection of plasma and DNA use in&#xD;
      studies of diverse diseases, and the transmittal of specimens to collaborating investigators.&#xD;
      Banking of biospecimens raises new concerns regarding a patient's privacy and consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informatics: Informatics and data security are critical components to a biorepository and key&#xD;
      to leveraging the power of biorepositories. QCBio will be linked to several databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Questionnaire: The investigators are using a questionnaire to collect information&#xD;
      regarding sociodemographic information, cardiovascular history, physical activity, lifestyle,&#xD;
      past medical information and family history. Data will be extracted from the questionnaire by&#xD;
      scanning or manual entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Annotation of Specimens with Clinical Data: The investigators are using the Hamad hospital&#xD;
      EMR viewer in addition to the laboratory databases to annotate the biorepository with&#xD;
      relevant clinical variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ascertaining Risk Factors: The investigators are ascertaining conventional cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. The EMR and survey data&#xD;
      will be used to establish presence of the following risk factors for atherosclerosis:&#xD;
      smoking, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity. The investigators are using&#xD;
      targeted manual review of paper records and EMR in tandem with access to electronic data sets&#xD;
      for laboratory values, medications, and diagnosis codes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biospecimen Management and Access to Biorepository: The investigators will develop protocols&#xD;
      to enable investigators to leverage the datasets associated with specimens, ensure compliance&#xD;
      with regulatory guidelines, encourage collaboration between Qatar, Gulf, and Mayo&#xD;
      investigators, and improve research productivity. The investigators will provide a flexible,&#xD;
      robust, secure, and validated information management workspace program to manage&#xD;
      biospecimens. Banked specimens will be available for researchers whose protocols have been&#xD;
      approved by the IRB and prioritized by the Scientific Review Panel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tracking Specimen Use: To maximize the use of the biospecimens, the investigator will use&#xD;
      LIMS to track all the specimens received by allotting unique identification for all input&#xD;
      (sample tubes) and output (DNA/plasma/white cell) tubes and record the sample movement,&#xD;
      processing, creation, and consumption. A designated computer analyst will maintain and manage&#xD;
      the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to Information: Only members of the research team will have access to the research&#xD;
      data. Participants will be identified by code numbers only in the database and in&#xD;
      transcripts; all data are tracked in databases by anonymous but linkable study numbers. No&#xD;
      identifiable information will be released outside the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategy for Project Continuation: The long-term goal of the investigative team is to create&#xD;
      a resource that enables discovery of genetic susceptibility variants and novel circulating&#xD;
      markers of CHD, thereby allowing individualized assessment of risk for CHD, a leading cause&#xD;
      of death and morbidity in Qatar. Creation of the biorepository is the first necessary step to&#xD;
      understand genomic and proteomic of CHD in Qatari individuals.&#xD;
