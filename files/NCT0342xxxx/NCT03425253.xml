  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has been designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of sequential treatment&#xD;
      with BELKYRA® (for the treatment of convexity and fullness associated with submental fat) and&#xD;
      VOLUMA™ (to restore volume along the mandibular border) to enhance the overall contour of the&#xD;
      jawline.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants may be treated with up to 6 treatments with Belkyra, followed by treatment with&#xD;
      Voluma. Participants will have opportunity to participation in a skin biopsy sub-study.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Showed ≥ 1-point Jawline Improvement From Baseline on the Allergan Loss of Jawline Definition Scale (ALJDS), as Assessed by the Investigator</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) to Week 58</time_frame>
    <description>The ALJDS was an investigator assessment of loss of jawline definition measured by a 5-point scale where: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=extreme. Data is reported for both sides of the face, right side of the face and left side of the face.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Last BELKYRA® Treatment on the ALJDS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) to Last Treatment (Up to Week 48)</time_frame>
    <description>The ALJDS was an investigator and independent reviewer assessment of jawline contour measured by a 5-point scale where: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=extreme. A negative change from baseline indicated improvement. The data is reported for both sides of the face, right side of the face and left side of the face.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Final Study Visit in the FACE-Q™ Satisfaction With Lower Face and Jawline Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) to Week 58</time_frame>
    <description>The participant assessed satisfaction using the 5 items on the Satisfaction of Lower Face and Jawline module of the FACE-Q™ questionnaire, measured on a 4-point scale where: 1=very dissatisfied, 2=somewhat dissatisfied, 3=somewhat satisfied, 4=very satisfied. The Rasch transformed scale total score was 0 (worst) to 100 (best). A positive change from baseline indicated improvement.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Final Study Visit in the FACE-Q™ Appraisal of Neck</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) to Week 58</time_frame>
    <description>The participant assessed satisfaction using the 10 items on the Appraisal of Neck module of the FACE-Q™ questionnaire measured on a 4-point scale where: 1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=moderately, 4=extremely. The Rasch transformed scale total score was 0 (worst) to 100 (best). A positive change from baseline indicated improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Final Study Visit for FACE-Q™ Appraisal of Area Under Chin</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) to Week 58</time_frame>
    <description>The participant assessed satisfaction using the 5 items on the Appraisal of Area Under Chin module of the FACE-Q™ questionnaire measured on a 4-point scale where: 1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=moderately, 4=extremely. The Rasch transformed scale total score was 0 (worst) to 100 (best). A negative change from baseline indicated worsening.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Final Study Visit for Clinician-Reported Submental Fat Rating Scale (CR-SMFRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) to Week 58</time_frame>
    <description>The CR-SMFRS score was based on the investigator's clinical evaluation of the participant, where submental fullness was scored on a 5-point scale where: 0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, and 4=extreme. A negative change from baseline indicated improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Final Study Visit for Patient-Reported Submental Fat Rating Scale (PR-SMFRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) to Week 58</time_frame>
    <description>The PR-SMFRS was based on the participant's response to the question &quot;How much fat do you have under your chin right now?&quot; and answered on a 5-point ordinal scale where: 0=no chin fat at all, 1=a slight amount of chin fat, 2=a moderate amount of chin fat, 3=a large amount of chin fat, and 4=a very large amount of chin fat. A negative change from baseline indicated improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Final Study Visit for Submental Skin Laxity Grade (SMSLG) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) to Week 58</time_frame>
    <description>The SMSLG scale integrated 3 skin features: skin wrinkling, adherence to underlying neck structures (bone and muscle), and redundancy (horizontal and vertical folds) assessed by the investigator using a 4-point scale where: 1=none, 2=mild, 3=moderate and 4=severe. A negative change from baseline indicated improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Final Study Visit in Jawline Definition, Based on Independent Reviewer Assessment Using the ALJDS and Photographic Images</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) to Week 58</time_frame>
    <description>The independent reviewer used photographic images collected at the time of the participant's live visit and the ALJDS to assess of loss of jawline definition using a 5-point scale where: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=extreme. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

            <description>BELKYRA® was injected into subcutaneous preplatysma fat tissue in the submental area (at least 1 plus up to 5 optional treatments, for maximum of 6 treatments 8 weeks apart). When the investigator and participant agreed that no further intervention was required to achieve the desired result, participants were eligible to receive VOLUMA™ treatment. VOLUMA™ was injected along the mandibular border, with an optional touch-up visit 2 weeks later if applicable.</description>
