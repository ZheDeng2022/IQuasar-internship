  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MPS IIIA, also known as Sanfilippo A, is an inherited lysosomal storage disease (LSD). MPS&#xD;
      IIIA is caused by a deficiency in sulfamidase, one of the enzymes involved in the lysosomal&#xD;
      degradation of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) heparan sulfate (HS). The natural course of MPS&#xD;
      IIIA is characterized by devastating neurodegeneration with initially mild somatic&#xD;
      involvement. The aims of the present study is to assess the dose related safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of SOBI003, a chemically&#xD;
      modified recombinant human (rh) Sulfamidase developed as an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-controlled, parallel, sequential ascending multiple-dose,&#xD;
      multicenter study to assess the dose related safety, tolerability, PK and PD of SOBI003 in&#xD;
      pediatric MPS IIIA patients. Patients between 1 and 6 years of age who have not received&#xD;
      previous treatment for MPS IIIA with an ERT, gene- or stem cell therapy will be eligible to&#xD;
      participate in the study. The study is planned to consist of 3 dose cohorts, each comprising&#xD;
      3 patients. Treatment initiations will be staggered within each cohort in order to be able to&#xD;
      observe, interpret and treat possible adverse reactions. SOBI003 is administered as weekly&#xD;
      i.v. infusions over a period of 24 weeks. Upon completion of the 24-week treatment period&#xD;
      with satisfactory tolerability, the patient is offered to receive continued SOBI003 treatment&#xD;
      by participation in an extension study.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL™) is a modular approach to measuring health-related quality of life in healthy children and adolescents and those with acute and chronic health conditions. The measure includes a scale, from where the categorical score &quot;4&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, and &quot;0&quot; was reversed and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale to 4=0, 3=25, 2=50, 1=75 and 0=100, where 100 = minimum and 0 = maximum. The Total Score is the sum of all 36 items in the test divided by the number of items answered. Higher scores indicate better functioning.</description>

The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-Third Edition is an individually administered test designed to assess developmental functioning of infants and toddlers. The Bayley-III assesses development in five areas: cognitive, language, motor, social-emotional, and adaptive behavior.&#xD;

The age equivalent scores are assessed by Vineland™ Adaptive Behavior Scales, Expanded Interview Form, Second edition (VABS-II). The Vineland is designed to measure adaptive behavior of individuals from birth to age 90.&#xD;
The Vineland-II contains 5 domains each with 2-3 subdomains. The main domains are: Communication, Daily Living Skills, Socialization, Motor Skills, and Maladaptive Behavior.</description>

        <description>Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL™) is a modular approach to measuring health-related quality of life in healthy children and adolescents and those with acute and chronic health conditions. The measure includes a scale, from where the categorical score &quot;4&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, and &quot;0&quot; was reversed and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale to 4=0, 3=25, 2=50, 1=75 and 0=100, where 100 = minimum and 0 = maximum. The Total Score is the sum of all 36 items in the test divided by the number of items answered. Higher scores indicate better functioning.</description>
