  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because of its prolonged terminal half-life, dalbavancin is an extremely attractive option in&#xD;
      treating Gram-positive infections caused by S. aureus including MRSA, and streptococcal&#xD;
      species. Systemic bacterial infections due to Staphylococci such as osteomyelitis and septic&#xD;
      arthritis, are conditions which require prolonged IV therapy, typically for at least 3-6&#xD;
      weeks, though sometimes more. Due to dalbavancin's prolonged terminal half-life, it may offer&#xD;
      the opportunity to substantially reduce costs and morbidity in native joint and prosthetic&#xD;
      joint infections with one infusion every fourteen days until completion of therapy.&#xD;

      Dalbavancin, currently FDA approved for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections&#xD;
      (SSTI), is a lipoglycopedptide with bactericidal activity in vitro against Staphylococcus&#xD;
      aureus, including MRSA and VISA strains, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Its bactericidal action&#xD;
      results primarily from inhibition of cell-wall biosynthesis, specifically the prevention of&#xD;
      N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG)-peptide subunits incorporation into&#xD;
      the peptidoglycan matrix. Dalbavancin alters bacterial-cell-membrane permeability and RNA&#xD;
      synthesis. It is highly protein bound, primarily to albumin, with a half-life of 346 hours.&#xD;
      Approximately 33% of unchanged drug is excreted in the urine, 20% via feces and 12% as the&#xD;
      minor metabolite, hydroxyl-dalbavancin. There is minimal potential for drug-drug&#xD;
      interactions; it is not a substrate, inducer or inhibitor of hepatic CYP450 isoenzymes and&#xD;
      the administration of CYP450 substrates, inhibitors or inducers does not affect its clearance&#xD;
      rate. In SSTI trials, Dalbavancin was demonstrated to be non-inferior to vancomycin and&#xD;
      linezolid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prosthetic joint infections (PJI) are an emerging health problem. Although the incidence of&#xD;
      these infections is historically low (approximately 0.5%-1.0of implants), because of the&#xD;
      rapid increase in the number of hip, knee and other joint implants, the absolute number of&#xD;
      cases of infection is increasing. In 2010, 332,000 hip joints and 719,000 knee joints were&#xD;
      implanted. This alone conservatively translates to 5,000-10,000 cases, with an economic&#xD;
      impact of $1 billion. Management of PJI is particularly challenging because long term&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy in most cases is accompanied by removal of the prosthesis and&#xD;
      re-implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For long term antimicrobial administration, current standard of care requires a peripherally&#xD;
      inserted central catheter (PICC) or other indwelling intravascular catheter, and&#xD;
      daily/multiple daily infusions. There is substantial cost of maintaining the intravascular&#xD;
      access, drugs, home health care and monitoring, as well as the infection risk of the chronic&#xD;
      indwelling line which is being accessed frequently. There is a clear need for alternative&#xD;
      care models to the current approach. Dalbavancin, because of its activity profile against&#xD;
      Gram-positive organisms and its pharmacokinetics which would allow weekly or every other week&#xD;
      dosing, is a favorable option. This option would eliminate the need for long term IV access,&#xD;
      because at most, weekly IV infusions would be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of bone infection, dalbavancin has favorable pharmacokinetic properties. A PK study&#xD;
      performed in subjects undergoing elective orthopedic surgery found that dalbavancin (dosed at&#xD;
      1000mg IV at enrollment and then 500mg weekly for up to 7 weeks) maintained levels in&#xD;
      cortical bone at bactericidal levels , at &gt;50X the MIC of typical staphylococcal organism&#xD;
      (including MRSA). Animal studies in a rat osteomyelitis model also found that dalvabancin was&#xD;
      comparable to vancomycin. Because of these same PK properties, dalbavancin offers the&#xD;
      opportunity to substantially reduce costs and morbidity in native joint and prosthetic joint&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a two-center, randomized, open label trial of dalbavancin versus standard intravenous&#xD;
      therapy control comparator in the treatment of subjects with gram positive native joint or&#xD;
      prosthetic joint infections. The primary outcome variable is clinical cure at day 42 after&#xD;
      start of treatment in all randomized patients. Safety and tolerability will also be assessed&#xD;
      throughout the study period via laboratory measurements and AE monitoring. Additionally,&#xD;
      clinical response will be measured by patient reported outcomes with change from baseline&#xD;
      symptoms and by Quality of Life questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects with confirmed gram positive joint infections, will be randomized in a&#xD;
      ratio of 2:1 to receive open label dalbavancin or standard IV therapy. Standard IV therapy&#xD;
      will depend on the antibiotic susceptibility of the causative pathogen. Subjects randomized&#xD;
      to dalbavancin may have received standard of care therapy for no more than 120 hours prior to&#xD;
      first dalbavancin dose. Subjects randomized to standard of care can continue with treatment&#xD;
      course if already started, or receive the first dose at the baseline visit.&#xD;
