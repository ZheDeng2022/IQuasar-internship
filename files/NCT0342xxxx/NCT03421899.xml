  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that is increasingly common&#xD;
      with age, with the incidence rising from approximately 4 people per 10,000 in their forties&#xD;
      to 2 in 100 over the age of eighty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our understanding of the causes of PD has rapidly developed in the past two decades, but this&#xD;
      has not yet translated into any clinically established neuroprotective treatment that slows&#xD;
      disease progression. There is a growing consensus that the failure of previous efforts is&#xD;
      mainly due to the causative diversity of PD i.e. that PD may have many different causes. For&#xD;
      example, it is known that variants in mitochondrial (cellular power house) genes can cause&#xD;
      specific forms of PD and this may be relevant to other forms of PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to attempt to group PD patients based on markers of biochemical&#xD;
      dysfunction (e.g. into groups of patients that do and those who do not have evidence of&#xD;
      mitochondrial dysfunction) to aid in the development of new candidate neuro-protective&#xD;
      compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope by grouping people with Parkinson's into those with and without&#xD;
      impaired mitochondrial function the investigators will be better able to develop more&#xD;
      targeted treatments aimed at protecting further loss of brain cells that occurs in&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this the investigators will study people, in two study sites in London, with both&#xD;
      genetic forms of PD and those with idiopathic PD (i.e. those where there is not a known&#xD;
      genetic variant causing PD), as well as a healthy control group. All groups will undergo&#xD;
      standardised clinical assessment to collect information on several aspects of their condition&#xD;
      (e.g. disease severity, memory problems and sleep problems).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to provide blood, urine and optionally cerebrospinal fluid &amp; skin&#xD;
      samples from which various biochemical assays and genetic analysis will be performed in&#xD;
      attempt to group participants based on the results of these tests. The study is funded for 3&#xD;
      years with participants being asked to attend for up to 3 study visits each over this time&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that is increasingly&#xD;
      prevalent with age, with the incidence rising from approximately 4 people per 10,000 in their&#xD;
      forties to 2 in 100 over the age of eighty. Besides motor symptoms, such as tremor, rigidity,&#xD;
      bradykinesia, and postural instability, PD patients often experience a variety of non-motor&#xD;
      symptoms, such as fatigue, depression, sleep disturbance, and dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although symptomatic treatments exist to partially compensate for motor dysfunction, no&#xD;
      neuroprotective treatment has yet been established to slow PD progression, which inevitably&#xD;
      renders patients incapable of living independently. Compared to age- and sex-matched&#xD;
      controls, PD patients are about 5 times more likely to require nursing home care and this&#xD;
      care costs about 5 times more than average nursing home care. This, combined with the&#xD;
      European demographic shift toward an increasingly larger fraction of aged individuals,&#xD;
      creates a social and economic challenge to develop new medications to slow the progression of&#xD;
      PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our understanding of the aetiopathogenesis of PD has rapidly developed in the past two&#xD;
      decades, but this has not yet translated into any clinically established neuroprotective&#xD;
      treatment that slows disease progression. There is a growing consensus that the failure of&#xD;
      previous efforts is mainly due to the aetiopathogenic diversity of PD and the estrangement of&#xD;
      existing preclinical models from clinical PD. For example, it is known that mutations in&#xD;
      mitochondrial genes can cause monogenic PD and biochemical evidence indicates that in a&#xD;
      proportion of cases, idiopathic PD is associated with detectable mitochondrial dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators focus is on monogenic forms of PD that involve mitochondrial&#xD;
      abnormalities as a primary (e.g., Parkin, PINK1), or secondary (e.g., LRRK2, GBA1)&#xD;
      phenomenon, in order to extrapolate to idiopathic PD (IPD) patients with and without&#xD;
      mitochondrial dysfunction (Mito-IPD and Amito-IPD, respectively). Biochemical pathways&#xD;
      focusing on, but not restricted to mitochondrial function, will be assessed using a variety&#xD;
      of techniques including biochemical assays on blood, urine, CSF and tissue samples. The&#xD;
      investigators will explore both the relevance and measurement of specific biochemical&#xD;
      pathways in Parkinson's and related disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main overall objective is to stratify PD patients based on dysfunction in biochemical&#xD;
      pathways related to PD. This will aid in developing new candidate neuroprotection compounds&#xD;
      to slow the progression of neurodegeneration.&#xD;
