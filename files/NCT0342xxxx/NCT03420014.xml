  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is an open-label, randomized, controlled, two-arm multi-center study of the&#xD;
      efficacy of L19TNF treatment in combination with doxorubicin versus doxorubicin alone in&#xD;
      metastatic or unresectable soft-tissue sarcoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study, 114 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive doxorubicin treatment&#xD;
      (Arm 1) or L19TNF treatment in combination with doxorubicin (Arm 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate if L19TNF in combination with doxorubicin&#xD;
      (Arm 2) given for unresectable or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma improves efficacy measured&#xD;
      as progression free survival, as compared to doxorubicin alone (Arm 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-cancer activity will be assessed every 6 weeks during therapy and every 12 weeks&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
