  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the present study is to compare the esthetic result and stability of gingival&#xD;
      tissue over the immediate implant only and immediate implant with connective tissue in&#xD;
      patients with single non-restorable tooth in the esthetic zone. The main null hypothesis to&#xD;
      be tested is that the addition of SCTG to immediately placed implants will not significantly&#xD;
      differ from immediately placed implant alone as regard gingival tissue stability.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Implant became a treatment modality for replacing missing or non-restorable teeth, providing&#xD;
      clinical success rate and esthetic outcome. (1) In esthetic zone the main goal is not only&#xD;
      the preservation of function but also the preservation of the esthetics. The esthetic outcome&#xD;
      of implant supported restoration depend on the soft tissue volume and the soft tissue&#xD;
      contour. (2) The placement of immediate implant after tooth extraction was proved as a very&#xD;
      high success rate treatment modality. It provided several advantages such as reduction of the&#xD;
      time between tooth extraction and the placement of prosthesis, reduction of the number of&#xD;
      surgical treatments (3) and increase osteointegration between bone and implant surface (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the survival rate of immediate implantation versus delayed implantation there is&#xD;
      no significant difference with an overall success rate of 99.6%, it is just considered as a&#xD;
      successful treatment modality, based on 802 implants (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand disadvantage related to esthetic outcome has been reported, showing facial&#xD;
      gingival recession following the first year of function due to labial bone plate resorption.&#xD;
      (6, 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A systematic review by Sanz et al.,(2012) compared the reduction of bone height and bone&#xD;
      width between two groups the control group was delayed implant placement and the studied&#xD;
      group was immediate implant placement and the mean difference between groups was of 13.11%&#xD;
      (95% CI: from 3.83 to 22.4; P = 0.057) and 19.85% (95% CI: from 13.85 to 25.81)respectively,&#xD;
      concluding that the early placement of dental implants after tooth extraction offers&#xD;
      advantages in terms of soft and hard tissue preservation, compared with delayed implant&#xD;
      placement , which affect the aesthetic (7 ) As a sequence of dimensional ridge alterations&#xD;
      that occur following tooth extraction many studies reported a recession of marginal&#xD;
      peri-implant mucosa, which affect the aesthetic outcome (8, 9, and 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study made by Migliorati et al., (2015) between two groups, the control group (immediate&#xD;
      loading implant treated without raising a flap) and the test group (immediate loaded implant&#xD;
      treated with sub-epithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) using the tunnel technique in the&#xD;
      labial area) Both groups (47 implants) received deproteinized bovine bone minerals and&#xD;
      implants were successfully integrated with a follow up period 2-year examination . Moreover&#xD;
      the mean recession in the control group was 0.71mm (17.58%), one third of the control group&#xD;
      reported recession &gt;1mm, and mean pink aesthetic score (PES) was 6.65, resulting in bad&#xD;
      aesthetic. The test group showed an increase of the keratinized mucosa (KM) with a mean of&#xD;
      34.29% (0.5mm) and a mean recession of 0.2mm (10.01%), only one case (4%) showed recession&#xD;
      &gt;1mm and the mean PES was 8. The thickening of soft tissue by the addition of SCTG, lead to&#xD;
      compensation and maintenance of the loss of bone volume in the labial area (11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The addition of sub epithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) to the immediate implant was&#xD;
      suggested for facial gingival biotype conversation. It was proved to be successful in&#xD;
      preserving soft tissue levels. (12)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A systematic review was made to investigate if the addition of SCTG overcome the disadvantage&#xD;
      of placement of immediate implant only or not, but unfortunately the included studies had&#xD;
      different techniques and the number of the patients in those studies was few thus further RCT&#xD;
      was necessary (13).&#xD;
