      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the infectivity, safety, and immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      recombinant live-attenuated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines RSV ΔNS2/Δ1313/I1314L&#xD;
      or RSV 276 or placebo when delivered as nose drops to RSV-seronegative infants and children 6&#xD;
      to 24 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a companion study to IMPAACT 2018.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral cause of serious acute lower&#xD;
      respiratory illness (LRI) in infants and children under 5 years of age worldwide. This study&#xD;
      will evaluate the infectivity, safety, and immunogenicity of two recombinant live-attenuated&#xD;
      RSV vaccines: RSV ΔNS2/Δ1313/I1314L and RSV 276. The vaccines will be delivered as nose drops&#xD;
      to RSV-seronegative infants and children 6 to 24 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive a single dose of the RSV ΔNS2/Δ1313/I1314L&#xD;
      vaccine, the RSV 276 vaccine, or placebo at study entry (Day 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled in the study outside of RSV season, i.e., between April 1 and&#xD;
      October 31. All participants will remain on study until they complete the post-RSV season&#xD;
      visit between April 1 and April 30 in the calendar year following enrollment. Participants'&#xD;
      total study duration is between 6 and 13 months, depending on when they enroll in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend several study visits throughout the study, which may include&#xD;
      physical examinations, blood collection, nasal washes, and nasal adsorption (nasosorption)&#xD;
      specimen collection. Participants' parents or guardians will be contacted by study staff at&#xD;
      various times during the study to monitor participants' health.&#xD;
