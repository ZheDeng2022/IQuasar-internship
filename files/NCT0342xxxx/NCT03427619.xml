  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standard of care for Lymphatic Malformations has been surgical excision. We have been using&#xD;
      OK432/Picibanil (generously supplied by Chugai Pharmaceuticals in Japan) since 1992 with&#xD;
      great success for macrocystic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study was to provide OK-432 immunotherapy to subjects with macrocystic&#xD;
      or mixed (&gt; 50% macrocystic) lymphatic malformations (LMs) and investigate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of OK 432 as a treatment option in subjects with LMs.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lymphatic malformations are uncommon tumors that represent localized malformations in the&#xD;
      development of the lymphatic system. They typically present in children under 2 years of age&#xD;
      and in almost 50% of the cases, are diagnosed at birth. There is neither a racial nor a&#xD;
      sexual tendency. The malformations can occur anywhere on the body, but typically they are in&#xD;
      the head/neck area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morbidity can be significant. Besides the obvious cosmetic deformity caused by these tumors,&#xD;
      there is risk of infection and airway compromise and even obstruction. However, effective&#xD;
      therapeutic options are limited. Small lesions can be observed, although spontaneous&#xD;
      resolution is unlikely. For larger lesions, surgery has been the traditional form of therapy.&#xD;
      In the head and neck, in particular, lymphangiomas typically wrap themselves around major&#xD;
      neurovascular structures, making total excision removal difficult, if not impossible, and&#xD;
      thus the likelihood of recurrence is quite high. Because of these surgical limitations,&#xD;
      alternate therapies have been considered; including cryotherapy, diathermy, and chemical&#xD;
      sclerotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators experience with using the drug for macrocystic disease(large cysts) since&#xD;
      1992 in the United States has been very promising compared to traditional surgery. Recurrence&#xD;
      rate to date, has been very minimal as well. (&lt;2%)&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the conclusion of the Phase 2 randomized study, all new subjects who presented with an&#xD;
      LM and were eligible for treatment were treated under an open-label protocol for continued&#xD;
      access to OK-432. This multicenter, open label study enrolled subjects between September 2005&#xD;
      and November 2017.&#xD;

OK-432 was administered intracystically at a concentration of 0.01 to 0.05 mg/mL. A 4-dose injection series of OK-432 was planned for all subjects. All injections were spaced approximately 6 to 12 weeks apart</description>

Therefore there are differences in the number of subjects for different analyses.</time_frame>
      <desc>In this study, &quot;serious adverse event&quot; (SAE) was defined as any deviation from expected response to OK-432 immunotherapy. Treatment emergent SAE (TESAE) was defined as any SAE occurring or worsening on or after the first dose of study drug and within 35 days after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
Other AEs were collected via Subject Diaries were presented as observed for subjects who provided diary data. Therefore the number of participants at risk for individual events is less than the overall.</desc>
