      This research study is studying a drug called Ruxolitinib as a possible treatment for&#xD;
      Myelofibrosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved Ruxolitinib as a treatment&#xD;
      option for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study examines two different cohorts of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: Participants who are eligible for Ruxolitinib therapy before transplant, based&#xD;
           on their platelet counts. These participants will receive their first dose of the study&#xD;
           drug between 2 and 6 months before HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: Participants who are not eligible for Ruxolitinib therapy pre-treatment based&#xD;
           on their platelet counts. These participants will receive their first dose of&#xD;
           Ruxolitinib 1 week before the conditioning period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ruxolitinib is a medication that blocks certain proteins called tyrosine kinases.&#xD;
      Specifically, it blocks tyrosine kinases called JAK2. Many cancers have over active &quot;cell&#xD;
      signaling.&quot; What this means is that certain functions in the cancer cells never turn off and&#xD;
      this makes them grow in an uncontrolled way. Ruxolitinib, shuts down the pathway that depends&#xD;
      on the JAK2 tyrosine kinases. The JAK2 pathway is over active in the participant's disease,&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia. The exact way ruxolitinib does this is not yet clear but it may have&#xD;
      to do with its ability to block the JAK2 pathway since this pathway can also lead to&#xD;
      inflammation in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ruxolitinib has also been shown to lower the rates of Graft-Versus-Host-Disease (GVHD), a&#xD;
      complication of transplant. GVHD is a disease that occurs when the immune cells in&#xD;
      transplanted donor tissue from your HCT attack the participant's own tissues and organs.&#xD;
      There are two types of GVHD: acute and chronic. Acute GVHD generally occurs within 1 week to&#xD;
      3 months after your HCT and may affect your skin, intestines, and liver. Chronic GVHD begins&#xD;
      later on and may affect the organs prone to acute GVHD complications, as well as the lungs,&#xD;
      mucous membranes, or other organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is also evidence that ruxolitinib is associated with reduced instances of enlarged&#xD;
      spleen size after HCT. Enlarged spleens play a role in the engraftment rate after HCT, which&#xD;
      is the rate at which donated tissue and your own tissue begin reproducing and growing&#xD;
      together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assessing the efficacy (how well the study drug works) and tolerability of Ruxolitinib&#xD;
           before, during, and after HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  examining the rates of GVHD after HCT when ruxolitinib is administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determining whether engraftment rates improve when ruxolitinib is given&#xD;
