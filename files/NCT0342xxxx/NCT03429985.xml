  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While existing teen pregnancy prevention efforts have contributed to significant declines in&#xD;
      the overall U.S. teen pregnancy rate, teen pregnancy prevention programs specifically&#xD;
      targeting adolescent males are limited and sorely needed. The primary aim of the proposed&#xD;
      research is to further develop, evaluate, and disseminate a teen pregnancy prevention program&#xD;
      specifically designed for adolescent males to enhance the current scientific evidence and&#xD;
      intervention options available for broad public health implementation. The proposed&#xD;
      intervention Fathers Raising Responsible Men (FRRM) focuses on the adolescent male component&#xD;
      of teen pregnancy by identifying and addressing adolescent risk and paternal protective&#xD;
      behaviors specific to adolescent males that have not been fully addressed in previous&#xD;
      prevention efforts. This study strives to reduce adolescent male sexual risk behavior through&#xD;
      targeting African American and Latino adolescent males aged 15-19 and their fathers residing&#xD;
      in the South Bronx, specifically Mott Haven and surrounding areas in three phases. Phase I is&#xD;
      a pilot study consisting of eight dyads (fathers and sons) to test and refine the&#xD;
      intervention and technical and training assistance needs. Phase II is the Randomized Control&#xD;
      Trial (RCT) comprised of two cohorts (a total of 500 father-son dyads) to rigorously evaluate&#xD;
      the intervention. During the final 6 months of the project, qualitative interviews with 30&#xD;
      father-son dyads will be conducted to triangulate the quantitative RCT results with&#xD;
      participant experiences of FRRM. Finally, in Phase III the intervention will be refined and&#xD;
      the intervention materials will be available to the general public, while findings will be&#xD;
      widely disseminated. These three phases allow for the successful implementation and&#xD;
      evaluation of FRRM in conjunction with the refinement and provision of all training and&#xD;
      technical assistance necessary for the intervention. If successful, the proposed project will&#xD;
      further develop the current scientific evidence and intervention options targeted&#xD;
      specifically to the teen pregnancy prevention needs of African American and Latino adolescent&#xD;
      males.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      FRRM is a male-focused intervention designed to reduce adolescent male sexual risk behavior&#xD;
      through supporting father-son communication about sex and condoms, as well as improve future&#xD;
      life trajectories. The goals of the program are to reduce the number of unprotected sex acts&#xD;
      among adolescents through (1) improved knowledge about correct and consistent condom use, (2)&#xD;
      increased sexual transmitted infection (STI) testing, and (3) increased utilization of sexual&#xD;
      and reproductive health services. Additionally, the program aims to improve adolescent life&#xD;
      opportunities through (1) improved perception of life trajectories; and (2) increased&#xD;
      utilization of academic and job training services within the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RCT consists of two cohorts. The first cohort (n=200 father-son dyads) will receive (1)&#xD;
      two 60 to 90 minute intervention sessions delivered to the father by project staff.&#xD;
      Intervention sessions should happen within the first month following the baseline interview.&#xD;
      The first intervention session focuses on motivating fathers to communicate with their sons&#xD;
      about sex and condom use, and the second session provides fathers with the skills and&#xD;
      knowledge necessary to teach their sons about correct condom use. In addition, fathers&#xD;
      receive guidance on effective adolescent monitoring and supervision and strengthening their&#xD;
      relationship quality with their adolescent son.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second cohort (n=300 father-son dyads) will receive (1) two 60 to 90 minute intervention&#xD;
      sessions delivered to the father by project staff with content identical to the interventions&#xD;
      given to cohort one; and 2) one 60 to 90 minute intervention session delivered to the&#xD;
      father-son dyad by project staff regarding adolescent life opportunities. In the third&#xD;
      intervention session, the father coach provides father-son dyads with specific guidance and&#xD;
      helpful resources for on-going and positive interactions between fathers and sons.&#xD;
      Additionally, this session highlights specific academic and job training resources within the&#xD;
      community that fathers and sons can access to better address adolescent sexual and&#xD;
      reproductive health, overall wellbeing, and future goals/aspirations.&#xD;
