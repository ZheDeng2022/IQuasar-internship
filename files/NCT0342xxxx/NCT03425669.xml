      Noise benefit in ADHD Auditory noise benefit: The original findings from our research group,&#xD;
      that auditory noise enhances cognitive performance in inattentive children without diagnosis&#xD;
      as well as children with an ADHD diagnosis, have been replicated several times (Baijot et&#xD;
      al., 2016; Söderlund et al., 2016; Söderlund &amp; Nilsson Jobs, 2016; Söderlund et al., 2007).&#xD;
      In a new study, the benefit of noise was shown to be in parity with or even larger than the&#xD;
      benefit of pharmacological ADHD treatment on two cognitive tasks, episodic word recall and&#xD;
      visuo-spatial working memory task. In the study a group of children diagnosed with ADHD were&#xD;
      tested on and off medication, at separate occasions, in noisy vs. silent environments while&#xD;
      performing the tasks (Söderlund, Björk et al., 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and recruitment: Participants with an ADHD diagnosis using medication will be&#xD;
      recruited from Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in Lund and Malmö. Typically developing&#xD;
      children (TDC) and inattentive children without diagnosis will be recruited from schools in&#xD;
      collaboration with the municipality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design: All participants will perform a double-blind placebo cross over control&#xD;
      study. ADHD participants will perform the entire test battery at three occasions with 2-3&#xD;
      weeks intermission in between tests. One occasion with placebo medication and sham SVS&#xD;
      stimulation; one occasion with active SVS stimulation; and one occasion with active&#xD;
      medication. TD children will only be tested twice while they will not be given any medication&#xD;
      or placebo and just perform under SVS vs. sham conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test battery: 1) Episodic memory will be tested trough Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT)&#xD;
      (e.g. Dige et al., 2008). 2) Visuo-spatial working memory will be tested through the&#xD;
      Spanboard task (Westerberg et al., 2004). 3) Motor-neurological investigation. 4) A finger&#xD;
      tapping task. 5) Evaluation of an iPhone auditory noise application in a normal school&#xD;
      setting. Our research group has developed an iPhone application (www.smartnoise.se) that is&#xD;
      available at App-store right now. The study will last for about 5 months and participants&#xD;
      will be 50 voluntary secondary school pupils that have documented attention difficulties as&#xD;
      judged by their teachers. The application will be evaluated both by pupils, teachers and&#xD;
      parents.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most frequent childhood&#xD;
      disorders with an estimated prevalence of about 5-7% (e.g. Ullebo et al., 2012). Today the&#xD;
      most common treatment approach is stimulant medication, e.g. methylphenidate (Greenhill et&#xD;
      al., 2002; Wigal et al., 2011). However there are many concerns about medication: i) best&#xD;
      dose for cognitive functioning and adapted school behavior differs (Hale et al., 2011), ii)&#xD;
      it is not even evident that medication improves learning processes (Molina et al., 2009),&#xD;
      iii) concerns regarding potential for drug abuse (Gordon et al., 2004); and iv) uncertainties&#xD;
      regarding long term effects of drug use on the developing brain (Andersen, 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both national and international guidelines of ADHD care multimodal treatment is&#xD;
      recommended (Young &amp; Amarasinghe, 2010), but most patients only receive pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment, sometimes in combination with parent training. If auditory or vestibular noise, as&#xD;
      the present project suggests, could be a complement or an alternative to stimulant medication&#xD;
      it could fundamentally change the treatment of ADHD and the school situation for those&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noise benefit in ADHD Auditory noise benefit: The original findings from our research group,&#xD;
      that auditory noise enhances cognitive performance in inattentive children without diagnosis&#xD;
      as well as children with an ADHD diagnosis, have been replicated several times (Baijot et&#xD;
      al., 2016; Söderlund et al., 2016; Söderlund &amp; Nilsson Jobs, 2016; Söderlund et al., 2007).&#xD;
      In a new study, the benefit of noise was shown to be in parity with or even larger than the&#xD;
      benefit of pharmacological ADHD treatment on two cognitive tasks, episodic word recall and&#xD;
      visuo-spatial working memory task. In the study a group of children diagnosed with ADHD were&#xD;
      tested on and off medication, at separate occasions, in noisy vs. silent environments while&#xD;
      performing the tasks (Söderlund, Björk et al., 2016). Inattentive and low achieving school&#xD;
      children have been shown to improve their memory recall when exposed to noise, whereas&#xD;
      attentive and high achieving children perform worse during noise exposure (Helps et al.,&#xD;
      2014; Söderlund &amp; Sikström, 2008, 2012; Söderlund et al., 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vestibular noise benefit: Vestibular stimulation has since long been demonstrated to increase&#xD;
      hippocampal activity and hippocampus is well demonstrated to be of crucial importance in&#xD;
      detecting and holding on to spatial targets showing that hippocampus is of fundamental for&#xD;
      both spatial orientation and learning in general (Moser et al., 2015). Therefore it is not&#xD;
      surprising that external stochastic vestibular stimulation (SVS) exerts beneficial effects in&#xD;
      different domains, e.g. balance in healthy astronauts (Mulavara et al., 2011), in Parkinson&#xD;
      patients (Pal et al., 2009; Samoudi et al., 2014) and response times in continuous&#xD;
      performance task (Yamamoto et al., 2005). The theory about noise benefit is thoroughly&#xD;
      described by Sikström and Söderlund (2007). 1. The first objective is to systematically&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of stochastic vestibular noise on cognitive task performance and to&#xD;
      compare these results with the ones of stimulant medication using a double blind RCT (Random&#xD;
      Control Trial) design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second objective is to implement a practical application, to evaluate if auditory noise&#xD;
      can be beneficial in an every day school setting by the use of an iPhone application (see:&#xD;
      www.smartnoise.se).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and recruitment: Participants with an ADHD diagnosis using medication will be&#xD;
      recruited from Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in Lund and Malmö. Typically developing&#xD;
      children (TDC) and inattentive children without diagnosis will be recruited from schools in&#xD;
