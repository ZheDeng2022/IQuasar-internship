    <textblock>
      This is A Phase III, randomized, two-armed, patient-outcome assessor-data analyzer blinded,&#xD;
      parallel active controlled non-Inferiority clinical trial study to evaluate efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of AryoTrust (Aryogen Trastuzumab in comparison to Herceptin® (Genentech/Roche) in&#xD;
      patients with Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive breast cancer. The main&#xD;
      objective is to verify the non-inferiority of AryoTrust (Aryogen trastuzumab) vs. Herceptin®&#xD;
      (Genentech/Roche trastuzumab), both given concomitantly with docetaxel after doxorubicin plus&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide in the neoadjuvant setting according to pathological complete response (pCR)&#xD;
      as primary objective and objective response (cOR), clinical complete response (cCR), clinical&#xD;
      partial response (cPR), clinical stable disease (cSD), clinical progressive disease (cPD),&#xD;
      breast conservation rate as Secondary objectives of this study. Evaluating the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of AryoTrust vs. Herceptin®, are also the other secondary outcomes. This study&#xD;

      safety of AryoTrust (Aryogen Trastuzumab) in comparison to Herceptin® (Genentech/Roche) in&#xD;
      patients with Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive breast cancer. Patients who&#xD;
      met the following criteria will be recruited. The inclusion criteria are: 18-70 years old&#xD;
      female patients, Patients with newly diagnosed stage III (locally advanced) or in-operable&#xD;
      stage II (due to sizes larger than 5 cm or high tumor to breast ratio) tumors are candidates&#xD;
      for participation, Willing and able to sign an informed consent, Pathological diagnosis of&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma of the breast, ECOG status of 0-1, With any ER/PR status, HER2 positive&#xD;
      (Immunohistochemical (IHC) 3+ intensity, amplification of the HER2 gene on fluorescence in&#xD;
      situ hybridization (FISH+ ) or HER2 positive results of Chromogenic in situ hybridization&#xD;
      (CISH)). Exclusion criteria are: Clinical or radiologic evidence of metastatic disease,&#xD;
      History of any other malignancy including previous breast cancer, second non-breast malignant&#xD;

&#xD;
      The main objective is to verify the non-inferiority of AryoTrust (Aryogen Trastuzumab) vs.&#xD;
      Herceptin® (Genentech/Roche Trastuzumab), both given concomitantly with docetaxel after&#xD;
      doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide in the neoadjuvant setting according to pathological,&#xD;
      clinical response and immunogenicity assay in patients with Human Epidermal Growth Factor&#xD;
      Receptor 2-Positive breast cancer. The primary objective of this study is to verify the&#xD;
      non-inferiority of AryoTrust vs. Herceptin®, given concomitantly with docetaxel after&#xD;
      doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide in the neoadjuvant setting according to pathological&#xD;
      complete response (pCR) rate. The secondary objectives are to evaluate non-significance&#xD;
      between AryoTrust and Herceptin®, given concomitantly with docetaxel after Adriamycin plus&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide in the neoadjuvant setting according to clinical objective response (cOR),&#xD;
      clinical complete response (cCR), clinical partial response (cPR), clinical stable disease&#xD;
      (cSD), clinical progressive disease (cPD), breast conservation rateEvaluating the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of AryoTrust vs. Herceptin®, are also the other secondary outcomes. This study&#xD;
      has two arms and 108 subjects will participate with a 1:1 allocation and receive AryoTrust&#xD;
      vs. Herceptin® randomly given concomitantly with docetaxel (for four 21-day cycles) after&#xD;
      four 14-day cycles of Doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide For primary outcome analysis,&#xD;
      Treatment differences in proportions will be calculated. A 95% two-sided confidence interval&#xD;
      will be constructed and the upper bound to determine non-inferiority with a 2.5% significance&#xD;
      level will be used.Frequency and proportions will be calculated for all secondary efficacy&#xD;
      endpoints include clinical complete response (cCR), clinical partial response (cPR), clinical&#xD;
      stable disease (cSD), clinical progressive disease (cPD), clinical objective response (cOR),&#xD;
      breast conservation rate. All safety data will be analyzed descriptively by each treatment&#xD;
      group. same protocol and procedures have been implemented by using same SOPs. Regular and&#xD;
      strict monitoring visits have been provided to ensure all processes will be carried out in&#xD;
      accordance with GCP. Probable variation of eligibility criteria and evaluation criteria are&#xD;
      resolved through investigator meetings.&#xD;
