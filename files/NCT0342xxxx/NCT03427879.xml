  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to test the hypothesis that chronic supplementation with&#xD;
      a dairy-based beverage containing a mixture of blueberry, green tea, and cocoa flavonoids&#xD;
      (non-nutritive natural plant compounds) will ameliorate exercise-related changes in gut&#xD;
      permeability and inflammation. In a previous feeding study in humans, (NCT02728570) a high&#xD;
      flavonoid diet (flavonoids at 340 mg/1000kcal) was effective in mitigating gut permeability&#xD;
      and inflammation in overweight and obese adults compared to a low flavonoid diet (10mg/1000&#xD;
      kcal). To test this hypothesis, 20 trained cyclists will complete a randomized crossover&#xD;
      study with supplementation for 2 weeks with a dairy-based sports beverage containing either a&#xD;
      high flavonoid (approximately 620 mg) or low flavonoid (approximately 5mg) beverage. After&#xD;
      the two week intervention, cyclists will complete a 1 hour cycling trial (45 min at 65% VO2&#xD;
      max then 15 minute time trial). The primary endpoints will be gut permeability as measured by&#xD;
      plasma intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) and the differential sugar test.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will include gut inflammation (measured via fecal calprotectin), plasma&#xD;
      cytokines (IL-6, IL-10 and TNFÎ±) and plasma LPS. In addition, the distance completed in the&#xD;
      time trial is a secondary endpoint.&#xD;
