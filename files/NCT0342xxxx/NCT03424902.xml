  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of aortic regurgitation (AR) jet from the aorta into the left ventricle is the&#xD;
      most common complication after TAVI, occurring in about 70% of patients but usually trivial&#xD;
      or mild (4, 5). In most previous studies, mild AR was not associated with a significantly&#xD;
      shorter survival time (4, 5); however, the PARTNER trial demonstrated that it may be&#xD;
      associated with worse long-term prognosis (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significant AR (moderate and severe) is less common, occurring in approximately 15-20% of&#xD;
      cases(6), and is considered one of the most important prognostic factors of mortality during&#xD;
      short- and long-term follow-up (7, 8). It is, therefore, essential to understand the&#xD;
      mechanisms and risk factors associated with the occurrence of AR in order to minimize its&#xD;
      incidence .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significant PVL most commonly results from(9):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Incomplete prosthesis apposition to the native annulus due to calcification or annular&#xD;
           eccentricity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. undersizing of the device and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. malpositioning of the valve . These observations seem to be true for both&#xD;
           balloon-expandable and self-expandable THVs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However there are some new predictors which may correlate to occurance of paravalvular&#xD;
      leakage including :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Eccentricity of aortic valve calcification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Characterization of aortic annular calcification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Associated mitral annular calcification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Angle of LVOT to ascending aorta measurement (LVOT-AO).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The depth of implantation of valve in relation to aortic cusps.&#xD;

      All patient will undergo :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Detailed history including symptoms (NYHA class) ,co morbidities(diabetes ,hypertension&#xD;
           ,ischemic heart disease,previous PCI ,renal impairment,peripheral arterial disease ,&#xD;
           chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,cerebrovascular disease ,atrial fibrillation ,..)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Electrocardiogram(detection of conduction disturbance , ischemic changes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Laboratory investigation (hemoglobin level ,creatinine,glomerular filteration rate(GFR))&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Echocardiography(11) :&#xD;
&#xD;
      1-Assesment of aortic valve by&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mean and maximum pressure gradiant .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aortic valve area by continuity equation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Measurement of aortic valve annulus(by both transthoracic echocardiography in&#xD;
           parasternal long axis view and transesophgeal echocardiography in long axis view ) .&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assesment of associated aortic regurge (regurge jet,regurge fraction and volume) 2-&#xD;
           Assesment of EF(by M-mode and simpsons method). 3-Assesment of other valves . 7-Computed&#xD;
           tomography (cardiac CT )&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Annular dimensions. Two diameters, the anteroposterior (AP) short axis and the&#xD;
           mediolateral (ML) long axis will be measured, and the mean ([ML plus AP] divided by 2)&#xD;
           will be calculated(12).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Cover Index is defined as 100x(nominal prosthesis diameter - CT mean annulus&#xD;
           Diameter)/nominal prosthesis diameter (13,14), and the&#xD;
&#xD;
           Eccentricity Index was calculated as 100 x(1 -(aortic annulus minimum diameter /maximum&#xD;
           diameter) (15).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Annular calcium . The cross-sectional axial annulus plane is used for the following&#xD;
           analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1-Amount of calcium is measured using Agatston calcium score(AgS)(16).&#xD;
           2-Characterization of annular calcification : Annular calcification is measured in two&#xD;
           planes, depth (D) and width (W), and evaluated for shape (1 for protruding [D&gt;W], 2 for&#xD;
           round [D=W], and 3 for adherent [W&gt;D]) for each side (noncoronary, right coronary, and&#xD;
           left coronary annulus side)(12).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Eccentricity of aortic valve calcification(EoC):&#xD;
&#xD;
           The EoC is defined as the maximum absolute difference in calcium volume scores between 2&#xD;
           adjacent sectors (bi-partition method) or between sectors based on leaflets&#xD;
           (leaflet-based method) (16).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Angle of LVOT to ascending aorta measurement (LVOT-AO). We consider the angle between&#xD;
           the axis of the first 4 cm of the ascending aorta representing the contact surface with&#xD;
           the upper part of the bioprosthesis and the LVOT axis representing the landing zone of&#xD;
           the prosthesis. . This angle is determined on CT or using left ventriculography in RAO&#xD;
           30Â° during preparation of the patients for the procedure (17).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Mitral annular calcification:&#xD;
&#xD;
           is qualitatively determined by circumferential involvement of mitral ring, mild =less&#xD;
           than 1/3 of mitral annulus , moderate =between 1/3and 1/2 of mitral annulus , severe&#xD;
           =calcification more than half mitral annulus circumference (20).&#xD;
&#xD;
           TAVI procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The detailed steps of procedure are reported by Nijhoff F,etal (19) .TAVI is performed&#xD;
           through transfemoral or transapical approach, based on the feasibility of the&#xD;
           iliofemoral anatomy and suitable access sites. All procedures are performed in a fully&#xD;
           equipped hybrid cardiac catheterization laboratory. Surgical cutdown or suture-mediated&#xD;
           closure device are used to close the vascular access site at the femoral arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Transesophageal echocardiography is used to support TAVI procedures, and fluoroscopy is&#xD;
           used to guide the deployment of the valves and prosthesis positioning. Both&#xD;
           predilatation of the native valve and prosthetic valve implantation are performed during&#xD;
           rapid right ventricular pacing (160 to 200 beats/min) (19). Prosthesis position,&#xD;
           function, and coronary ostia patency are assessed with transesophageal echocardiography&#xD;
           and fluoroscopy .&#xD;
&#xD;
           Procedural factors which relate to paravalvular leakage include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Valve type (balloon expandable or self expandable).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Valve size in relation to aortic annulus size (cover index).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The depth of implantation of valve in relation to aortic cusps.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Depth of final device position in the LVOT will be measured using a final aortogram of&#xD;
           the deployed bioprosthesis in RAO projection, displaying the aortic valve in optimal&#xD;
           alignment with all 3 leaflets visible in the same plane. The depth of delivery is&#xD;
           defined as the distance from the native aortic annular margin on the side of the non&#xD;
           coronary cusp (NCC) to the most proximal edge on the corresponding side (deepest in the&#xD;
           left ventricle) of the deployed stent-frame .In addition, the depth of delivery from the&#xD;
           annular margin of the left coronary cusp to the corresponding side will be measured(20).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assesment of paravalvular leakage :&#xD;
&#xD;
           1-Angiographic evaluation of paravalvular leakage Ten minutes after the deployment of&#xD;
           the prosthetic valve, angiography of the aortic root is performed to assess the severity&#xD;
           of aortic regurgitation according to Sellers criteria (21).&#xD;
&#xD;
           (0) no regurgitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (1) only trace of contrast could be seen in the left ventricle, and it is cleared in&#xD;
           each systole.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (2) contrast filling the entire LV in diastole with less density compared with&#xD;
           opacification of the ascending aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (3) contrast filling the entire LV in diastole equal in density to the contrast&#xD;
           opacification of the ascending aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (4) contrast filling of the entire LV in diastole on the first beat with greater density&#xD;
           compared with the contrast opacification of the ascending aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Two observers independently score the images. In case of discrepancy the images will be&#xD;
           re-evaluated and consensus will be reached by a third observer.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2-Intraprocedural Transesophageal echocardiography : Both 2D and 3D TEE will be used to&#xD;
           assess origin and severity of paravalvular leakage during procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3-Transthoracic Echocardiographic study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients will be evaluated after TAVI by pre-discharge transthoracic&#xD;
           echocardiography. The extent of PVL is assessed according to the main VARC criteria(9):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Semiquantitative parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
           1-Diastolic flow reversal in the descending aorta-pulsed wave : mild (Absent or brief)&#xD;
           ,moderate ( early diastolic Intermediate), severe (Prominent holodiastolic)&#xD;
           2-Circumferential extent of prosthetic valve paravalvular regurgitation: (0) no&#xD;
           regurgitation; (1) mild PVL is defined as&lt;10 % circumferential extent; (2) moderate PVL&#xD;
           was defined as [&gt;10 % but&lt;30 % of PVL and (3) severe PVL is defined as &gt;30 % according&#xD;
           to the updated VARC guideline , that is the circumferential extent of PVL in a&#xD;
           parasternal short-axis view (19).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Quantitative parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Regurgitant volume (ml/beat) mild (&lt;30) , moderate (30-59) ,severe (&gt;60).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Regurgitant fraction (%) mild (&lt; 30), moderate (30-49) ,severe (&gt;50).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Effective regurgitant orifice area (cm2) mild (&lt;0.10) ,moderate (0.10-0.29) ,&#xD;
                severe (&gt;0.30).&#xD;
&#xD;
                Follow up patients after 1month :&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Clinical follow up (symptoms,hospital readmission ).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Echocardiographic reassessment of paravalvular leakage using the VARC criteria .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The collected data will be tabulated and statistically analyzed and will&#xD;
      be shown in tables and figures.&#xD;
