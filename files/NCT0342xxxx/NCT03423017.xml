  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction Pierre Robin Sequence, PRS, incidence is about one hundred births per year in&#xD;
      France. The main neonatal clinical manifestations are secondary to airway obstruction and&#xD;
      food difficulties related to swallowing disorders. Despite recent progress, the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of PRS is not fully understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that brainstem dysfunction, BSD, plays a central role in the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of PRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to achieve a complete evaluation of BSD to specify its role in&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of PRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to compare central apnea index (CAI) of infants with PRS with those&#xD;
      of infants with isolated airway obstruction (AWO) and those of healthy infants in order to&#xD;
      clarify the direct role of BSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods This prospective interventional study will be carried out in Lyon at the&#xD;
      Hôpital Femme-Mère-Enfant and in Paris at the Hôpital Necker-Enfants Malades for 2 years. 3&#xD;
      groups of patients will be studied: PRS, 50 patients, AWO, 50 patients and healthy, 30&#xD;
      patients, included before 2 months of life. Infants will be followed for a maximum of 10&#xD;
      months. The evaluations will be carried out for 48 hours between birth and 2 months of life&#xD;
      and then for 24 hours between 6 and 10 months of life for PRS and AWO group. Concerning the&#xD;
      healthy group, the evaluation will be carried out during 48h during a single hospitalization&#xD;
      before 2 months. Polysomnography, holter-ECG, 24h gas exchange, impedance-pH monitoring and&#xD;
      mental region EEG will be performed. The central apnea index (mean number per hour),&#xD;
      obstructive apnea index, non-nutritive swallowing index (NNS), gastroesophageal reflux and&#xD;
      NNS-respiration coordination will be assessed for each stage of sleep and compared between&#xD;
      the three groups of patients.&#xD;
