  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety, efficacy and patient satisfaction associated with the treatment of&#xD;
      facial wrinkles using the Secret Micro-Needle Fractional RF System® (Ilooda Co., Ltd., Suwon,&#xD;
      South Korea).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects satisfying all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled in this trial.&#xD;
      After baseline evaluation, all subjects will undergo a series of 3 facial treatments with the&#xD;
      Secret Micro-Needle Fractional RF System® at 4 week intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinded-investigator and subject self-assessments will be performed at Baseline and Days 28,&#xD;
      56, 146, and 180 to evaluate treatment efficacy for facial wrinkling. Of note, the&#xD;
      blinded-investigators will be blinded to treatment settings and technique, and number of&#xD;
      treatments. Safety will be evaluated by subject diaries, as well as investigator- and&#xD;
      subject-rated evaluations of adverse events at all follow-up visits. Mandatory standard 2D&#xD;
      digital photography, Canfield VISIA and VECTRA 3D digital photography will be performed at&#xD;
      baseline and at each office visit.&#xD;
