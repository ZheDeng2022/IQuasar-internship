  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label study comparing perioperative&#xD;
      atezolizumab with FLOT chemotherapy versus FLOT alone in patients with locally advanced,&#xD;
      operable adenocarcinoma of the stomach or GEJ.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the study treatment regimens. The study&#xD;
      includes an evaluation of rate of immune cell infiltration into the esophagogastric tumor&#xD;
      tissue following two and four cycles of neoadjuvant therapy. Potential study participants&#xD;
      will be assessed for eligibility during a 28-day screening period that includes central&#xD;
      verification of clinical stage and eligibility. Eligible patients will be enrolled and&#xD;
      randomized to perioperative treatment with either atezolizumab with FLOT (Arm A) or FLOT&#xD;
      alone (Arm B). Randomization will occur in a 1:1 ratio with stratification by clinical nodal&#xD;
      stage (N+ vs. N-), location of the primary (GEJ type I vs. GEJ type II/III vs. stomach), and&#xD;
      MSI-status (MSI / MMRd vs. MSS / MMRp). Quantitative PDL-1 mRNA expression will be performed&#xD;
      but not used as stratification factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following randomization, study patients will enter the study treatment period which will last&#xD;
      approximately 22 to 52 weeks depending on treatment arm and timing of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: FLOT with Atezolizumab:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to treatment Arm A will receive atezolizumab + FLOT in four 2-week&#xD;
      treatment cycles as described below prior to undergoing surgery. Following surgery, patients&#xD;
      will receive four further 2-week cycles of atezolizumab + FLOT followed by 8 additional&#xD;
      3-week treatment cycles with atezolizumab alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B: FLOT alone:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to Arm B will receive FLOT alone for four 2-week treatment cycles prior&#xD;
      to surgery. Following surgery, patients will receive four further 2-week cycles of&#xD;
      chemotherapy alone.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have provided written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. In the investigator's judgement, is willing and able to comply with the study protocol&#xD;
             including the planned surgical treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Female and male patients* ≥ 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Diagnosed with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the GEJ (Type I-III) or the&#xD;
             stomach (cT2, cT3, cT4, any N category,&#xD;
&#xD;
             M0), or (any T, N+, M0) that:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. is not infiltrating any adjacent organs or structures by CT or MRI evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. does not involve peritoneal carcinomatosis&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. is considered medically and technically resectable&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: the absence of distant metastases must be confirmed by CT or MRI of the thorax&#xD;
             and abdomen, and, if there is clinical suspicion of osseous lesions, a bone scan. If&#xD;
             peritoneal carcinomatosis is suspected clinically, its absence must be confirmed by&#xD;
             laparoscopy. Diagnostic laparoscopy is mandatory in patients with T3 or T4 tumors of&#xD;
             the diffuse type histology in the stomach or upon request of the central review.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. No prior cytotoxic or targeted therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. No prior partial or complete esophagogastric tumor resection&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. ECOG ≤ 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Availability of a representative tumor specimen that is suitable for determination of&#xD;
             PD-L1 and MSI status; MSI assessment will be performed locally or centrally and result&#xD;
             must be available prior to randomization (for details, see chapter 9). PD-L1 will be&#xD;
             assessed centrally but is not used for enrolment of the patients. The analysis&#xD;
             requires paraffin embedded biopsy samples of the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Females of childbearing potential must agree to remain abstinent (refrain from&#xD;
             heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate&#xD;
             of &lt;1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 5 months after the last&#xD;
             study treatment. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is&#xD;
             postmenarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (has not had ≥12 continuous&#xD;
             months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not&#xD;
             undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). Examples of&#xD;
             contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include tubal ligation,&#xD;
             male sterilization, hormonal implants, established, proper use of combined oral or&#xD;
             injected hormonal contraceptives, and certain intrauterine devices. Alternatively, two&#xD;
             methods (e.g., two barrier methods such as a condom and a cervical cap) may be&#xD;
             combined to achieve a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year. Barrier methods must always be&#xD;
             supplemented with the use of a spermicide. The reliability of sexual abstinence should&#xD;
             be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and&#xD;
             usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
             symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
             contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Males must agree to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use&#xD;
             contraceptive measures, and agree to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. With female partners of childbearing potential or pregnant female partners, men&#xD;
             must remain abstinent or use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that&#xD;
             together result in a failure rate of 1% per year during the treatment period and for&#xD;
             at least 3 months after the last dose of study treatment to avoid exposing the embryo.&#xD;
             Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period. Men with a pregnant&#xD;
             partner must agree to remain abstinent or to use a condom for the duration of the&#xD;
             pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Adequate hematological, hepatic and renal function as indicated by the following&#xD;
             parameters:&#xD;

                  limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal, or glomerular filtration rate &gt;&#xD;
                  45 ml/min (calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum albumin ≥ 25 g/L (2.5 g/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For patients not receiving therapeutic anticoagulation: INR or aPTT ≤ 1.5 x ULN;&#xD;
                  for patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation: stable anticoagulant regimen&#xD;
                  *There are no data that indicate special gender distribution. Therefore patients&#xD;
                  will be enrolled in the study gender-independently.&#xD;
