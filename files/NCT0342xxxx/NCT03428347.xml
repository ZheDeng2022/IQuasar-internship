      This Phase I clinical trial was developed to study drug safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of the medicine for Ebola fever emergency prevention based on monoclonal&#xD;
      recombinant antibodies in single use in healthy volunteers with a dose escalation. A&#xD;
      consecutive recruitment of people who signed the Informed Consent Form into three groups of&#xD;
      volunteers with different drug doses is made according to the volunteers' screening results.&#xD;
      The total number of volunteers receiving the drug will be not less then 25 people.The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to assess safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a medicine for Ebola&#xD;
      fever emergency prevention based on monoclonal recombinant antibodies in a single dose in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The results of the screening of volunteers who signed the informed consent Form, is a&#xD;
      sequence set in three groups of volunteers with different doses of the drug, the total number&#xD;
      of volunteers who received the drug will be at least 25 people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking into account the fact that for the first time the drug is studied on people, initially&#xD;
      five volunteers will be hospitalized. Their dose of the studied medicine will be 1.4 mg/kg of&#xD;
      weight. After confirmation of safety based on observation results on the 60th day of the&#xD;
      study, the investigation will continue with the participation of five more volunteers. Safety&#xD;
      will be studied on these five volunteers with a single use of dose of 7 mg/kg of weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an intermediate safety assessment on the 60th day, 15 more volunteers will be included&#xD;
      in the study. They will get the medicine with the dose of 14 mg/kg of weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If necessary, understudies in an amount of not more than 4 people may be included. Volunteers&#xD;
      are replaced before the injection of the medicine. If a volunteer got the medicine, he could&#xD;
      not be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After evaluating the safety analyzes' intermediate results (blood test and blood chemistry,&#xD;
      urinalysis, immunological safety, clinical evaluation of general health status) obtained on&#xD;
      day 60 of the study, the Researcher, in agreement with the Ethics Committee, makes a decision&#xD;
      to include the second group (five people) to study the drug at a dosage of 7 mg/kg of weight.&#xD;
      After the evaluation of intermediate safety results on the 60th day of the study of&#xD;
      volunteers from the second group, 15 more volunteers will be included in the study. After the&#xD;
      intermediate evaluation of safety on the 60th day of study, 15 more volunteers will be&#xD;
      included in the study and get the medicine in a dose of 14 mg/kg of weight. Wherein the third&#xD;
      part of volunteers is planned to be included consistently: in the beginning 5 volunteers will&#xD;
      be included and after the intermediate safety evaluation on the 28th day the rest 10&#xD;
      volunteers will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and tolerability assessment will be based on the registration of adverse events&#xD;
      during the study. Changes in instrumental (ECG) and laboratory indicators (blood test and&#xD;
      blood chemistry, blood coagulation system indicators, urinalysis, immunological status),&#xD;
      dynamics of vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature) will be also&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated by a model-independent method. Immunological&#xD;
      methods (ELISA) will be used for studying the level of specific antibodies and the duration&#xD;
      of their circulation in the human body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling of biological material involves:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinalysis: at screening, before administration of the drug after 48 hours and on 7, 10, 14,&#xD;
      21, 28, 45, 60 and 90 days of the study; urine samples for a pregnancy test taken at&#xD;
      screening and on the day of hospitalization (in addition to volunteers women).&#xD;
&#xD;
      to define security settings (General clinical and biochemical** blood tests, including a&#xD;
      study of the coagulation system): at screening, before dosing, 48 hours, and 7, 10, 14, 21,&#xD;
      28, 45, 60 and 90 days of the study; immune status***- the drug, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, 45, 60&#xD;
      and 90 days of the study; will also be determining the level of specific antibodies to the&#xD;
      drug (with detection with the determination of class, subclass, immunoglobulins and&#xD;
      assessment of their functional activity) is the drug, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, 45, 60 and 90 days&#xD;
      of the study; **biochemical blood analysis includes a determination of: total protein, urea,&#xD;
      creatinine, aspartataminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline&#xD;
      phosphatase, total bilirubin, glucose, cholesterol, creatine phosphokinase, CRP,&#xD;
      concentration of electrolytes (sodium, potassium), coagulation include: PI+, INR, APTT,&#xD;
      fibrinogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *** evaluation of the immunological status includes: determining the number and relative&#xD;
      content of subpopulations of T - and b-lymphocytes (CD3, CD 4, CD 8, CD 16, CD19), phagocytic&#xD;
      activity of white blood cells, immunoregulatory index, content of serum immunoglobulins major&#xD;
      classes (A, M, G, E), circulating immuno complexes, the detection of antibodies to the mouse&#xD;
      immunoglobulin, the content of anti-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, ИЛ1, IL-6, IFN-γ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for testing for hepatitis b and C, HIV and syphilis will be taken once at&#xD;
      screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition there will be samples of whole blood for analysis of pharmacokinetic parameters:&#xD;
      before drug administration, through 1, 4, 8, 24, 36, 48 and 96 hours after drug&#xD;
      administration, and 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, 45, 60 and 90 days study.&#xD;
