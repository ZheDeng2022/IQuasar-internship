      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many people suffer from drug addiction. But currently, treatments are not very effective. One&#xD;
      group of patients in this study are enrolled in addiction treatment through physician health&#xD;
      programs (PHPs). About 70% of these patients are able to stop using drugs for extended&#xD;
      periods of time. By studying this specific group of patients, researchers want to understand&#xD;
      the difference between those who may or may not respond to treatment. They want to study the&#xD;
      brain while people do thinking and feeling tasks and when they relax. They will study brain&#xD;
      chemicals, a stress hormone, and certain genes. The results may help them understand the&#xD;
      brain basis for addiction and recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To use brain imaging to find differences between people with and without drug addiction. To&#xD;
      see if these differences help predict addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy, right-handed adults ages 21-65, enrolled in a physician health program or those with&#xD;
      no history of addiction and with at least 16 years of education&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants enrolled in a PHP will be screened under this study and participants with no&#xD;
      history of addiction will be screened under another study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the study visit, participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have a routine check-up, including tests for pregnancy, drugs, and alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Give 11 blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rate their cravings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test their frustration with stressful situations by responding to questions on a screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practice the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tasks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shock task. Two electrodes placed on a foot will deliver brief, low-strength electrical&#xD;
      shocks that get gradually stronger, but not painful. Participants will see drug or neutral&#xD;
      images. They will rate their discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thinking tasks. Participants will answer questions about pictures, numbers, and money. They&#xD;
      will press buttons in response to things they see.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Do the MRI tasks in 2 sessions (morning and afternoon) in the scanner. Participants will lie&#xD;
      in an MRI machine which will take pictures of the brain while doing these tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will repeat the visit twice over a year at set intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meals will be provided, and visits will include meal breaks and smoking breaks for those who&#xD;
      smoke.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite recent advances in addiction neuroscience, achieving a breakthrough in predicting&#xD;
      addiction treatment outcome has been difficult and long-term abstinence success unacceptably&#xD;
      low. The aim of this study is to create a biomarker using various neuroimaging metrics that&#xD;
      can predict treatment outcome in opioid, alcohol and dual opioid and alcohol use disorder&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total study enrollment will include up to 650 participants. The main study population will&#xD;
      include up to five hundred (500) participants to reach three hundred fifty (350) completers&#xD;
      (50 per group) based on their addiction status (1) healthy, non-drug using control&#xD;
      participants (CON) (2) Early-in-treatment, healthy prescription opioid use disorder&#xD;
      participants currently enrolled in physician health program (PHP) within 3 months of starting&#xD;
      treatment (POUD-E), (3) Long-term-in-treatment, healthy prescription opioid use disorder&#xD;
      participants currently enrolled in or affiliated with a PHP more than 2 months (POUD-L), (4)&#xD;
      Early-in-treatment, healthy alcohol use disorder participants currently enrolled in PHP&#xD;
      within 3 months of starting treatment (AUD-E), (5) Long-term-in-treatment, healthy alcohol&#xD;
      use disorder participants currently enrolled in or affiliated with a PHP more than 2 months&#xD;
      (AUD-L), (6) Early-in-treatment, healthy dual prescription opioid and alcohol and use&#xD;
      disorder participants currently enrolled in PHP within 3 months of starting treatment&#xD;
      (POAUD-E), (7) Long-term-in-treatment, healthy dual prescription opioid and alcohol use&#xD;
      disorder participants currently enrolled in or affiliated with a PHP more than 2 months&#xD;
      (POAUD-L). The Addiction Phenotype Characterization arm will include up to 150 completers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main study includes two studies that will run simultaneously:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-sectional study that will include participants who have been in treatment for more than&#xD;
      2 months and are either enrolled at a PHP if within the required monitoring period of 5 years&#xD;
      or still affiliated with their PHP after successfully completing their 5-year monitoring&#xD;
      period. Three target groups, in addition to the control group, will be included in this study&#xD;
      [POUD-L, AUD-L, and POAUD-L]. Each participant will complete a screening evaluation session&#xD;
      (approximately 3-4 hours) and a second session for study consent review (approximately 1-2&#xD;
      hours) at home or at the PHP through secure communication. These sessions will include the&#xD;
      screening consent process, administration of a structured psychiatric interview and a&#xD;
      semi-structured assessment, instructions for the completion of detailed self-administered&#xD;
      questionnaires to characterize clinical phenotype and physical condition, and consent review&#xD;
      for the study. Participants subsequently cleared for and enrolled in the cross-sectional&#xD;
      study will be invited to come to NIDA IRP for one imaging visit that will take approximately&#xD;
      8-10 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the cross-sectional study is to identify imaging based brain differences between&#xD;
      control group and drug using groups and to examine correlations between brain imaging markers&#xD;
      at different stages of recovery and (1) severity of drug use (duration and quantity), (2)&#xD;
      duration of abstinence, and (3) number of relapses in drug using groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure for the cross-sectional study will be differences in functional&#xD;
      connectivity and BOLD signal activation in executive and impulsive neurobehavioral decision&#xD;
      systems at various stages of sobriety in relation to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Longitudinal study that will include participants who are enrolled at a PHP within about&#xD;
      three months of starting treatment. Three groups, in addition to the control group, will be&#xD;
      included in this study [POUD-E, AUD-E, and POAUD-E]. Each participant will complete the&#xD;
      screening sessions as described in the cross-sectional study. Eligible participants will&#xD;
      undergo three imaging visits at NIDA; 1) 1st (baseline) visit within about 2 months of&#xD;
      eligibility determination, (2) 2nd (mid-year) visit within 4-8 months of baseline visit and&#xD;
      (3) 3rd (one-year) visit within 10-14 months of baseline visit. Each imaging visit will take&#xD;
      approximately 8-10 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the longitudinal study is to measure brain imaging changes over time in abstinent&#xD;
      and relapsing addicts and to identify brain imaging markers that differentiate between&#xD;
      abstinent and relapsing participants at 6 months and at 1 year. The rationale behind the&#xD;
      mid-year visit is that most relapses take place early (within the first 6 months) during&#xD;
      treatment and, by one year, some of those who relapsed earlier achieve abstinence. We chose&#xD;
      one year follow up in order to compare brain imaging changes between abstinent and relapsing&#xD;
      participants after relatively long sobriety and to add clinical value to our prediction&#xD;
      model. By including both of these visits, we will obtain three scans on both abstinent&#xD;
      without early relapse and abstinent with early relapse in order to uncover salient brain&#xD;
      differences between those who relapse early and those who maintain abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure for the longitudinal study will be differences in baseline and&#xD;
      changes over time in functional connectivity circuits and BOLD signal activation in executive&#xD;
      and impulsive neurobehavioral decision systems between abstinent and relapsing addicts that&#xD;
      can predict treatment response at 6 and 12 months. Most importantly, we will use imaging,&#xD;
      behavioral and genetic measures at the onset of treatment in a machine-learning framework in&#xD;
      an attempt to predict subsequent treatment success in this cohort of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures for both studies will be phenotypic (performance on behavioral&#xD;
      tasks, self-reported measures of cravings, impulsivity and personality traits), genotypic and&#xD;
      imaging (structural, functional and spectroscopy) differences between different addiction&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Addiction Phenotype Characterization arm will include participants who are ineligible for&#xD;
      the main study due to imaging-related exclusions or other medical exclusions (e.g.&#xD;
      medications, other SUD disorders). These participants will complete the characterization&#xD;
      measures (structured psychiatric interview, a semi-structured drug use history assessment,&#xD;
      and several self-administered questionnaires to characterize clinical phenotype and physical&#xD;
      condition).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the Addiction Phenotype Characterization arm is to characterize addiction&#xD;
      phenotype and physical condition in health professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures for the Addiction Phenotype Characterization arm are the&#xD;
      characterization measures.&#xD;

        Cross-sectional study will include participants enrolled in or affiliated with a PHP for&#xD;
        more than 2 months. Longitudinal study will include participants who are enrolled in a PHP&#xD;
        within about three months of starting treatment. No preferences in participant recruitment&#xD;
        will be made on the bases of gender, race, or ethnic background. Efforts will be made to&#xD;
        include minorities in proportion to their presence in the local population of the PHP. The&#xD;
        demographic profile for the PHP cohort is about 60% males (Braquehais et al. 2014; Brooks&#xD;
        et al. 2013), predominantly Caucasian; 89% and about 4% Asian, 3% Hispanic, 1.5% African&#xD;
        American and 1.5% other races (Brooks et al. 2013). The matching control group will be&#xD;
        recruited from NIH employees and from the major metropolitan Baltimore area.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All participants: (CON), (POUD-E), (POUD-L), (AUD-E), (AUD-L), (POAUD-E), (POAUD-L):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Males and females between 21-65 years of age will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
             Justification: The lower age cut off is chosen because the sample consists of addicted&#xD;
             health care professionals who are all above 21 years of age. The upper age cut off is&#xD;
             chosen because of aging-related brain changes that could confound the results.&#xD;
             Assessment tool: Participants self-report their demographic information, including&#xD;
             date of birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Able and willing to provide written informed consent. Justification: It is important&#xD;
             for subjects to understand and agree to all the procedures, time-commitments and&#xD;
             expectations entailed in this study. Assessment tool: Verbal confirmation of&#xD;
             willingness to consent and a score of 80% or more on consent quiz.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Must be right-handed. Justification: Some of the neural processes assessed in this&#xD;
             protocol may be lateralized in the brain. In order to reduce potential variance,&#xD;
             participants will be required to be right- handed. Assessment tool: Self-report.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participants must be in good health. Justification: Many illnesses may alter fMRI&#xD;
             signals as well as neural functioning. Assessment tool(s): Control participants will&#xD;
             undergo a medical history and physical examination. Experimental group participants&#xD;
             will provide a brief health history during phone/internet screening. Written physician&#xD;
             health records will also be obtained to verify health status of the experimental&#xD;
             groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Healthy control participants (CON) in addition to all participants inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Free of lifetime DSM-5 substance use disorders except for tobacco use disorder.&#xD;
             Justification: the presence of substance use disorder in the control group will&#xD;
             confound the results. Please note we exempted tobacco use disorder in order to match&#xD;
             the experimental group participants. Assessment tool(s): The MINI and clinical&#xD;
             assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. 16 years of education or more Justification: To match the educational status of the&#xD;
             experimental group. Assessment tool: Participant will provide educational history.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Early-in-treatment, prescription opioid use disorder (POUD-E) participants- in&#xD;
             addition to all participants inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Recently (within about 3 months) enrolled in a physician health program (PHP) or&#xD;
             equivalent at time of enrollment in the study. Justification: The three months&#xD;
             interval was chosen because we wish to longitudinally follow participants from very&#xD;
             early abstinence to long-term abstinence/relapse at one year. Importantly,&#xD;
             participants are typically allowed to leave residential treatment centers and go home&#xD;
             for weekends or short holidays as early as 30 days after starting treatment, so&#xD;
             inviting enrolled participants to travel to NIDA IRP for one-day visit after they have&#xD;
             been deemed eligible for overnight stays outside of their treatment facility is not&#xD;
             expected to increase their risk of relapse. Assessment tool: PHP and/or addiction&#xD;
             treatment records.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Meet a minimum of 6/11 DSM-5 criteria for severe opioid use disorder (OUD) for about 2&#xD;
             years prior to enrollment and abstinent for about 1-3 months at time of imaging.&#xD;
             Justification: The hypothesized differences in measured brain imaging parameters are&#xD;
             more likely to be detected in severe OUDs compared to mild or moderate OUDs.&#xD;
             Assessment tool: DSM 5 Opioid Use Disorder Checklist.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Early-in-treatment, alcohol use disorder (AUD-E) participants- in addition to all&#xD;
             participants inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Recently (within about 3 months) enrolled in a physician health program (PHP) or&#xD;
             equivalent at time of enrollment in the study. Justification: The three months&#xD;
             interval was chosen because we wish to follow longitudinally participants from very&#xD;
             early abstinence to long-term abstinence/ relapse at one year. Importantly,&#xD;
             participants are typically allowed to leave residential treatment centers and go home&#xD;
             for weekends or short holidays as early as 30 days after starting treatment,&#xD;
             therefore, inviting enrolled participants to travel to NIDA IRP for one-day visit&#xD;
             after they have been deemed eligible for overnight stays outside of their treatment&#xD;
             facility is not expected to increase their risk of relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Assessment tool: PHP and/or addiction treatment records.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Meet a minimum of 6/11 DSM-5 criteria for severe alcohol use disorder (AUD) for about&#xD;
             2 years prior to enrollment and abstinent for about 1-3 months at time of imaging.&#xD;
             Justification: The hypothesized differences in measured brain imaging parameters are&#xD;
             more likely to be detected in severe AUDs compared to mild or moderate AUDs.&#xD;
             Assessment tool: DSM 5 Alcohol Use Disorder Checklist.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Early-in-treatment, dual prescription opioid and alcohol use disorder (POAUD-E)&#xD;
             participants- in addition to all participants inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Recently (within about 3 months) enrolled in a physician health program (PHP) or&#xD;
             equivalent at time of enrollment in the study. Justification: The three months&#xD;
             interval was chosen because we wish to follow longitudinally participants from very&#xD;
             early abstinence to long-term abstinence/ relapse at one year. Importantly,&#xD;
             participants are typically allowed to leave residential treatment centers and go home&#xD;
             for weekends or short holidays as early as 30 days after starting treatment,&#xD;
             therefore, inviting enrolled participants to travel to NIDA IRP for one-day visit&#xD;
             after they have been deemed eligible for overnight stays outside of their treatment&#xD;
             facility is not expected to increase their risk of relapse. Assessment tool: PHP&#xD;
             and/or addiction treatment records.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Meet a minimum of 6/11 DSM-5 criteria for either severe opioid or severe alcohol use&#xD;
             disorders and a minimum of 4/11 DSM-5 for either moderate opioid or moderate alcohol&#xD;
             use disorder for about 2 years for each substance prior to enrollment and abstinent&#xD;
             for about 1-3 months at time of imaging. Justification: The hypothesized differences&#xD;
             in measured brain imaging parameters are more likely to be detected in severe SUDs&#xD;
             compared to mild or moderate SUDs, so at least one of the two dual addictions should&#xD;
             be severe and the second one can be moderate. Assessment tool: DSM 5 Opioid Use&#xD;
             Disorder and Alcohol Use Disorder Checklists.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Long-term-in-treatment, prescription opioid use disorder (POUD-L) participants- in&#xD;
             addition to all participants inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Enrolled in or affiliated with a physician health program (PHP) or equivalent for more&#xD;
             than 2 months at time of enrollment in the study. Justification: PHP participants are&#xD;
             generally enrolled and closely monitored for 5 years after which they may continue a&#xD;
             voluntary relationship with the PHP with a reduced level of monitoring. We wish to&#xD;
             study brain changes (compared to non-drug using controls) at different stages of&#xD;
             abstinence. Assessment tool: PHP records.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Meet a minimum of 6/11 DSM-5 criteria for severe opioid use disorder for about 2 years&#xD;
             prior to starting treatment and abstinent for at least 3 months at time of imaging.&#xD;
             Justification: The hypothesized differences in measured brain imaging parameters are&#xD;
             more likely to be detected in severe OUD compared to mild or moderate OUDs. Assessment&#xD;

&#xD;
             Long-term-in-treatment, alcohol use disorder (AUD-L) participants- in addition to all&#xD;
             participants inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Enrolled in or affiliated with a physician health program (PHP) or equivalent for more&#xD;
             than 2 months at time of enrollment in the study and in full remission for at least 2&#xD;
             months at time of imaging. Justification: PHP participants are generally enrolled and&#xD;
             closely monitored for 5 years after which they may continue a voluntary relationship&#xD;
             with the PHP with a reduced level of monitoring. We wish to study brain changes&#xD;

         16. Meet a minimum of 6/11 DSM-5 criteria for severe alcohol use disorder for about 2&#xD;
             years prior to starting treatment and abstinent for at least 3 months at time of&#xD;
             imaging. Justification: The hypothesized differences in measured brain imaging&#xD;
             parameters are more likely to be detected in severe AUD compared to mild or moderate&#xD;
             AUDs. Assessment tool: DSM 5 Alcohol Use Disorder Checklist.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Long-term-in-treatment, dual prescription opioid and alcohol use disorder (POAUD-L)&#xD;
             participants - in addition to all participants inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Enrolled in or affiliated with a physician health program (PHP) or equivalent for more&#xD;
             than 2 months at time of enrollment in the study. Justification: PHP participants are&#xD;
             generally enrolled and closely monitored for 5 years after which they may continue a&#xD;
             voluntary relationship with the PHP with a reduced level of monitoring. We wish to&#xD;
             study brain changes (compared to non-drug using controls) at different stages of&#xD;
             abstinence. Assessment tool: PHP records.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Meet a minimum of 6/11 DSM-5 criteria for either severe opioid or severe alcohol use&#xD;
             disorder and a minimum of 4/11 DSM-5 for either moderate opioid or moderate alcohol&#xD;
             use disorder about 2 years for each substance prior to enrollment and abstinent for at&#xD;
             least 3 months at time of imaging. Justification: The hypothesized differences in&#xD;
             measured brain imaging parameters are more likely to be detected in severe SUDs&#xD;
             compared to mild or moderate SUDs, so at least one of the two dual addictions should&#xD;
             be severe and the second one can be moderate. Assessment tool: DSM 5 Opioid Use&#xD;
             Disorder and Alcohol Use Disorder Checklists.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All participants: (CON), (POUD-E), (POUD-L), (AUD-E), (AUD-L), (POAUD-E), (POAUD-L):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Females must not be pregnant or lactating. Justification: The impact of exposing&#xD;
             pregnant females to MRI and stress paradigms is unknown. Including lactating females&#xD;
             will confound the results because of the effect of lactation-associated hormonal&#xD;
             changes on the brain. Assessment: medical history and negative urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             prior to each MRI visit (and at screening for control participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Presence of ferromagnetic objects in the body that are contraindicated for MRI of the&#xD;
             head (e.g. pacemakers or other implanted electrical devices, brain stimulators, some&#xD;
             types of dental implants, aneurysm clips, metallic prostheses, permanent eyeliner,&#xD;
             implanted delivery pump, or shrapnel fragments) or fear of enclosed spaces.&#xD;
             Justification: The presence of ferromagnetic objects poses risk of injury during MRI.&#xD;
             Assessment tool: medical history and MRI screening form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Noise-induced hearing loss or tinnitus. Justification: individuals with noise-induced&#xD;
        hearing problems may be particularly vulnerable to the acoustic noise generated by MRI&#xD;
        scanner. Assessment tool: medical history and MRI safety screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Head trauma with loss of consciousness for more than 30 minutes or significant sequelae&#xD;
        for more than one month. Justification: The presence of head injury could result in subtle&#xD;
        alterations in brain structure or function and could confound the results. Assessment tool:&#xD;
        medical history and physical exam (controls).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Current or past DSM-5 diagnosis of any psychiatric disorder that required&#xD;
        hospitalization other than detoxification (any length), or chronic medication management&#xD;
        for more than three months, (except for stable doses of antidepressants, or low dose (up to&#xD;
        100mg/day of Quetiapine or equivalent - see appendix 31 for antipsychotic dose equivalent&#xD;
        conversion table to 100mg of Quetiapine) of antipsychotics (experimental groups only) for&#xD;
        at least one month prior to the time of a scanning visit) and that could impact brain&#xD;
        function at the time of the study based on study MAI s discretion. Current or past tobacco&#xD;
        use disorder or nicotine use, opioid use disorder in opioid use disorder participants,&#xD;
        alcohol use disorder in alcohol use disorder participants, and both opioid and alcohol use&#xD;
        disorders in the dual opioid and alcohol use disorder group is not exclusionary.&#xD;
        Justification: The presence of severe or unstable comorbid psychiatric conditions could be&#xD;
        associated with brain alterations that could confound the results. Assessment tool:&#xD;
        history, MINI clinical assessment, as well as review of medical records, including clinical&#xD;
        exam, for experimental group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Currently (at time of imaging sessions) using any medications that are known to alter&#xD;
        BOLD signal such as stimulant or stimulant-like medications (amphetamine, methylphenidate,&#xD;
        modafinil); anorexics (sibuteramine); antianginal agents; antiarrhythmics; antiasthma&#xD;
        agents that are systemic corticosteroids; anticholinergics; anticonvulsants;&#xD;
        antineoplastics; antiobesity;; hormones (exceptions: thyroid hormone replacement, oral&#xD;
        contraceptives, and estrogen replacement therapy); insulin; lithium; herbal products with&#xD;
        known psychotropic effects (e.g. Gingko biloba, or St. John s Wort) and other medications&#xD;
        based on study MAI s discretion. Justification: Concomitant intake of medications that&#xD;
        could alter BOLD signal could confound the results. Note that stable low dose&#xD;
        antipsychotics are allowed for the experimental groups for two reasons: (1) anecdotal data&#xD;
        suggest that a large number of PHP participants are prescribed low doses of antipsychotics&#xD;
        to attenuate some of the mood instability, irritability, and insomnia that is commonly&#xD;
        experienced as a result of abstinence. If we exclude these participants, it will be&#xD;
        difficult to get to the targeted recruitment number. (2) The effect of low dose&#xD;
        antipsychotics on BOLD signal in patients with substance use disorder is largely unknown.&#xD;
        Most of the literature on the effects of antipsychotic medications on fMRI BOLD signals&#xD;
        focuses on schizophrenic and bipolar populations taking high dose antipsychotics. Among&#xD;
        individuals with schiz...&#xD;
