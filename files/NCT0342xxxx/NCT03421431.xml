    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline (Average) in Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected at specific timepoints for the laboratory evaluation to assess the ALT level. Baseline refers to the average of the screening and the Day 1 values; if either the screening or Day 1 values were missing, the non-missing value was used. Mean change was defined as the mean value at Week 12 minus the mean value at baseline.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Percentage of Fat in the Liver as Assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging - Proton Density Fat Fraction (MRI-PDFF) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The liver fat percentage was assessed by MRI-PDFF, which is an established method that enables the quantification of fat content in the liver; the value of liver fat is expressed in percentage and ranges from 0 to 100% with higher values representing higher liver fat level.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Aspartate Aminotransferase to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected at specific timepoints for the laboratory evaluation to assess the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level and platelet count. Baseline refers to the last non-missing value collected prior to the first dose of study treatment. The APRI score (AST to platelet ratio index) is an index comprised of biochemical values and is used to determine the degree of hepatic fibrosis. APRI is calculated from the level of AST measured in a blood test (international units per liter [IU/L]) and platelet count (10^9/L) according to the following formula:&#xD;
APRI = ([AST value in IU/L / upper limit of the normal range of AST] / [platelet count in 10^9/L]) Ã— 100.&#xD;
In general, APRI scores range from 0 to &gt;2.0, where scores &lt;0.5 indicate no significant fibrosis, scores &gt;1.5 indicate significant fibrosis, and scores &gt;2.0 have been shown to be best correlated with the presence of cirrhosis. Mean change was defined as the mean value at Week 12 minus the mean value at baseline.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Percentage of Fat in the Liver as Assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging - Proton Density Fat Fraction (MRI-PDFF) at Week 12</title>
        <description>The liver fat percentage was assessed by MRI-PDFF, which is an established method that enables the quantification of fat content in the liver; the value of liver fat is expressed in percentage and ranges from 0 to 100% with higher values representing higher liver fat level. Baseline refers to the last non-missing value collected prior to the first dose of study treatment. Mean change was defined as the mean value at Week 12 minus the mean value at baseline.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Percentage of Fat in the Liver as Assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging - Proton Density Fat Fraction (MRI-PDFF) at Week 12</title>
          <description>The liver fat percentage was assessed by MRI-PDFF, which is an established method that enables the quantification of fat content in the liver; the value of liver fat is expressed in percentage and ranges from 0 to 100% with higher values representing higher liver fat level. Baseline refers to the last non-missing value collected prior to the first dose of study treatment. Mean change was defined as the mean value at Week 12 minus the mean value at baseline.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Aspartate Aminotransferase to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) at Week 12</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected at specific timepoints for the laboratory evaluation to assess the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level and platelet count. Baseline refers to the last non-missing value collected prior to the first dose of study treatment. The APRI score (AST to platelet ratio index) is an index comprised of biochemical values and is used to determine the degree of hepatic fibrosis. APRI is calculated from the level of AST measured in a blood test (international units per liter [IU/L]) and platelet count (10^9/L) according to the following formula:&#xD;
APRI = ([AST value in IU/L / upper limit of the normal range of AST] / [platelet count in 10^9/L]) Ã— 100.&#xD;
In general, APRI scores range from 0 to &gt;2.0, where scores &lt;0.5 indicate no significant fibrosis, scores &gt;1.5 indicate significant fibrosis, and scores &gt;2.0 have been shown to be best correlated with the presence of cirrhosis. Mean change was defined as the mean value at Week 12 minus the mean value at baseline.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) Index for Nondiabetic Participants at Week 12</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected at specific timepoints for the laboratory evaluation; from the results of fasting glucose and insulin, an insulin resistance (IR) was estimated for the nondiabetic participants using the HOMA-IR computer algorithm. A higher HOMA-IR indicates a higher degree of insulin resistance. Participants who were not considered as having type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were identified as nondiabetic. Baseline refers to the last non-missing value collected prior to the first dose of study treatment. Mean change was defined as the mean value at Week 12 minus the mean value at baseline.</description>

          <description>Blood samples were collected at specific timepoints for the laboratory evaluation; from the results of fasting glucose and insulin, an insulin resistance (IR) was estimated for the nondiabetic participants using the HOMA-IR computer algorithm. A higher HOMA-IR indicates a higher degree of insulin resistance. Participants who were not considered as having type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were identified as nondiabetic. Baseline refers to the last non-missing value collected prior to the first dose of study treatment. Mean change was defined as the mean value at Week 12 minus the mean value at baseline.</description>
