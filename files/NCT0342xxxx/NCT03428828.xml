  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical efficacy of real-time functional&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) training to increase the amygdala's&#xD;
      response to positive autobiographical memories in patients with depression who are considered&#xD;
      treatment-resistant&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to two-thirds of patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) will not respond&#xD;
      to standard pharmacological and psychological interventions and will be considered treatment&#xD;
      resistant (TR-MDD). Decreased reactivity to positive stimuli, indexed by low amygdala&#xD;
      reactivity to positive autobiographical memory recall, may be a causal mechanism interfering&#xD;
      with recovery from TR-MDD. Previous work in our lab suggests that individuals who do respond&#xD;
      to antidepressant medications show increased amygdala activity that is indistinguishable from&#xD;
      controls relative to baseline, while TR-MDD individuals fail to show this increase in&#xD;
      amygdala activity. Furthermore, the investigators have found that MDD participants (more&#xD;
      generally, not specifically TR- MDD) are indeed able to increase their amygdala response&#xD;
      during positive memory recall via real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) training, and that&#xD;
      this increase is associated with large and rapid reductions in depressive symptoms. Here, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to evaluate whether rtfMRI-nf training to increase the amygdala&#xD;
      response to positive memories may serve as an intervention for TR-MDD. 100 TR-MDD individuals&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned under double-blind conditions to receive 5 amygdala rtfMRI-nf or 5&#xD;
      control rtfMRI-nf sessions where they are trained to regulate a parietal region putatively&#xD;
      not involved in emotional processing or MDD. The investigators will assess changes in&#xD;
      amygdala activity, severity of clinical symptoms, and autobiographical memory deficits.&#xD;
      Success will suggest a new non- pharmacological, non-invasive intervention for a&#xD;
      traditionally treatment-resistant population of MDD individuals.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  right-handed adults (ages 18 - 55) with a primary diagnosis of MDD according to&#xD;
             diagnostic criteria DSM-5 for recurrent MDD who are currently depressed will be&#xD;
             recruited to participate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  must be able to give written informed consent prior to participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  must have fewer than 45% memories categorized as specific on the Autobiographical&#xD;
             Memory Test&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  must have a SHAPS score &gt; 4, indicating the presence of anhedonia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  unmedicated or stable on an SSRI antidepressant regime (at least 3 weeks to ensure&#xD;
             symptoms are stable)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  have a history of traumatic brain injury&#xD;
&#xD;
