  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, there has been a significant improvement in understanding the biology of&#xD;
      cancer and this information has been used to improve cancer care and patient outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has shown that changes in some genes and/or proteins may be important indicators for&#xD;
      certain cancers and response to treatments. Genes are molecules made up of ribonucleic acid&#xD;
      (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). DNA contain instructions for the development and&#xD;
      functioning of the cells in the body and are passed down from parent to child. RNA is&#xD;
      involved with producing proteins in the body. Further research is needed to better understand&#xD;
      the changes found in cancer cells and how to target them to stop or reduce cancer growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A drug that may be able to block certain specific cancer cell changes is called &quot;targeted&#xD;
      therapy&quot;. Different people with the same type of cancer receiving the same drug could have&#xD;
      different responses to it. For example, one person may experience a reduction of their tumor&#xD;
      while another person's cancer may worsen. The reason for this is still not well understood&#xD;
      and could lie in gene changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding these changes may allow researchers to predict how treatments may work in&#xD;
      guiding decisions around choice of drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to learn more about gene changes or protein expression (levels)&#xD;
      of tumors to better understand the behavior of gynecological diseases and, if possible,&#xD;
      better address participants' cancer care now or in the future.&#xD;

    <description>Depending on the status of disease when participants join the study, a sample of tumor tissue may be collected from:&#xD;
A previous surgery for the disease,&#xD;
A biopsy for diagnosing the disease,&#xD;
Other surgical procedures done for clinical management or possible cancer related complications (e.g., bowel obstruction).&#xD;
In addition:&#xD;
At anytime participants require a biopsy as a part of their cancer care, a sample of that tumor tissue will be collected.&#xD;
New biopsies will be done to collect fresh tumor tissue each time participants' disease worsens.</description>

    <description>Blood samples will be collected at the following different times points:&#xD;
Before starting a new line of treatment for the disease,&#xD;
One week after starting a new line of treatment for the disease,&#xD;
During treatment, at each radiological assessment (imaging scan) that will be done to check the status of the disease,&#xD;
At the time the disease worsens or relapses (comes back)&#xD;
During observation/follow-up, at the time of any radiological assessments that will be done to check the status of the disease</description>
