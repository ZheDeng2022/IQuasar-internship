  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab works with radiation therapy in treating&#xD;
      patients with urothelial bladder cancer that has spread from its original site of growth to&#xD;
      nearby tissues or lymph nodes and are ineligible for chemotherapy. Monoclonal antibodies,&#xD;
      such as nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;
      Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving&#xD;
      nivolumab and radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with urothelial bladder&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the 12-month rate of progression-free survival (PFS) achieved with the&#xD;
      combination of nivolumab, a programmed death (PD-1) inhibitor, and radiation therapy in&#xD;
      localized/locally advanced urothelial cancer patients, who are chemotherapy ineligible, to a&#xD;
      historical control reference 12-month PFS rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the toxicity of concurrent nivolumab and radiation therapy in urothelial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine overall response rate (ORR). III. To determine metastasis-free survival&#xD;
      (MFS). IV. To determine overall survival (OS). V. To evaluate the quality of life and bladder&#xD;
      functioning during and after the therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To explore the relationships of PD-1 expression, PDL-1 expression, and the Th1/Th2&#xD;
      cytokine ratio to clinical outcomes (response, PFS, MFS, and OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 14 days (2 weeks) for up to 14 courses (6 months) in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 3 days of course 1, patients undergo radiation therapy&#xD;
      over 32-35 on weeks 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 12 months.&#xD;

    <time_frame>From date of registration to date of first documented disease relapse/progression, or death from urothelial cancer whichever occurs first, assessed up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS distribution will be summarized with the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survivorship estimate. A graph of the K-M curve for PFS will be generated along with the Hall-Wellner 95% confidence band, and a display of the number of patients at risk at several time points, below the X-axis. Summary statistics (12-month PFS rate, median PFS, etc.) will be calculated from the K-M life table, each one with its respective 95% confidence interval (CI).</description>

    <measure>Overall response rate (ORR)</measure>

    <description>ORR will be estimated among the response evaluable patients and among all patients. Frequency distributions of best response will be generated for each of those sets of patients. The point estimate of the ORR will be computed, along with its 95% (Wilson type) CI.</description>

    <measure>Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The continuous markers (e.g., tumor infiltrating lymphocyte [TIL]s, Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio, etc.) will be summarized with standard descriptive statistics. These descriptive analyses of the serum markers will be performed for each time point at which the each marker is determined. Response (CR/PR vs not) will be modeled as a function of a dichotomized version of pre-study the continuous (ungrouped) markers (e.g., TILs from tissue, and the Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio from serum). The statistical goal of these exploratory analyses is to obtain the point and 95% CI estimates of the OR, and to simply determine the direction and approximate magnitude of these associations for use in planning a subsequent study. Censored PFS will be modeled as a function of a dichotomized version of the continuous (ungrouped) markers (e.g., TILs from tissue, and the Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio using Cox modelling strategy.</description>
