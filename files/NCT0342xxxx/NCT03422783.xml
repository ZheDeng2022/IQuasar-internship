    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the correlation between NoL index response to standardized stimulus&#xD;
      under general anesthesia and the post-operative pain, assessed by opioid consumption and&#xD;
      numerical pain scores after video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The NoL index, a nociception monitor using a multiparametric approach, has shown an excellent&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity in detecting noxious stimuli under general anesthesia. This&#xD;
      monitor is better than any other parameter in grading nociception under general anesthesia.&#xD;
      More recently, it has recently been shown a strong correlation between NoL index response to&#xD;
      nociceptive stimulus and the level of opioid analgesia during surgery. No study has evaluated&#xD;
      that NoL could predict post-operative pain so far. It has not yet been proven that NoL was&#xD;
      correlated with post-operative opioid consumption or with post-operative pain scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some phenotypic factors were previously shown to correlate with post-operative pain and&#xD;
      opioid consumption, such as psychological factors and tests, or also assessment of some&#xD;
      pre-operative nociceptive thresholds (NT). Pain catastrophizing was proven in several studies&#xD;
      to correlate with acute post-operative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, no study compared each of these preoperative psychological factors or nociceptif&#xD;
      thresholds to the NoL index response to intraoperative standardized pain stimulus in terms of&#xD;
      correlation with post-operative opioid requirements and pain scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, there is no study evaluating the pro-inflammatory protein profiles that might&#xD;
      likely be correlated to inter-individual differences in NoL response after this standardized&#xD;
      nociceptive stimulus under general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the level of correlation between NoL index response to standardized&#xD;
      stimulus under general anesthesia and the post-operative pain, assessed by opioid consumption&#xD;
      and numerical pain scores after video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS). It also evaluates the&#xD;
      correlation between NoL index response to standardized stimulus under general anesthesia and&#xD;
      pre-operative phenotype and post-operative pain biomarkers.&#xD;
