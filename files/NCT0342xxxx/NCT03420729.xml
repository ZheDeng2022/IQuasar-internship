  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dyspepsia is a common presenting complaint that doctors have to manage and this is true both&#xD;
      in the primary and secondary care setting. OGD is a useful test for investigating a variety&#xD;
      of suspected upper GI disorders including dyspepsia. However, it is uncomfortable for&#xD;
      patients and incurs the risk of intubation and sedation. Capsule endoscopy (CE) is the&#xD;
      investigation of choice for diseases of the small bowel. It is safe, non-invasive and well&#xD;
      tolerated, the main risk being capsule retention occurring in up to 1-2% of procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to undertake a prospective study comparing acceptability and&#xD;
      tolerability of MACE and OGD in the investigation of dyspepsia. Patients presenting to&#xD;
      general practice or the outpatients department with symptoms of dyspepsia who are referred&#xD;
      for investigation are invited to take part in the study. Patients will undergo MACE prior to&#xD;
      OGD performed by an endoscopist blinded to the MACE findings. . A comparison of tolerance and&#xD;
      acceptance of both procedures will be measured by means of using structured and validated,&#xD;
      qualitative questionnaires. The aim is to assess for whether there is a significant&#xD;
      difference between the perception and experience of both modalities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single blinded, comparative trial of patient acceptability and&#xD;
      tolerability of MACE and both transoral and transnasal gastroscopy in the investigation of&#xD;
      dyspepsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted within Sheffield Teaching Hospitals. Recruitment will take place&#xD;
      at the Sloan Medical Centre, the Royal Hallamshire Hospital or the Northern General Hospital&#xD;
      during the consultation when patients present with dyspepsia requiring gastroscopy for&#xD;
      investigation as per national guidelines. MACE will take place at the Sloan Medical Centre.&#xD;
      Equipment for collecting demographics (height, weight etc) will be available. All the capsule&#xD;
      equipment is stored and re-charged in this designated room. The case report files and&#xD;
      computer data will be stored in this room that is secured by a locked door.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastroscopy will take place in the Endoscopy Departments, which are specially designed units&#xD;
      for a variety of endoscopic tests, at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital and Northern General&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are assessed in the Sloan Medical Centre or the Royal Hallamshire Hospital/Northern&#xD;
      General Hospital outpatients department for their primary presenting complaints of dyspepsia.&#xD;
      The study will be discussed with patients in those who satisfy the enrolment criteria and&#xD;
      they will be provided by with the written study literature. If in agreement to enter the&#xD;
      study, informed written consent will be obtained from the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to any investigation, the pre-MACE section of the questionnaire will be completed by&#xD;
      the patient with the assistance of study team members. MACE will be performed at the Sloan&#xD;
      Medical Centre; this will be in a dedicated room setup to accommodate the MACE procedure.The&#xD;
      post-MACE section of the questionnaire will then be completed by the patient with the&#xD;
      assistance of study team members. MACE will be preceded by obtaining measurements of height,&#xD;
      weight and waist/hip circumference. The patient will then be given 500 to 1000mls of water&#xD;
      with 6 drops of simethicone added to drink. This is to enable adequate distension of the&#xD;
      stomach. Our previous study has shown excellent tolerance of this volume of water distension&#xD;
      by patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient then swallows the capsule in the presence of the PI. MACE of the oesophagus and&#xD;
      stomach will be carried out by the PI. Once the PI is satisfied that an adequate examination&#xD;
      has been completed the capsule will be allowed to pass into and through the small bowel.&#xD;
      Visibility of major locations of the stomach will be documented. Any pathology noted will be&#xD;
      recorded according to the standard fashion described for gastroscopy reporting. A note of the&#xD;
      procedure duration will be recorded. The patient will be given the option to complete their&#xD;
      small bowel capsule endoscopy in the standard way and this will be reported in the usual&#xD;
      fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients referred for gastroscopy as part of the normal pathway for investigation of&#xD;
      dyspepsia, will attend a designated list for their gastroscopy within 1 week and this will be&#xD;
      performed by a JAG accredited endoscopist who has experience in endoscopic therapy. TOG will&#xD;
      be performed using a standard 11mm Olympus or Pentax gastroscope and TNG will be performed&#xD;
      using an ultra-thin 5.9mm Olympus or Fujinon gastroscope. The endoscopist performing the&#xD;
      gastroscopy will be a member of the study team. The participant will be asked to complete the&#xD;
      pre-gastroscopy section of the participant questionnaire before, and the post-gastroscopy&#xD;
      section after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have 80mg simethicone mixed in 100mls of water as an anti-foaming agent prior&#xD;
      to the gastroscopy. Patients undergoing TNG will have their nasal passages prepared with a&#xD;
      fine mist of 5% lidocaine and 0.5% phenylephrine (co-phenylephrine nasal spray) which are a&#xD;
      local anaesthetic and nasal decongestant. Phenylephrine is a topical vasoconstrictor used as&#xD;
      a nasal decongestant to reduce the risk of peri-procedure epistaxis. Five minutes following&#xD;
      this, a 6mm diameter soft-sillicone catheter lubricated with 2% aqueous lidocaine gel is&#xD;
      inserted into either or each nasal passage approximately 5-8cm passages to ensure the passage&#xD;
      is wide enough to comfortably accommodate a nasal endoscopy. If neither passages accommodate&#xD;
      the silicone catheter, the procedure will be converted to a transoral route. Patients&#xD;
      undergoing TOG will have 10 sprays of 10% topical lidocaine administered to the oropharynx.&#xD;
      Procedures will be performed in the left lateral decubitus position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastroscopy will be performed in the standard fashion and reported to the PI to compose a&#xD;
      written record for study purposes. This reporting system (InfoFlex) requires details to be&#xD;
      entered regarding indication for examination, patient comfort, sedation and pathology.&#xD;
      Pathology will be documented in a standardised way (for further details see section on&#xD;
      Scientific Justification). An entry of the duration of procedure will be included. This&#xD;
      denotes the end of the participants' involvement in the study. The patient will be managed&#xD;
      thereafter according to the responsible clinician at the Sloan Medical Centre or Sheffield&#xD;
      Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be evaluated using the questionnaires to compare acceptability and&#xD;
      tolerance of both procedures.&#xD;
