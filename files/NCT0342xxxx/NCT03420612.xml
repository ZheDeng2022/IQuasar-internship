  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is the gold standard in the diagnosis and treatment colorectal disease, but due&#xD;
      to the uncomfortable or even painful procedure, a part of people unwilling to undergoing the&#xD;
      examination and giving analgesic agents were recommended in several guidelines. However, use&#xD;
      of analgesic agents have their own drawbacks, and nearly 70% patients felt no pain or only&#xD;
      mild discomfort with the unsedated colonoscopy, routine administration of sedative or&#xD;
      analgesic agents to all patients was considered as unnecessary. However, unsedated&#xD;
      colonoscopy was thought to be an option for some but not for all, therefore a method to&#xD;
      identify which patients at high risk for painful colonoscopy in preoperational stage is&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
