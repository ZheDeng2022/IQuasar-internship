      The objective of this study is to test two different operating modes of the latest version of&#xD;
      the Dose Safety artificial pancreas system (APS), the Dose Safety Controller (DSC version&#xD;
      2.3), in a population of subjects with type 1 diabetes (TID) in a hospital CRC setting. The&#xD;
      first mode is the Fully Automated Closed Loop (FACL) mode, in which all insulin delivery is&#xD;
      directed by the controller and the second mode is the Hybrid Closed Loop (HCL) mode, in which&#xD;
      insulin delivery is a hybrid between controller directed delivery and user directed insulin&#xD;
      delivery. There will be two study arms: HCL and FACL. No comparisons will be made between the&#xD;
      two arms.&#xD;

      3.1 Overview Two independent questions will be addressed in this study. For evaluation of the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of the hybrid closed loop (HCL), participants will use the hybrid closed&#xD;
      loop during and after a standardized meal on the clinical research center. For evaluation of&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of the fully automated closed loop (FACL), participants will use the&#xD;
      system for a 24 hour clinical research center stay incorporating meals and standardized&#xD;
      exercise. Safety and efficacy will be evaluated by descriptive outcomes including number of&#xD;
      completed studies and glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Eligibility. Participants will be recruited from the Diabetes Registry at the Benaroya&#xD;
      Research Institute. Eligibile participants may enroll in the HCL, the FACL, or both studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCL Study visit, Day 1 (~7 hours total): The below times are approximate and may be adjusted&#xD;
      to accommodate the CRC schedule. Prior to arrival at the CRC, participants will be asked to&#xD;
      eat their normal breakfast and take their usual amount of insulin based on BG and&#xD;
      carbohydrate content before 8am. Once at the CRC, participants will be able to drink water ad&#xD;
      lib, but no food other than the prescribed meals can be eaten, unless hypoglycemia&#xD;
      intervention is necessary. Participants will be required to check FSBG before the meal and&#xD;
      calibrate if the FSBG value varies by &gt;30% from CGM value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FACL Study visit, Day 1 (~ 23 hours total): The below times are approximate and may be&#xD;
      adjusted to accommodate the CRC schedule. Prior to arrival at the CRC, participants will be&#xD;
      asked to eat their normal breakfast and take their usual amount of insulin based on BG and&#xD;
      carbohydrate content before 8 am. Once arrived at the CRC, participants will be able to drink&#xD;
      water, but no food other than the prescribed meals can be eaten, unless hypoglycemia&#xD;
      intervention is necessary. Participants will be required to check FSBG before meals, at&#xD;
      bedtime and at 0300. They will calibrate if the FSBG value varies by &gt;30% from the CGM value.&#xD;
      They will calibrate the CGM every 12 hours as recommended by Dexcom.&#xD;
