      Medical device study for efficacy and tolerability of a HA gel in the management of teething&#xD;
      symptoms&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Due to the potential toxicity that can result from the use of topical anesthetics to relieve&#xD;
      the symptoms associated with gingival inflammatory conditions or gums trauma in infant,&#xD;
      recently, products containing Hyaluronic Acid (HA) have been marketed in Europe. In&#xD;
      particular, Bioplax Limited is developing several high molecular weight HA medical devices&#xD;
      characterized by the absence of preservatives, alcohol and dyes; therefore, the&#xD;
      administration of these products in infants is safe and can help creating a natural&#xD;
      protective layer on the gingival tissue. In previous clinical trials with these high&#xD;
      molecular weight HA medical devices it was noted a periodontal tissue/fluid balance with&#xD;
      accelerated healing and repair properties that could be of interest either for accelerating&#xD;
      the wound healing process or for treating the complex physical symptoms (i.e. soreness and&#xD;
      swelling of gums, crying, sleeplessness) related to the teething in infants. These data were&#xD;
      confirmed by a recent pilot study on 18 infants suffering by teething where the two&#xD;
      formulation of the tested high molecular weight HA medical device evidenced, at the end of&#xD;
      treatment period, a statistically significant reduction of pain, swelling, gingival rush,&#xD;
      hyper-salivation and redness, from baseline.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female infants aged between 3 and 36 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Teething diagnosed by the presence of at least 3 of the following clinical symptoms:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  pain&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  swelling&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  hyper-salivation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  redness&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  abnormal teeth depth.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. At the moment of inclusion no subcutaneous mucosal laceration must be yet appeared.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Infants and parents who are in a general position to follow all study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Informed consent form signed by parents or legal representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Infants in hospitalization and/or immobilization and/or confinement to bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Infants with known history of severe renal insufficiency and/or known history of&#xD;
             severe cardiac dysfunction and/or liver problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Use of topical oral Lidocaine, other topical oral anesthetic products and/or topical&#xD;
             Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) within one day before inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Use of systemic NSAIDs within 3 days before inclusion and/or use of systemic&#xD;
             anesthetics within 10 days before.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Concomitant use during the period of study of NSAIDs and/or any other anesthetics&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Subjects with known family history of allergic or adverse reactions to drugs or&#xD;
             substances.&#xD;
&#xD;
