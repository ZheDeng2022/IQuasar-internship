  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 3, multicenter, open-label study of chronic, intermittent use of study drug (DBF)&#xD;
      is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the buccal formulation of diazepam in&#xD;
      children, adolescents and adults with intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure&#xD;
      activity (eg, seizure clusters) that are distinct from the subject's usual seizure pattern.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of DBF (study&#xD;
      drug) administered a minimum of 3 times to subjects with epilepsy for the treatment of&#xD;
      seizures over a minimum 6-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the usability of study drug as assessed by the ability of&#xD;
           caregivers/subjects to administer study drug based on the Instructions for Use (IFU).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the Quality of Life (QoL) of the subjects during the study drug treatment&#xD;
           period as assessed by use of age-appropriate epilepsy scales over a minimum 6-month&#xD;
           period.&#xD;

             160326 within 30 days prior to Day 0. Participation in an observational&#xD;
             (non-interventional) study is not an exclusion, provided that there are no scheduling&#xD;
             conflicts with this study. Received any other investigational medication (unless it&#xD;
             can be documented that the subject received only placebo) or device within 8 weeks or&#xD;
             5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before assignment to study drug treatment&#xD;

             marijuana is or was used for medicinal indications in the opinion of the Investigator,&#xD;
             it is not considered as drug abuse and the subject can be enrolled in states where&#xD;
             medical marijuana use is legal, even if the marijuana metabolites in the urine&#xD;
