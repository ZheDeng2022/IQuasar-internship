  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypoxic cells in tumors have less oxygen than normal cells do, which leads to several changes&#xD;
      inside the cells that lead to genetic chages making these cells resistant to treatment. The&#xD;
      end result of this is increased tumor growth, spread of the tumor and poor outcome. Early&#xD;
      studies have shown that [131]I-IAZA scans can help detect if there are hypoxic cells in the&#xD;
      tumor. A [131]I-IAZA scan is a nuclear medicine test used to create pictures of the whole&#xD;
      body after [131]I-IAZA is injected into a vein. Further scientific research will help&#xD;
      understand how [131]I-IAZA is distributed throughout the body and how it can be used to treat&#xD;
      hypoxic tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demonstrate the safety of [131]I-IAZA&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To Determine the biodistribution and tumor avidity of [131]I-IAZA in patients with&#xD;
           locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the optimal imaging time of [131]I-IAZA SPECT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To collect data from imaging and plasma sampling for radiopharmacokinetic analysis of&#xD;
           [131]I-IAZA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine whole body dosimetry of [131]I-IAZA in selected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To evaluate tumor dosimetry of [131]I-IAZA in patients with positive uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To determine the radiation dose accrued in hypoxic tumors.&#xD;

      The proposed clinical trial will be a Phase I/II open-label, single site,&#xD;
      radiopharmacokinetic and radiodosimetric study in participants with locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic solid tumors. All participants will be administered oral potassium iodide tablets&#xD;
      to block radioactive iodine uptake in the thyroid. After administration of 185 MBq&#xD;
      [131]I-IAZA (range: 150 - 220 MBq), all participants will undergo a series of up to six whole&#xD;
      body planar scans on a dual headed gamma camera, and blood sampling for radiopharmacokinetic&#xD;
      evaluation. A single fecal sample will be collected for up to 5 participants 24 - 72 hours&#xD;
      post-injection, if possible, and assessed for total radioactivity. A safety evaluation will&#xD;
      be conducted on the first 10 consecutively enrolled participants (safety sub-group),&#xD;
      consisting of: Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) pre-injection and 6 weeks ±1 week&#xD;
      post-injection; vital signs pre-injection and after scans 3 and 4; haematology, and SMA-12&#xD;
      serum biochemistry profile pre-injection and after scans 3 and 4; and an AE assessment at&#xD;
      each imaging time point, up to 8 days post-injection. The safety evaluation for the remaining&#xD;
      participants will consist of an AE assessment at each imaging time point, up to 8 days&#xD;
      post-injection of [131]I-IAZA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiodosimetry of [131]I-IAZA in different tissues will be determined in the first 5&#xD;
      consecutively enrolled participants from the planar images and the measured radioactivity in&#xD;
      the fecal samples, if available. SPECT/CT imaging of the tumor(s) will be acquired at 19-36&#xD;
      hours post-injection for all the participants and will be used along with the planar images&#xD;
      to determine the radiodosimetry and pattern of dose distribution within the tumor(s).&#xD;
      Dosimetry data will be potentially correlated with the participants' health status, or other&#xD;
      relevant information, as applicable .&#xD;
