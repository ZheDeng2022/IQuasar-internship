  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      School-aged children in low and middle-income countries (LMIC) face significant challenges to&#xD;
      their health and development which contribute to poor academic achievement. Multi-component&#xD;
      comprehensive school health programs guided by the World Health Organization's (WHO) Health&#xD;
      Promoting Schools (HPS) framework have been shown to positively impact health outcomes. Such&#xD;
      programs are implemented widely throughout the world. However, in LMIC the scope and reach of&#xD;
      school health programs are limited by human resource constraints. A key challenge to&#xD;
      effective implementation has been the identification of effective delivery agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A potential alternative approach is to leverage existing community members as lay&#xD;
      fieldworkers for the delivery of school health promotion. Our hypothesis is that&#xD;
      lay-fieldworkers can effectively implement comprehensive school health programs in&#xD;
      resource-constrained primary schools. This hypothesis will be tested by retrospectively&#xD;
      analyzing data obtained during a 5-year pilot of a school health program (CHHIP) in rural&#xD;
      primary schools of the Darjeeling Himalayas of India.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Comprehensive Health and Hygiene Improvement Program (CHHIP) is an intense&#xD;
      multi-component comprehensive school health program. The content of the program is structured&#xD;
      around three reinforcing components: 1) health education, 2) basic primary health services,&#xD;
      and 3) a healthy school environment. This holistic approach is based on the WHO's Health&#xD;
      Promoting Schools framework and designed in accordance with the Indian National Rural Health&#xD;
      Mission's operational guidelines for the school health programme. Delivery of the program is&#xD;
      led by lay fieldworkers termed School Health Activists (SHAs). SHAs are existing community&#xD;
      members without formal background or certification. The SHAs serve as the primary delivery&#xD;
      agent for all components of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From 2012 to 2016, the CHHIP program was implemented by Darjeeling Prerna, an Indian&#xD;
      non-governmental organization, in the rural Darjeeling Himalayas, a region of the state of&#xD;
      West Bengal in India. The program was implemented in both low-cost private and government&#xD;
      primary schools. A convenience sample of 22 primary schools (13 government and 9 low-cost&#xD;
      private) was chosen by the project team. Program implementation occurred in 16 schools and&#xD;
      was led by 4 lay fieldworkers. The intervention was implemented as a community development&#xD;
      program with a rigorous evaluation component and all data was collected prospectively. This&#xD;
      research study was added post-hoc with data transmitted to the research team prior to any&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a mixed methods stepped-wedge cluster controlled evaluation. A&#xD;
      primary school will be a cluster and each step in the study will be a single academic year.&#xD;
      In accordance with guidelines for the design and evaluation of complex evaluations, this&#xD;
      study will couple process evaluation with that of definitive impact. The intervention will be&#xD;
      evaluated across three domains: outcomes, implementation, and mechanism of impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary impact outcome will be the incidence of diarrheal illness as assessed by 14-day&#xD;
      parental recall. A secondary outcome, health knowledge as assessed by pre and post-test, will&#xD;
      be utilized as a key mediator to assess for differential impact on mechanisms of impact.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be carried out as a comparison between the intervention and control&#xD;
      arms within the context of the stepped-wedge framework. The analysis will be based on&#xD;
      individual student-level data, with the unit of assignment (schools) included as a cluster&#xD;
      effect in the regression analysis. Exposures of interest will be explored for association&#xD;
      with the outcome in univariate analyses. Diarrheal incidence rate ratios will be calculated&#xD;
      via multivariable Poisson regression analysis and mean difference in health knowledge&#xD;
      post-test scores will be obtained using a multivariable linear mixed model. All P-values will&#xD;
      be 2-tailed and significance will be set at P&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study implementation, process outcomes will be obtained via a series of descriptive&#xD;
      analysis. Coverage rates for individual health interventions and performance evaluations&#xD;
      scores expressed as means and standard deviations will be obtained. In consultation with the&#xD;
      project team, the research study team will define benchmarks for reach and fidelity, prior to&#xD;
      analysis of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data will be integrated with quantitative data via a process of triangulation.&#xD;
      This data was obtained from parents and teachers in focus groups and lay fieldworkers in&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews. Coding and analysis of the qualitative data will begin with a&#xD;
      deductive coding method. Common themes, including important contrary opinions, will be&#xD;
      identified and illustrative quotes will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All quantitative analysis will be done in SPSS and qualitative analysis completed in CATMA.&#xD;
      The reporting and presentation of this trial will be in accordance with the Transparent&#xD;
      Reporting of Evaluations with Nonrandomized Designs (TREND) guidelines.&#xD;
