    <textblock>
      The study sets out to determine the effect of smartphone pedometers on the body mass of&#xD;
      overweight and obese clients at the general outpatient department, national hospital Abuja.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a synopsis of the proposed dissertation submitted to the West African College of&#xD;
      Physicians in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the part 11 Fellowship examination&#xD;
      of the faculty of Family Medicine.&#xD;

      3.1 Study Area The Hospital is a melting pot of referral cases, fresh cases, executive&#xD;
      patients and the masses alike and therefore gives a scout picture of the non-communicable&#xD;
      diseases situation in Nigeria. First contact to undifferentiated patients is offered in the&#xD;
      clinic. It is accredited by both the West African College of Physician and the National&#xD;
      Postgraduate Medical College of Nigeria for residency training in Family Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Study Population The study will be carried out among consenting adult overweight and&#xD;
      obese patients attending the GOPC of National Hospital Abuja.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Study Design This study is a Randomized Controlled Trial with parallel open label design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Duration of Study The study will be conducted over a period of 24 weeks with a lead in&#xD;
      period of 4 weeks for recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5 Minimum Sample Size Estimation The minimum sample size was calculated using the formula&#xD;
      for sample size estimation for tests between two independent means.&#xD;
&#xD;
      N = 2 s 2 (zcrit+ zpower)2 D2 Where N = Sample size estimate zcrit = critical value for alpha&#xD;
      (0.05 alpha has a zcrit of 1.960 zpower = value for 1-beta (80% power has a z of 0.842) s =&#xD;
      standard deviation D = the expected difference between the two means (i.e. the minimum&#xD;
      difference between the two means that will be considered clinically significant).&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a previous study that considered weight loss as the primary outcome in black women, the&#xD;
      standard deviation was 3.479 A difference in means of 1.44 kg is regarded as clinically&#xD;
      significant. Therefore, the sample size calculated for the weight variable in each arm of the&#xD;
      investigation will be; N = 2×3.42 (1.960+ 0.842)2/ 1.44 squared = 87.5 for each arm of the&#xD;
      study and a total of 176 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The minimum sample size for the study is therefore 176. Being a medium term duration study,&#xD;
      we assume a maximum attrition rate of 10%, the final sample size to recruit is 194, with 97&#xD;
      participants in each arm of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.7 Study Instruments and Tools The data capture form broadly consists of 6 sections and&#xD;
      incorporates the fundamental aspects of an obesity consultation clinic; Android phone&#xD;
      versions higher than 3.0 with a Pedometer app version 5.19 by tayutau which is a simple easy&#xD;
      to use pedometer application that measures steps for physical activity monitoring. It has&#xD;
      three modes that count the steps, the distance or the calories burnt. It has the advantage of&#xD;
      recording at least 2 months of daily step counts and can be evaluated at leisure in the&#xD;
      clinic. It also shows your average pace.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stadiometer: (By SECA; Vogel and Halke; made in Germany) will be used for height measurements&#xD;
      (cm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weighing Scale: (By SECA; Vogel and Halke; Made in Germany) will be used for weight&#xD;
      measurements (kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sphygmomanometer: (Dekamet Accoson Mercury Sphygmomanometer, Made in England). Calibrated in&#xD;
      mmHg from 0 - 300 mmHg; arm cuff size 22 - 32(cm); will be used for blood pressure&#xD;
      measurements (mmHg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tape rule measure: Flexible, non-stretchable tape measure (NEWEY, Made in Germany).&#xD;
      Calibrated in (cm), from 0 - 150, will be used for WC measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.8 Study Procedure 3.81 Research Assistants Four research assistants will be trained in the&#xD;
      research proceedings including the initial screening, inclusion and exclusion criteria. The&#xD;
      research assistants are also resident doctors who have basic experience in the management of&#xD;
      obese clients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.82 Screening for Eligibility Screening for eligibility will be conducted at the first visit&#xD;
      in the General Outpatient Clinic by 4 trained research assistants. The age of the prospective&#xD;
      participant, ownership of a pedometer capable phone, the Body Mass Index and a pass in the&#xD;
      Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PARQ) will be the minimum to proceed to the&#xD;
      randomization and study clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A &quot;Yes&quot; response to any question in the PARQ requires further evaluation and depending on&#xD;
      severity, may render a participant ineligible for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.83 Randomization and Allocation Concealment At the study clinic, eligible consenting&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to the two arms of the study. Allocation concealment will be&#xD;
      achieved by using opaque envelopes containing allocation color coded cards, white for 'UC'&#xD;
      and pink for 'SOME' will be used to execute random assignment to the two group. Under&#xD;
      supervision of a research assistant, participants will pick one of the envelopes before&#xD;
      proceeding to the consulting room without opening the envelope for enrollment. Allocation&#xD;
      ratio will be 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be achieved by having prospective participants pick color coded cards&#xD;
      before anthropometric examinations. After every pick, the envelopes will be reshuffled before&#xD;
      the next pick. The color coded cards will be stuck on the front inner cover of folders of all&#xD;
      participants to avoid confusion. They will be no formal blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.84 Aspects Common to Both Study Arms After signing the consent form, all eligible&#xD;
      participants will fill out a brief health-screening and qualification questionnaire within&#xD;
      the data capture form. Participants will all have the International Physical Activity&#xD;
      Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF) tools computed at the beginning to assess the level of&#xD;
      physical activity, at 8 weeks and at the end of the study (16 weeks) with results computed&#xD;
      into a continuous variable by the formula; Total MET/Min/week = [Walking METs × min × days] +&#xD;
      [Moderate METs × min × days] + [Vigorous METs × min × days] and finally grouped into&#xD;
      categorical variables of low, moderate and high physical activity levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be counseled using the 5A model and given an exercise prescription to&#xD;
      maintain for the duration of the study. They will be counseled on dietary modifications and&#xD;
      exercise plans. Basic lifestyle counseling will be in the form of a uniform lifestyle &quot;SERVE&quot;&#xD;
      advice slip modified from the one used by the Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein&#xD;
      College of Medicine and New York University School of Medicine as reported by Sheira Schlair,&#xD;
      Sarah Moore, Michelle McMacken, and Melanie Jay for both groups with the printed leaflets&#xD;
      given to participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be offered the routine care of their presenting complaint. Blood pressure&#xD;
      will be measured at the beginning, at 8 weeks and at 16 week using an Omron blood pressure&#xD;
      with appropriate cuffs. Baseline assessment will include anthropometric measurements - height&#xD;
      (measured in bare feet to nearest 0.5 cm using a stadiometer) at the beginning of the study&#xD;
      only, weight (measured to nearest 0.1 kg), waist and neck circumferences will be measured&#xD;
      using a flexible measuring tape between the middle of the bottom rib (close to the navel) and&#xD;
      iliac crest and recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm. These measurements will be taken at the&#xD;
      beginning, at 8 weeks and at the end of the 16 weeks. Participants' phone numbers will be&#xD;
      collated for bulk text message reminders of exercise prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.85 Aspects only Common to Intervention Group Only At this juncture, the balloted envelop&#xD;
      will be opened and if participants belong to the SOME group, they will now have the Pedometer&#xD;
      app installed on their smartphones and calibrated with a 100 step test for sensitivity. They&#xD;
      will be shown how to use the application and instructed to keep their phones handy, charged&#xD;
      and chart their step count and monitor the increment. They will be a step count record card&#xD;
      with targets in slow increments to 10,000 steps per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.86 Retention Efforts&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retention will be promoted by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examining and attempting to remove barriers (e.g., adjusting clinic hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Positive attitude and demeanor towards overweight and obesity with investigators&#xD;
           training in motivational methods and the sensitivity of obesity lingua. (Use &quot;weight&#xD;
           problem&quot; instead of &quot;obesity&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Give incentives such as educational materials and web links to keep participants active&#xD;
           and give them ownership of the problem. They will also be an incentivizing prize for the&#xD;
           best 5 completers of the trial in terms of weight outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The trial will make every effort to maintain contact with inactive participants via&#xD;
           phone, e-mail and text messaging to continue encouraging participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.87 Follow up, Monitoring and Evaluation They shall be at least two follow ups per&#xD;
      participant during which further evaluations and weight measurement of primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will be conducted. For comorbidities that require more frequent follow up, this will&#xD;
      be pursued to a logical conclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.9 Data Collection A pretested investigator administered data capture form will be used to&#xD;
      collect demographic data and baseline anthropometric and laboratory evaluation will be&#xD;
      conducted. participants will be given appropriate care and follow up. A further set of&#xD;
      evaluation will be obtained at 8 weeks and the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Ethical Consideration Approval to conduct the study has been obtained from the Research&#xD;
      Ethics Committee of the National Hospital, Abuja and the study shall be conducted based on&#xD;
      good clinical practice principles and in conformity with the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent shall be obtained from each participant. No participant will be&#xD;
      coerced. Welfare, rights and confidentiality shall be guaranteed for all participants. Only&#xD;
      serial numbers will be allocated to participants and their names will not be entered into the&#xD;
      data capture forms. However, phone numbers will be required for adequate follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consultations and physical examination will be done in privacy with participants' caregiver&#xD;
      or a chaperone in attendance during physical examination. Undue discomfort will be avoided.&#xD;
      The issues of weight will be discussed in a sensitive manner and local cultures will be&#xD;
      respected during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Data Analysis Data will be collected and collated in Microsoft Excel spreadsheet from&#xD;
      Windows Office Package Version 8. Data will then be exported and analyses will be conducted&#xD;
      using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20.0 for Windows software with a p&#xD;
      value of &lt;0.05 used to indicate statistically significant differences (V.20.0, 2010; SPSS,&#xD;
      Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). The data will be analyzed for normality and descriptively.&#xD;
      Data transformation will be conducted on data that are not normally distributed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics such as the mode, median, mean and standard deviation will be used to&#xD;
      analyze all demographic data and primary and secondary outcome variables. Independent t-tests&#xD;
      (for continuous data) and chi-square tests (for categorical data) will be used to compare at&#xD;
      baseline, the demographic and outcome variables between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-way repeated-measures analysis of covariance will be conducted to compare the effects of&#xD;
      using a pedometer on the primary outcome measure. The intention-to-treat principle (last&#xD;
      observation carried forward) will be used to handle missing data resulting from dropout. In&#xD;
      addition, an independent t-test will be used to compare the average physical activity level&#xD;
      between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4 Budget&#xD;
