  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is long-standing recognition that people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have&#xD;
      difficulty imitating others' actions; some investigators have highlighted impaired imitation&#xD;
      as being a core contributor to the development of autism. What is yet unknown is precisely&#xD;
      how imitation in children with ASD differs from that of typically developing peers.The&#xD;
      investigators have identified a task parameter that separates preserved from impaired gesture&#xD;
      imitation in ASD: children with ASD have difficulty imitating when the task requires two&#xD;
      separate movement elements be coordinated simultaneously. By contrast, imitation is&#xD;
      relatively preserved when movement elements are performed serially. The coordination of&#xD;
      simultaneous movements is a hallmark of actions performed in the real world. With an eye to&#xD;
      optimizing common therapies that depend heavily on imitation, the next step is to tease apart&#xD;
      where, in the chain from perception to action, the capacity limitation in simultaneous&#xD;
      processing lies. This study will be conducted in about two days and will involve imitating&#xD;
      gestures that are presented via video. In addition, an EEG will record the brain's electrical&#xD;
      activity during certain tasks to assess how the brain responds when the imitation task is&#xD;
      more or less difficult. Several other clinical and behavioral measures will also be used.&#xD;

      Visuo-motor imitation (VMI) impairments are central to the pathogenesis and affect the&#xD;
      treatment of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Therapies most commonly used to enhance social,&#xD;
      communicative, academic, adaptive and occupational function in individuals with ASD rely on&#xD;
      imitation, and impairments in VMI represent a bottleneck to the efficiency and efficacy of&#xD;
      these therapies. Furthermore, an influential psychological account suggests that imitation&#xD;
      impairments lead to the development of the ASD phenotype. By studying precisely how VMI is&#xD;
      impaired in ASD, it is possible both to enhance widespread therapies and possibly to alter&#xD;
      the course of the disorder itself. Unfortunately, researchers currently know little about the&#xD;
      precise nature of imitation impairments in ASD. Our laboratory has recently identified a&#xD;
      promising specific task parameter that separates preserved from impaired gesture imitation in&#xD;
      ASD: children with ASD have difficulty imitating when the task requires two separate movement&#xD;
      elements be coordinated simultaneously. By contrast, imitation is relatively preserved when&#xD;
      movement elements are performed serially. This finding has been subsequently validated in a&#xD;
      published study and again replicated in preliminary data. Coordination of simultaneous&#xD;
      movements is a hallmark of skills performed in the real world (shoe tying, eating with&#xD;
      knife-and-fork, driving, communicating with simultaneous verbal and gestural language). In&#xD;
      order to optimize common adaptive and social-communicative skill therapies, the next step is&#xD;
      to tease apart where, in the chain from perception to action, the capacity limitation in&#xD;
      simultaneous processing lies. To do this, the investigators propose a rigorous research plan&#xD;
      that encompasses three complementary experimental approaches: systematic psychophysics,&#xD;
      neuropsychological testing and EEG. The goal is to specifically dissect the contribution to&#xD;
      the simultaneity bottleneck in perceptual vs. motor processes using psychophysical control&#xD;
      experiments. Under the hypothesis that some children with ASD may have more perceptual&#xD;
      limitations and others may have more motor limitations, the investigators will assess&#xD;
      heterogeneity explicitly. It is then possible to relate perceptual and motor aspects of&#xD;
      simultaneous gesture VMI to validated neuropsychological tests of known clinical attentional&#xD;
      and perceptual deficits in ASD. Finally, in Aim 3, the investigators will directly&#xD;
      interrogate visual and motor networks. EEG measures of task-related activation are sensitive&#xD;
      to task load and can be differentially assessed in visual and motor networks. By assessing&#xD;
      deficient event-related modulation of EEG activity in visual or motor networks to&#xD;
      simultaneous (high-load) vs. serial (low-load) conditions, the investigators can pinpoint the&#xD;
      bottleneck. In addition to providing an approach that is complementary to the behavioral&#xD;
      measures of Aims 1 and 2, the results of the EEG study can pave the way for future biomarkers&#xD;
      and neurostimulation therapies.&#xD;

        uncomplicated brief febrile seizures), tumor, severe head injury, stroke, lesion, history&#xD;

&#xD;
        Excessive tactile sensitivity of the scalp&#xD;

&#xD;
        Chronic tics or other significant movement disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy (because of potential and unknown effects on brain function with respect to the&#xD;
        measures of this study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children will be excluded if they are in foster care. Parents may be the biological or&#xD;
        adoptive parent as long as they are the child's legal guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Parents of children in the study may not have a diagnosis of autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional eligibility criteria for each group are contained in the following sections:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Specific Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria for ASD Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) will be made conservatively using either the&#xD;
        Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), or the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule,&#xD;
        Second Edition (ADOS-2). If circumstances dictate that an ADOS-2 cannot be administered,&#xD;
        the Brief Observation of Symptoms of Autism (BOSA) will be administered in its place. The&#xD;
        ADOS-2 or BOSA will be performed by a psychology associate trained in its administration&#xD;
        and scoring. Children must meet diagnostic thresholds on these instruments, and the&#xD;
        diagnosis will be confirmed using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,&#xD;
        fifth edition (DSM-5), by a neurologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children may not have a history of known etiology for autism (e.g., fragile X syndrome,&#xD;
        Tuberous Sclerosis, phenylketonuria, congenital rubella) or history of documented&#xD;
        prenatal/perinatal insult, and they will show no evidence of meeting criteria for&#xD;
        additional psychiatric diagnoses including major depression, bipolar disorder, conduct&#xD;
        disorder, or adjustment disorder, based on maternal and child responses from the Kiddie&#xD;
        Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (K-SADS).&#xD;
        Subjects with comorbid anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder,&#xD;
        separation anxiety disorder, simple and social phobias, and obsessive-compulsive disorder&#xD;
        (OCD), will be allowed to participate since anxiety is common in ASD, and similar&#xD;
        repetitive repertoires resembling &quot;obsessive-compulsive behavior&quot; are components of the&#xD;
        diagnostic criteria for ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children with a comorbid diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) will&#xD;
        also be included due to the frequent rates of comorbidity with ASD. Children on stimulant&#xD;
        medication will have the medication held on the day of testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Specific Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria for Typically Developing (TD) Controls&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children will be included in the typically developing (TD) control group if they: (1) Do&#xD;
        not meet published cutoff criteria for ASD on the Social Responsiveness Scale, second&#xD;
        edition (SRS-2), (2) do not have a history of a developmental disorder or a psychiatric&#xD;
        disorder based on maternal and child responses from the K-SADS (excluding simple or social&#xD;
        phobia); and (3) are free of immediate family members (sibling, parent) with autism or&#xD;
        other pervasive developmental disorder.&#xD;
