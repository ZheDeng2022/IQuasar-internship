      This randomized comparative study aims to evaluate the satisfaction and quality of life of&#xD;
      patients using Cicaplast balm B5, versus Dexeryl, for the management of cutaneous toxicities&#xD;
      of iEGFR in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, cancers colorectal or pulmonary&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The arrival of new therapeutic strategies such as targeted therapies has led to real progress&#xD;
      in the treatment of cancers. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors and antibodies to epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor receptors (EGFR), or iEGFR, target one of the major pathways of tumor cell&#xD;
      proliferation. These treatments have demonstrated their interest in the treatment of certain&#xD;
      advanced solid malignant tumors (head and neck cancer, colorectal cancer, bronchial cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although having a much better tolerance profile than the &quot;classical&quot; cytotoxic treatments&#xD;
      used in the same indications, these treatments, however, have frequent cutaneous toxicities&#xD;
      that are inconvenient for patients. According to the molecules, they can affect 80 to 90% of&#xD;
      patients treated from the first weeks of treatment and to different degrees. They appear as&#xD;
      well in the skin (acneiform rash, erythema, desquamation, xerosis, pruritus) as skin&#xD;
      appendages (paronychia, alopecia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consequences of these adverse effects are significant, which may be at the origin of a&#xD;
      decrease in dose or even of a stop of anti-tumoral treatment inducing a reduction of the&#xD;
      expected clinical benefit. In addition, they represent for the patient a real source of&#xD;
      inconvenience and pain, which can impact the quality of life (choice of dress, feeling of&#xD;
      shame because of the appearance of the skin ...) and impact the adherence to iEGFR treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management includes first and foremost preventive measures: the use of moisturizing topicals&#xD;
      and dermatological soap-free surgras is recommended as soon as iEGFR treatment is initiated,&#xD;
      and preventive systemic treatment with cyclins (doxycycline 100 mg daily) is proposed for at&#xD;
      least 6 weeks and then reevaluated for skin toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of appearance of skin toxicities, it is initially prescribed in common practice a&#xD;
      topical such as Dexeryl (used in many hospitals as standard) or Cicaplast Balm B5 La Roche&#xD;
      Posay (used in current practice at Léon Bérard Center). In a second step, topical&#xD;
      corticosteroids are prescribed, depending on the grade of toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is, however, no validated argument in the literature to guide the choice of clinicians&#xD;
      to use either of these topics. Cicaplast balm B5 (antibacterial, repairing damaged skin,&#xD;
      moisturizing and relieving feelings of discomfort) would limit the aggravation of skin&#xD;
      toxicities and therefore the use of pharmacological measures, including topical&#xD;
      corticosteroids class 3 or 4 may long term, weaken the skin barrier even more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized comparative study aims to evaluate the satisfaction and quality of life of&#xD;
      patients using Cicaplast balm B5, versus Dexeryl, for the management of cutaneous toxicities&#xD;
      of iEGFR in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, cancers colorectal or pulmonary&#xD;
