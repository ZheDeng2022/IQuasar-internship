  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that following the loss of a single tooth, severe hard- and soft-tissue&#xD;
      alterations may take place within the affected site, resulting in a subsequent reduction of&#xD;
      both vertical and horizontal ridge dimensions, often not allowing neither appropiate pontic&#xD;
      fabrication nor correct placement of endosseous implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past 20 years, various surgical procedures, grouped under the term of &quot;alveolar&#xD;
      ridge preservation&quot; (ARP), have been introduced, aiming to maintain the existing soft and&#xD;
      hard tissue envelope as well as a stable ridge volume, simplifying subsequent treatment&#xD;
      procedures and optimizing functional and esthetic outcomes. They have been widely tested in&#xD;
      controlled and not controlled clinical studies with various materials and approaches, and a&#xD;
      number of recently published systematic reviews on this topic have confirmed the efficacy of&#xD;
      ARP in preventing post-extraction dimensional changes of alveolar ridges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After these procedures a minimum of four to six months must be awaited before implant&#xD;
      insertion can be performed, bringing the patient compromised comfort, function and aesthetics&#xD;
      and needing of a second surgical procedure for the implant placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental implant insertion at the time of tooth extraction (type I or immediate placement)&#xD;
      reduced the number of dental appointments, of surgeries required and the overall treatment&#xD;
      time. Nevertheless this surgical protocol does not provide predictable outcomes, since it may&#xD;
      contribute towards a more pronounced bone resorption during healing. Different anatomical&#xD;
      factors, as the thickness of the buccal bone wall and the dimension of the horizontal gap,&#xD;
      may influence the dimensional changes of the alveolar crest following immediate implant&#xD;
      placement. Such morphological changes could lead to negative esthetic complications, such as&#xD;
      marginal soft tissues recessions, especially when affecting the buccal side of maxillary&#xD;
      sites in patients with a high smile line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is unknown if immediate implant placement plus grafting materials and/or barrier membranes&#xD;
      could influence post-extraction dimensional changes of alveolar ridges. No consensus exists&#xD;
      on the need for bone augmentation simultaneously with immediate implant placement.&#xD;
      Furthermore, no human study has yet compared dimensional changes of both hard and soft&#xD;
      tissues after two different treatments: an alveolar ridge preservation technique for a&#xD;
      subsequent implant placement, and an alveolar ridge preservation technique with an immediate&#xD;
      implant placement.&#xD;

      Hypothesis/Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypotesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placing an immediate implant into a fresh extraction site plus a bone substitute filling and&#xD;
      a matrix covering could negatively modify the healing patterns and thus the tissue morphology&#xD;
      of the ridge site with regard to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical hard tissues dimensions (bone width and height, bone volume)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical soft tissues dimensions (soft tissues volume, keratinized tissues width and&#xD;
           thickness, muco-gingival junction position's modifications, gingival color and texture,)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placing an immediate implant into fresh extraction site plus a bone substitute filling and a&#xD;
      matrix covering could negatively influence tissue morphology of the preserved site with&#xD;
      regard to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical hard tissues dimensions (bone width and height, bone volume)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical soft tissues dimensions (soft tissues volume, keratinized tissues width and&#xD;
           thickness, muco-gingival junction position's modifications, gingival color and texture,)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim of this study is to evaluate the possible impact on hard and soft tissue&#xD;
      morphological changes of placing an immediate implant in post-extraction site treated by a&#xD;
      bone substitute filling and a matrix covering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim of this study is to compare hard and soft tissue morphological changes in a&#xD;
      spontaneous healed extraction site versus a fresh extraction site treated by immediate&#xD;
      implant placement plus a bone substitute filling and a matrix covering&#xD;
