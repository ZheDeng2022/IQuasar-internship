      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motor stereotypies are a movement disorder characterized by involuntary, repetitive, and&#xD;
           rhythmic movements. These movements have a predictable pattern and seem purposeful, but&#xD;
           they serve no obvious function, tend to be prolonged, and can be suppressed. Common&#xD;
           examples of motor stereotypies include hand waving, head nodding, and body rocking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers are interested in learning more about motor stereotypies. Many children with&#xD;
           autism and other developmental disorders tend to exhibit these behaviors, but normal&#xD;
           healthy children and even some adults have demonstrated motor stereotypies under certain&#xD;
           conditions (including boredom and stress). More research is needed to determine the&#xD;
           internal causes of and potential successful treatments for these behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To use electroencephalography (EEG) to study cerebral activity related to stereotypies in&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Children between 7 and 18 years of age who demonstrate stereotypy movements on a consistent&#xD;
      basis (at least 10 times a day for at least 4 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will require two visits to the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First visit: Outpatient screening visit to determine the child s eligibility for the&#xD;
           study, including questionnaires for parents/guardians and a medical assessment of the&#xD;
           stereotypies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second visit: Participating children will spend 1 day in a room at the NIH Clinical&#xD;
           Center Pediatric Day Hospital. During the visit, participants will wear a portable EEG&#xD;
           unit to measure brain activity. For the first hour of the visit, researchers will&#xD;
           perform movement tests to study the brain activity related to normal movements. For the&#xD;
           rest of the day, participants may play games, watch television or movies, read, or nap,&#xD;
           while continuing to wear the EEG to monitor brain activity related to the stereotypic&#xD;
           movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive a small amount of compensation for their time and&#xD;
           participation.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor stereotypy is a common movement disorder observed in children and adolescents but whose&#xD;
      pathophysiology is unknown. Therefore, our overall objective is to study cerebral activity&#xD;
      related to stereotypies. First, we want to define whether motor stereotypies are preceded by&#xD;
      a cortical potential, as it is observed before voluntary movements. We hypothesize that no&#xD;
      pre-movement potentials will precede the stereotypies. However, if a pre-movement potential&#xD;
      is observed, our secondary objective is to compare this potential to cortical potentials that&#xD;
      precede voluntary movements. We also aim to study cortical potentials preceding voluntary&#xD;
      movements in healthy children and to compare them with the potentials observed in children&#xD;
      with stereotypies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 children presenting with primary motor stereotypies and 12 healthy children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using 19 scalp electrodes, we will record the patients electroencephalographic (EEG) activity&#xD;
      for up to 8 hours during one day. The electromyographic (EMG) activity of the muscles&#xD;
      involved in the stereotypies will be recorded with surface EMG electrodes. Healthy children&#xD;
      will undergo an EEG for 2 hours. During this EEG recording, they will be asked to perform&#xD;
      arms movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes: latency and amplitude of both evoked and induced activity (cortical&#xD;
      potentials) related to motor stereotypies will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: latency and amplitude of evoked and induced activity related to voluntary&#xD;
      movements will be measured.&#xD;

        -  Population&#xD;
&#xD;
             12 children presenting with primary motor stereotypies will be recruited as well as 12&#xD;
             healthy children.&#xD;
