  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SRT2104 (2.0&#xD;
      g administered once daily for 28 days) and to examine the effects of SRT2104 (2.0 g&#xD;
      administered once daily for 28 days) on reversing vasomotor and fibrinolytic dysfunction in&#xD;
      both type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and otherwise healthy cigarette smokers in a fed&#xD;
      state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the effects of SRT2104 on the reduction of platelet activation&#xD;
      markers (platelet-monocyte aggregates), and to evaluate the effects of SRT2104 on platelet&#xD;
      and monocyte surface markers (P-selectin, CD11b), inflammatory markers (high sensitivity CRP,&#xD;
      IL-6, SAA, TNF-α and sCD40L), and markers of oxidative stress (urinary and plasma&#xD;
      F2-isoprostanes and nitrotyrosine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further goals of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of SRT2104 after a&#xD;
      single dose and multiple administrations in both type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and&#xD;
      otherwise healthy cigarette smokers in a fed state, and to explore the effects of SRT2104 on&#xD;
      potential biomarkers of activity for glucose control (HbA1c, glycated albumin and&#xD;
      fructosamine) and/or Sirt1 activation.&#xD;

      Single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, safety, activity, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) study of 2.0 g of SRT2104 administered orally once daily for 28&#xD;
      consecutive days to two different populations: type 2 diabetic (T2D) subjects on an existing,&#xD;
      stable, hypoglycemic regimen and otherwise healthy cigarette smokers (≥ 10cigarettes/day for&#xD;
      at least 1 year). Approximately 24 subjects with T2D and 24 otherwise healthy cigarette&#xD;
      smokers, aged 18-60 years, who fulfill the inclusion/exclusion criteria, will be enrolled in&#xD;
      this study to ensure at least 20 evaluable subjects per population are enrolled. Subjects&#xD;
      will be evenly stratified and randomized to receive SRT2104 2.0 g/day or placebo once daily&#xD;
      for 28 days. After 28 days, subjects will cross over to receive the other test article for&#xD;
      another 28 days of dosing, bringing the total dosing period to 56 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will sign the informed consent form at the screening visit (to occur within 21 days&#xD;
      of first dose of test article), and will undergo screening assessments to verify eligibility&#xD;
      for the study. If eligible and willing to participate, subjects will return to the clinic on&#xD;
      Days -1 and 1 for safety assessments, hematology and biochemistry measurements, platelet&#xD;
      monocyte aggregation (PMA) assessment, forearm venous occlusion plethysmography, pulse wave&#xD;
      analysis (PWA), pulse wave velocity (PWV) and PK sampling. The first dose of test article&#xD;
      will occur on Day 1 after eligibility has been confirmed. After each 28 day dosing period,&#xD;
      subjects will return on Day 28 and Day 56 for safety assessments, hematology and biochemistry&#xD;
      measurements, forearm plethysmography, PWA, PWV, and PK sampling. Subjects will return to the&#xD;
      clinic on Days 2, 15, 29, 43, and 57 for safety assessments and additional PK sampling.&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to complete a study drug diary on a daily basis for compliance and&#xD;
      adverse event (AE) monitoring (diabetic subjects will be required to monitor and record their&#xD;
      fasting blood glucose in the diary also). An End of Study visit will occur 14 days following&#xD;
      the final dose of SRT2104 or placebo on Day 70. A followup safety call will be made to each&#xD;
      subject 30 days following their final dose of SRT2104 or placebo (Day 86).&#xD;
