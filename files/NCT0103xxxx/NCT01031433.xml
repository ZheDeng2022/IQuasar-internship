      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The prevalence of cigarette smoking among individuals with schizophrenia is noticeably&#xD;
           higher than in the general population, and smoking cessation attempts frequently are&#xD;
           unsuccessful in this population. Little is known about the effects of cigarette/nicotine&#xD;
           craving in individuals with schizophrenia. Researchers are interested in learning more&#xD;
           about how craving affects people with schizophrenia and developing new ways to treat&#xD;
           cravings and improve the effectiveness of smoking cessation therapies and treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In recent years, virtual reality (VR) has been studied to determine whether it can be&#xD;
           used to induce craving by using life-like cue settings. VR cues involving cigarette use,&#xD;
           including images of cigarettes and scent cues of tobacco smoke, may be used to elicit&#xD;
           craving in smokers. Researchers are interested in learning more about how individuals&#xD;
           with schizophrenia respond to specific VR cues and settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the feasibility of using a contextual real-world paradigm using virtual&#xD;
           reality involving cigarette smoking in people with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine if virtual reality cues will elicit craving in smokers with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Current smokers (five or more cigarettes per day for at least 1 year) between 18 and 45&#xD;
      years of age who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will involve three sessions, with an initial screening visit, a test session,&#xD;
           and a follow-up session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening visit: Participants will be screened with a medical and psychiatric history,&#xD;
           and will answer questions about smoking history, current smoking habits and craving&#xD;
           patterns, and general anxiety levels. This session will also introduce participants to&#xD;
           the operation and use of the VR equipment. Participants who are comfortable using the VR&#xD;
           system will return within 2 days for the test session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test session: Participants will use the VR equipment to view neutral scenes and scenes&#xD;
           that are designed to elicit cravings for cigarettes. After viewing each scene,&#xD;
           participants will answer questions about their overall mood, anxiety levels, and any&#xD;
           cigarette cravings they may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up session: Participants will return 1 week after the VR session to answer&#xD;
           questions about mood, anxiety levels, and current smoking habits and craving patterns.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nicotine use is high in people with schizophrenia; however, interventions to aid in smoking&#xD;
      cessation have not been overwhelmingly successful. Craving, particularly situational craving,&#xD;
      is one reason people relapse. Craving paradigms in people with schizophrenia need to be&#xD;
      optimized in order to test new treatments on craving measures in this population. Thus, the&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and effects of virtual reality cues on&#xD;
      craving intensity for smoking in patients with schizophrenia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will enroll 25 smokers with a DSM IV diagnosis of schizophrenia with the goal of obtaining&#xD;
      a total of 16 completers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study uses a comparison-controlled, within-subject design. All subjects will undergo a&#xD;
      baseline assessment and acclimation period and then participate in an experimental condition&#xD;
      in which four cues will be presented in separate rooms in the VR program. These include two&#xD;
      smoking cues and two neutral cues in four different rooms. A follow up session for craving&#xD;
      and symptom assessments will occur one week after the experimental session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Cue trials the Cigarette Craving Visual Analogue Scale (CCVAS), a four-item scale,&#xD;
      and the Tobacco Craving Questionnaire-Short Form (TCQ-SF)will be administered to measure&#xD;
      cigarette craving during the virtual reality session. At the end of each of the 4 cues&#xD;
      (neutral, smoking cue with no interaction, smoking cue with interaction, neutral)&#xD;
      participants will be asked about craving. The CCVAS will be projected into the VR environment&#xD;
      and participants will respond via hand controller. To assess mood status, the Mood form will&#xD;
      also be administered at baseline as well as at the end of each of the 4 cues. Before and&#xD;
      after the experimental session participants will also be rated on the Brief Psychiatric&#xD;
      Rating Scale (BPRS), Schedule for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), side effects,&#xD;
      and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The Immersion Questionnaire and Imagery Realism&#xD;
      Presence Questionnaire (PQ) will be given at the conclusion of the experimental session.&#xD;
      During the experiment participants will be monitored for physiological reactivity (heart&#xD;
      rate, blood pressure, and skin conductance response) to cues of smoking as well as neutral&#xD;
      cues measured. Additionally, subjects will be assessed before and after the experimental&#xD;
      session&#xD;
