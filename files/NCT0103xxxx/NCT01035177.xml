    <textblock>
      Numerous geometric and bone mineral density (BMD) parameters can be derived from quantitative&#xD;
      computed tomography (QCT) images of the proximal femur analyzed using dedicated software. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to evaluate the contribution of QCT-image analysis to the prediction of&#xD;
      the osteoporotic hip fracture risk, as compared to the reference standard, namely, dual&#xD;
      energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis: For predicting osteoporotic hip fracture, findings from QCT images of the&#xD;
      proximal femur analyzed using dedicated software are superior over DXA measurements of&#xD;
      proximal femoral BMD.&#xD;

      Background Osteoporotic hip fractures exact an immense human and economic toll and therefore&#xD;
      constitute a major public health problem. Because their incidence increases exponentially&#xD;
      with age in both men and women, they will impose an increasing burden in the near future as&#xD;
      the population continues to age throughout the world. In addition to the direct costs of&#xD;
      fractures (hospitalisation and rehabilitation), the subsequent risks of death, functional&#xD;
      impairment, dependency, and institutionalization are increased as compared to same-age&#xD;
      individuals without fractures. Low BMD is the main risk factor for hip fracture and is&#xD;
      generally measured using DXA, which is the reference standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Our research project aims to identify QCT factors that predict osteoporotic hip&#xD;
      fracture. To this end, we will use image analysis software specially designed for proximal&#xD;
      femur evaluation to assess 3D QCT images of the proximal femur. Femoral BMD and geometry&#xD;
      parameters will be studied. This method has been validated experimentally. Our working&#xD;
      hypothesis is that it will prove superior over DXA (the reference standard) in predicting&#xD;
      osteoporotic Phip fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Originality&#xD;
&#xD;
      The QCT-image analysis method investigated in our study is original, as there are no&#xD;
      commercially available tools for measuring proximal femur BMD on QCT images. This original&#xD;
      method grew out of 6 years of work conducted jointly at the Medical Physics Institute of the&#xD;
      Erlangen University and the Experimental Radiology Laboratory of the LARIBOISIERE-St-Louis&#xD;
      Research and Training Unit. Advantages of our method include 3D evaluation of the hip (with&#xD;
      measurement of the true volumetric density), evaluation of both BMD and bone geometry, and&#xD;
      separate evaluations of cortical and trabecular bone. DXA produces 2D images of the hip,&#xD;
      spine, or wrist that neither provide geometric data (except projected neck length) nor allow&#xD;
      separate analysis of cortical and trabecular bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use a case-control design to investigate postmenopausal patients with hip fracture&#xD;
      and female age-matched controls without hip fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research project focusing on age-related bone changes is part of a multidisciplinary&#xD;
      effort conducted by rheumatologists, radiologists, gerontologists, and orthopaedic surgeons.&#xD;
      It will provide new information for understanding fracture pathogenesis and optimising&#xD;
      prevention strategies in high-risk populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design We will compare geometric and BMD parameters at the proximal femur in women with&#xD;
      PFF and in age-matched women without PFF. This is a multicenter case-control study with&#xD;
      direct individual benefit. A diagnostic benefit exists for both the cases and the controls,&#xD;
      who will undergo a thorough physical evaluation including routine screening for factors&#xD;
      suggesting secondary osteoporosis, BMD measurements, and identification of risk factors for&#xD;
      fractures (e.g., impaired balance) to allow planning of appropriate primary prevention&#xD;
      (controls) or secondary prevention (cases). The therapeutic benefit will lie in advice&#xD;
      regarding diet and lifestyle, calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and bisphosphonate&#xD;
      therapy, as indicated by bone mass measurement results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment procedure (see eligibility below)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with PFF&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients with PFF will be recruited at four centres:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the orthopaedic surgery department of the LARIBOISIERE Teaching Hospital (Prof L.&#xD;
                SEDEL and Prof. R. NIZARD)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the gerontology department at the Sainte-Périne hospital (Dr Roger)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the orthopaedic surgery department of the St-ANTOINE Teaching Hospital (Prof Alain&#xD;
                SAUTET)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the orthopaedic surgery department of the PANTIN Center (Dr Pascal BIZOT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Controls The controls will be recruited at the same four centres, either among patients&#xD;
           referred for the diagnosis and prevention of age-related bone loss or among patients&#xD;
           admitted for reasons other than hip fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures, investigations, and sample collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical data Age, height, weight, personal and familial medical history, smoking&#xD;
           status, corticosteroids, treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Laboratory tests We will assay serum vitamin D levels, which are often low in women&#xD;
           older than 65 years. All vitamin D assays for the study will be done in the same run&#xD;
           (laboratory headed by Prof. Launay, LARIBOISIERE Teaching Hospital).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Bone mineral density (DXA) BMD will be measured suing a LUNAR DPX-L machine (Madison,&#xD;
           USA). BMD measurement by DXA is the reference standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis&#xD;
           or osteopenia. BMD will be measured at the lumbar spine (L1 to L4) and proximal femur.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Quantitative computed tomography QCT allows for separate measurements in cortical and&#xD;
           trabecular bone. Cortical bone will be evaluated at the proximal femur, and both BMD and&#xD;
           geometry will be measured. In addition to parameters characterizing cortical bone, we&#xD;
           will measure cancellous bone BMD and geometry. The methodology and the study parameters&#xD;
           will vary according to the measurement site. When designing the investigation protocols,&#xD;
           we sought the best trade-off between minimum radiation exposure and maximum image&#xD;
           quality .&#xD;
