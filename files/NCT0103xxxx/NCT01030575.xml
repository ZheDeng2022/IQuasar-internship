  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial to measure changes in&#xD;
      blood and urine levels of inositol in premature infants at high risk for retinopathy of&#xD;
      prematurity (ROP) following repeated doses of inositol. Based on previous studies, the&#xD;
      premise is that maintaining inositol concentrations similar to those occurring naturally in&#xD;
      utero will reduce the rates of ROP and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants. The&#xD;
      objective is to evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety, and clinical outcomes of multiple doses of&#xD;
      three different dose amounts of myo-inositol (provided by Abbott Laboratories) in very low&#xD;
      birth weight premature infants. This study will enroll an estimated 96 infants at 17 NICHD&#xD;
      Neonatal Research Network sites. Infants will be randomly assigned to receive either 10 mg/kg&#xD;
      of 5% inositol, 40 mg/kg of 5% inositol, 80 mg/kg of 5% inositol, or 5% glucose given in the&#xD;
      same volumes and timings as the inositol dosage to maintain masking. Enrollees will receive&#xD;
      their assigned dose or placebo daily, starting within 72 hours of birth, and continuing until&#xD;
      they reach 34 weeks post-menstrual age, 10 weeks chronologic age, or until the time of&#xD;
      hospital discharge, whichever occurs first. The study drug will be administered first&#xD;
      intravenously; as the infants progress to full feeding, the drug will be given enterally&#xD;
      (orally or via feeding tube). Enrollees will be seen for a follow-up examination at 18-22&#xD;
      months corrected age. This pilot study is in preparation for a future Phase III multi-center&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is an abnormal growth of the blood vessels in the eye that&#xD;
      occurs primarily in very premature infants. Eye development occurs normally in the womb; in&#xD;
      infants born prematurely, however, the blood vessels must finish developing outside the&#xD;
      protective environment of the uterus. Retinopathy of prematurity (also known as retrolental&#xD;
      fibroplasia) is a leading cause of blindness and other vision impairments (myopia,&#xD;
      strabismus, and amblyopia) in children, both in developed and developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inositol is a naturally-occurring sugar alcohol produced by the fetus and placenta and is&#xD;
      present in high levels in fetal blood throughout pregnancy in humans and other animals. Serum&#xD;
      levels fall rapidly after birth, although this fall is moderated in infants who receive&#xD;
      breast milk or fortified formula. Two randomized trials have shown that intravenous inositol&#xD;
      supplementation in the first week significantly reduced death, bronchopulmonary dysplasia&#xD;
      (BPD), and retinopathy. One study of enteral supplements (given orally or via feeding tube)&#xD;
      was less convincing, but also supported reduction of retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will evaluate changes in blood and urine inositol levels (half-life&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics) of multiple doses of myo-inositol (provided by Abbott Laboratories, Abbott&#xD;
      Nutrition Division) given to very low birth weight infants. The premise is that maintaining&#xD;
      inositol concentrations similar to those occurring naturally in utero will reduce the rates&#xD;
      of retinopathy and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants. Results from this study&#xD;
      will be used to select the dose for a large multi-center trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, 17 NICHD Neonatal Research Network sites will enroll approximately 96 infants&#xD;
      at 12-72 hours of age. Enrolled infants will be randomly assigned to receive either 10mg/kg&#xD;
      of 5% inositol, 40 mg/kg of 5% inositol, 80 mg/kg of 5% inositol, or 5% glucose given in the&#xD;
      same volumes and timings as the inositol dosage to maintain masking. Inositol will be&#xD;
      administered intravenously until babies are feeding normally, at which time the same dose and&#xD;
      formulation will be administered enterally (orally or via feeding tube). Concentrations of&#xD;
      inositol will be measured in blood, urine, and milk received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratification: Recruitment will be stratified by gestational age into infants born at 23 0/7&#xD;
      to 26 6/7 weeks gestational age and infants born at 27 0/7 to 29 6/7 weeks gestational age.&#xD;
