  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to try to understand the biology of development of breast,&#xD;
      ovarian, fallopian tube, peritoneal or endometrial cancer from persons at high genetic risk&#xD;
      for these diseases. The influence of environmental factors on cancer development in&#xD;
      individuals and families will be studied. The efficacy of treatments for these diseases will&#xD;
      be evaluated.&#xD;

      1. To establish a demographic database to evaluate the efficacy of medical interventions in&#xD;
           patients and relatives who carry BRCA1 and 2 mutations and to compare these outcomes to&#xD;
           patients who do not carry a BRCA1 or 2 mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To obtain blood samples from patients who undergo genetic testing to a) evaluate the&#xD;
           incidence of genetic modifier polymorphisms involved in the development of cancer in&#xD;
           BRCA1 and 2 mutation carriers and to compare this incidence to non-BRCA 1 and 2&#xD;
           carriers. b) to understand the interaction of genetic modifiers and BRCA1 and 2 in the&#xD;
           development of cancer. c) to determine the effect of environmental influences on the&#xD;
           incidence of polymorphisms in genetic modifiers and on the penetrance of BRCA1 and 2&#xD;
           mutations by linking information from our demographic database to blood samples and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To obtain tumor tissue from BRCA1 and 2 carriers to utilize for gene expression studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To establish a cohort of sporadic breast cancer patients, or women with no family&#xD;
           history of cancer in a first degree relative, to serve as a comparison group to women&#xD;
           with strong family history of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To establish a cohort of healthy volunteers without personal or family history of cancer&#xD;
           to serve as a comparison group to women with sporadic and familial breast cancer.&#xD;
