      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and side effects of the&#xD;
      vorinostat, bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone investigational combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of these drugs - vorinostat, bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone, are approved by&#xD;
      the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration). They have not been approved in this combination&#xD;
      for use in your type of cancer or any other type of cancer. Vorinostat is approved for&#xD;
      treatment of patients with a different type of cancer (Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma). Bortezomib&#xD;
      is currently approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Lenalidomide is currently&#xD;
      approved for the treatment of certain types of myelodysplastic syndrome (another form of&#xD;
      cancer affecting the blood) and for use with dexamethasone for patients with multiple myeloma&#xD;
      who have received at least one prior therapy. Dexamethasone is commonly used, either alone,&#xD;
      or in combination with other drugs, to treat multiple myeloma.&#xD;

Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
After 8 courses, patients may receive maintenance therapy comprising lenalidomide by mouth once a day on days 1-21, dexamethasone by mouth once a day on days 1, 2, 8, and 9, and bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds or subcutaneously on days 1 and 8.
