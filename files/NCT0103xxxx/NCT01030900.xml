  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Studies conducted at the National Cancer Institute suggest that certain chemotherapy&#xD;
           drugs may be more effective if given by continuous infusion into the vein rather than by&#xD;
           the standard method of rapid intravenous injection. One combination of six chemotherapy&#xD;
           drugs, known as EPOCH-R, has had a high degree of effectiveness in people with certain&#xD;
           kinds of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recent evidence also indicates that the effects of chemotherapy may be improved by&#xD;
           combining the treatment with monoclonal antibodies, which are purified proteins that are&#xD;
           specially made to attach to foreign substances such as cancer cells. A monoclonal&#xD;
           antibody called campath (alemtuzumab) has been manufactured to attach to a protein&#xD;
           called CD52 that may target tumor cells or the surrounding inflammatory cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers are interested in developing new treatments for large B-cell lymphoma or&#xD;
           Hodgkin lymphoma that can best be treated with chemotherapy. This protocol is&#xD;
           specifically for people with diffuse large B-cell or Hodgkin lymphomas that have not&#xD;
           responded to standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test whether giving campath (alemtuzumab) in combination with continuous infusion&#xD;
      EPOCH-R chemotherapy will improve the outcome of lymphoma treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals 18 years of age and older who have large B-cell lymphoma or Hodgkin lymphoma&#xD;
      that has not responded well to standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the study, patients will receive standard EPOCH-R chemotherapy, which includes&#xD;
           the following drugs: etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,&#xD;
           and rituximab. The additional drug, campath, will be given by IV infusion on the first&#xD;
           day of treatment over several hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When the campath IV infusion and rituximab IV infusion are complete, the drugs&#xD;
           doxorubicin, etoposide, and vincristine will each be given by continuous IV infusion&#xD;
           over the next 4 days (that is, continuously for a total of 96 hours). Cyclophosphamide&#xD;
           will be given by IV infusion over several hours on Day 5. Prednisone will be given by&#xD;
           mouth twice each day for 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients may be given other drugs to treat the side effects of chemotherapy, to prevent&#xD;
           possible infections, and to improve white blood cell counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The campath-EPOCH-R therapy will be repeated every 21 days, as a cycle of therapy, for a&#xD;
           total of 6 cycles. Following the fourth and sixth treatment cycles (approximately weeks&#xD;
           12 and 18) of campath-EPOCH-R treatment, study researchers will perform blood tests and&#xD;
           CT/MRI scans on all patients to assess their response to the treatment.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two signatures of the microenvironment were recently identified that are predictive of&#xD;
      outcome in patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL treated with R-CHOP. These signatures, called&#xD;
      stromal 1 and stromal 2 , are associated with genes expressed by infiltrating mononuclear&#xD;
      cells. The stromal 2 signature, which includes genes associated with angiogenesis, is&#xD;
      predictive of an inferior outcome. Based on these observations, we are interested in&#xD;
      targeting the reactive cells in the microenvironment as a therapeutic strategy in patients&#xD;
      with relapsed and refractory DLBCL. Along the same principles, we are also including patients&#xD;
      with relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). The surrounding reactive cells around Hodgkin Reed&#xD;
      Sternberg (HRS) cells are now not thought to be bystander cells and they appear to provide&#xD;
      important survival signals to HRS cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CD52 is one such promising target that is highly expressed in most of these infiltrating&#xD;
           cells and on most DLBCL although not on HRS cells specifically. Anti-CD52 antibodies may&#xD;
           have therapeutic value by depleting reactive B and T cells, and monocytes from the&#xD;
           microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The dose of alemtuzumab in combination with DA-EPOCH is 30 mg IV, as determined by a&#xD;
           prior study done in patients with untreated peripheral T-cell lymphoma. The main&#xD;
           toxicities of this combination are myelosuppression and opportunistic infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An important component of this study will be to obtain tumor tissue for gene expression&#xD;
           profiling and to assess microenvironment signatures and look at other molecular&#xD;
           signatures and targets before treatment and in patients who progress and ultimately&#xD;
           correlate response and outcome with these various end-points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Assess response, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory DLBCL and Hodgkin Lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previously treated orrefractory classical large B-cell lymphomas, Grey-zone lymphoma and&#xD;
           Hodgkin lymphoma, including Lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma (LPHL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years with adequate organ functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIV negative and no active CNS lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive 30mg of Alemtuzumab on day 1 of therapy, followed by Rituximab on&#xD;
           day 1 and dose-adjusted EPOCH chemotherapy days 1-5, up to six cycles of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor biopsies will be done before treatment, after 1 cycle of therapy and at relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is anticipated that up to 10-15 patients per year may be enrolled onto this trial.&#xD;
           Thus, accrual of up to 52 patients is expected to require approximately 4-5 years.&#xD;

                  known cause); unless impairment due to organ involvement by lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Active symptomatic ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction or congestive heart&#xD;
             failure within the past year. If ECHO is obtained, the LVEF should exceed 40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. HIV positive, because of the unknown effects of combined therapy with chemotherapy and&#xD;
             an immunosuppressive agent on HIV progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Female subject of child-bearing potential not willing to use an acceptable method of&#xD;
             birth control (i.e. a hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine device, diaphragm with&#xD;
