    <textblock>
      The effect of acupuncture for postoperative pain control remains controversial. We therefore&#xD;
      studied the effects of electrical auricular acupuncture (AA) on postoperative opioid&#xD;
      consumption in a randomized, patient-blinded clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 female patients undergoing laparoscopy were included. Anaesthetized patients were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive AA (shen men, thalamus and one segmental organ-specific point) or&#xD;
      electrodes and electrical stimulation for 72 hours. Postoperatively patients received 1 g&#xD;
      paracetamol every 6 hours and additional piritramide on demand. A blinded observer obtained&#xD;
      the doses of piritramide and the visual analogue pain scores (VAS) at 0, 2, 24, 48, and 72&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was the aim of our study to find out, whether auricular acupuncture reduces postoperative&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;

      Postoperative pain treatment is a major issue in management of surgical patients. Goal of the&#xD;
      treatment is a maximal effect with minimal side effects. There are various treatment options,&#xD;
      including conventional pharmacological and complementary approaches. Acupuncture is a system&#xD;
      with an empirical basis, which has been used in the treatment for centuries. The mechanisms&#xD;
      can be partly explained in terms of endogenous pain inhibitory systems. Its use for pain&#xD;
      relief has been supported by clinical trials and this has facilitated its use in pain clinics&#xD;
      in most countries. Needle acupuncture and other forms of sensory stimulation produce similar&#xD;
      physiological changes in humans and mammals, e.g. rhythmic discharges in nerve fibres, and&#xD;
      the release of endogenous opioids. Besides acupuncture points located on &quot;meridians&quot; all over&#xD;
      the body acupuncture points are also described on the ear. The stimulation of acupuncture&#xD;
      points can be achieved by pressure, a mechanical action of needling, or electrical point&#xD;
      stimulation. In chronic pain treatment acupuncture has been found to be more effective than&#xD;
      other non-pharmacological therapies. Furthermore, continuous electrical stimulation of&#xD;
      auricular acupuncture points improves the treatment of chronic cervical pain patients.&#xD;
      Finally, acupuncture represents not only a therapeutically beneficial, but also a&#xD;
      cost-effective treatment option. Auricular acupuncture is also known to be effective in&#xD;
      treatment of acute postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to investigate in a randomized, prospective, double - blind, and&#xD;
      controlled design whether continuous electrical stimulation of auricular acupuncture points&#xD;
      results in reduction of postoperative pain.&#xD;

    <description>Patients in the acupuncture group received titan disposable needles (27-gauge, 3 mm length; Biegler GmbH, Mauerbach, Austria), which were inserted in the dominant ear at the following acupuncture points: shen men, thalamus and one segmental organ-specific point. Acupuncture points were identified by measuring skin resistance, using an electrical conductance meter (multipoint selection pen™, Biegler GmbH, Mauerbach, Austria). The needles were connected to the P-Stim™ device and received continuous low frequency electro acupuncture using P-Stim™ (constant current: 1 Hz biphasic, 2 mA) for 72 hours postoperatively. Acupuncture was performed by a specialist with 15 years experience in this technique.</description>
