  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if using the PEMFlex Solo II, a&#xD;
      high-resolution camera for positron emission tomography (PET) scan imaging, on an area of the&#xD;
      body that has, or is suspected to have cancer will give researchers the same or better&#xD;
      information about the disease compared to the images taken with a routine PET/computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will compare the images taken using the PEMFlex Solo II to the images taken&#xD;
      during your scheduled routine PET/CT scan, as well as any additional routine CT scan(s),&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan(s), and/or ultrasound image(s) you may have had within&#xD;
      the last 30 days or may have in the next 30 days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If you agree to take part in this study, right after your already scheduled routine PET/CT&#xD;
      scan is complete, a study staff member will take you to a separate imaging room located in&#xD;
      the same clinic area where your routine PET/CT scan was just performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will then sit in a chair as a study staff member positions the PEMFlex Solo II on either&#xD;
      side of your breast that has, or is suspected to have cancer. To take images using the&#xD;
      PEMFlex Solo II, the breast is placed between two flat panels on the scanning machine and&#xD;
      compressed (flattened). The position of the breast for this procedure is similar to getting a&#xD;
      mammogram, but the PEMFlex Solo II uses about 50% less force to compress the breast(s). The&#xD;
      compression will be repeated on the other breast if you are having scans of both breasts&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will take about 20 minutes to set up the PEMFlex Solo II and take the PET scan images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the PET scan images have been taken using the PEMFlex Solo II, your participation in&#xD;
      this study will be over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The PEMFlex Solo II is commercially available for PET scan&#xD;
      imaging of the breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 24 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
