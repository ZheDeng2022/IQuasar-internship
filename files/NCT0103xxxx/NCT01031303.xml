    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide further immunogenicity and safety information of&#xD;
      sanofi pasteur's DTacP-IPV combined vaccine (TETRAXIM™) as a booster dose during the 4th and&#xD;
      6th year of life in children that previously received in Study E2I34 (NCT 00255021), sanofi&#xD;
      pasteur DTacP-IPV// PRP~T vaccine (PENTAXIM™) as a three-dose primary and booster&#xD;
      vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess immunogenicity in terms of seroprotection rates (Diphtheria, Tetanus, Polio&#xD;
           types 1, 2 and 3) and seroconversion/vaccine response rates to acellular Pertussis&#xD;
           antigens (Pertussis toxoid [PT], Filamentous Haemagglutinin [FHA]) of sanofi pasteur's&#xD;
           DTacP-IPV (Tetraxim™) vaccine, one month after the booster dose given at 4 to 6 years of&#xD;
           age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the antibody persistence in terms of anti-pertussis antibody levels&#xD;
           (anti-PT, and -FHA) and in terms of seroprotection rates and GMTs for Diphtheria,&#xD;
           Tetanus, and Poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3, just before administration of the booster dose&#xD;
           (at Visit 1) in all subjects at 4-6 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess immunogenicity in terms of seroprotection rates (Diphtheria, Tetanus, Polio&#xD;
           types 1, 2 and 3) and seroconversion/ vaccine response rates to acellular Pertussis&#xD;
           antigens (PT, FHA) of sanofi pasteur's DTacP-IPV (Tetraxim™) vaccine, one month after&#xD;
           administration of the booster dose given at 4 to 6 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the safety after the booster dose of the study vaccine.&#xD;

      All participants that previously completed the three-dose primary and the booster&#xD;
      vaccinations in the study E2I34 (NCT 00255021) will be contacted to enroll in this study to&#xD;
      receive sanofi pasteur's DTacP IPV combined vaccine (Tetraxim™) at 4 to 6 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive the study vaccine [sanofi pasteur's DTacP-IPV vaccine (TETRAXIM™)]&#xD;
      at 4 to 6 years of age (at visit 1).&#xD;
