  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether albaconazole tablets and albaconazole&#xD;
      capsules (single 400mg dose) act in the body in the same way over a period of time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the bioavailability of the formulation used in earlier&#xD;
      clinical studies (albaconazole capsules) with the formulation intended for use in further&#xD;
      development (albaconazole tablets). The study is also designed to assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of a single oral dose of albaconazole tablets (400 mg), and assess the&#xD;
      bioequivalence of albaconazole tablets with albaconazole capsules.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of understanding and willing to provide signed and dated written voluntary&#xD;
             informed consent (and any local or national authorization requirements) before any&#xD;
             protocol specific procedures are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female aged from 18 to 45 years at time of consent and at time of first dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 30 kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to complete the study and to comply with study instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Free of clinically significant disease as determined by history, physical examination,&#xD;
             and laboratory testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is a non-smoker or ex-smoker. If a subject is an ex smoker, he/she must&#xD;
             not have used nicotine for at least 6 months before first dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The screening and baseline laboratory parameters must be within normal ranges unless&#xD;
             agreed as not clinically relevant by the principal investigator and the sponsor.&#xD;
             Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline&#xD;
             phosphatase, and total bilirubin values should be lower than 1.5 times the upper&#xD;
             normal limit at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject will have negative results for the following tests at screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hepatitis B core antibodies (HBcAc)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Anti-hepatitis C virus (Anti-HCV)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody test&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Urine drug screen&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually active females of childbearing potential participating in the study must&#xD;
             agree to use a medically acceptable method of contraception while receiving&#xD;
             protocol-assigned product and until 30 days following the last dose of the study&#xD;
             product. A woman of childbearing potential is defined as one who is biologically&#xD;
             capable of becoming pregnant; including perimenopausal women who are less than 2 years&#xD;
             from their last menses. Acceptable contraceptive methods include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hormonal contraception, including oral, injectable, or implantable methods&#xD;
                  started at least 2 months prior to screening. If hormonal contraception was&#xD;
                  started less than 2 months prior to screening, then a form of nonhormonal&#xD;
                  contraception should be added until the third continuous month of hormonal&#xD;
                  contraception has been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Two forms of reliable nonhormonal contraception, to include the use of either an&#xD;
                  intrauterine device plus a reliable barrier method or 2 reliable barrier methods.&#xD;
                  Reliable barrier methods include condoms or diaphragms. A cervical cap is also a&#xD;
                  reliable barrier method, provided that the female subject has never given birth&#xD;
                  naturally. The combined use of a condom and spermicide constitute 2 forms of&#xD;
                  acceptable nonhormonal contraception, provided that they are both used properly.&#xD;
                  The use of spermicide alone and the improper use of condoms are inferior methods&#xD;
                  of contraception. Subjects with surgical sterilization, including tubal&#xD;
                  sterilization or partner's vasectomy, must use a form of nonhormonal&#xD;
                  contraception. A barrier method or sterilization plus spermatocide are&#xD;
                  acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are not currently sexually active must agree to use a medically accepted&#xD;
             method of contraception should they become sexually active while participating in the&#xD;
             study. Male subjects and/or their partners must use a medically acceptable form of&#xD;
             contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female who is pregnant (positive pregnancy test), trying to become pregnant, or breast&#xD;
             feeding.&#xD;

             recreational drugs, or herbal products within 30 days of dosing, unless agreed as not&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Currently suffering from any disease or condition that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, may affect the evaluation of the study product or place the subject at&#xD;
             undue risk.&#xD;
