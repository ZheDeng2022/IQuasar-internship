      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Several studies of risk perception have demonstrated a common bias known as unrealistic&#xD;
           optimism, in which individuals feel they are less likely than other people to experience&#xD;
           unpleasant or harmful events in their lives, but more likely to experience pleasant or&#xD;
           beneficial events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous research has indicated that individuals with schizophrenia have less of a sense&#xD;
           of unrealistic optimism about adverse events than individuals without schizophrenia.&#xD;
           However, research on risk perception in schizophrenia is sparse, primarily reporting on&#xD;
           behaviors and decisions in the laboratory that likely are influenced by risk perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Risk perception among substance users may be viewed in two separate categories:&#xD;
           perception of vulnerability to adverse events and perception of vulnerability to&#xD;
           negative outcomes associated with substance use. Research in both areas has yielded&#xD;
           mixed results. Researchers are interested in studying the connections among&#xD;
           schizophrenia, addiction, and risk perception in order to develop better drug use&#xD;
           prevention and treatment programs for people with and without schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To compare unrealistic optimism bias in people with and without schizophrenia and/or drug&#xD;
      dependence, and its association with actual risky behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals between 18 and 64 years of age who fall into one of the following study&#xD;
           categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  diagnoses of both drug dependence (marijuana or cocaine) and&#xD;
           schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  diagnosis of drug dependence only (marijuana or cocaine)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  diagnosis of schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder only&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  healthy volunteers with no history of drug use or serious mental disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will require a single visit to the research center for a 5- to 6-hour session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete questionnaires on medical and behavioral history, complete&#xD;
           tests of thinking skills like memory and attention, complete a brief computerized&#xD;
           decision-making task, and answer questions about risk perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also provide urine samples and breath carbon monoxide measurements to&#xD;
           test for recent use of tobacco and other substances.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies of risk perception have demonstrated a common bias known as unrealistic&#xD;
      optimism', in which individuals feel they are less likely than other people to experience&#xD;
      unpleasant or harmful events in their lives, but more likely to experience pleasant or&#xD;
      beneficial events. In a previous study, we showed that unrealistic optimism about adverse&#xD;
      events in patients with schizophrenia was lower than in healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare unrealistic optimism bias in people with and without schizophrenia and/or drug&#xD;
      dependence, and its association with actual risky behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults with current diagnosis (DSM-IV criteria) of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder&#xD;
      (n = 24), with current drug dependence (cannabis or cocaine) (n = 24), with both&#xD;
      schizophrenia and drug dependence (n = 24), or healthy, non-drug-using controls (n = 24).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have a single study visit, at which their psychiatric and substance use&#xD;
      histories, current substance use (urine drug testing, expired breath CO), risk perception,&#xD;
      risk-taking/impulsivity, sensation-seeking, insight, history of risky behavior, and cognitive&#xD;
      function will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scores on Risk Perception Questionnaire, Balloon Analog Risk Task, short form self-report&#xD;
      assessments of risk perception, risk-taking/impulsivity and sensation-seeking, Revised Life&#xD;
      Orientation Scale, Self-Mastery Scale, Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire,&#xD;
      Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. South Oaks Gambling&#xD;
      Screen-Revised, NORC DSM-IV Screen for Gambling Problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no direct benefit to subjects from study participation. Future benefits to society&#xD;
      might be better understanding of risk perception biases associated with co-occurring&#xD;
      substance abuse and schizophrenia, leading to development of more effective prevention and&#xD;
      treatment programs and improved processes for obtaining informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study poses minimal risk to subjects, primarily boredom or anxiety from taking&#xD;
      questionnaires and psychological tests and embarrassment from giving an observed urine&#xD;
      specimen for drug testing.&#xD;

        -  Participants in three patient groups will have a current diagnosis of schizophrenia&#xD;
             (or schizoaffective disorder), drug dependence, or both. Healthy comparison&#xD;
             participants will be free of either diagnosis. Psychiatric diagnoses will be based on&#xD;
             DSM-IV criteria as determined by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID;&#xD;
             First et al 1997), which will be administered in either a computerized version or in&#xD;
             the standard interview format. Participants in all four groups will be 18-64 years&#xD;
             old, of either gender and of any race/ethnicity. Specific inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
             criteria for the participant groups are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Group 1: Drug dependence with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Inclusion: Drug dependence; schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Exclusions: mood disorder; obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Group 2: Drug dependence without schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Inclusion: Drug dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Exclusions: schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder; mood disorder; OCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Group 3: Schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder without drug dependence&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Inclusion: DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Exclusions: mood disorder; OCD; use of illegal drugs more than 3 times in the&#xD;
                  previous month.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Group 4: Healthy comparison participants&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Exclusions: Any DSM-IV Axis I diagnosis (except simple phobia); use of illegal&#xD;
                  drugs more than 3 times in the previous month.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Exclusions for all groups: History of neurological disease/condition (unrelated&#xD;
                  to schizophrenia or drug dependence) with ongoing cognitive sequelae; physical&#xD;
                  limitations (e.g., with hearing, vision or movement) that would prevent&#xD;
                  performance of computerized tasks; documented mental retardation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Substances of choice among drug-dependent participants (Groups 1 and 2) must be&#xD;
                  marijuana, cocaine or both (the commonest illegal drugs of abuse among patients&#xD;
                  with schizophrenia).&#xD;
