      RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy, such as proton beam radiation therapy, that&#xD;
      delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause&#xD;
      less damage to normal tissue in patients with retroperitoneal sarcoma. PURPOSE: This phase I&#xD;
      trial is studying the side effects and and best dose of proton beam radiation therapy in&#xD;
      treating patients with retroperitoneal sarcoma.&#xD;

      Detailed DescriptionPRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the feasibility and toxicity of proton radiotherapy for retroperitoneal&#xD;
      sarcomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the maximum safe proton radiotherapy dose for retroperitoneal sarcomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the maximally tolerated dose of proton radiotherapy for patients with&#xD;
      potentially resectable retroperitoneal sarcoma. (Pre-operative cohort) IV. To assess acute&#xD;
      side effects from irradiation using proton beam therapy and dose/volume constraints that are&#xD;
      derived from conventional radiotherapy. (Postoperative cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the clinical effectiveness of proton radiotherapy for retroperitoneal sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the long-term toxicity of proton radiotherapy to the abdomen and pelvis&#xD;
      region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To monitor for effects of proton treatment on tumor and normal tissues using&#xD;
      radiographic imaging (both cohorts) or ex-vivo analysis of tissue samples (preoperative&#xD;
      cohort only).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a histologic diagnosis of sarcoma in the&#xD;
             peritoneum/retroperitoneum/pelvis are eligible for this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have either radiographic(pre-operative) or pathologic (post-operative)&#xD;
             evidence of disease limited the peritoneum/retroperitoneum/pelvis without evidence of&#xD;
             peritoneal sarcomatosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For pre-operative cases, the patient must be considered operable/resectable as judged&#xD;
             by the attending surgeon (this is determined by an extensive radiographic and medical&#xD;
             evaluation that includes but is not limited to: CT Chest and Abdomen with contrast,&#xD;
             MRI/CT Brain and Medical/Cardiac Clearance)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should have an EGOC status of 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must sign a document that indicates that they are aware of the investigative&#xD;
             nature of the treatment of this protocol, and the potential benefits and risks&#xD;
             (patients unwilling or unable to sign informed consent are excluded from the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential as long as she agrees to use a recognized method of&#xD;
             birth control (e.g. oral contraceptive, IUD, condoms or other barrier methods etc.);&#xD;
             hysterectomy or menopause must be clinically documented&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior or simultaneous malignancies within the past two years (other than cutaneous&#xD;
             squamous or basal cell carcinoma, melanoma in situ or thyroid carcinoma)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women, women planning to become pregnant and women that are nursing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who experience surgical complications that prevent radiation from starting&#xD;
             for 5 months or more, unless there is evidence of gross residual disease&#xD;
