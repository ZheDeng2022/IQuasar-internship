      This phase I clinical trial studies the side effects and the best dose of azacitidine and&#xD;
      oxaliplatin in treating patients with advanced cancers that do not respond to treatment or&#xD;
      have returned after any platinum therapy. Azacitidine is designed to activate (turn on)&#xD;
      certain genes in cancer cells whose job is to fight tumors. Oxaliplatin is designed to block&#xD;
      the growth and spread of new cancer cells, eventually destroying them, by damaging their&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Giving azacitidine with oxaliplatin may kill more cancer cells&#xD;
      and may also reverse resistance to platinum-based drugs.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of 5-azacytidine (azacitidine) and oxaliplatin&#xD;
      combination regimen in patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory to any platinum compound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define 5-azacytidine and oxaliplatin pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. For patients treated in the expansion phase of this study: (a) to assess copper transport&#xD;
      protein (CTR1) score; (b) to assess changes in global DNA methylation; and (c) to measure&#xD;
      changes in oxaliplatin levels in tumor biopsies between pretreatment and day 12 of the first&#xD;
      cycle of 5-azacytidine plus oxaliplatin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To correlate results of the pharmacokinetic studies of 5-azacytidine and oxaliplatin with&#xD;
      changes in CTR1, changes in global DNA methylation and changes in oxaliplatin levels in&#xD;
      tissue biopsies of patients treated in the expansion phase of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive azacitidine IV over 15-30 minutes on days 1-5 and oxaliplatin IV over 2&#xD;
      hours on days 2-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
