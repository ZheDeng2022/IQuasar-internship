  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to test an intervention to increase patients' understanding of the causes,&#xD;
      consequences, and the rationale for treatment, of their hypertension (HTN), as a strategy for&#xD;
      increasing blood pressure (BP) control. The focus is on the interaction between a behavioral&#xD;
      intervention to reduce BP - home BP monitoring (HBPM) - and patient knowledge, which, we&#xD;
      propose, moderates the effect of the HBPM intervention. We hypothesize that patients who have&#xD;
      a better understanding of their illness and its prescribed treatment will be more adherent to&#xD;
      the treatment regimen, and thus will exhibit improved outcomes compared to those who have&#xD;
      been exposed to the same intervention, but who do not have a clear understanding of these&#xD;
      elements.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, more than 31% of adults in&#xD;
      the U.S. population have hypertension (HTN). HTN is a major risk factor for heart disease and&#xD;
      stroke, which are the 1st and 3rd leading causes of death in the U.S. and impose an enormous&#xD;
      financial and social burden on Americans with more than $352 billion spent in direct and&#xD;
      indirect costs. Behavioral interventions to control blood pressure (BP) have exhibited, on&#xD;
      average, positive but relatively modest effects on blood pressure control. We and others have&#xD;
      studied the effects of one such intervention - home BP monitoring - on BP control in&#xD;
      hypertensive patients, and found reliable, albeit modest effects. We have found similar&#xD;
      effects for another behavioral intervention, Motivational Interviewing, on BP control. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that the effects of such interventions will be augmented when accompanied by a&#xD;
      systematic approach to patient education concerning their illness and its treatment. The&#xD;
      literature suggests that patient education is &quot;necessary but not sufficient&quot;(an implicit&#xD;
      interaction) to produce behavioral changes; however, the &quot;necessary&quot; part tends to be ignored&#xD;
      by interventionalists. The implication of the interaction is that when patients lack the&#xD;
      necessary knowledge, any intervention is likely to be less effective (as any value multiplied&#xD;
      by zero - i.e., no knowledge - is zero). In spite of this, we have found no trials that have&#xD;
      tested the interaction between patient knowledge and a lifestyle or drug intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to test an intervention to increase patients' understanding of the causes,&#xD;
      consequences, and the rationale for treatment, of their HTN, as a strategy for increasing BP&#xD;
      control. The focus is on the interaction between a behavioral intervention to reduce BP -&#xD;
      home BP monitoring (HBPM) - and patient knowledge, which, we propose, moderates the effect of&#xD;
      the HBPM intervention. We hypothesize that patients who have a better understanding of their&#xD;
      illness and its prescribed treatment will be more adherent to the treatment regimen, and thus&#xD;
      will exhibit improved outcomes compared to those who have been exposed to the same&#xD;
      intervention, but who do not have a clear understanding of these elements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to pilot test the effect of the HBPM intervention using a 2 X 2 independent groups&#xD;
      randomized design, to allow us to compare the effects of Usual Care (UC) + Printed Materials&#xD;
      (PM) compared to Usual Care (UC) and Self-Paced Programmed Instruction (SPPI) compared to&#xD;
      Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (HBPM) + Printed Materials (PM) compared to Home Blood&#xD;
      Pressure Monitoring (HBPM) + Self-Paced Programmed Instruction (SPPI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary hypothesis is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decreased ABP at 3 months will be ordered thusly:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HBPM+SPPI &gt; HBPM+PM &gt; UC+SPPI &gt; UC+PM&#xD;
