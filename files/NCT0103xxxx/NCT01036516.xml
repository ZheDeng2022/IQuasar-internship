      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cues related to past drug use induce a particular pattern of brain activation, which has&#xD;
           been correlated with craving for cocaine in active cocaine abusers. Researchers are&#xD;
           interested in determining the role of the brain chemical dopamine in cue-elicited as&#xD;
           well as spontaneous craving for cocaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the role of dopamine in cocaine craving, researchers will use positron emission&#xD;
           tomography (PET) to compare the neural reactions of cocaine users with those of&#xD;
           non-substance-abusing healthy volunteers. Researchers hope that the data gathered from&#xD;
           this study will lead to the development of more effective anti-craving medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To clarify the role of dopamine in cue-elicited responses that contribute to cocaine&#xD;
           abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if PET results of this study differ with various means of administering PET&#xD;
           chemicals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals 21 to 44 years of age who are either current cocaine users (at least twice per&#xD;
      week) or healthy volunteers without a history of drug abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cocaine-using participants will enter the inpatient clinical research ward at the&#xD;
           National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Addiction Research Center for 2 nights before&#xD;
           the day of the study. In addition, these participants will stay overnight at NIDA the&#xD;
           evening after each PET session and will be discharged the following day. Cocaine-using&#xD;
           participants will be required to perform a balance test before the study to provide a&#xD;
           baseline response in case they require anti-anxiety medications to cope with the effects&#xD;
           of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control subjects will not be required to stay overnight and will arrive as outpatients&#xD;
           for the PET session. All participants will be required to abstain from alcohol and&#xD;
           caffeine consumption from midnight before each study session, and will not be permitted&#xD;
           to smoke on the day of testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  - On the day of the study, participants will undergo a practice session to set up the&#xD;
           PET scanning equipment. Following the practice session, participants will be shown video&#xD;
           recordings of images that are related to nature (e.g., seashells) or to drug abuse&#xD;
           (e.g., drug paraphernalia). Participant reactions will be studied through the PET&#xD;
           monitoring, and the study will be conducted in two separate PET sessions with a break in&#xD;
           between. Individuals in the cocaine-using group may receive anti-anxiety medication if&#xD;
           the stimulus cues increase anxiety related to cocaine craving.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Different groups of participants will receive different methods of PET chemical&#xD;
           administration, and researchers will compare these methods.&#xD;

      Cues related to past drug use induce a particular pattern of brain activation, which has been&#xD;
      correlated with craving for cocaine in active cocaine abusers. The proposed research is&#xD;
      designed to assess the role of dopamine in cue-elicited as well as spontaneous craving for&#xD;
      cocaine. Cocaine abusers and control subjects will be presented with a stimulus complex&#xD;
      related to drug abuse (cocaine cues: videotape depicting drug use, drug paraphernalia) or to&#xD;
      nature (neutral cues: videotape depicting items such as shells and pinecones). The effects of&#xD;
      each cue condition on striatal D2-like dopamine (DA) receptors and changes in intrasynaptic&#xD;
      dopamine will be measured by positron emission tomography (PET). The PET data will then be&#xD;
      correlated with subjective self-reports of mood, particularly measures of craving. These&#xD;
      results will be compared between the two subject groups. This research will help clarify the&#xD;
      role of dopamine in cue-elicited responses that contribute to cocaine abuse. Ultimately, the&#xD;
      results obtained may lead to the development of anti-craving medications.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Age: Subjects in both the cocaine abuser and control groups will be volunteers of&#xD;
                  either gender, aged 21 to 44 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. History of Drug Abuse: For the cocaine abuser group, regular current use of&#xD;
                  cocaine is required (at least twice per week) that has been ongoing for at least&#xD;
                  two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Psychiatric disease: DSM IV criteria will be used. No subject with a current axis I&#xD;
             diagnosis other than a substance abuse disorder will be allowed. No subject with a&#xD;
             lifetime history of a schizophrenic disorder will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of Drug Abuse: Cocaine users will be excluded if toxicology screen at the time&#xD;
             of obtaining informed consent is positive for any illicit drug other than cocaine.&#xD;
             Volunteers for the control group with any history of intravenous drug abuse or any&#xD;
             history of psychostimulant drug abuse will be excluded. Axis I diagnoses of substance&#xD;
             abuse disorders other than nicotine abuse and/or dependence will be exclusionary&#xD;
             criteria for volunteers in control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. CNS disease: Structural brain abnormalities (e.g., neoplasms, subarachnoid cysts),&#xD;
             cerebrovascular disease, infectious disease (e.g., abscess), history of other&#xD;
             neurological disease, or history of head trauma (defined as loss of consciousness &gt; 2&#xD;
             min or requiring hospitalization).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Cardiovascular disease: Advanced coronary artery disease, endocarditis or other&#xD;
             cardiac disease likely to result in cerebral embolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pulmonary disease: Significant obstructive pulmonary disease, tuberculosis, or&#xD;
             bronchospasm (asthma, emphysema, bronchitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Systemic disease: Endocrinopathies, renal or hepatic failure, or autoimmune disease&#xD;
             involving the CNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Miscellaneous: Hematocrit &lt; 35-36 (for women) or &lt; 39 (for men), prostatic hypertrophy&#xD;
             or chronic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Claustrophobia: Subjects will be questioned about their potential discomfort in being&#xD;
             in an enclosed space, such as a PET or MRI scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Because of the potentially harmful effects of radiation exposure to fetuses and&#xD;
             infants, female subjects who are pregnant, nursing, planning to become pregnant or who&#xD;
             do not show evidence of reliable birth control will be excluded from participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Arterial circulation to the hand: Evidence of inadequate patency of radial and ulnar&#xD;
             arteries, determined by either Doppler flow measurements or a positive Allen's test,&#xD;
             is an exclusionary criterion for insertion of an arterial catheter. Potential subjects&#xD;
             who do not have adequate arterial circulation in their hand but otherwise meet&#xD;
             criteria could be included in this study and have only venous blood samples drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Radiation exposure: Any subject who has had sufficient prior radiation exposure for&#xD;
             research purposes (i.e., apart from medical procedures for diagnostic or therapeutic&#xD;
             purposes) prior to beginning the study that exceeds 5.0 rem during the previous 12&#xD;
             months or 3.0 rem during the previous 3 months will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Other medication: Volunteers who are currently taking any psychoactive medication, or&#xD;
             are currently prescribed other drugs that affect central neurotransmitter systems,&#xD;
             will be excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. HIV positive individuals will be excluded because HIV infection and the development of&#xD;
             AIDS produces abnormalities in brain function, and in particular in the basal ganglia&#xD;
             (Rottenberg et al., 1987), where we propose to make measurements of [11C] raclopride&#xD;
             binding.&#xD;
