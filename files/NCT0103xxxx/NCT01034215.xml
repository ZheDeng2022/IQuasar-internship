      Global Objective: To improve quality of life and reduce stress for breast cancer survivors.&#xD;
      To address the late-term and long-term effects of breast cancer treatment, as defined by the&#xD;
      Institute of Medicine, including chemo brain, fatigue, sleep deprivation, stress, anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, and PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II Aims: (1) To demonstrate the clinical efficacy (i.e., improved quality of life,&#xD;
      stress reduction, participant satisfaction with product) of the &quot;Envision the Rhythms of&#xD;
      Life&quot; program and (2) to establish the technical merits of the program's distance-delivery&#xD;
      (videoconferencing hardware and software) and instructional technology (i.e., animations,&#xD;
      graphically enhanced PowerPoint instructional materials, full-color program manuals,&#xD;
      art-as-imagery, and audio-imagery). &quot;Envision the Rhythms of Life&quot; instructs breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors in the practice of individualized, emotionally supportive, and biologically&#xD;
      accurate imagery and consists of 5, 4-hour long, interactive classes and between-class&#xD;
      instructor support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instructional Options: Option 1 delivers the program technology (animations, PowerPoint,&#xD;
      manuals, art, audio-art) with instructor and participants in the same room. Option 2 delivers&#xD;
      the program at-a-distance, to a small group of, via videoconferencing software and camera&#xD;
      systems (Alaska and Seattle) to low, moderate or high bandwidth areas. Each option delivers&#xD;
      program three times (total of 45 participants for each option). A website portal provides all&#xD;
      program information and materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Method: Program will be delivered to 135 breast cancer survivors who have&#xD;
      completed conventional care (surgery, radiation, IV chemotherapy) for at least six weeks.&#xD;
      Differences in option 1 and 2 outcomes will be compared to each other and to controls;&#xD;
      combined outcomes of option 1 and 2 will be compared to controls; and waitlist control&#xD;
      outcomes will be compared to their extended baseline. Hypothesis: Options 1 and 2 will both&#xD;
      produce significantly better outcomes than waitlist control group.&#xD;

      DESCRIPTION: To improve quality of life and reduce stress for breast cancer survivors. Phase&#xD;
      II Aims: (1) To demonstrate the clinical efficacy (i.e., improved quality of life, stress&#xD;
      reduction, participant satisfaction with product) of the &quot;Envision the Rhythms of Life&quot;&#xD;
      program and (2) to establish the technical merits of the program's distance-delivery&#xD;
      (videoconferencing hardware and software) and instructional technology (i.e., animations,&#xD;
      graphically enhanced PowerPoint instructional materials, full-color program manuals,&#xD;
      art-as-imagery, and audio-imagery). &quot;Envision the Rhythms of Life&quot; instructs breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors in the practice of individualized, emotionally supportive, and biologically&#xD;
      accurate imagery and consists of 5, 3-hour long, interactive classes and between-class&#xD;
      instructor support. Instructional Options: Option 1 delivers the program technology&#xD;
      (animations, PowerPoint, manuals, art, audio-art) with instructor and 15 participants in the&#xD;
      same room. Option 2 delivers the program at-a-distance, to a small group of 15, via&#xD;
      videoconferencing software and camera systems (Alaska and Seattle) to low, moderate or high&#xD;
      bandwidth areas. Each option delivers program three times (total of 45 participants for each&#xD;
      option). A website portal provides all program information and materials. Design and Method:&#xD;
      Program will be delivered to 135 breast cancer survivors who have completed conventional care&#xD;
      (surgery, radiation, IV chemotherapy) for at least six weeks. Differences in option 1 and 2&#xD;
      outcomes will be compared to each other and to controls; combined outcomes of option 1 and 2&#xD;
      will be compared to controls; and waitlist control outcomes will be compared to their&#xD;
      extended baseline. Long-Term Objectives: This innovative project integrates technology with&#xD;
      bandwidth-sensitive multi-media conferencing strategies to deliver a virtual mind-body,&#xD;
      imagery intervention. The technology will allow seamless program delivery to interested&#xD;
      survivors across the country during Phase III. Instructional technology, designed per Phase I&#xD;
      participant feedback, will serve to 'jump-start' potent imagery practice and will optimize&#xD;
      clinical efficacy. Commercial application and survivor participation is not limited by&#xD;
      location, work schedule, or health status, addressing issues of barriers to access of care.&#xD;
      Although desirable, instructional options 1 and 2 do not require survivors to have computer&#xD;
      skills or internet access. The program is designed to be culturally sensitive and supports&#xD;
      individual spiritual practices. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This program addresses NCI and IOM&#xD;
      summary reports that call for individualized supportive care for cancer survivors suffering&#xD;
      disease-related distress. Changes in two disease-education program modules would allow the&#xD;
      program to be used as supportive therapy for other forms of cancer across the country.&#xD;
