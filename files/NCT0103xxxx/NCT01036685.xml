      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drugs of abuse have effects on mood, behavior, thinking, and decision making that may&#xD;
           encourage people to continue using them and make it difficult for them to stop.&#xD;
           Researchers who study these effects are interested in developing new tests to evaluate&#xD;
           how drugs and drug use affect different areas of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans allow researchers to study brain activity and&#xD;
           changes to brain function. When specific psychological tests are performed during&#xD;
           functional MRI (fMRI) scans, researchers can examine the effects of drug use on the&#xD;
           brain. By developing and testing new procedures for fMRI studies, more information can&#xD;
           be obtained on brain function and activity in drug-using and non-drug-using individuals,&#xD;
           and this information can help develop new treatments and therapies for substance abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the effects of newly developed psychological procedures to be performed during&#xD;
      fMRI scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers between 13 and 55 years of age who are willing to undergo MRI&#xD;
           scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both drug-using and non-drug-using individuals will be selected for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before the start of the study, participants will complete questionnaires about medical&#xD;
           and psychological history, and provide information about past or current drug use.&#xD;
           Researchers will introduce the tasks to be performed during the scanning session(s), and&#xD;
           will allow participants to practice the test either on a separate computer or on the&#xD;
           computer used during the MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the study, participants will be asked to do one or more tasks selected by the&#xD;
           researchers. The tasks will be performed on a computer in an MRI machine, and may&#xD;
           involve receiving rewards (such as money or sips of juice) for actions, memory and&#xD;
           reaction-time tests, or other tests that involve responding to instructions on the&#xD;
           screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive compensation for their participation in the study, including&#xD;
           hourly compensation for individual visits and lump-sum compensation for each MRI scan.&#xD;

      Objective: Drugs of abuse have cognitive and affective effects that may contribute to the&#xD;
      inception and maintenance of their use. In order to measure these effects, psychological&#xD;
      tests suitable for use both in and outside the fMRI scanner need to be developed and&#xD;
      validated. Thus, the objective of this protocol is to allow for the development, assessment&#xD;
      and refinement of cognitive and affective tasks and determination of their practical&#xD;
      feasibility and efficacy for both MRI and non-MRI application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design and piloting of psychological tests and fMRI tasks specifically designed for an&#xD;
      adolescent population allows the investigators to determine if the tests/tasks measure&#xD;
      theorized cognitive constructs and result in measurable and interpretable fMRI data in&#xD;
      adolescents. At this time, the protocol is not enrolling adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: This minimal-risk protocol will employ volunteer participants aged 18-55,&#xD;
      who must be generally healthy and male or non-pregnant female. In order to ensure&#xD;
      applicability to relevant groups, both drug and non-drug using volunteers as well as those&#xD;
      recruited from clinical populations will be used to validate task design and parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Participants may pilot tasks outside and/or inside the MRI scanner, depending on the&#xD;
      aspects of task development requiring verification. Tasks developed de novo will undergo both&#xD;
      steps. Modifications to previously published MRI tasks may require only one of the steps.&#xD;
      Task designs may also use transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied either on&#xD;
      the bench or in the MRI scanner.Upon their successful verification, specific experimental&#xD;
      manipulations will be performed under separate, hypothesis driven protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Our goal is to determine if the tasks developed reliably and appropriately&#xD;
      measure specific cognitive constructs and behaviors thought to be associated with specific&#xD;
      brain systems and, also if they yield measurable and interpretable fMRI results, and/or if&#xD;
      they are able to be combined with the application of tDCS.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Subjects must be between the ages of 18-55, be generally healthy and male or non-pregnant&#xD;
        female. (Please note that references to adults in this protocol refers to those age 18 and&#xD;
        older). There are two levels of inclusion and exclusion criteria; those applying to all&#xD;
        participants and those applying to MRI or tDCS phase participants only. In addition, some&#xD;
        criteria apply to specific populations in which tasks may be piloted. Participants will be&#xD;
        considered for one of eight categories: 379-bench-control, 379-bench-smoker,&#xD;
        379-bench-user, 379-bench-other-psych-diagnosis, 379-control, 379-smoker, 379-user,&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Male or female between the ages of 18-55.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. All subjects must be able to provide informed consent/assent. Additional criteria&#xD;
                  for specific populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. 379-smoker- daily smoker of tobacco cigarettes for at least one year&#xD;
                       (excluding quit attempts)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. 379-user- DSM-V substance use disorder on a substance other than nicotine.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    3. 379-other-psych-diagnosis- DSM-V disorder, stable and in treatment (i.e., no&#xD;
                       medication changes in the previous four weeks and a clearly identified&#xD;
                       treating psychiatrist).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Additional criteria for MRI phase participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Right-handed. Assessment tool: Edinburgh Handedness Inventory. Rationale: Left-handed&#xD;
        individuals may have lateralization of many brain functions that differ from right-handed&#xD;
        individuals who are the majority of the population. Therefore, inclusion of left-handed&#xD;
        individuals may add unwanted noise to imaging data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        C) Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Bench Only Phase (Does not require MRI. Task requires gathering of accurate behavioral&#xD;
        data).&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of neurological illnesses including but not limited to CVA, CNS tumor, head&#xD;
             trauma, MS or other demyelinating diseases, epilepsy, movement disorders, or migraine&#xD;
             in treatment. Assessment tool: phone screen and history and physical (H&amp;P). Rationale:&#xD;
             Neurological illnesses are likely to impair performance on the range of tasks to be&#xD;
             piloted under this protocol and may impair ability to tolerate the procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Current use of psychoactive medications unless required for the psychiatric disorder&#xD;
             for which participants in the 379-user and 379-other-psych-diagnosis subcategories are&#xD;
             being treated. Assessment tool: phone screen, H&amp;P, Triage, comprehensive urine&#xD;
             toxicology. Rationale: psychoactive medications are likely to alter performace on the&#xD;
             range of tasks to be piloted under this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Cognitive impairment. Assessment tool: self report of extended placement in special&#xD;
             education classes for learning problems, history of specific learning disability or&#xD;
             mental retardation. Rationale: Cognitive impairment is likely to impair performance on&#xD;
             the range of tasks to be piloted under this protocol and may impair ability to&#xD;
             tolerate the procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Current major mood, anxiety or psychotic disorder (unless task is being evaluated in a&#xD;
             specific clinical population). Assessment tool: self report, H&amp;P. Rationale: Current&#xD;
             major mood or psychotic disorders are likely to impair performance on the range of&#xD;
             tasks to be piloted under this protocol and may impair ability to tolerate the&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Non-English speaking. Assessment tool(s): self-report. Rationale: To include&#xD;
             non-English speakers, we would have to translate the consent and other study documents&#xD;
             and hire and train bilingual staff, which would require resources that we do not have&#xD;
             and could not&#xD;
&#xD;
             justify given the small sample size for each experiment. Additionally, the data&#xD;
             integrity of some of the cognitive tasks and standardized questionnaires used in this&#xD;
             study would be compromised as they have only been validated in English. Most&#xD;
             importantly, ongoing&#xD;
&#xD;
             communication regarding safety procedures is necessary when participants are&#xD;
             undergoing study procedures. The inability to effectively communicate safety&#xD;
             procedures in a language other than English could compromise the safety of non-English&#xD;
             speaking participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Suspected or confirmed acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assessment tool: 2019 Novel&#xD;
             Coronavirus (COVID-19) patient screening tool administered by phone prior to&#xD;
             participant arrival. The current version of the screening tool to be used is available&#xD;
             at http://intranet.cc.nih.gov/hospitalepidemiology/emerging_infectious_diseases.html).&#xD;
             Viral testing looking for SARS-CoV-2 in a specimen deemed appropriate by NIH such as&#xD;
             nasopharyngeal or mid-turbinate swab. We reserve the right to change the specimen type&#xD;
             as NIH approves new test procedures. This test may be carried out in-house at NIDA,&#xD;
             NIH, at a community testing site or through a commercial vendor. Anyone with a&#xD;
             positive symptom screen without a clear alternative explanation or a positive viral&#xD;
             test will be excluded until they recover or (for asymptomatic cases) are no longer&#xD;
             infectious. Additionally, participants will be asked about any lingering neurological&#xD;
             and psychiatric symptoms such as difficulty with memory or concentration, changes in&#xD;
             mood or new anxiety symptoms that may be a result of COVID-19 exposure. The MAI will&#xD;
             evaluate any lingering symptoms to determine whether the potential impact on data is&#xD;
             compatible with continuing in the study. The MAI will also retain the ability to&#xD;
             exclude for a suspicious symptom screen without positive viral test. Rationale:&#xD;
             Covid-19 is extremely infectious and can have serious consequences. Allowing&#xD;
             participants with acute infection would alter the risk:benefit ratio for non-treatment&#xD;
             studies without a primary focus on SARS-CoV-2 to an unacceptable level of risk. In&#xD;
             addition, Covid-19 can have cognitive consequences which would add unnecessary noise&#xD;
             to the study data. Screening and testing will continue as long as public health&#xD;
             officials and/or NIDA medical personnel deem it appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Additional criteria for MRI Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Pregnancy. Assessment tool: Urine pregnancy test. Rationale: Since the hormonal&#xD;
             changes of pregnancy have been shown to have an impact on cognitive functioning and&#xD;
             the tasks we are developing may yield only subtle differences between control and drug&#xD;
             abusing subjects, we need to minimize any extraneous variation in the pilot data.&#xD;
             Additionally, fMRI is not accepted as a safe procedure purely for research purposes&#xD;
             during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Deep vein thrombosis: Assessment tool: self report during H&amp;P of thrombosis, or a&#xD;
             medical condition that may lead to a hypercoagulable state Rationale: Lying still for&#xD;
             &gt;2 hours may be a risk for the development of DVT in persons with certain medical&#xD;
             conditions. As such, persons with will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. HIV positive individuals. Assessment tool: oral HIV test with serum confirmation of&#xD;
             positive results. Rationale: potential for cognitive and/or other CNS disease that&#xD;
             makes performing cognitive tasks non-reliable and /or non generalizeable to the&#xD;
             general population. Also, potential liver/metabolic/vascular disease can interfere&#xD;
             with the physiological transduction mechanisms for fMRI (i.e. making the measurement&#xD;
             unreliable).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Unable to undergo MRI scanning due to possible pregnancy, metallic devices in the&#xD;
             body, claustrophobia or body morphometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Currently using respiratory, cardiovascular or anticonvulsant medications that may&#xD;
             interfere with the BOLD MRI signal.&#xD;
