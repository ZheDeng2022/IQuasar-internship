      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have allowed&#xD;
      researchers to map and study how the brain works when at rest and when engaged in specific&#xD;
      tasks. MRI scans have provided more information about how drugs affect the brain, and about&#xD;
      how drug addiction changes the brain and influences behavior, mood, and thinking processes.&#xD;
      To better understand the underlying mechanism of drug addiction and to develop strategies for&#xD;
      more effective treatment, researchers are interested in developing new MRI techniques to&#xD;
      study the effects of addiction on the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To develop new functional and structural MRI techniques, and to evaluate their potential&#xD;
      use in brain imaging studies related to addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals between 18 and 55 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may be smokers or nonsmokers, and may use drugs or not use drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the initial screening, participants will complete questionnaires about family and&#xD;
           personal history, drug use, and other information as required by the researchers.&#xD;
           Participants who will be asked to complete tasks during the MRI scan will be shown how&#xD;
           to perform these tasks before the scanning session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before each study session, participants may be asked to complete some or all of the&#xD;
           following: questions about their drug use during the last week, a breathalyzer test, a&#xD;
           urine drug-use assessment, a urine pregnancy test, or a measure of carbon monoxide.&#xD;
           Participants will also provide blood samples before the start of the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For each scanning session, participants will have an MRI scan that will last&#xD;
           approximately 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI scans may include injections with a contrast agent to study brain function, specific&#xD;
           tasks to be performed during the scan, or an experiment that studies the brain's&#xD;
           response to carbon dioxide.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging techniques have proven essential for&#xD;
      noninvasive mapping of brain physiology and pathology. The primary objective of this protocol&#xD;
      is to develop advanced magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy (MRI and MRS) techniques&#xD;
      for neuroimaging studies related to addiction. These neuroimaging techniques will be used in&#xD;
      other studies to better understand the underlying mechanism of drug addiction and to&#xD;
      potentially develop strategies for more effective treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy controls and drug users will participate in the study. Technical developments of&#xD;
      MRI/MRS will be performed on healthy controls, while the evaluation of the applicability of&#xD;
      these techniques to addiction related neuroimaging studies will be performed using drug users&#xD;
      and healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the fundamental principle of the biophysical transduction of physiological signals&#xD;
      to magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and spectroscopic signals, advanced techniques will be&#xD;
      developed to measure the activity, metabolism, structure, and biochemistry of the brain. The&#xD;
      development of these techniques typically includes the following steps: 1) proof-of-concept&#xD;
      computer simulations, 2) implementation of the imaging concept with an MRI scanner and&#xD;
      phantoms, 3) feasibility testing on control subjects, and 4) evaluation of the sensitivity&#xD;
      and specificity of these techniques in detecting functional changes modulated by task&#xD;
      performance, contrast agent injection, CO2 administration, CO2 administration, or&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation evaluation of these techniques in detecting functional&#xD;
      and/or structural alterations of the brain related to a specific disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advanced neuroimaging techniques developed from this protocol will demonstrate the ability to&#xD;
      distinguish between drug using and control populations. Successful techniques will then be&#xD;
      incorporated into hypothesis driven studies in the Neuroimaging Research Branch at NIDA-IRP.&#xD;
      These techniques will also be useful, through publications and technology transfer, to the&#xD;
      entire neuroimaging society.&#xD;

             non-pregnant female. Smokers, non-smokers, drug using and non-drug using populations&#xD;
             will participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        General:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and non-pregnant female adults between the ages of 18-55.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects must be able to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be excluded if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are pregnant. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed on all female volunteers of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential before each experimental session.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are unable to undergo MRI scanning due to implanted metallic devices (cardiac&#xD;
             pacemaker or neurostimulator, some artificial joints, metal pins, surgical clips or&#xD;
             other implanted metal parts including Copper 7 IUD) or claustrophobia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are unable to safely undergo TMS stimulation due to having epilepsy or being at high&#xD;
             risk for a seizure, being sleep deprived, having a history of unexplained fainting,&#xD;
             recurrent severe headaches, significant head injury, having undergone a neurosurgical&#xD;
             procedure, having metal in the head, having hearing problems or ringing in the ears or&#xD;
             implanted medical devices that could malfunction under TMS stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have major medical illnesses to include, but not limited to, hypertension,&#xD;
             cardiovascular disease, asthma, diabetes, peripheral vascular diseases,&#xD;
             coagulopathies, syncope, history of superficial or deep vein thrombosis, HIV, or other&#xD;
             clinically significant infectious diseases that may alter the signal being measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have current major psychiatric disorders to include, but not limited to, mood,&#xD;
             anxiety, psychotic disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have neurological illnesses including, but not limited to, seizure disorders,&#xD;
             migraine, multiple sclerosis, movement disorders, or history of head trauma, CVA, CNS&#xD;
             tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have cognitive impairment as assessed by screening WASI vocabulary subtest below 48,&#xD;
             corresponding to full IQ of 85 (in that case on screening, a full WASI will be done to&#xD;
             verify IQ of 85 or above).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to comply with task demands.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suspected or confirmed active SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assessment tool: 2019 Novel&#xD;
             Coronavirus (COVID-19) patient screening tool administered by phone prior to&#xD;
             participant arrival. The current version of the screening tool to be used is available&#xD;
             at http://intranet.cc.nih.gov/hospitalepidemiology/emerging_infectious_diseases.html).&#xD;
             Viral testing looking for SARS-CoV-2 in a specimen deemed appropriate by NIH (such as&#xD;
             nasopharyngeal or mid-turbinate swab) may also be completed. We reserve the right to&#xD;
             change the specimen type as NIH approves new test procedures. This test may be carried&#xD;
             out in-house at NIDA, NIH, at a community testing site or through a commercial vendor.&#xD;
             Anyone with a positive symptom screen without a clear alternative explanation or a&#xD;
             positive viral test will be excluded until they recover or (for asymptomatic cases)&#xD;
             are no longer infectious. MAI will also retain the ability to exclude for a suspicious&#xD;
             symptom screen without positive viral test. Justification: COVID-19 is extremely&#xD;
             infectious and can have serious consequences. Allowing participants with active&#xD;
             infection would alter the risk:benefit ratio for non-treatment studies without a&#xD;
             primary focus on SARS-CoV-2 to an unacceptable level of risk. In addition, COVID-19&#xD;
             can have cognitive consequences which would add unnecessary noise to the study data.&#xD;
             Testing will continue as long as public health officials and/or NIDA medical personnel&#xD;
             deem it appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional exclusions for some experiments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Based on the scientific and medical requirements of the particular experiment, participants&#xD;
        may also be excluded for:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  left-handedness (if using a cognitive or affective task),&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  color-blindness (if using a task requiring color discrimination),&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  drug use diagnosis (if a technique is being validated in a non-drug using population),&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  renal insufficiency (if contrast agents are to be used), as determined by estimated&#xD;
             glomerular filtration rate, which must be &gt; 60 ml/min, as renal insufficiency greatly&#xD;
             increases the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis from gadolinium exposure. Renal&#xD;
             insufficiency may also be associated with metabolic abnormalities that may interfere&#xD;
             with MR imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lactation (if contrast agents are to be used). The safety of gadolinium for nursing&#xD;
             infants has not been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of psychoactive or vascularly active medications (if a functional fMRI technique&#xD;
             that is sensitive to hemodynamic changes is being used).&#xD;
