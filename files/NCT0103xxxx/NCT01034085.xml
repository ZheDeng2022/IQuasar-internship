      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some people with schizophrenia have problems with their working memory and paying&#xD;
           attention for extended periods. These difficulties cannot be treated with antipsychotic&#xD;
           medications or with many standard therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The prevalence of cigarette smoking among individuals with schizophrenia is about three&#xD;
           times higher than in the general population. Research has shown that nicotine, the&#xD;
           addictive component found in cigarettes, can help improve attentional and working memory&#xD;
           performance. Researchers are interested in learning more about whether there may be an&#xD;
           overlap in the cognitive functions beneficially affected by nicotine and areas of&#xD;
           dysfunction in individuals with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the potential of transdermal nicotine to alleviate cognitive deficits in&#xD;
           schizophrenia, and to determine whether naturally maintained cigarette-smoking, in&#xD;
           comparison, is an effective self-medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To gather preliminary data on genetics that may account for individual and group&#xD;
           differences in the performance effects of nicotine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Current smokers (25 or more cigarettes per week for at least 1 year) between 18 and 55&#xD;
      years of age who are either healthy volunteers or have been diagnosed with&#xD;
      schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will require five visits to the research center, with an initial screening&#xD;
           visit, a training session, and three test sessions. Ideally, all visits will occur 1&#xD;
           week apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Training session: Participants will receive training on the types of computerized&#xD;
           cognitive and attentional behavior tests that will be given during the active portion of&#xD;
           the study. Participants will also fill out questionnaires on nicotine use and other&#xD;
           alcohol and drug use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test sessions: Participants will be assigned to random groups and will complete tests&#xD;
           that assess cognitive performance (a) while maintaining their usual smoking behavior,&#xD;
           (b) after minimal deprivation (3.5 hours without smoking) while wearing a placebo patch,&#xD;
           and (c) under the influence of a standard nicotine patch. The order of these sessions&#xD;
           will be different for individual participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide blood samples throughout the research study for evaluation&#xD;
           purposes.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the potential of transdermal nicotine to alleviate distinct cognitive&#xD;
           deficits in schizophrenia, and to determine whether naturally maintained&#xD;
           cigarette-smoking, in comparison, is an effective self-medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To gather preliminary data on genotypes that may account for interindividual and group&#xD;
           differences in the performance effects of nicotine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      45 regular smokers with schizophrenia, 45 matched control smokers (greater than or equal to 5&#xD;
      cigarettes/day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject study, evaluating cognitive functions under&#xD;
      conditions of normal smoking, transdermal nicotine (14 mg/day), and placebo (minimal tobacco&#xD;
      deprivation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures of cognitive task performance, measures of subjective state, plasma concentrations&#xD;
      of nicotine and metabolites, and genotype with regards to genes coding for nicotinic receptor&#xD;
      subunits, MAO, and COMT.&#xD;
