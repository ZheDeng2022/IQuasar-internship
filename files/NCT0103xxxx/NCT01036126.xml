      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Relapse to drug abuse often happens in the presence of stimuli that are associated with&#xD;
      previous drug use, also known as cues. Drug-taking behavior appears to be partly controlled&#xD;
      by such cues. Some research suggests that cue-induced craving states are responsible for drug&#xD;
      use and relapse, but other research suggests that cues can control drug taking without&#xD;
      conscious craving or even awareness. Researchers are interested in using functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI) to study how individuals respond to drug-related cues and how these&#xD;
      cues affect craving on a conscious or unconscious level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine how drug-related stimuli (cues) affect thinking, information processing, and&#xD;
      body reactions in current drug users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 50 years of age who are dependent on either tobacco or&#xD;
      crack-cocaine, or are healthy volunteers who are not dependent on either drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will require two sessions, a training session and a testing session, that will&#xD;
           take place within 48 hours of each other. Between the two test sessions, participants&#xD;
           may not consume alcohol, tobacco, or illegal drugs, and must restrict caffeine&#xD;
           consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the first session, participants will complete questionnaires about&#xD;
           tobacco/cocaine use and craving, and will be trained on the tasks to be performed in the&#xD;
           MRI scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the second session, participants will perform concentration tasks and look at&#xD;
           pictures, some of which will be tobacco/cocaine related. Body reactions such as heart&#xD;
           rate, pupil dilation, and sweating will be measured during this session. Some&#xD;
           participants will have actual MRI scanning, while others will have mock MRI scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the MRI session, participants will complete questionnaires about craving and&#xD;
           responses to the scan.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Relapse to drug abuse often happens in the presence of stimuli that are associated with&#xD;
      previous drug-use, and drug-taking behavior appears to be partly controlled by such cues.&#xD;
      While some theories postulate that such facilitation is mediated by cue-induced craving&#xD;
      states, others hypothesize that the underlying processes are highly automatized and can&#xD;
      happen without conscious control or even awareness. One way to approach psychological&#xD;
      mechanisms of cue reactivity is to measure disruption of ongoing mental activity by&#xD;
      drug-related material in dependent individuals while manipulating the degree to which&#xD;
      cognitive evaluative processes can unfold. Craving measurement under these conditions can&#xD;
      elucidate its relationship with automatic processing versus conscious evaluation of drug&#xD;
      cues. Autonomic and neural correlates can be identified by concomitant psychophysiological&#xD;
      and fMRI recording. Results from these studies will shed light on the role of spontaneous&#xD;
      automatic reactions versus cognitive evaluation for different measures of cue reactivity. By&#xD;
      helping to elucidate the psychological mechanisms and neurobiological basis of drug-cue&#xD;
      reactivity in dependent individuals, this may have substantial implications for the&#xD;
      understanding of mechanisms and treatment of drug dependence. Thus, while there are no direct&#xD;
      benefits to subjects participating in these experiments, the results may benefit the health&#xD;
      of society. MRI-related risks to subjects (injury from metal implants, claustrophobia,&#xD;
      temporary deafness due to the loud banging noises) will be minimized by prescreening and&#xD;
      providing earplugs. Drug-related cues may induce acute craving; subjects will be dismissed&#xD;
      only after craving levels have returned to baseline.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Smokers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Regular smoking of greater than or equal to 20 cigarettes other than ultra-low nicotine&#xD;
        cigarettes per day for at least two years. Experienced withdrawal signs after not smoking&#xD;
        for several hours. Score on the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence greater than or&#xD;
        equal to 3.&#xD;
