  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The therapeutic modalities of cannabis have received more research attention recently&#xD;
           with the discovery of its ability to stimulate appetite and to provide pain and nausea&#xD;
           relief in patients with AIDS, cancer, and multiple sclerosis, among other diseases.&#xD;
           Sativex(Registered Trademark), an experimental drug derived from the marijuana plant,&#xD;
           contains tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), both of which affect brain&#xD;
           activity. Sativex(Registered Trademark) is being tested to determine how and to what&#xD;
           extent it affects brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) uses magnetic waves to study brain&#xD;
           activity. Researchers are interested in using fMRI to study how Sativex(Registered&#xD;
           Trademark) affects regional brain activity, including thinking abilities and behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study changes in regional brain activity produced by Sativex(Registered Trademark)&#xD;
           compared with THC and placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine how Sativex(Registered Trademark) is processed by the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 45 years of age who are either current users of cannabis (less&#xD;
      than daily) or healthy volunteers who do not use cannabis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will involve one training session and five testing sessions on separate days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At every session, subjects will receive either THC or placebo capsules and either&#xD;
           Sativex(Registered Trademark) or placebo spray.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete a training session in a mock fMRI scanner to adapt to the&#xD;
           fMRI scanning environment. In the training session, participants will practice the tests&#xD;
           that will track thinking ability, attention, working memory, and other cognitive tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have five fMRI scanning sessions with the tests they have practiced&#xD;
           previously, and will provide blood, urine, and saliva samples as required by the&#xD;
           researchers. Participants will be discharged approximately 12 hours after they arrive&#xD;
           for the study sessions....&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Cannabis sativa contains over sixty cannabinoids, including&#xD;
      delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). CBD lacks psychoactivity and may&#xD;
      attenuate the subjective effects produced by THC. The ratio of THC:CBD in illicit cannabis in&#xD;
      the US is approximately 20:1. Sativex(Registered Trademark), a whole-plant cannabinoid&#xD;
      extract oromucosal spray, contains THC and CBD in a ratio of nearly 1:1. It was approved by&#xD;
      Health Canada in 2005 as a prescription medication for neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis&#xD;
      (MS) and will be evaluated in Phase III trials in the U.S. in patients with advanced cancer&#xD;
      for the treatment of pain refractory to opiates. No studies have examined changes in regional&#xD;
      brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during completion of&#xD;
      cognitive tasks or affective measures after administration of Sativex(Registered Trademark).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: 1) To characterize physiological and affective condition, subjective state,&#xD;
      cognitive performance, and concomitant changes in activation of specific brain regions (blood&#xD;
      oxygen level-dependent [BOLD] signal) with fMRI after oromucosal administration of&#xD;
      Sativex(Registered Trademark) and oral administration of THC. 2) To characterize the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of THC and CBD and metabolites in plasma, urine, and oral fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Population: 18 healthy controls and 18 healthy cannabis users, 18 - 45 years old,&#xD;
      with no current major psychiatric disorders except nicotine or caffeine dependence.&#xD;
      Non-dependent substance use is allowed for cannabis users. Cannabis using participants must&#xD;
      have used cannabis with an average frequency of at least once in the last 90 days and maximum&#xD;
      frequency of less than daily during the three months prior to study entry. Enrollment target,&#xD;
      based on national population of adult current cannabis users and the Baltimore City&#xD;
      Department of Planning 2000 census, is 65% male, 35% female; 64% African American, 32%&#xD;
      Caucasian, 4% other; and 9% Hispanic and 91% non-Hispanic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design and Methods: This randomized, double blind, double-dummy,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, within- and between-subject study evaluates the effects of oral THC and&#xD;
      oromucosal administration of Sativex(Registered Trademark) on brain activation and&#xD;
      subjective, affective, cognitive, and physiologic measures. Cannabis users undergo a thorough&#xD;
      medical, psychiatric (including structured diagnostic interview), and psychosocial (including&#xD;
      Addiction Severity Index) evaluation. They enter the research unit the morning of the&#xD;
      dosing/scanning session. Each cannabis-using participant receives, in random order, synthetic&#xD;
      THC 5 mg, synthetic THC 15 mg, two actuations of Sativex(Registered Trademark) (5.4 mg THC&#xD;
      and 5.0 mg cannabidiol), six actuations of Sativex(Registered Trademark) (16.2 mg THC and&#xD;
      15.0 mg cannabidiol), and placebo. There is an interval of at least five days between dosing&#xD;
      sessions. Physiological, psychological, and behavioral measures are monitored throughout the&#xD;
      study to determine onset, magnitude, and duration of effects and to correlate with THC and&#xD;
      cannabidiol pharmacokinetics. Changes in BOLD signal in multiple brain areas are determined&#xD;
      with five fMRI scans during the completion of cognitive tasks and affective measures after&#xD;
      cannabinoid and placebo administration. Eighteen controls undergo neuroimaging,&#xD;
      psychological, and behavioral monitoring as do cannabis users to control for practice&#xD;
      effects. Primary outcome measures include changes in physiologic effects, subjective effects,&#xD;
      BOLD signal, affect, and cognitive task performance in relation to THC, CBD, and metabolites&#xD;
      plasma concentrations. Secondary objectives are to monitor the disposition of THC, CBD, and&#xD;
      metabolites in plasma, urine, and oral fluid. Primary statistical analysis for changes in&#xD;
      affect, cognitive performance, and physiologic and subjective effects is a within-subject&#xD;
      analysis of variance (ANOVA) (or equivalent analysis). Changes in BOLD signal determined by&#xD;
      fMRI are compared between groups and dosing conditions using repeated-measures ANOVA. Based&#xD;
      upon power analyses, we estimate needing 18 cannabis users and 18 controls to complete the&#xD;
      experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and Benefits: Potential risks are those associated with administration of cannabinoids,&#xD;
      but proposed doses have proven safe and well tolerated in other studies. The most common side&#xD;
      effects from the oromucosal administration of Sativex(Registered Trademark) include dry&#xD;
      mouth, dizziness, application site discomfort, fatigue, somnolence, nausea, and diarrhea.&#xD;
      Side effects resulting from oral THC administration include sedation, cognitive impairment,&#xD;
      euphoria, poor coordination, tachycardia and hypotension. There are no clinical benefits to&#xD;
      participants. Likely scientific benefits are greater understanding of the role of cannabidiol&#xD;
      in modifying the impact of THC on cognitive performance, affective condition, subjective&#xD;
      state, physiological condition, and brain activation.&#xD;
