      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a&#xD;
      mindfulness-based behavioral intervention combining breathing and other relaxation exercises&#xD;
      on symptoms of anxiety in patients undergoing the implantation of an implantable cardioverter&#xD;
      defibrillator. This study will pilot test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a&#xD;
      mindfulness-based intervention intended to improve mindfulness and anxiety levels in ICD&#xD;
      (Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators) patients. A randomized controlled study design will&#xD;
      be used, in which an 8 session phone-delivered mindfulness intervention will be compared to a&#xD;
      usual care condition among consecutive candidates for ICD procedures. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted at the Electrophysiology (EPS) Unit at the UMass Memorial Medical Center.&#xD;
      Assessments will be performed at baseline and at the end of the intervention (9 weeks after&#xD;
      enrollment).&#xD;

      The Specific Aims of this pilot study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the feasibility of a randomized clinical trial of a phone-administered,&#xD;
      mindfulness-based training program, as measured by recruitment and retention rates, treatment&#xD;
      adherence and fidelity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To obtain preliminary estimates of the effect of a phone delivered mindfulness-based&#xD;
           intervention on mindfulness levels, measured as the difference between baseline and&#xD;
           post-intervention Five Factors of Mindfulness scores (FFM) in the intervention and in&#xD;
           the control group at the end of the intervention. Hypothesis: Mindfulness levels will&#xD;
           improve in the intervention group compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To obtain preliminary estimates of the effect of a phone delivered, mindfulness-based&#xD;
           intervention on anxiety, measured as the difference between baseline and&#xD;
           post-intervention Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) anxiety scores in the&#xD;
           intervention and in the control group at the end of the intervention. Hypothesis:&#xD;
           Anxiety levels will be reduced in the intervention group, compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To collect preliminary data about the number of arrhythmic episodes/administered shocks&#xD;
           during the intervention period. Hypothesis: the proportion of patients experiencing&#xD;
           arrhythmic events/shocks will decrease in the intervention vs. the control group.&#xD;

    <description>Eight, phone delivered, individual mindfulness sessions. Each training session will last 30 minutes (20 minutes for intervention + an additional 10 minutes for questions, answers, and for scheduling the next intervention. Patients will also receive instructions to practice at home every day, at least once a day, for at least 15 minutes. An audio CD containing guided mindfulness exercises will be given to the patient at the beginning of the study, to guide them during their home practice. The CD consists of sequences of different mindfulness techniques, consistent with the techniques learned during each session with the instructor. Each patient will record the minutes of mindfulness practice in a diary to be kept daily.</description>

    <description>The UC group will be offered the standard care planned by the hospital, which includes the routine care provided by the electrophysiology team and other health care professionals that the patient may see over the course of the ICD experience. All patients receive a number of printed education materials and participate to support meetings for ICD patients four times a year. Being part of the standard care offered at UMass Memorial Medical Center, these meetings are offered to all patients regardless of their assignment (thus including patients assigned to the MBI arm).</description>
