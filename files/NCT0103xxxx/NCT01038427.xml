  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compared the efficacy and safety of a generic mometasone nasal spray to the&#xD;
      reference listed drug in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis. Additionally both the&#xD;
      test and the reference formulations were tested for superiority against a placebo nasal&#xD;
      spray.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed as a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group,&#xD;
      multi-site to compare the clinical equivalence of the test formulation of mometasone furoate&#xD;
      monohydrate, 50 mcg/actuation nasal spray (Lek Pharmaceuticals d.d.) with the reference&#xD;
      formulation Nasonex® nasal spray (Schering) in the relief of the signs and symptoms of&#xD;
      seasonal allergic rhinitis. Participants who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria entered a&#xD;
      7-day placebo lead-in period. Following this placebo lead-in period, on Day 1 participants&#xD;
      who continued to meet eligibility criteria were randomly assigned in a 2:2:1 ratio to one of&#xD;
      three treatment groups (Test Product:Reference Product:Placebo) for 14 days of treatment. In&#xD;
      all treatment groups, participants were instructed to administer the study drug once daily at&#xD;
      approximately the same time each day. A single dose of 200 mcg was 4 actuations, each&#xD;
      containing 50 mcg per actuation. Patients were instructed to administer the 4 actuations&#xD;
      alternating between right and left nostril, such that 2 actuations were not administered back&#xD;
      to back to the same nostril.&#xD;

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) (Equivalence: Per-Protocol Population)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were required to record a 12 hour &quot;reflective&quot; score twice a day approximately 12 hours apart. For the rTNSS patients were asked to &quot;look back&quot; or &quot;reflect&quot; on their severity of nasal symptoms over the previous 12 hours. The first rating on each day was taken prior to dosing. Patients were asked to score 4 nasal symptoms (nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing and itchy nose) on a 4 point scale ranging from 0 (no symptom) to 3 (severe symptom). The means of the 4 individual symptom scores obtained over the randomized treatment period were summed to give the mean rTNSS, which ranged from 0 to 12 with a lower score indicating less severe symptoms.&#xD;
Mean baseline rTNSS was calculated by summing the means of the 4 individual symptom scores obtained over the 72 hours before the randomized treatment period.&#xD;
Mean change from baseline was calculated as &quot;mean baseline rTNSS&quot; - &quot;mean post-randomization rTNSS&quot;. A positive change from baseline in rTNSS is considered a favorable outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were required to record an &quot;instantaneous&quot; score twice a day approximately 12 hours apart. For the iTNSS patients were asked to evaluate &quot;how I feel now&quot; regarding their severity of nasal symptoms. The first rating on each day was taken prior to dosing. Patients were asked to score 4 nasal symptoms (nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing and itchy nose) on a 4 point scale ranging from 0 (no symptom) to 3 (severe symptom). The means of the 4 individual symptom scores obtained over the randomized treatment period were summed to give the mean iTNSS, which ranged from 0 to 12 with a lower score indicating less severe symptoms.&#xD;

    <description>A global evaluation of efficacy relative to baseline was assessed separately by the investigator and the patient on Day 15. Both the investigator and the patient were asked to rate clinical improvement since baseline on a 5-category scale ranging from &quot;No Relief&quot; to &quot;Complete Relief&quot; of signs and symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis.

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) (Equivalence: Per-Protocol Population)</title>
        <description>Patients were required to record a 12 hour &quot;reflective&quot; score twice a day approximately 12 hours apart. For the rTNSS patients were asked to &quot;look back&quot; or &quot;reflect&quot; on their severity of nasal symptoms over the previous 12 hours. The first rating on each day was taken prior to dosing. Patients were asked to score 4 nasal symptoms (nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing and itchy nose) on a 4 point scale ranging from 0 (no symptom) to 3 (severe symptom). The means of the 4 individual symptom scores obtained over the randomized treatment period were summed to give the mean rTNSS, which ranged from 0 to 12 with a lower score indicating less severe symptoms.&#xD;
Mean baseline rTNSS was calculated by summing the means of the 4 individual symptom scores obtained over the 72 hours before the randomized treatment period.&#xD;
Mean change from baseline was calculated as &quot;mean baseline rTNSS&quot; - &quot;mean post-randomization rTNSS&quot;. A positive change from baseline in rTNSS is considered a favorable outcome.</description>

For the rTNSS patients were asked to &quot;look back&quot; or &quot;reflect&quot; on their severity of nasal symptoms over the previous 12 hours. The first rating on each day was taken prior to dosing. Patients were asked to score 4 nasal symptoms (nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing and itchy nose) on a 4 point scale ranging from 0 (no symptom) to 3 (severe symptom). The means of the 4 individual symptom scores obtained over the randomized treatment period were summed to give the mean rTNSS, which ranged from 0 to 12 with a lower score indicating less severe symptoms.&#xD;
Mean baseline rTNSS was calculated by summing the means of the 4 individual symptom scores obtained over the 72 hours before the randomized treatment period.&#xD;
Mean change from baseline was calculated as &quot;mean baseline rTNSS&quot; - &quot;mean post-randomization rTNSS&quot;. A positive change from baseline in rTNSS is considered a favorable outcome.</description>

        <title>Clinical Global Improvement Based on the Patient's Assessment</title>
        <description>A global evaluation of efficacy relative to baseline was assessed separately by the investigator and the patient on Day 15. Both the investigator and the patient were asked to rate clinical improvement since baseline on a 5-category scale ranging from &quot;No Relief&quot; to &quot;Complete Relief&quot; of signs and symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis. This record shows the clinical global improvement based on the patient's assessment.</description>
