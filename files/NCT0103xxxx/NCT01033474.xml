      The investigators are going to compare embryo developmental rates of human eggs following&#xD;
      freezing in two different freezing methods. The investigators are going to compare the&#xD;
      pregnancy rates following transfer to patients as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null Hypothesis: The type of vitrification methodology used will not have an impact on the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survival rates&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Embryonic developmental rates&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy and implantation rates.&#xD;

      Randomization of Oocytes: Oocytes will be denuded approximately 1-2 hours post retrieval and&#xD;
      graded for maturity. Only the Metaphase II oocyte will be vitrified. Half of the oocytes&#xD;
      within each donor will be randomized to the following treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Frozen using an open system using a metal grid to hold the oocyte. Three to five oocytes&#xD;
           will be frozen on the metal grid using a minute amount (&lt; 2-3 µls) of cryoprotectant. A&#xD;
           top is put over the metal grid to protect the oocytes. This system has proven to be&#xD;
           successful in limited cases in Peru. This is an open system of vitrification where the&#xD;
           oocytes are directly plunged into liquid nitrogen. This will serve as the control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Frozen in closed straws using a methodology developed by Jim Stachecki. Three to five&#xD;
           oocytes will be frozen in ¼ cc straws. This is very similar to the method used to&#xD;
           successfully vitrify blastocysts. This will be the experimental treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null Hypothesis: The type of vitrification methodology used will not have an impact on the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survival rates&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Embryonic developmental rates&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy and implantation rates. Measured Outcomes The effect of vitrification&#xD;
           technique will be measured using the appropriate statistical analysis on the following&#xD;
           parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Survival rates following thawing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Effect of vitrification technique on how oocytes react to ICSI. The parameters have&#xD;
                been previously defined at NCRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Normal fertilization rates, abnormal fertilization rates and rates of degeneration&#xD;
                following ICSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Embryonic development rates. Embryos will be cultured until Day 5/6 and rate as&#xD;
                well as quality of blastocyst will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Pregnancy and implantation rates following replacement in endometrial prepared&#xD;
                recipients.&#xD;
