  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this Phase I clinical study, three recombinant, avirulent Salmonella Typhi (RASV) strains&#xD;
      each expressing the Streptococcus pneumoniae surface protein, PspA, will be compared as live&#xD;
      biological vaccine vectors to evaluate safe and tolerable, single, oral dose levels in adult&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of attenuated Salmonella strains that are unable to cause clinical disease but&#xD;
      trigger a self-limiting infection leading to stimulation of protective immunity presents an&#xD;
      attractive alternative to killed and subunit vaccines. Live, attenuated Salmonella strains&#xD;
      have been shown to be excellent carriers, or vectors, for prokaryotic or eukaryotic antigens,&#xD;
      being able to stimulate strong systemic and local immune responses against the expressed&#xD;
      antigens. Three Salmonella Typhi strains have been engineered to express a gene encoding the&#xD;
      alpha-helical domain of the Streptococcus pneumoniae surface protein, PspA, and will serve as&#xD;
      live biological vaccine vectors in the proposed clinical trial to evaluate maximum safe and&#xD;
      tolerable single dose levels after their oral administration to subjects. In this Phase I&#xD;
      study, healthy young adults 18-40 years of age will participate in a dose escalating, dose&#xD;
      sequential study divided into four Arms to receive doses of 10^7, 10^8, 10^9 and 10^10 CFU.&#xD;
      Each Arm (1-4) will consist of 3 groups of 5 subjects per group to receive a single oral dose&#xD;
      of one of three recombinant attenuated S. Typhi vaccine vectors producing the pneumococcal&#xD;
      antigen PspA. Each group per Arm will receive the same dose of one of the three vaccines for&#xD;
      a total of 60 subjects (15 subjects per dose-escalating Arm, 3 groups per Arm, 5 subjects per&#xD;
      group). Subject participation lasts 6 months after receiving the oral vaccine dosage with&#xD;
      approximately the first 12-15 days (study Days 0-14) in confinement. Release criteria include&#xD;
      2 negative blood cultures in a row through study Day 7 (inpatient monitoring for 8 days) and&#xD;
      2 negative stool cultures in a row through study Day 5. The objectives of the study are 1) to&#xD;
      evaluate maximum safe tolerable single dose levels of the three recombinant attenuated S.&#xD;
      Typhi vaccine vectors using dose-escalation, dose-sequential studies in healthy adult&#xD;
      subjects, and 2) to evaluate immunogenicity of the three recombinant attenuated S. Typhi&#xD;
      vaccine vectors with regard to their abilities to induce mucosal and systemic antibody&#xD;
      responses to the S. pneumoniae PspA and S. Typhi antigens. The vaccines are not anticipated&#xD;
      to prevent disease. Although the immune responses generated by the vaccine vectors may confer&#xD;
      some degree of protection against future infection with S. pneumoniae and S. Typhi, such&#xD;
      protection is incidental. It is not the goal of this study to develop or test either a&#xD;
      pneumonia or typhoid vaccine, but to select the S. Typhi vector that provides optimal&#xD;
      delivery of the PspA antigen in a safe and immunogenic manner.&#xD;
