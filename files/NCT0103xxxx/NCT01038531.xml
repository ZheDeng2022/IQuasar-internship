      Acute lung injury (ALI) and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represent a&#xD;
      spectrum of clinical syndromes of rapid respiratory system deterioration that are associated&#xD;
      with both pulmonary and systemic illness. These syndromes are associated with 30-40%&#xD;
      mortality with our current standard of care and are responsible for approximately 75,000&#xD;
      deaths in the US yearly. Current evidence-based care of ALI consists of a strategy of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation utilizing low lung volumes (ARDSNet ventilation) intended to limit&#xD;
      further stretch-induced lung injury exacerbated by the ventilator. However, this strategy has&#xD;
      been shown to be associated with increased lung injury in a subset of patients and still is&#xD;
      associated with about a 30% mortality rate. Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) is a&#xD;
      different, non-experimental strategy of mechanical ventilation currently in routine clinical&#xD;
      use. APRV is a pressure-cycled ventilator mode that allows a patient a greater degree of&#xD;
      autonomy in controlling his or her breathing pattern than ARDSNet ventilation. Use of APRV&#xD;
      has been associated with better oxygenation, less sedative usage, and less&#xD;
      ventilator-associated pneumonia in small studies compared with other ventilator modes.&#xD;
      However, debate exists over whether APRV might result in decreased or increased&#xD;
      ventilator-associated lung injury when compared with ARDSNet ventilation. We intend to&#xD;
      implement a randomized, cross over study looking at biomarkers of lung injury in patients&#xD;
      with acute lung injury during ventilation with APRV and using the ARDSNet protocol. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that airway pressure release ventilation is associated with lower levels of&#xD;
      lung injury biomarkers than ARDSNet ventilation.&#xD;

      Acute lung injury (ALI) and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represent a&#xD;
      spectrum of clinical syndromes of rapid respiratory system deterioration that are associated&#xD;
      with both pulmonary and systemic illness. These syndromes are associated with 30-40%&#xD;
      mortality with our current standard of care and are responsible for approximately 75,000&#xD;
      deaths in the US yearly. The current evidence-based care consists of a strategy of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation utilizing low lung volumes (ARDSNet ventilation) intended to limit further lung&#xD;
      injury from overstretch of the lung induced by the ventilator. However, this strategy has&#xD;
      been shown to be associated with continued lung injury in some studies and still is&#xD;
      associated with about a 30% mortality rate. Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) is a&#xD;
      different, nonexperimental strategy of mechanical ventilation currently in routine clinical&#xD;
      use. APRV allows a patient a greater degree of autonomy in controlling his/her breathing&#xD;
      while achieving a higher mean airway pressure (at similar plateau pressures) than that&#xD;
      typically achieved with ARDSNet. APRV has been associated with less ventilator-associated&#xD;
      pneumonia, better oxygenation, and less sedative usage in small studies when compared with&#xD;
      other methods of ventilation. However, debate exists over net effects of APRV with regard to&#xD;
      ventilator-associated lung injury. Additionally, we recently completed a study showing that&#xD;
      APRV was associated with lower ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) rates, but this benefit&#xD;
      did not appear to be mediated by sedation differences. We hypothesized that the VAP benefits&#xD;
      might be mediated by greater lung recruitment and possibly less ventilator-induced lung&#xD;
      injury with APRV. We propose a randomized, crossover study looking at biomarkers of lung&#xD;
      injury in patients with acute lung injury ventilated with APRV and ARDSNet. Our hypothesis is&#xD;
      that airway pressure release ventilation is associated with lower levels of lung injury&#xD;
      biomarkers than ARDSNet ventilation.&#xD;
