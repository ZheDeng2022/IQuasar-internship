    <textblock>
      In this open-label, multi-center study, patients were treated with frovatriptan for a maximum&#xD;
      of 12 perimenstrual periods (PMPs). For each PMP, dosing commenced 2 days before the&#xD;
      anticipated onset of the menstrual migraine (MM) headache and continued for a total of 6&#xD;
      days. Patients were to take a loading dose of frovatriptan 5 mg (two tablets) twice daily on&#xD;
      Day 1, followed by frovatriptan 2.5 mg twice daily on Days 2-6. During the study, patients&#xD;
      were to visit the study site a total of 6 times. Efficacy and/or safety assessments were&#xD;
      performed at each visit.&#xD;

      This Phase IIIb, open label, multi-centre study evaluated the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      frovatriptan taken by patients for up to 12 perimenstrual periods (PMPs) for the prevention&#xD;
      of menstrual migraine (MM). The study required approximately 300 patients to treat 6 PMPs and&#xD;
      100 patients to treat 12 PMPs. To achieve these numbers, 550 patients were to be enrolled&#xD;
      into the study. Once enrolled, patients were requested to treat at least 6 PMPs in the first&#xD;
      9 months and 12 PMPs overall. Patients were to remain in the study for a maximum of 15 months&#xD;
      or until they had completed the treatment of 12 PMPs, whichever occurred sooner.Patients were&#xD;
      to take a loading dose of frovatriptan 5 mg (two tablets) twice daily on Day 1, followed by&#xD;
      frovatriptan 2.5 mg twice daily on Days 2-6.&#xD;
