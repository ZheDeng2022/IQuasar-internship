      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Many cigarette smokers claim that smoking helps them stay alert and improves their&#xD;
      concentration, and have reported problems in attention and concentration after quitting&#xD;
      smoking. Some research has indicated that nicotine can enhance certain aspects of attention&#xD;
      and memory in humans. However, more research is needed to determine how nicotine affects&#xD;
      different elements of the brain's ability to pay attention. Knowing which aspects of&#xD;
      attention are affected by nicotine may help produce new medications and therapies to help&#xD;
      people successfully stop smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the dose-related effects of nicotine on the ability to pay attention in&#xD;
           smokers and nonsmokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the effects of nicotine in smokers and nonsmokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 50 years of age who are either current smokers (at least 15&#xD;
      cigarettes per day on average for at least 2 years) or healthy, nonsmoking volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will consist of one training session and three testing sessions. Each session&#xD;
           will last about 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The training session will introduce participants to the study tests and evaluate their&#xD;
           tolerance of the two levels of nicotine nasal spray used in the study. Smokers will&#xD;
           receive the higher dose of nicotine to introduce them to the effects of the spray.&#xD;
           Nonsmokers will be given first the lower dose of the spray, followed by higher dose at&#xD;
           least 30 minutes later. Nonsmoking participants who cannot tolerate the higher dose will&#xD;
           not continue in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the start of each testing session, smokers will have one cigarette to standardize the&#xD;
           time of the most recent exposure to nicotine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the testing sessions, participants will receive a placebo spray, a lower dose of&#xD;
           nicotine, or a higher dose of nicotine, and then will be asked to perform tests that&#xD;
           evaluate mood, attention, and performance.&#xD;

      Objective: The primary objective of this study is to investigate the dose-related effects of&#xD;
      nicotine on various elements of attention in smokers and nonsmokers. Because no published&#xD;
      study, to our knowledge, has reported the effects of nicotine on the ANT and ABT, we will&#xD;
      include the CPT, a task shown to be sensitive to nicotine, as a positive control. A secondary&#xD;
      aim is to compare the subjective and physiological effects of nicotine between smokers and&#xD;
      nonsmokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: 50 smokers for a total of 30 completers (15 women, 15 men) and up to 50&#xD;
      nonsmokers for a total of 30 completers (15 women, 15 men).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Placebo-controlled, between-groups comparison of smokers and nonsmokers. Participants&#xD;
      will attend three experiemental sessions; a single dose of nicotine nasal spray (0, 0.5, or&#xD;
      1.5 mg) will be administered at each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: Primary outcome measures will be accuracy and/or response time on the three&#xD;
      attention tests, ANT, CPT, and ABT. Secondary outcome measures include responses to the&#xD;
      PANAS, VAS items, and vital signs (heart rate and blood pressure). Participant demographics&#xD;
      and smoking history will be reported using descriptive statistics.&#xD;
