  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is determine if performing endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) in&#xD;
      addition to standard endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) can increase the precision and accuracy of&#xD;
      staging esophageal cancer in comparison to EUS alone. The expectation is that EBUS can be&#xD;
      used to biopsy lymph nodes that: (1) because of their position in the mediastinum would be&#xD;
      inaccessible to EUS, or (2) would be inaccessible due to their position behind the esophageal&#xD;
      tumor.&#xD;

      1. Problem:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Endoscopic ultrasound techniques are becoming more and more popular. The safety of these&#xD;
           technologies has been demonstrated on multiple occasions. These minimally invasive&#xD;
           trans-luminal techniques do not require general anesthesia and can be performed,&#xD;
           rapidly, accurately and at low cost. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) has been used by&#xD;
           pulmonologists and thoracic surgeons primarily for the staging, diagnosis and management&#xD;
           of lung cancer. Its efficacy and safety has been demonstrated in multiple studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           EBUS is not currently utilized by most centers in the staging of esophageal cancer. To&#xD;
           date, no study has explored the possible use of EBUS for peritumoral lymph node biopsy,&#xD;
           nor for biopsy of any suspicious mediastinal lymph nodes, not accessible by EUS. At&#xD;
           Notre Dame Hospital, Centre Hospitalier de L'Universite de Montreal, all patients&#xD;
           diagnosed with esophageal cancer undergo complete EUS staging followed by EBUS during&#xD;
           the same procedure, in order to examine all the lymph nodes near or far from the primary&#xD;
           tumor amenable to EBUS guided trans-bronchial biopsy. This is important because it&#xD;
           allows physicians to bypass the primary tumor and pass through the normal&#xD;
           (non-cancerous) bronchial wall, eliminating any chances of tumoral contamination of the&#xD;
           sample. In addition, this also provides a much more complete mediastinal staging as it&#xD;
           allows biopsy of a population of lymph nodes non-accessible to EUS biopsy. Thus far, we&#xD;
           have performed EBUS in six patients with esophageal cancer with upstaging of the N stage&#xD;
           of the tumor in two of these patients (33%). There have been no morbidities and all&#xD;
           patients have been discharged home on the day of the procedure. EBUS was therefore able&#xD;
           to change the treatment strategy, without adding any morbidity, discomfort or additional&#xD;
           procedural time for two out of six patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The proposed project will be the first study ever to evaluate the impact of EBUS on&#xD;
           esophageal cancer staging as well as on the choice of therapy. This study consists of a&#xD;
           prospective cohort study with no placebo group, all patients will have EBUS and stages&#xD;
           obtained with and without EBUS will be compared as well as changes to the treatment plan&#xD;
           based on EBUS staging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Examine the impact of adding EBUS to the gold standard work-up on esophageal cancer&#xD;
                staging.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Examine the impact of adding EBUS to the gold standard work-up on the treatment&#xD;
                plan for patients newly diagnosed with esophageal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study consists of a prospective cohort study. Each patient will serve as his/her own&#xD;
           control. All patients currently undergoing esophageal cancer staging in the Division of&#xD;
           Thoracic Surgery at the CHUM will be approached for enrolment into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           EUS followed by EBUS will be performed during the EUS staging procedure. The order of&#xD;
           procedures for all patients is as follows: (1) Flexible Esophagoscopy with endoluminal&#xD;
           biopsy, (2) Radial EUS for T staging (3) Linear EUS for lymph node biopsy and N staging,&#xD;
           (4) Flexible Bronchoscopy for evaluation of the left mainstem bronchus for tumor&#xD;
           invasion, (5) Linear EBUS for trans-tracheal and trans-bronchial lymph node biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All FNA samples will be evaluated using standard methods by cytopathologists at the&#xD;
           CHUM. Results will be evaluated for: (A) positivity, (B) negativity (no tumor cells,&#xD;
           positive lymphocytes), (C) inadequacy (no tumor cells, no lymphocytes). A minimum of two&#xD;
           passes will be performed into each lymph node.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be discharged on the same day, as their procedure. Results will be&#xD;
           discussed with them in a follow-up clinic appointment with their thoracic surgeon within&#xD;
           3 weeks of the procedure. Any procedure-related morbidity will be documented in the&#xD;
           post-procedural period as well as at their follow-up appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Expected Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe that by adding EBUS to the gold standard work up and staging of esophageal cancer,&#xD;
      we can make a significant difference in esophageal cancer staging. This may also&#xD;
      significantly change the choice of therapy.&#xD;
