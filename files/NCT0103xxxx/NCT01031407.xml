  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of developmental disorders that affect&#xD;
           communication, social interaction, and behavior. Relatively little is known about the&#xD;
           relationship between genetics and behavior among these individuals and their close&#xD;
           relatives. Researchers are interested in using interviews and rating scales to better&#xD;
           understand these issues, as well as collecting brain scan data and genetic samples for&#xD;
           testing and comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  By comparing test results and genetic samples from healthy volunteers, people with ASD,&#xD;
           and parents (or caregivers or legal guardians) of the first two groups, researchers hope&#xD;
           to better understand the neuroscience of ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To learn more about the brain in healthy people and in people with autism spectrum&#xD;
           disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study genes that might be involved in autism spectrum disorders by collecting DNA&#xD;
           samples from participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following groups of participants will be eligible for the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals between 5 and 89 years of age who have autism spectrum disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers between 5 and 89 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitively impaired children between 5 and 17 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents/caregivers/legal guardians of individuals in the above three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will visit the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center for research&#xD;
           tests, which will be administered over multiple visits. Researchers will determine the&#xD;
           specific tests to be administered based on the medical history of the study participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will study the brain through interviews, tests of thinking and memory&#xD;
           (neuropsychological tests), brain imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and&#xD;
           magnetoencephalography (MEG).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will also collect blood or saliva to obtain a DNA sample.&#xD;

      Objective: The primary objective of the proposed studies is to utilize neuroimaging&#xD;
      (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging [fMRI], structural MRI [sMRI], Magnetoencephalography&#xD;
      [MEG]) and neuropsychological tools (eye-tracking, cognitive experiments, clinical&#xD;
      neuropsychological measures, questionnaires, etc.) to identify cognitive idiosyncrasies&#xD;
      (e.g., social-cognitive deficits, visual perceptual assets, and savant skills) characteristic&#xD;
      of individuals on the autism spectrum and their neural underpinnings across childhood and&#xD;
      adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Children, adolescents, and adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs),&#xD;
      controls (i.e., typically developing children, adolescents, and adults and those with mild to&#xD;
      moderate mental retardation), as well as caregivers/legal guardians/parents of these&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Descriptive/Characterization/Observational studies using primarily neuropsychological&#xD;
      and neuroimaging methodologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: Behavioral (reaction time, accuracy, eye movements, etc.) and neuroimaging&#xD;
      (brain morphometry, BOLD, electrophysiology, etc.).&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. males and females.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. 5-89 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A minimum IQ of 70&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects in the ASD group will:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. meet DSM-IV criteria for one of the pervasive developmental disorders (i.e., autistic&#xD;
             disorder, Asperger disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise&#xD;
             specified).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. meet or pass the autism cut-off score for social symptoms on the ADI and/or the ASD&#xD;
             cut-off score from social+communication symptoms on the ADOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. be able to provide their own consent (for adults).&#xD;
&#xD;
        For inclusion in the facial recognition substudy, subjects must be:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. ages 18 to 35&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. in good health&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. with bad memory of faces&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All subjects, except for savants, also will be excluded if they have:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. a history of neurological insult/injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. substantial prenatal drug exposure known to affect later brain and behavior (e.g.,&#xD;
             cocaine, alcohol).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. severely premature birth or birth trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. severe medical disorder (e.g., neurofibromatosis, hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy,&#xD;
             uncontrollable seizure disorder).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. a known genetic disorder (e.g., Fragile X or Down syndrome) that would be expected to&#xD;
             significantly impact findings from cognitive testing and/or neuroimaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Furthermore, subjects will be excluded from MRI/MEG studies, if they have:&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. any exclusion from MRI scanning including: the presence of metal in their body, having&#xD;
             a pacemaker, and/or females who are pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy volunteers, except for parents of individuals with autism spectrum disorders and&#xD;
        parents of healthy volunteers, will also be excluded if they have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a current or past history of axis I psychiatric conditions or any current usage of&#xD;
        psychiatric medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Savants have less restrictive exclusionary criteria because: 1) they are a very rare group,&#xD;
        thus we don t want to limit recruitment further and 2) we can examine common and unique&#xD;
        cognitive mechanisms across savants, a question of keen interest, regardless of&#xD;
        co-morbidities. Those with tumors or other neuroimaging-relevant contraindications will be&#xD;
        excluded from fMRI/MEG procedures.&#xD;
