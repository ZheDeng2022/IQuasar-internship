      Background In adults with acute myeloid leukemia, especially those &lt; 60 years of age,&#xD;
      high-dose cytarabine consolidation therapy has been shown to influence survival. However, the&#xD;
      appropriate dose has not been defined. We evaluated survival after cytarabine consolidation&#xD;
      therapy at three different doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Methods We conducted a single-center, retrospective study involving 499 acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia patients, aged 18-92 years, all evaluated between 1978 and 2007. Of those&#xD;
      499 patients, 400 received curative treatment and 203 received cytarabine consolidation. The&#xD;
      latter were divided into three groups: low-dose (receiving &lt; 1.5 g/m2 of i.v. cytarabine,&#xD;
      every 12 h, on 3 alternate days, for up to 4 cycles); medium-high-dose (&lt; 45.45 g-the median&#xD;
      dose-by the end of the cycles); and very-high-dose (≥ 45.45 g by the end of the cycles).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results Among the 400 patients receiving curative treatment, five-year survival was 22.8% (91&#xD;
      patients). Cytarabine consolidation dose was an independent determinant of survival&#xD;
      (significant differences were found among the groups), whereas age, karyotype, induction&#xD;
      protocol, French-American-British classification and etiology were not. In comparison with&#xD;
      the very-high-dose group, the risk of death was 3.871 times (95% CI, 1.043 to 14.370 times)&#xD;
      higher in the high-dose group (p=0.043) and 9.775 times (95% CI, 2.493 to 38.320 times)&#xD;
      higher in the low-dose group (p=0.001), assuming, in both cases, that age, karyotype,&#xD;
      French-American-British classification and etiology of acute myeloid leukemia were constant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusions Consolidation therapy with high-dose cytarabine appears to improve survival in&#xD;
      patients with acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;
