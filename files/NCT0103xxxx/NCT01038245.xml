  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Central nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are primary targets for the action of&#xD;
      nicotine. In addition to being involved in tobacco dependence, they are also involved in a&#xD;
      variety of brain disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Researchers are&#xD;
      interested in developing better ways to study the action of nAChRs to improve treatments for&#xD;
      smoking cessation and other problems affected by these receptors. These new study methods may&#xD;
      involve different approaches to positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, which can show&#xD;
      brain activity related to nAChRs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate appropriate and useful doses of radiotracers used in PET scanning of nAChRs in&#xD;
      the brains of nonsmokers/former smokers, light smokers, and heavy smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 50 years of age who fall into one of the following groups: (1)&#xD;
      nonsmokers or former smokers who have not smoked for the past 2 years, (2) light/situational&#xD;
      smokers, or (3) heavy smokers (at least 15 cigarettes/day for the past 2 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each participant will undergo up to three PET studies, given approximately1 month apart.&#xD;
           Each study will take approximately 8 hours to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide urine and breath samples before the study and at the start of&#xD;
           the study, which will be tested for chemicals that may interfere with the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depending on the study, some of the smoking participants may receive a nicotine patch to&#xD;
           wear during the PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On the day of the study, participants will receive a dose of a radiotracer (a drug used&#xD;
           in PET scanning) given either as a single injection or as an injection followed by a&#xD;
           continuous infusion, and will have a series of PET scans over the next 7 hours and&#xD;
           provide blood samples during that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will return for a follow-up visit 1 month after the end of the study.&#xD;

      Background: Central nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) mediate a variety of brain&#xD;
      functions and have been implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's&#xD;
      diseases, other CNS disorders (Tourette's syndrome, epilepsy, etc.), and nicotine dependence.&#xD;
      These receptors are the primary target for the action of nicotine, which is believed to cause&#xD;
      tobacco dependence. The ability to quantitatively image nAChRs with PET in humans would allow&#xD;
      scientists to monitor the nAChRs in vivo during nicotine dependence and smoking cessation and&#xD;
      to determine the receptor occupancy by nicotine for different types of nicotine replacement&#xD;
      therapy (NRT). Recently completed studies demonstrated the feasibility of imaging nAChRs in&#xD;
      the human brain with 2[18F]FA-85380 and showed that each participant could receive up to 4&#xD;
      injections of 5 mCi/70 kg without exceeding dosimetry limits imposed by the FDA and the NIH&#xD;
      Radiation Safety Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific Goal: The aims of the proposed study are 1) to compare the total volumes of&#xD;
      distribution for 2[18F]FA-85380 and volumes of distribution for specific binding compartment&#xD;
      (an estimate of nAChR densities) in brains of light and heavy smokers and 2) to develop a&#xD;
      simplified PET procedure that is more comfortable for the human participants and that&#xD;
      maintains the ability to accurately quantify nAChR binding in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Healthy adult participants (non-smokers or exsmokers and light&#xD;
      (situational) and heavy smokers), males and females between 18 and 50 years of age, will be&#xD;
      recruited for this study. The goal is to complete studies of 12 controls (non-smokers or&#xD;
      exsmokers), 12 light smokers and 12 heavy smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design and Method: After being medically cleared and giving informed consent,&#xD;
      each participant will undergo up to three PET studies. In each study, the participant will&#xD;
      receive a 5 mCi/70 kg dose of the radioligand, 2[18F]FA-85380-Injection. For one of the&#xD;
      studies, the participants who smoke will receive nicotine by a nicotine patch (Nicoderm),&#xD;
      applied approximately 4 h before the scan. The patch will be removed 12 h after it is&#xD;
      applied. For two studies (one without and one with nicotine), participants who smoke will&#xD;
      receive the radioligand as a bolus injection. Six of the participants who do not currently&#xD;
      smoke (control group) will receive the radioligand as a bolus injection twice without&#xD;
      nicotine either time. For the third study, all participants will receive the radioligand as a&#xD;
      bolus injection followed by a continuous infusion (bolus injection/infusion combination). Six&#xD;
      of the participants who do not currently smoke (control group) will receive the radioligand&#xD;
      as a bolus plus infusion injection twice. For each study, a series of brain PET scans will be&#xD;
      acquired for 8 h beginning at the time of the injection. The data from the PET scans without&#xD;
      and with nicotine patch (smokers only) will be used to determine the total and non-specific&#xD;
      accumulation of radioactivity in the brain. The data from the equivalent two PET scans for&#xD;
      the controls will be used to determine the test-retest reliability of the measure. The data&#xD;
      from the PET scans acquired from the bolus/infusion paradigm will be used to demonstrate the&#xD;
      feasibility of a shorter scanning period for quantitation studies. It is anticipated that&#xD;
      several of the participants will choose not to continue after the first scan. The study&#xD;
      design accommodates this expectation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits to participants and/or society: This protocol will provide no direct benefits to the&#xD;
      research participants other than routine medical screening and attention from the research&#xD;
      staff. The knowledge gained in this study may lead to the availability of an agent for&#xD;
      external monitoring of nAChRs using PET. This agent would be a valuable tool for determining&#xD;
      the dynamics of nAChRs in nicotine dependence and smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks to participants: There are risks related to the PET scans in general, involving&#xD;
      exposure to radiation, arterial catheterization and venous catheterization. In addition,&#xD;
      there are risks related to the administration of this radiopharmaceutical and from exposure&#xD;
      to nicotine. Medical supervision will be provided throughout the study. A plan for monitoring&#xD;
      potential side effects of this radiotracer is given.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age: Subjects will be male and female volunteers aged 18 to 50 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects must have a stable point of contact and must agree to participate in&#xD;
             three PET studies at approximately 4-week intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All participants in the light or heavy smoker groups must have smoking experience.&#xD;
             Those in the heavy smoker group must smoke at least 15 cigarettes/day and have smoked&#xD;
             for at least the last 2 consecutive years. Those participants in the light smoker&#xD;
             group should be situational smokers (those who often smoke while consuming alcohol or&#xD;
             in another type of situation, but who do not smoke daily). Light smokers should have&#xD;
             not smoked more than 1 cigarette in the week before starting the medical screening&#xD;
             process and agree to not smoke for the week before the first PET study (except for the&#xD;
             single cigarette we ask them to smoke). Participants in the heavy smoker group should&#xD;
             have experience with abstaining from smoking for at least 48 h. Subjects in the&#xD;
             control group must be nonsmokers or have ceased smoking at least two years before the&#xD;
             start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Weight: Anyone weighing more than 300 lbs is excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychiatric disease: DSM-IV criteria will be used (American Psychiatric Association,&#xD;
             1994). No subject with a current axis I diagnosis will be allowed. No subject with&#xD;
             known claustrophobia will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of Drug Abuse: Volunteers reporting current or having a significant history of&#xD;
             illicit drug abuse (single illicit substance use of more than 30 times in a lifetime&#xD;
             for any given substance, except marijuana) will be excluded from the study. However,&#xD;
             if the use was greater than 10 times in a lifetime, it must have occurred more than 10&#xD;
             years before enrollment in this protocol. Subjects may use moderate amounts of alcohol&#xD;
             and caffeine and smoke an occasional marijuana cigarette. Moderate alcohol use will be&#xD;
             defined as less than fourteen drinks of liquor (1.5 oz) or the equivalent beer (12 oz)&#xD;
             or wine (5 oz) per week. Moderate caffeine use will be defined as less than 500 mg of&#xD;
             caffeine per day, where 100 mg is equivalent to 1 serving of coffee (5 oz serving),&#xD;
             2.5 servings (12 oz serving) of caffeinated soft drinks, or 2.5 servings of tea (5 oz&#xD;
             serving). Occasional marijuana use will be defined as less than or equal to two&#xD;
             marijuana cigarettes/month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current Medication Use: Volunteers may not currently use chronic (daily or for more&#xD;
             than 10/14 days in the last month) prescription or over the counter medications,&#xD;
             (including, but not limited to, anti-hypertensive, anti-allergy, pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CNS disease: History of known structural brain abnormalities (e.g., neoplasm,&#xD;
             subarachnoid cysts), cerebrovascular disease, infectious disease (e.g., abscess),&#xD;
             history of head trauma (defined as documented loss of consciousness &gt; 5 min or injury&#xD;
             requiring hospitalization), history of seizures as an adult, sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiovascular, pulmonary, or systemic disease: Repeated (measured on three separate&#xD;
             occasions) diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mm Hg, or systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mm&#xD;
             Hg, known arrhythmia, symptomatic or known coronary artery disease; history of&#xD;
             endocarditis, cerebral embolism, obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, active&#xD;

             reproductive function) known chronic renal or hepatic dysfunction, known HIV&#xD;
             seropositive, known current autoimmune disease involving the CNS, type I diabetes&#xD;
             mellitus, current gastrointestinal disease, gastritis or ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Special considerations for female subjects. Female participants who are currently&#xD;
             pregnant or nursing will not be allowed to participate in this study because of&#xD;
             potential damage to the fetus or baby from the radiation. Female subjects will be&#xD;
             given a serum pregnancy test (quantitative beta HCG) within 24 hours of each PET&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiation exposure: Any subject who has participated in any research studies in which&#xD;
             he/she received a radiation exposure that would result in combination with the present&#xD;
             study, in a total effective radiation exposure (from research studies) exceeding 3.0&#xD;
             rem in a 13-week period or 5.0 rem in a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lack of bilateral arterial patency: Evidence of inadequate patency of radial and lunar&#xD;
             arteries, determined by either Doppler flow measurements or a positive Allen's test,&#xD;
             is an exclusionary criterion for insertion of an arterial catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating and children under the age of 18 will be excluded&#xD;
             to avoid unnecessary exposure to radiation to these populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence in body of metallic implants or materials that could be moved by the magnet&#xD;
             of the MRI scanner: pacemakers, surgical implants, aneurysm clips, dental braces,&#xD;
             bullet(s) or other metallic materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Miscellaneous exclusionary criteria: Body mass index less than 19 or greater than 30.&#xD;
             Hematocrit &lt; 39.0 for males or &lt; 36.0 for females.&#xD;
