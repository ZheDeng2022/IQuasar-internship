      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment for nicotine addiction is characterized by high rates of relapse. New&#xD;
           treatment therapies for nicotine addiction are exploring the use of brain scanning&#xD;
           equipment to control and decrease nicotine and cigarette cravings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the brain.&#xD;
           These pulses can change activity in parts of the brain. Researchers are interested in&#xD;
           determining whether TMS delivered in single pulses can decrease activity in the parts of&#xD;
           the brain that respond to nicotine craving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine whether single pulse TMS can reduce cue-induced nicotine craving and use in&#xD;
      cigarette smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals 18 years of age and older who are physically healthy and have smoked 10 or&#xD;
           more cigarettes per day for at least 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A small group of healthy nonsmoking control subjects 18 years of age and older will also&#xD;
           participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will involve seven study visits and two follow-up visits. The control&#xD;
           participants will have only two visits: one with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan&#xD;
           and one with TMS to evaluate brain function and response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have an initial assessment about tobacco use habits and craving&#xD;
           patterns, and will provide blood and urine samples before beginning the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have two initial MRI brain scans. The first scan will look at the&#xD;
           structure of the brain at rest. During the other scan, participants will look at images&#xD;
           related to and not related to cigarette smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The single pulse TMS sessions (with either actual TMS or inactive [sham] TMS) will be&#xD;
           held daily for 5 consecutive days. Magnetic pulses will be triggered by&#xD;
           cigarette-related picture cues and delivered at varying intervals before the participant&#xD;
           sees a cigarette-related picture. During these testing visits, researchers will ask&#xD;
           questions related to tobacco use and craving, and collect urine and breath samples for&#xD;
           further study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have two follow-up visits, 1 week and 2 weeks after the TMS sessions,&#xD;
           to evaluate memory and mood, and will have one final MRI brain scan at the end of the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Primary objective: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) provides a non-invasive means of&#xD;
      inhibiting brain neural activity. This pilot study will test whether 5 days of single pulse&#xD;
      (sp) TMS reduces cue-induced nicotine craving and use in cigarette smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: We predict that active spTMS will significantly lower craving for nicotine&#xD;
      compared with sham spTMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Subjects will be up to 73 adult cigarette smokers (averaging greater than&#xD;
      or equal to 10 cigarettes daily for greater than or equal to one year) with current nicotine&#xD;
      dependence (based on DSM-IV criteria or Faerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence score greater&#xD;
      than or equal to 3). Subjects will not have other current major psychiatric disorders or&#xD;
      substance abuse. Subjects in the pilot phase (one fMRI and one TMS session to valid brain&#xD;
      mapping procedures) will be up to 25 healthy non-smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Following a baseline day to evaluate subject characteristics, subjects will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive 5 days of active or sham spTMS session. spTMS at strength 120&#xD;
      percent of the motor threshold will be applied to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) using a&#xD;
      figure-eight coil. Magnetic pulses will be triggered by cigarette-related pictorial cues and&#xD;
      delivered at varying intervals prior to presentation of a cigarette-related picture. TMS&#xD;
      pulses will not be delivered during emotionally salient images unrelated to nicotine or&#xD;
      emotionally neutral images. Brain site localization will use a computerized navigation system&#xD;
      based on functional and structural MRI scans obtained before the first session. Each session&#xD;
      (lasting around 20 minutes) will consist of 108 trials (cue presentations): 72 with&#xD;
      nicotine-associated cues and 18 each with non-drug-associated positive or neutral cues.&#xD;
      Subjects return for follow-up fMRI and behavioral assessments one and two weeks after the&#xD;
      final TMS session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure will be nicotine craving assessed with the&#xD;
      Tobacco Craving Questionnaire and visual analog scales before and after every TMS session and&#xD;
      at one- and two-week follow-up. Secondary outcome measures will include cigarette smoking&#xD;
      over the test period and at follow-up assessed by self-report, salivary cotinine levels, and&#xD;
      expired breath CO levels. A follow-up fMRI will evaluate changes in regional brain activity&#xD;
      associated with changes in craving and TMS treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits: Participants will not directly benefit from this study. This study may contribute&#xD;
      to better scientific understanding of nicotine addiction and development of better treatment&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks: The primary risks from TMS are transient headache, scalp discomfort, and hearing loss&#xD;
      (minimized by wearing ear plugs). Seizures are very rare when spTMS is administered within&#xD;
      accepted safety guidelines and individuals at increased risk of seizures are excluded. By&#xD;
      excluding individuals with a history of non-drug-induced mania/ hypomania we minimize the&#xD;
      risk of inducing a manic episode.&#xD;
