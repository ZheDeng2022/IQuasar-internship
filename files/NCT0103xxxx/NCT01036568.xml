      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Eye tracking, the ability to focus on and follow a moving target with the eyes, is often&#xD;
      difficult for people who have schizophrenia. Research has shown that first-degree relatives&#xD;
      of people with schizophrenia, such as parents and siblings, also tend to have difficulty with&#xD;
      smooth eye movement and eye tracking. Researchers are interested in using functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI) to study brain activity during eye tracking tests in order to better&#xD;
      understand the effect that schizophrenia has on brain function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study eye-tracking and eye-tracking impairments in people with and without&#xD;
      schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 62 years of age in one of three groups: (1) patients who have&#xD;
      been diagnosed with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder, (2) first-degree relatives of&#xD;
      patients in group 1, and (3) healthy volunteers with no family history of psychosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will involve two visits, one screening session and one testing session. Each&#xD;
           session will take about 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to avoid consuming alcohol and restrict consumption of&#xD;
           caffeine before the start of the study. Participants will provide urine and breath&#xD;
           samples to be tested for chemicals that may interfere with the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will visit the clinical center the morning of the day before the scanning&#xD;
           session to provide blood and urine samples as required. Participants will return and be&#xD;
           admitted for an overnight stay later that afternoon or evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the screening session, participants will provide a medical and psychological&#xD;
           history, provide blood samples, and learn the eye movement tasks they will do during the&#xD;
           scanning session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the scanning session, participants will have an fMRI scan. During the scan, they&#xD;
           will perform eye movement tasks that involve following moving light targets on a screen,&#xD;
           and will also perform other tasks that test the ability to think and pay attention.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed protocol aims to combine functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and SPEM&#xD;
      eyetracking measures to study 1) the neural circuit controlling the psychophysical,&#xD;
      cognitive, and oculomotor aspects of eyetracking; 2) the underlying neural mechanism of&#xD;
      schizophrenia-related eyetracking impairments; and 3) the degree to which pursuit-related&#xD;
      imaging changes aggregate in families. The human eye movement system is complex. It is likely&#xD;
      that only components of the system, rather than the whole system, are involved in the&#xD;
      pathology of schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three groups of subjects will be tested: schizophrenic patients (approximately n=60), full&#xD;
      siblings of patients (approximately n=60), and healthy controls without family history of&#xD;
      psychosis (approximately n=60). To reach this goal of 60 per group we expect to enroll 225&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiments in this protocol employ fMRI in combination with psychophysical and oculomotor&#xD;
      paradigms to dissect the neural correlates of the neurophysiological components controlling&#xD;
      pursuit eye movement. A high-resolution in-magnet eyetracking system will be used during&#xD;
      imaging. Using this imaging technology we will be able to associate behavioral performance&#xD;
      with specific brain regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combining fMRI and visual neuroscience techniques, this protocol will study the functional&#xD;
      neuroanatomic underpinnings of smooth pursuit eye movement (SPEM) deficits in schizophrenia.&#xD;
      We aim to establish a pathophysiological model of the illness based on the SPEM paradigm.&#xD;
      Such a disease model may provide safe in vivo examination of the effects of pharmacological&#xD;
      interventions, comorbidity, and functionality relating to schizophrenia. For example,&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia have high comorbidity of nicotine use. High incidence of&#xD;
      substance abuse in schizophrenia suggests that the two conditions may share some common&#xD;
      pathophysiology. Excessive nicotine use in schizophrenia is increasingly viewed as a form of&#xD;
      self-medication by patients to correct underlying pathophysiological changes caused by the&#xD;
      illness. We have found that nicotine can transiently improve smooth pursuit eye movement&#xD;
      deficits in patients. We are currently examining the nicotinic effect on the learning&#xD;
      components of smooth pursuit eye movement in schizophrenic patients using fMRI. This is an&#xD;
      example on how carefully validated behavioral/imaging paradigm can be used as a&#xD;
      pathophysiological model in aiding the study of complex brain illness including schizophrenia&#xD;
      and substance abuse. Clearly, this research direction also requires a parallel research&#xD;
      effort that aims at in-depth understanding of the foundational neural mechanism of the smooth&#xD;
      pursuit eye movement itself.&#xD;
