    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between cutaneous functional&#xD;
      unit(CFU)recruitment throughout the available active range of motion of a prescribed joint in&#xD;
      normal subjects and patients with burn scars. Specifically, this study will determine if&#xD;
      differences in CFU recruitment exist between normal subjects and individuals with burn scars&#xD;
      at the dorsal hand, dorsal or volar forearm, or anterior or posterior arm during active range&#xD;
      of motion of the MCP joint during flexion, or the wrist or elbow during flexion or extension,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;

      Specific Aim #1: To establish the relationship between joint position and skin recruitment,&#xD;
      expressed as the percentage of CFU recruited during active ROM, in patients with burn scars&#xD;
      and normal controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2: To establish the within-day and between-day reliability of percent CFU&#xD;
      estimation and absolute skin recruitment, measured in millimeters from a fixed reference,&#xD;
      during active ROM for a specified joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #3: To establish the relationship between scar height, measured by diagnostic&#xD;
      ultrasound, scar cross-sectional area, and percent CFU recruitment in individuals with burn&#xD;
      scar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #4: To determine whether the amount of skin recruitment, expressed as the&#xD;
      percent of the CFU recruited during active ROM, is differentially affected by burn scar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ho: There is no difference in the percent CFU recruited at the completion of active range of&#xD;
      motion at a specified joint between individuals with burn scars and normal controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ha: Individuals with burn scars recruit a greater percentage of the CFU in order to obtain&#xD;
      maximal range of motion at a specified joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #5: To determine whether the timing of skin recruitment, expressed as the&#xD;
      initiation of skin movement within a CFU relative to joint position during active ROM, is&#xD;
      differentially affected by burn scar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ho: There is no difference in the initiation of skin movement within a CFU relative to joint&#xD;
      position during active ROM at a specified joint between individuals with burn scars and&#xD;
      normal controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ha: In individuals with burn scars in a given CFU, skin movement farther from the joint axis&#xD;
      occurs earlier in the range of motion compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #6: To determine whether skin extensibility within a CFU during active ROM of a&#xD;
      specified joint is differentially affected by burn scar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ho: There is no difference skin extensibility within a CFU during active ROM of a specified&#xD;
      joint between individuals with burn scars and normal controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ha: In individuals with burn scars in a given CFU, skin near the joint axis undergoes greater&#xD;
      deformation (stretch) as range of motion at the joint increases compared to controls.&#xD;
