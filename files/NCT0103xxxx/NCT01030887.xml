  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many cancer survivors suffer symptoms such as fatigue and dyspnea which may persist for years&#xD;
      or months after their chemotherapy has finished. Despite the known benefits of exercise and&#xD;
      its potential to address many of the symptoms after cancer, the type of practical exercise&#xD;
      programme which best suits this population is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many exercise programmes performed in cancer survivors take place over many weeks or months&#xD;
      and include people with specific types of cancer. Such programmes may therefore not be&#xD;
      suitable for the majority of cancer survivors and would pose serious practical difficulties&#xD;
      with high drop-out rates and expensive resource consumption if they were extended into&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to run an 8-week exercise intervention in a mixed cancer population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: A brief, individually tailored 8-week intervention will increase fitness and&#xD;
      improve other physical symptoms in a mixed cancer survivor population after chemotherapy.&#xD;

      Background: Many cancer survivors suffer a range of physical and psychological symptoms with&#xD;
      may persist for years or months after treatment finishes. Despite the known benefits of&#xD;
      exercise and its potential to address many of these adverse effects of treatment, the role of&#xD;
      exercise as well as its optimum duration, frequency, and intensity in this population has yet&#xD;
      to be fully elucidated. Many cancer rehabilitation programmes presented in the literature are&#xD;
      very long, have tight eligibility criteria and are not likely to be practical in the majority&#xD;
      of cancer survivors. We plan to investigate a novel brief 8-week intervention which aims to&#xD;
      increase physical fitness, and address other physical symptoms in a heterogeneous cancer&#xD;
      survivor population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/design: Approximately 60 cancer survivors 2-6 months after completion of&#xD;
      chemotherapy, usually adjuvant, with curative intent will be recruited through oncology&#xD;
      clinics in a single institution and randomised to usual care or an exercise intervention. The&#xD;
      exercise intervention consists of two specifically tailored, supervised, moderate intensity&#xD;
      aerobic exercise sessions per week for 8 weeks. All participants will be assessed at baseline&#xD;
      (0 weeks), post intervention (8 weeks), and at 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome measure&#xD;
      is fitness, and secondary patient-related outcome measures include fatigue, quality of life,&#xD;
      and morphological outcomes. A further secondary outcome is process evaluation including&#xD;
      adherence to and compliance with the exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: This study will provide valuable information about the physical outcomes of this&#xD;
      8-week supervised aerobic programme. Additional process information and economic evaluation&#xD;
      will inform the feasibility of implementing this program in a heterogeneous population after&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment with curative intent.&#xD;
