  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to enable the study sponsor to assess the impact of a marketed or&#xD;
      validated blood test has on physicians' clinical treatment decision making when treating RA&#xD;
      patients who have been taking methotrexate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultimately, the blood test will allow treating physicians to modify current methotrexate&#xD;
      therapy in partially responding Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients' therapy, on an&#xD;
      individualized basis, as a means of improving clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study requires a blood sample from RA patients who have been on methotrexate therapy for&#xD;
      a minimum of 3 months and are having an inadequate response to therapy. Physicians will then&#xD;
      be provided with the results of the test indicating the methotrexate polyglutamate (active&#xD;
      metabolites of methotrexate) levels in the patient's red blood cells as a means to help&#xD;
      determine whether a patient's exposure to methotrexate has been optimized.&#xD;

      This study is currently enrolling individuals who have an established diagnosis of RA and are&#xD;
      receiving methotrexate as part of their therapy. Patients are required to submit a blood&#xD;
      sample. There is no cost to volunteers who participate.&#xD;
