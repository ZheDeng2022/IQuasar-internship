    <textblock>
      Females who participate in cutting and landing sports suffer anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)&#xD;
      injuries at a 2 to 10-fold greater rate than males participating in the same high-risk&#xD;
      sports. Fifty to 100 percent of ACL injured females will suffer osteoarthritis of the injured&#xD;
      knee within one to two decades of the injury. External knee abduction moment (LOAD) predicts&#xD;
      ACL injury with high sensitivity and specificity in female athletes. Control of lateral trunk&#xD;
      motion (LTM) also predicts ACL injury with similar levels of sensitivity and specificity in&#xD;
      female athletes. These predictors may be linked, as lateral positioning of the trunk can&#xD;
      create high knee abduction load via both biomechanical and neuromuscular mechanisms. The&#xD;
      mechanism of ACL injury in females include high knee LOAD and high LTM, with the majority of&#xD;
      body weight shifted over the injured limb and the foot positioned lateral to the body's&#xD;
      center of mass. An unanticipated perturbation is also often a contributor to the injury&#xD;
      mechanism. LTM may result in increased knee LOAD by increasing the lateral position and&#xD;
      magnitude of the GRF vector (ΔGRFv) or by increasing reactive hip adductor torque (HAdT). Our&#xD;
      long-term objectives are to determine the mechanisms that cause ACL injury in female athletes&#xD;
      and to develop neuromuscular training (NMT) interventions that specifically target these&#xD;
      mechanisms. If the objectives of this proposal are achieved, an evidence-based NMT&#xD;
      intervention will be developed and made available nationally that will effectively and&#xD;
      efficiently reduce ACL injury risk in high-risk female athletes. The major goal of this&#xD;
      proposal is to determine if increased LTM increases coronal plane knee load in high-risk&#xD;
      groups of female athletes.&#xD;

      1. Specific Aim 1 Determine the mechanisms by which trunk motion increases knee load in&#xD;
           females.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Rationale Aim 1 Knee external abduction moment (LOAD) and lateral trunk motion (LTM) are&#xD;
           known to be strong predictors of ACL injury risk in female athletes, but it is not known&#xD;
           whether these predictors are linked and which athletes are at increased risk. In&#xD;
           addition, we do not know the specific neuromuscular mechanisms that predispose these&#xD;
           athletes to greater risk of injury. Neuromuscular control of the trunk will be examined&#xD;
           relative to GRF position and magnitude, hip torque and knee LOAD. We will determine if&#xD;
           increased ΔGRFv and increased relative hip adductor torque (HAdT) underlie increased&#xD;
           knee LOAD in females.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Central Hypothesis Aim 1 Lateral trunk motion will increase knee LOAD in female athletes&#xD;
           by increased ΔGRFv, increased HAdT or by a combination of these two mechanisms during&#xD;
           cutting and landing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 1.1. Increased LTM induced by unanticipated lateral cutting will increase&#xD;
           knee LOAD by increasing ΔGRFv, adjusting for HAdT, in female athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 1.2. Increased LTM induced by single-leg medial drop landing will increase&#xD;
           knee LOAD by increasing HAdT, adjusting for ΔGRFv, in female athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 1.3. Increased LTM induced by combined drop landing and unanticipated lateral&#xD;
           cutting will result in combinatorial increases in knee LOAD by increasing ΔGRFv and HAdT&#xD;
           in female athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 1.4 Females with low ΔGRFv, low HAdT, and low knee LOAD will form a distinct&#xD;
           group or cluster of subjects, those with high ΔGRFv or HAdT and moderate LOAD will form&#xD;
           another cluster, and those with high ΔGRFv, high HAdT and high LOAD will form the last&#xD;
           distinct group using data collected during DLUC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Specific Aim 2 Determine if NMT that decreases coronal plane trunk motion will decrease&#xD;
           knee abduction LOAD in a double-blind cluster (by school and team) randomized controlled&#xD;
           trial (RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale Aim 2 This aim will determine how NMT targeted to LTM and its two knee loading&#xD;
      mechanisms, ΔGRFv and HAdT, will affect knee LOAD in low, moderate and high LOAD subgroups of&#xD;
      female athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central Hypotheses Aim 2 NMT will increase control of coronal plane trunk motion and decrease&#xD;
      knee LOAD by either mechanical (ΔGRFv), neuromuscular (HAdT) or both mechanisms and pre-test&#xD;
      low, moderate and high knee LOAD subgroups of female athletes will demonstrate differential&#xD;
      effects of NMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2.1 Knee LOAD will be lower in trained than untrained females during landing and&#xD;
      cutting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2.2 Post-test knee LOAD will not differ in trained high, moderate and low knee&#xD;
      LOAD subgroups. Hypothesis 2.3 Post-test ΔGRFv and HAdT will not differ in trained high,&#xD;
      moderate and low LOAD subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2.3 Post-test knee LOAD, ΔGRFv and HAdT values will not differ from pre-test&#xD;
      values in untrained high, moderate and low knee LOAD subgroups.&#xD;

      A. Specific Aims The Specific Aims have not been modified from the original application. Our&#xD;
      long-term goals are to determine the mechanisms by which female athletes become more&#xD;
      susceptible to ACL injury and to develop interventions that address these mechanisms in order&#xD;
      to reduce knee loads and ACL injury risk. The major goal of this proposal is to determine if&#xD;
      decreased neuromuscular control of the trunk increases coronal plane knee load in high-risk&#xD;
      groups of females. This overall objective of this application is to test the central&#xD;
      hypotheses that lateral trunk motion increases knee load and that neuromuscular training that&#xD;
      increases control of trunk motion will decrease knee abduction loading in females with&#xD;
      moderate and high knee loads. Our rationale for this project is that its successful&#xD;
      completion will provide a strong, evidence-based intervention that will effectively decrease&#xD;
      ACL injury risk in high-risk female athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Studies and Results&#xD;
&#xD;
      We continue to utilize a prospective randomized controlled design for Specific Aims 1 and 2&#xD;
      as outlined in the original funded application. The Boone County Superintendent and the Boone&#xD;
      County School Board approved the participation (testing, busing, randomized intervention,&#xD;
      etc) of the school systems' girls' athletic programs (Basketball, Soccer and Volleyball) at&#xD;
      their monthly school board meeting on Thursday, June 11, 2009 and pre-testing began on&#xD;
      September 1, 2009. As outlined, school-sponsored basketball, soccer and volleyball teams from&#xD;
      the Boone County, Kentucky school system have been and are almost completely recruited,&#xD;
      tested and tracked. Testing will be completed by December 31, 2010. Female subjects from all&#xD;
      the county high school and junior high schools are being screened prior to the start of their&#xD;
      basketball and soccer and volleyball seasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 23 teams yielding 318 basketball players have been pre-screened and trained and&#xD;
      post-screened September 1, 2009 through April 30, 2010. A total of 29 teams of approximately&#xD;
      306 soccer and volleyball players (31 of which were not new athletes and were tested in prior&#xD;
      basketball season) were pre-screened, trained and post-screened between May 2010 and December&#xD;
      2010. We have faced challenges recruiting soccer players at the junior high school level in&#xD;
      the county school system. Some of the junior high schools do not have organized soccer teams.&#xD;
      We are addressing this challenge by recruiting volleyball teams within the county in order to&#xD;
      fill in all of our randomized blocks. In addition, we will capture those athletes that will&#xD;
      go on to play high school soccer, volleyball and basketball within the Fayette county school&#xD;
      system (see supplement summary below). Thus far, we have enrolled and pretested (N=31 tested&#xD;
      for both seasons) and tested a total of 593 athletes for our randomized controlled trial from&#xD;
      9/1/09 through 12/31/10. The breakdown by sport and school level is summarized in the&#xD;
      Enrollment Table. There were 558 athletes made the cuts on their respective teams who were&#xD;
      randomized by cluster (team) into the intervention. This number includes all athletes who&#xD;
      completed at least 1 intervention training session. 523 athletes had full data sets for&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the initial biomechanical analyses, we have chosen to focus on Hypothesis 1.4 with the&#xD;
      use Latent Profile Analysis (LPA). We will use LPA to examine whether we can cluster subjects&#xD;
      with similar characteristics of the GRFv, HAdT, hip moments (minimum and maximum), lateral&#xD;
      trunk motion and center of gravity displacement into distinct neuromuscular profiles. Our&#xD;
      latent profile analyses will evaluate independent variables across the multiple tasks to form&#xD;
      groups of girls with similar neuromuscular patterns for these variables where the&#xD;
      heterogeneity of response pattern is minimized within each profile and maximized across&#xD;
      profiles. Initially, two profiles are specified for the LPA model, then, in a stepwise&#xD;
      fashion, the number of profiles specified is increased by one. At each step, changes in&#xD;
      Bayesian information criteria (BIC), adjusted for sample size, is used to assess model fit&#xD;
      and identify the number of profiles needed. The point at which the number of profiles is&#xD;
      deemed adequate is when no significant drop in BIC is seen when the profile number is&#xD;
      increased. In addition, the Lo-Mendell-Rubin adjusted likelihood ratio test is used to&#xD;
      determine the optimal number of profiles.(Lo 2001) The analysis was implemented using Mplus&#xD;
      5.(Muthen 2007) Validation of profile group includes examination as an independent predictor&#xD;
      of LOAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis has begun and profiles have been created for the pre-test movements. Graphs&#xD;
      depicting the standardized means along with the 2 generalized profiles are shown in Figure 1.&#xD;
      For presentation purposes it is necessary to show the standardized values as the variables&#xD;
      are on different scales, with hugely varying mean values. Due to the underlying normality&#xD;
      assumption, it was necessary to transform the lateral trunk motion variable to the loge&#xD;
      scale. In addition, it is necessary to account for the correlation between some of these&#xD;
      variables; in particular maximum hip moment and GRFv and HAdT. We are continuing to examine&#xD;
      the potential LPA models at this time and will be checking them against the post intervention&#xD;
      data to determine any emergent profiles. Comparison of mean KAM, with and without adjustment&#xD;
      for age and pubertal status by profile will also be the focus of future analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Figure 1. Profile analysis of Pre-Test Data Set (N=457) In addition, we have performed this&#xD;
      initial assessment of the efficacy of the Randomized controlled intervention and will be&#xD;
      presenting these initial results (The effect of Trunk focused Neuromuscular training on Hip&#xD;
      Strength) at a national meeting this coming July.&#xD;
