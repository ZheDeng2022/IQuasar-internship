      Randomized, controlled, double-blind, multicenter phase II study comparing risedronate 35mg&#xD;
      (ActonelR 35mg weekly tablet) versus placebo in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis&#xD;
      (AS) treated with standard first and second-line therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary efficacy endpoint: Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI). The&#xD;
      time schedule for performing the BASDAI was at screening, upon inclusion (T0), then after 3,&#xD;
      6 and 12 months or at the time of premature withdrawal in case of drop-out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical endpoints: The secondary efficacy measures were the following: Bath Ankylosing&#xD;
           Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) , Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index&#xD;
           (BASMI), ASAS (Assessments in Ankylosing Spondylitis) Working Group core set of domains,&#xD;
           Spinal pain VAS, ESR, CRP and the percentage of patients achieving 20% or greater&#xD;
           decrease in each of these parameters. These parameters were determined at T0, T3, T6,&#xD;
           T12 or at the time of premature withdrawal in case of drop-out. The spinal pain assessed&#xD;
           by VAS was also done at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DEXA: Dual Energy X-Ray-Absorptiometry (DEXA) measurements were performed in all&#xD;
           patients upon inclusion (T0) and at the end of the study (T12).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biochemical markers: selected biochemical markers of bone metabolism were measured at&#xD;
           T0, T3, T6 and T12 or at the time of premature withdrawal in case of drop-out using&#xD;
           commercially available kits. Bone formation was assessed by serum bone-specific alkaline&#xD;
           phosphatase (BAP) and osteocalcin (OC) levels using commercially available kits. Bone&#xD;
           resorption was assessed in serum by the C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen&#xD;
           degradation (Crosslaps R) and urinary N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen&#xD;
           degradation (Osteomark R).&#xD;
