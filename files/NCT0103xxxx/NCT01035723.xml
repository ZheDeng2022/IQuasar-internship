      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - New research on genetics and the human genome has helped to identify certain genes that&#xD;
      affect specific parts of the brain, including the parts that may be involved in drug use and&#xD;
      dependency. Researchers are interested in studying both genetic information and brain&#xD;
      activity to better understand variations in brain function among individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study brain activity in conjunction with specific genetic information provided by&#xD;
      healthy volunteers including smokers, non-smokers, people with drug dependence, and those who&#xD;
      do not have any dependence on any substance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy volunteers between 18 and 50 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is an 8 10 hour study which may be completed in 1, 2, or 3 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete questionnaires about emotional and psychological responses to&#xD;
           different situations, including stressful situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a training session in a mock (fake) scanner to practice tasks to&#xD;
           be completed in the real scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have the following two types of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans&#xD;
           in one scan session of the brain:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A structural MRI scan to provide basic information about each participant's brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A functional MRI scanning session, in which participants will perform a memory task to&#xD;
           provide information about brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide blood samples for research and testing....&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional genetic polymorphisms have been identified that influence the morphology and&#xD;
      function of brain regions that have been implicated in addictive and neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      disorders. This protocol aims to integrate genotyping with both structural and functional&#xD;
      brain imaging to investigate the impact of specific functional polymorphisms on morphology&#xD;
      and function of the amygdala and the hippocampus and on behavior mediated by these brain&#xD;
      regions. Functional polymorphisms of the BDNF, SLC6A4, and DISC1 genes will be studied, as&#xD;
      these are logical candidates to influence variability in brain morphology and function. The&#xD;
      overall hypothesis is that variation in morphology and function of the amygdala and the&#xD;
      hippocampus is explained, at least in part, by specific genotype differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of healthy male and female adult volunteers (18-50 years&#xD;
      old).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After being medically cleared and giving written informed consent, each participant will&#xD;
      undergo a structural MRI scan of the brain to be used for volumetric measurements of the&#xD;
      amygdala, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and intracranial cavity. Each participant will&#xD;
      undergo an fMRI scanning session, which will include an emotional context memory task&#xD;
      specifically designed to require functioning of the amygdala and the hippocampus. A venous&#xD;
      blood sample will be collected for genotyping of BDNF, SLC6A4, and DISC1 polymorphisms.&#xD;
      Additionally, other functional polymorphisms that may influence brain structure may also be&#xD;
      evaluated, in exploratory fashion. If participants have already had a blood sample collected&#xD;
      for the genetics portion of another Neuroimaging Research Branch study, they may not need to&#xD;
      have another sample taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will provide no direct benefits to research participants. Understanding the&#xD;
      relationship between genetic polymorphisms and brain morphology and their association to&#xD;
      brain function and behavior may provide further clues to the neurobiological mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying addictive and neuropsychiatric disorders. The potential risks are related to&#xD;
      acquiring MRI scans in general. Medical supervision will be provided throughout the study.&#xD;
