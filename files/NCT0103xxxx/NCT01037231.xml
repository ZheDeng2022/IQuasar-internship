          1. Signed informed consent (as applicable for the age of the subject)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female subjects ≥ 2 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A mean urinary oxalate excretion of &gt; 1.0 mmol/1.73m2/day from eligible urine&#xD;
             collections performed during screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A diagnosis of PH I or PH II by one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Liver biopsy confirmation of deficient liver specific peroxisomal&#xD;
                  alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase, (AGT) or mislocalization of AGT from&#xD;
                  peroxisomes to mitochondria (PH I) or deficient glyoxylate&#xD;
                  reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR) activity (PH II)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for a known mutation in the causative&#xD;
                  genes for PH I and PH II.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Increased glycolate excretion for PH I or increased L-glycerate excretion for PH&#xD;
                  II.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects receiving pyridoxine must be receiving a stable dose for at least 3 months&#xD;
             prior to entry into the study and must remain on the stable dose during the study.&#xD;
             Subjects not receiving pyridoxine at study entry must be willing to refrain from&#xD;
             initiating pyridoxine during study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Renal function defined as an estimated GFR ≥ 40 ml/min normalized to 1.73m2 body&#xD;
             surface area, or a creatinine clearance of ≥ 40 ml/min normalized to 1.73m2 body&#xD;
             surface area.&#xD;
&#xD;

             transdermal, injectable, or implanted contraceptives, IUD, abstinence, use of a condom&#xD;
             by the sexual partner or sterile sexual partner) for 30 days prior to the first dose&#xD;
             of OxabactTM and must agree to continue using such precautions during the clinical&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Presence of a medical condition that the Principal Investigator considers likely to&#xD;
             make the subject susceptible to adverse effect of study treatment or unable to follow&#xD;
             study procedures. Note: Subjects from correctional facilities or asylums and subjects&#xD;
             who are mentally handicapped are not to be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Participation in any study of an investigational product, biologic, device, or other&#xD;
