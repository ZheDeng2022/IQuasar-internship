    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced cirrhosis have abnormal translocation of Gram-negative bacteria across&#xD;
      the intestinal barrier and subsequent systemic inflammatory response. We hypothesized that&#xD;
      this translocation may worsen the underlying liver disease. Thus, the aim of this trial was&#xD;
      to assess the effects of the oral administration of norfloxacin (an antibiotic that&#xD;
      suppresses intestinal Gram-negative bacteria) on the development of complications of&#xD;
      cirrhosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intestinal translocation of Gram-negative bacteria occurs in patients with advanced&#xD;
      cirrhosis. Long-term oral administration of 400 mg/day of norfloxacin (a fluoroquinolone&#xD;
      antibiotic) is known to induce selective intestinal decontamination against Gram-negative&#xD;
      bacteria. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral norfloxacin (400&#xD;
      mg/day for 1 year) has been conducted in a small series of patients with advanced cirrhosis&#xD;
      and low ascitic fluid protein concentrations &lt;1.5 g/dL. This trial showed that norfloxacin&#xD;
      therapy significantly increased the 1-year probability of being free of a first episode of&#xD;
      spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and improved 3-month survival. In this previous&#xD;
      study, oral norfloxacin therapy was also found to decrease the risk of development of&#xD;
      hepatorenal syndrome, a very severe complication of cirrhosis. It has been suggested that&#xD;
      bacterial translocation, through the release of bacterial byproducts, results in systemic&#xD;
      inflammation and subsequent systemic vasodilation which precipitates hepatorenal syndrome.&#xD;
      Since systemic vasodilation plays a role in the development of ascites, bacterial byproducts&#xD;
      via circulatory alterations may contribute to mechanisms leading to ascites formation. It is&#xD;
      important to note that a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral&#xD;
      administration of the quinolone ciprofloxacin (500 mg/day for 1 year) has been conducted in a&#xD;
      small series of patients with moderately severe cirrhosis, low ascitic fluid protein&#xD;
      concentrations (&lt;1.5 g/dL) and no prior history of SBP. However, ciprofloxacin therapy did&#xD;
      not significantly increase the 1-year probability of being free of SBP. Taken together the&#xD;
      findings of these 2 previous small-size trials suggest that long-term oral quinolone therapy&#xD;
      is effective mainly in patients with severe cirrhosis. This is why we decided to perform a&#xD;
      large multicenter, randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled trial assessing the effects of&#xD;
      norfloxacin on survival in patients with cirrhosis and severe liver failure (Child-Pugh grade&#xD;
      C). In addition, the effects of norfloxacin on the development of main complications of&#xD;
      cirrhosis will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be 6-month survival. The secondary outcome measures will be&#xD;
      the proportion of transplanted patients, the occurrence of complications (bacterial&#xD;
      infection, renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy and gastrointestinal bleeding). All adult&#xD;
      patients with severe cirrhosis might be randomized after written consent. Pregnant persons;&#xD;
      patient who has been treated with a quinolone in the month before the inclusion, allergy to&#xD;
      quinolones, hepatocellular carcinoma, or HIV infection will not be included. Patients receive&#xD;
      either norfloxacin or placebo once a day for 6 months. Three hundred and ninety-two patients&#xD;
      are necessary to decrease 6-month mortality rate from 40% in the placebo group to 25% in the&#xD;
      norfloxacin group with a beta risk of 90% and an alpha risk of 5%. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed-up every month during 6 months and at 9 and 12 months.&#xD;
