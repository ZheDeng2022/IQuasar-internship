    <textblock>
      The &quot;one-stop&quot; hybrid coronary revascularization combines minimally invasive direct coronary&#xD;
      artery bypass (MIDCAB) and PCI to be performed in the hybrid operating suite, an enhanced&#xD;
      operating room equipped with radiographic capability. This study is to compare 1-year&#xD;
      clinical outcomes of &quot;one-stop&quot; hybrid coronary revascularization with off-pump coronary&#xD;
      artery bypass (OPCAB) in selected patients with multivessel coronary artery disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      - With the development of specialized devices and experience, off-pump coronary artery bypass&#xD;
      (OPCAB) has been a well-established less invasive technique for coronary revascularization.&#xD;
      Compared with conventional on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), OPCAB avoids the&#xD;
      use of cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic arrest, and is associated with decreased&#xD;
      morbidity, shorter length of stay in ICU and hospital, and less perioperative complications,&#xD;
      especially in elderly patients with severe comorbidities. &quot;One-stop&quot; (also named&#xD;
      simultaneous) hybrid coronary revascularization is also a novel, safe and feasible minimally&#xD;
      invasive approach in selected patients with multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD). It&#xD;
      allows surgical and interventional procedures to be performed consecutively in the &quot;one-stop&quot;&#xD;
      hybrid operating suite, an enhanced operating room equipped with radiographic capability,&#xD;
      wherein the left intramammary artery (LIMA) is placed on the left anterior descending artery&#xD;
      (LAD) by minimally invasive procedure, immediately followed by percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention/stenting on the non-LAD lesions. However, few studies are now available on the&#xD;
      outcomes of coronary revascularization between the new hybrid strategy with conventional&#xD;
      OPCAB. This study is a single center randomized clinical trial to compare 1-year clinical&#xD;
      outcomes of &quot;one-stop&quot; hybrid coronary revascularization with OPCAB in selected patients with&#xD;
      multivessel CAD with suitable coronary anatomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - We examined the results of SYNTAX trial and of our institution published previously. The&#xD;
      1-year MACCE rate (the primary endpoint) is estimated as being 13% for OPCAB. The sample&#xD;
      calculated for this trial is 400 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design/Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Trial design: A single center randomized clinical trial comparing &quot;one-stop&quot; hybrid&#xD;
      procedure versus conventional OPCAB in 400 patients with suitable anatomy who need&#xD;
      revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Patients will be randomized to undergo either &quot;one-stop&quot; hybrid procedure or&#xD;
      conventional OPCAB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Randomization: Patients will be evaluated by both a cardiac surgeon and an interventional&#xD;
      cardiologist. After obtaining informed written consent, patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive &quot;one-stop&quot; hybrid procedure or conventional OPCAB. An expertise-based randomization&#xD;
      will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data adjudicators will be blinded to the study. Due to the nature of this study, the&#xD;
      operating surgeons, cardiologists, anesthetists, other operative room staff, and ICU staff&#xD;
      will not be blind in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Candidates will be randomized to receive &quot;one-stop&quot; hybrid procedure or conventional OPCAB.&#xD;
