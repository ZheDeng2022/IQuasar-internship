      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People who are in treatment for substance abuse often feel distress during the withdrawal&#xD;
      period and afterward. Some individuals feel distress more acutely than others, and this&#xD;
      distress has been linked to poor treatment outcomes and increased risk of relapse in smokers,&#xD;
      alcoholics, and cocaine- and heroin-dependent individuals. More research is needed on the&#xD;
      effects of distress on the brain, particularly in individuals who are seeking treatment for&#xD;
      substance abuse. Researchers are interested in using functional magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (fMRI) scanning to study distress tolerance in both substance users seeking treatment and&#xD;
      healthy non-drug-using volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To use functional magnetic resonance imaging to study the effectiveness of a distress&#xD;
      tolerance assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 50 years of age who are either cocaine dependent or healthy&#xD;
      non-drug-using volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study involves an initial screening visit and a scanning visit, with four followup&#xD;
           visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, as well&#xD;
           as blood samples and questionnaires about mood and past and current drug use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a structural MRI scan of the brain to provide a baseline reading&#xD;
           for comparison. Participants will then have an fMRI scanning session, which will include&#xD;
           both the distress tolerance assessment and relevant control tasks. Heart rate, blood&#xD;
           pressure, and other physical reactions will be monitored throughout the scan.&#xD;
           Participants will also provide blood and saliva samples to measure stress hormone&#xD;
           levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be eligible to have followup assessments with fMRI scanning 1, 3, 6,&#xD;
           and 12 months after the scanning visit.&#xD;

      Objective: The primary objective of the current study is to implement a distress tolerance&#xD;
      assessment for use in fMRI to determine the neurobiological differences between individuals&#xD;
      with low and high distress tolerance. Additionally, other biological and physiological&#xD;
      indicators will be assessed, including genetic polymorphisms, salivary cortisol, galvanic&#xD;
      skin response, and blood pressure. The overall hypothesis is that individuals with low&#xD;
      distress tolerance will exhibit hyperactivation in the extended amygdala and hypoactivation&#xD;
      of the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex when experiencing affective distress&#xD;
      and failure during a stressful task, as compared to individuals with high distress tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: The study population will consist of healthy male and female adult&#xD;
      volunteers (18-55 years old), as well as an otherwise healthy sample of male and female&#xD;
      treatment seeking substance users with cocaine users (18-55 years old) (see exclusion&#xD;
      criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design and Methods: After being medically cleared and giving written informed&#xD;
      consent, each participant will undergo a structural MRI scan of the brain, and undergo an&#xD;
      fMRI scanning session, which will include administration of the distress tolerance and&#xD;
      relevant control tasks. Physiological response to the tasks, including heart rate, blood&#xD;
      pressure, galvanic skin conductance, and salivary cortisol concentrations will be monitored&#xD;
      throughout the fMRI scan. Follow-up assessments on control and cocaine dependent participants&#xD;
      will occur at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the baseline assessment. Genetic data collected&#xD;
      under the aegis of protocol 10-DA-N457 will be compared with data collected under this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: Outcome measures include distress tolerance measured as latency in seconds&#xD;
      to task termination on each of the distress tolerance tasks, neural indices of distress&#xD;
      tolerance (for all participants), and substance use treatment outcomes (for cocaine users)&#xD;
      including relapse to drug use, latency to first cocaine use, and number of substance use days&#xD;
      per week at follow-ups.&#xD;

             clinically significant infectious diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have current major psychiatric disorders to include, but not limited to, mood,&#xD;
             anxiety, borderline personality disorder, psychotic disorders, or substance-induced&#xD;
             psychiatric disorders,&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Cocaine using participants:&#xD;

                  be preferable to exclude individuals whose use of other substances reaches the&#xD;
                  threshold of abuse, inclusion of such individuals will not necessarily&#xD;
