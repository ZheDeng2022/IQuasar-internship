    <textblock>
      The role of oxytocin (OT) is already known in the regulation of satiety but some clinical&#xD;
      studies demonstrated that OT participates also in the regulation of social behavior by its&#xD;
      implication on a better comprehension of emotion which plays a role on theory of mind and&#xD;
      empathy. By the way, these 2 behaviors are deviants for patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome&#xD;
      (PWS). Actually, no study was led on the effect of OT on PWS patients but Swaab and al in&#xD;
      1995 showed a significant reduction in number and in volume of neurons expressing OT in the&#xD;
      paraventricular nucleus of PWS patients. Recent data were obtained studying OT in patients&#xD;
      with autism which showed a link between the deregulation of OT and the autistic pathology.&#xD;
      Clinical and imaging studies obtained with PWS and autistic populations make us believe that&#xD;
      some mechanisms are common between these two pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to look for an influence on the understanding of the social codes of the PWS patients,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to look for an influence on the behavior of stress and anxiety and on the regulation of&#xD;
           eating habits when patients receive a nasal pulverizing of OT.&#xD;

      Recent clinical studies showed that the oxytocin (OT), next to its long-time known actions&#xD;
      (lactation, satiety), participates in the regulation of the social behavior. Swaab and al in&#xD;
      1995 showed a significant reduction in number and in volume of neurons expressing OT in the&#xD;
      paraventricular nucleus of PWS patients. Recent data suggest a link between OT and the&#xD;
      autistic pathology: the existence of a lower plasmatic rate on OT and the association with a&#xD;
      polymorphism of the OT's receptor for autistics patients. Because OT has a role on the&#xD;
      pro-social behavior and on the nervous control of the stress, the hypothesis on which a&#xD;
      deficit in OT would play a role in the abnormalities of the social behavior was advanced.&#xD;
      Moreover, certain features of the autistic spectrum disorder can be found in PWS patients.&#xD;
      Moreover, a recent study has shown that OT administered by intra-nasal spray reduces&#xD;
      psychosocial stress and increases the confidence in each other in healthy volunteers. The PWS&#xD;
      is a genetic pathology and some clinical features are very similar to the autistic pathology.&#xD;
      The PWS is the most common cause of syndromic autism. Data from the literature and a&#xD;
      collaborative study conducted between our team and the Prof. B. Rogé's team suggests that&#xD;
      these two pathologies share common pathophysiological mechanisms. To our knowledge, no study&#xD;
      with the OT was conducted in people with PWS. We want to conduct a pilot study in adult&#xD;
      patients with PWS. Given the severity of this disease, related to socialization disorders,&#xD;
      significant anxiety and overeating, and with no effective therapy, this justifies the pilot&#xD;
      study. Moreover, side effects of OT are almost nonexistent when used by intra-nasal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The objectives of this project are to investigate whether the administration by&#xD;
      intra-nasal spray of OT plays a role on the understanding of social codes of PWS adult&#xD;
      patients. We also analyze its effect on the level of stress, anxiety and eating behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: This study is a double blind control study. We will include 24 PWS patients,&#xD;
      aged over 18 years recruited at the Hendaye Marine Hospital (associated with the PWS&#xD;
      reference center whose coordination is in Toulouse). The hospital routinely receives PWS&#xD;
      adults for a 4 weeks stay which gives optimal conditions for the establishment of this study.&#xD;
      Patients are separated into 2 groups matched one by one on the sex and IQ. One group receives&#xD;
      the OT, the other a placebo. Forty five minutes after inhalation, all of the patients are&#xD;
      evaluated on their social comprehension thanks to psychometric tests. Furthermore, an&#xD;
      analysis based on observation sheets allows us to score daily stress, anxiety and eating&#xD;
      behavior. These sheets serve for the comparison between 2 days before and 2 days after the&#xD;
      nasal spray on the above described scoring components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Differences between the two groups will be statistically analyzed by non parametric&#xD;
      statistical tests such as Mann-Whitney's test.&#xD;
