      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) uses a standardized set of procedures to&#xD;
      develop a pool of potential participants for research studies. Because some of the data&#xD;
      collected during screening are used later for research, the screening itself is considered a&#xD;
      study. An applicant to any NIDA study is considered a participant in NIDA screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To identify, recruit, and screen participants for NIDA research protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals 18 years of age and older who are able to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals who are eligible for screening will undergo two interviews: a telephone&#xD;
           interview and an in-person interview. The phone interview will determine eligibility for&#xD;
           the in-person interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The in-person interview may require up to five visits to NIDA. The in-person visit will&#xD;
           involve any or all of the following procedures: (1) full physical examination and&#xD;
           medical history; (2) psychiatric interview; (3) psychological testing; (4)&#xD;
           electrocardiogram; (5) samples of blood, urine, and hair; and (6) other minimally&#xD;
           invasive procedures as directed by the research staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During screening, a photograph will be taken for confirmation of identity during&#xD;
           subsequent visits for other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No clinical care will be provided as part of screening.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Through its clinical research protocols, the NIDA IRP attempts to: elucidate the nature of&#xD;
      drug abuse and addiction; determine the potential use of new therapies, both pharmacological&#xD;
      and psychosocial; and decipher the long-term effects of drugs of abuse on the development,&#xD;
      maturation, function, and structure of the brain and other organ systems. In support of the&#xD;
      IRP's work, the scientific goal of this screening protocol is to assess potential research&#xD;
      participants' eligibility for NIDA IRP research studies. Screening will include medical and&#xD;
      psychological tests and procedures. The data collected during screening are a unique and&#xD;
      valuable source of information that aids in NIDA's mission. Therefore, a secondary goal of&#xD;
      this protocol is to obtain data that characterizes the population of subjects contacting NIDA&#xD;
      about research participation and to analyze data so obtained, such as that on the prevalence&#xD;
      and consequences of HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, and related diseases.&#xD;
