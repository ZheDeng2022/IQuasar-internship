      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to delineate and measure the symptom burden experienced by&#xD;
      patients with ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary Aim is to develop and validate an ovarian-cancer module of the M. D. Anderson&#xD;
      Symptom Inventory (MDASI-Ovarian Cancer) to measure the severity of multiple symptoms and the&#xD;
      impact of these symptoms on daily functioning in patients with ovarian cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Secondary Aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop a detailed description of symptom severity and interference with daily activities&#xD;
      experienced by patients with ovarian cancer; To assess the impact of symptom severity on&#xD;
      standard functioning and quality of life (QOL) measures, including Eastern Cooperative&#xD;
      Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovary&#xD;
      (FACT-O), and a single-item QOL scale, in patients with ovarian cancer; To define the&#xD;
      qualitative symptom burden of patients with ovarian cancer receiving various treatments.&#xD;

      PART 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be interviewed about what it is like to&#xD;
      have ovarian cancer and any symptoms that you may have experienced. This will be a 1-on-1&#xD;
      interview with the study doctor or a member of the study staff. It will take place during 1&#xD;
      of your regularly scheduled, standard of care clinic visit and should take about 30 minutes&#xD;
      to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interview will be digitally recorded. The electronic recording of the interview will be&#xD;
      given a code number and stored on a password-protected computer at M. D. Anderson. No&#xD;
      identifying information will be directly linked to your interview recording. Only the&#xD;
      researcher in charge of the computer will have access to the code numbers and be able to link&#xD;
      the interview recording to you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the interview, you will also complete a symptom questionnaire, a quality-of-life&#xD;
      questionnaire, and a demographic questionnaire that asks questions about your age, race, and&#xD;
      marital status. You will complete the questionnaires after the interview during the same&#xD;
      clinic visit. It should take about 10 minutes to complete all 3 questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should contact the study doctor or study nurse right away if at any time you are&#xD;
      experiencing severe, troublesome, or intolerable symptoms. You should also remember to rate&#xD;
      them on the symptom questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires will also be given a code number and stored in a locked file cabinet at MD&#xD;
      Anderson. No identifying information will be directly linked to your questionnaires. Only the&#xD;
      researcher in charge of the study will have access to the code numbers and be able to link&#xD;
      the questionnaires to you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you have completed the interview and the questionnaires, your participation on this&#xD;
      study will be over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any information about your symptoms that is collected as part of this study is for research&#xD;
      purposes only. All study materials, including the interview recording and questionnaires,&#xD;
      will only be used for the purposes of this study and will be destroyed after the study&#xD;
      results have been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you rate a symptom as severe on the symptom questionnaire, a study staff member will ask&#xD;
      you if you have already told, or plan to tell your regular care doctor or nurse about the&#xD;
      symptom. If you have not already told you regular care doctor or nurse, a study staff member&#xD;
      will tell your regular care doctor or nurse about the symptom for you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 15 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will complete the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A symptom questionnaire, 2 quality-of-life questionnaires, and a demographic&#xD;
           questionnaire that asks questions about your age, race, and marital status. It should&#xD;
           take about 20 minutes to complete all 4 questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. About 1 to 5 days after you complete the first set of questionnaires, you will be asked&#xD;
           to complete a questionnaire either through phone interview with the study staff or&#xD;
           through a mail-in survey . If you complete the questionnaire by mail-in survey, the&#xD;
           study staff will give you a copy of the questionnaire and a stamped pre-addressed&#xD;
           envelope. The questionnaire will take 5-10 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should contact the study doctor or study nurse right away if at any time you are&#xD;
      experiencing severe, troublesome, or intolerable symptoms. You should also remember to rate&#xD;
      them on the symptom questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires will be given a code number and stored in a locked file cabinet at M. D.&#xD;
      Anderson. No identifying information will be directly linked to your questionnaires. Only the&#xD;
      researcher in charge of the study will have access to the code numbers and be able to link&#xD;
      the questionnaires to you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opinion Questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are one of the first 20 patients enrolled in the study, you will be asked questions&#xD;
      about your opinion of the symptom questionnaire. For example, you will be asked if the&#xD;
      symptom questionnaire was easy to understand and complete, and if there were any other&#xD;
      questions that should be included. The study staff will use your opinion to decide if changes&#xD;
      should be made to the questionnaire or if important symptom questions are missing from the&#xD;
      questionnaire. This questionnaire should take about 5 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you have completed the questionnaires, your participation on this study will be over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Information :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any information about your symptoms that is collected as part of this study is for research&#xD;
      purposes only. The questionnaires will only be used for the purposes of this study and will&#xD;
      be destroyed after the study results have been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you rate a symptom as severe on the symptom questionnaire, a study staff member will ask&#xD;
      you if you have already told, or plan to tell your regular care doctor or nurse about the&#xD;
      symptom. If you have not already told you regular care doctor or nurse, a study staff member&#xD;
      will tell your regular care doctor or nurse about the symptom for you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 128 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson and&#xD;
      Lyndon B. Johnson General Hospital.&#xD;
