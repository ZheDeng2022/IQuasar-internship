      The study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Replagal® (agalsidase alfa) at a dose of&#xD;
      0.2 mg/kg infused intravenously (IV) over 40 minutes, every other week. The study will&#xD;
      monitor the course of disease in males and females with Fabry disease who are naive to&#xD;
      treatment or were previously treated with agalsidase beta (Fabrazyme®).&#xD;

      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Replagal in patients with Fabry disease&#xD;
      who are either naive to treatment, who were previously treated with agalsidase beta, or who&#xD;
      had previously received Replagal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed with Fabry disease who have not previously received treatment, who have&#xD;
      received agalsidase beta, or who had previously received Replagal will be eligible to enroll&#xD;
      in the study and will receive Replagal at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg body weight administered by an&#xD;
      IV infusion over 40 minutes every other week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits will occur in 3 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening/Baseline Phase: A Screening/Baseline period (Day -30 to Day -1) to determine&#xD;
           eligibility and obtain baseline measurements. Patients who have previously received&#xD;
           agalsidase beta will be tested for the presence of anti-agalsidase beta antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Phase: A 12-month treatment phase during which all patients will receive&#xD;
           Replagal administered IV every other week. Clinical assessments will occur at Months 1,&#xD;
           3, 6, 9, and 12. The study may be extended to continue giving patients access to&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End-of-Study Phase: An end-of-study contact either as an office visit or follow-up&#xD;
           telephone call will occur one month after the last infusion.&#xD;
