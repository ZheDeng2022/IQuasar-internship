      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Denicotinized cigarettes are similar to commercial cigarettes but contain and deliver&#xD;
           virtually no nicotine. Denicotinized cigarettes are used as a control condition in&#xD;
           smoking research, as a substitute treatment for nicotine dependence, and as a strategy&#xD;
           to reduce incidence of nicotine addiction. However, the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal&#xD;
           and craving for cigarettes must be minimized to ensure that smokers will continue to use&#xD;
           denicotinized cigarettes instead of their preferred cigarettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Although research has shown that smokers preferred cigarettes that delivered nicotine,&#xD;
           subjective measures of tobacco craving and withdrawal were similar after standard and&#xD;
           denicotinized cigarettes. This suggests that the process of smoking and non-nicotine&#xD;
           components of tobacco smoke mediate some of the effects of cigarette smoking. More&#xD;
           research is needed on the comparative physical and mental effects of regular cigarettes&#xD;
           and denicotinized cigarettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To compare the effects of complete abstinence or smoking denicotinized cigarettes with&#xD;
      smoking nicotinized cigarettes on the following measures: (1) withdrawal symptoms and quality&#xD;
      of sleep, (2) hormonal responses, (3) mood and cognitive performance, and (4) functional&#xD;
      brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Men between 18 and 50 years of age who are either current smokers (at least 15 cigarettes&#xD;
      per day for at least 2 years) or nonsmoking volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be divided into four groups: (1) nonsmokers, (2) smokers who receive&#xD;
           nicotinized cigarettes, (3) smokers who receive denicotinized cigarettes, and (4)&#xD;
           smokers who will abstain from cigarettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will last 16 days. Smokers will have 14 visits to the clinical center;&#xD;
           nonsmokers will have 6 visits. From Day 6 to Day 14, current smokers will follow the&#xD;
           smoking regimen assigned by the researchers (not smoking, smoking denicotinized&#xD;
           cigarettes, or smoking nicotinized cigarettes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nonsmokers will have one day of training on the memory and thinking tasks that will be&#xD;
           performed in the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner, and will have 5&#xD;
           additional days of two fMRI scans per day (total of 10 fMRI scans).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current smokers will have 2 days of training on the memory and thinking tasks that will&#xD;
           be performed in the fMRI scanner, physical assessments on Day 3 and Day 6, and 5 days of&#xD;
           two fMRI scans per day (total of 10 fMRI scans).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants in the complete abstinence group will be asked to resume smoking after the&#xD;
           abstinence period and the denicotinized cigarettes group will resume nicotinized&#xD;
           cigarettes on day 14. Participants can decline to resume smoking, and if desired they&#xD;
           will be referred for smoking cessation treatment.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the effects of complete abstinence or smoking denicotinized research cigarettes to&#xD;
      smoking ad libitum nicotinized research cigarettes on the following measures: withdrawal&#xD;
      symptoms and quality of sleep; MAO-A and MAO-B activities; hormonal responses (HPA, HPT);&#xD;
      mood, cognitive and psychometric performance; functional brain activity, and physiological&#xD;
      responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are 125 men who are at least 18 years old, report smoking at least 15 cigarettes&#xD;
      per day, have not used any illicit drug except marijuana in the past year, have no history of&#xD;
      drug or alcohol dependence, and have already experienced tobacco withdrawal symptoms when&#xD;
      they had no access to cigarettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smokers will be randomized into one of the following 3 groups: a) complete tobacco abstinence&#xD;
      for 8 days; b) denicotinized research cigarettes for 8 days, or c) control group smoking&#xD;
      nicotinized research cigarettes during the entire study (16 days). Because there are few&#xD;
      studies comparing functional brain activity in smokers and nonsmokers, a group of nonsmokers&#xD;
      will serve as a control group for the brain imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal symptoms, mood, quality of sleep, cognitive performance, temperature, blood&#xD;
      pressure and heart rate, MAO-A parameters: plasma DHPG (dihydroxyphenylglycol), HVA&#xD;
      (homovanillic acid), 5HIAA (5-hydroxyindolacetic acid); MAO-B parameters: urinary excretion&#xD;
      of phenylethylamine, platelet MAO-B activity; hormonal parameters: serum ACTH, cortisol, TSH,&#xD;
      thyroxine, triiodothyronine; EEG; cigarette liking; expired air CO; and functional brain&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
