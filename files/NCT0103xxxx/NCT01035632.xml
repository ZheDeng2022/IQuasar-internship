      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Relapse following cigarette abstinence remains a common problem for smokers who are&#xD;
      attempting to quit. Most research has focused on the acute withdrawal phase that occurs&#xD;
      within the first 48 hours to 1 week after quitting; however, more information is needed on&#xD;
      the experiences of smokers in longer durations of abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the effects of long-term smoking abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the effects of cigarette-related cues on craving in longer periods of smoking&#xD;
           abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who are current smokers (at least 10 cigarettes per&#xD;
      day) and who want to quit but are not currently attempting to quit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be randomly assigned to abstain from all nicotine use for 7, 14, or 35&#xD;
           days. A fourth group of participants will also abstain for 35 days, but will undergo&#xD;
           more testing sessions than the other groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will have an initial orientation session in which they will complete&#xD;
           questionnaires about their smoking habits and will respond to smoking-related cues to&#xD;
           provide information about their cravings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will visit the clinic daily during their abstinence period, and provide&#xD;
           urine and breath samples to test for tobacco use. Participants will receive compensation&#xD;
           for every day that they do not use tobacco.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On the end day of the abstinence period, participants will return to the clinic, provide&#xD;
           urine and breath samples, and undergo testing of their responses to smoking-related&#xD;
           cues. Participants in the fourth group will have these tests on Days 7, 14, and 35 of&#xD;
           abstinence; other participants will have the tests only once, at the end of their&#xD;
           abstinence period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the required abstinence period, participants will enter a 5-day step-down period.&#xD;
           They will continue to report to the clinic for breath and urine testing, and they will&#xD;
           receive payments for abstinence that decrease in value across days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the step-down period, for the final 12 days of the study, participants will report&#xD;
           to the clinic every 3 days to give urine and breath samples and to report the number of&#xD;
           cigarettes smoked.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relapse following cigarette abstinence remains a common problem for smokers attempting to&#xD;
      quit. Extensive research has focused on the acute withdrawal phase that occurs within the&#xD;
      first 48 hours to one week; however, this study will focus on longer durations of abstinence.&#xD;
      Current clinical wisdom suggests that the rate of relapse decreases as the length of&#xD;
      abstinence increases; however, animal studies indicate that reactivity to drug-related cues&#xD;
      actually increases over time, an effect that has not been studied in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific Goal&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the time course of cue reactivity in smokers who have been abstinent for 7, 14,&#xD;
      and 35 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of up to 420 smokers who are planning to quit in the future, but not right now, and&#xD;
      are willing to undergo a practice quit attempt. Target enrollment will include 50% women and&#xD;
      50% minorities (mostly African-American).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smokers (N=420) will participate in one of 4 groups over a period of 24 to 52 days in&#xD;
      sessions conducted in at the National Institute on Drug Abuse Intramural Research Program at&#xD;
      251 Bayview Blvd, Suite 200, Baltimore, MD 21224, and in a separately approved site, the&#xD;
      Human Behavioral Pharmacology Laboratory (HBPL, L484-496, 5841 S. Maryland Ave., Chicago, IL,&#xD;
      60637). We expect that 190 participants will successfully complete the withdrawal phase (N=50&#xD;
      in groups 1, 2, and 3a, N=40 in group 3b).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to abstain from all nicotine use for 7, 14, or 35 days&#xD;
      and participate in one cue-reactivity session on day on the last day of abstinence (groups 1,&#xD;
      2, and 3a; N=50 per condition). The cue-presentation task will involve visual, olfactory, and&#xD;
      tactile cues. After cue presentation, participants will complete the Brief Questionnaire of&#xD;
      Smoking Urges and other standardized mood questionnaires. Physiological responses and&#xD;
      auditory reaction time will be obtained. Group 3b (N=40) will also abstain for 35 days, but&#xD;
      will complete the cue-reactivity task two additional times to provide a within-study&#xD;
      examination of the changes in cue reactivity over long periods of abstinence. On each&#xD;
      laboratory visit, participants will give a urine sample to be tested for cotinine and a&#xD;
      breath sample to be tested for carbon monoxide (CO) to verify abstinence from smoking.&#xD;
      Participants will receive $20 in cash if both tests are negative, and they will accumulate a&#xD;
      further $10 to be paid as a bonus at the end of the abstinence phase. After their required&#xD;
      abstinence period of 7, 14, or 35 days, participants will enter a five-day step-down period&#xD;
      during which they will continue to report to the laboratory for 10 min a day, and they will&#xD;
      receive payments for abstinence in descending value across days. One of the primary outcome&#xD;
      measures in the study is the time to return to smoking, beginning from the last day of&#xD;
      required abstinence. After the step-down period, for the final 12 days of the study,&#xD;
      volunteers will report to the lab every 3 days to give urine and breath samples and to report&#xD;
      the number of cigarettes smoked. Participants will receive $15 for each visit to the&#xD;
      laboratory, and they will receive an end-of-study bonus of $25 for attending all visits. This&#xD;
      money will be paid regardless of whether they abstain from smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits to Participants and/or Society&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no direct benefit to participants. These studies will provide the basis for future&#xD;
      studies investigating relapse to drug use. They will also shed light on the role of cue&#xD;
      reactivity and impulsivity in relapse. Knowledge about the time course of relapse will&#xD;
      provide important information about the processes underlying drug use and relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks to Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks to participants are minimal. Participants will be healthy cigarette smokers who&#xD;
      will abstain from smoking for varying periods of time and may have increased craving at the&#xD;
      end of the experimental cue-exposure session. They will be given guided relaxation at the end&#xD;
      of the session to reduce craving to pre-session levels and will be fully debriefed following&#xD;
      the study. Some participants experience depression or other adverse symptoms during nicotine&#xD;
      withdrawal. These will be fully described to the participants, and, if the symptoms become&#xD;
      severe, the psychologist/counselor will counsel participants. The only other risks involve&#xD;
      loss of confidentiality from information obtained during screening.&#xD;
