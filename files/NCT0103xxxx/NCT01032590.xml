      RATIONALE: A personalized Internet-based weight-loss program may help improve the quality of&#xD;
      life for colorectal cancer survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying how well an Internet-based program works&#xD;
      in helping colorectal cancer survivors lose weight.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the feasibility of implementing an Internet-based weight-loss intervention&#xD;
           for colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain preliminary outcome data on the impact of an Internet-based intervention on&#xD;
           weight loss, waist circumference, physical activity, diet, weight-control strategies,&#xD;
           weight-loss intention, exercise and diet self-efficacy, and perceived weight-loss&#xD;
           barriers among CRC survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain preliminary data on potential moderators (sociodemographics, disease and&#xD;
           treatment characteristics, prior Internet experience, depressive symptoms, dieting and&#xD;
           weight-loss experiences, weight-loss expectations, and physical activity and dietary&#xD;
           outcome expectancies) of weight loss among CRC survivors using an Internet-based&#xD;
           weight-loss intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to time since completion of cancer treatment (1 to&#xD;
      2 years vs 3 to 4 years vs 5 to 6 years vs 7 to 10 years). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2&#xD;
      intervention arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (12-week Internet-based weight-loss intervention): Patients attend an in-person&#xD;
           60-minute session with a health educator. The health educator will review the patient's&#xD;
           weight history, current eating habits, prior and current level of physical activity,&#xD;
           reasons for wanting to lose weight, current weight, weight-loss goals, and barriers to&#xD;
           weight loss. The health educator will provide basic weight-loss advice for the patient,&#xD;
           according to established guidelines, and advice on diet modification to reduce caloric&#xD;
           intake. The health educator will also recommend gradual increases in physical activity&#xD;
           and help patients set a realistic target weight to achieve at the end of the 12-week&#xD;
           intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The health educator will introduce the intervention website to the patient and assist the&#xD;
      patient in setting up a confidential, unique login username and password that will provide&#xD;
      secure access to the study website. Patients are asked to provide an email address. After&#xD;
      logging onto the website and viewing an introductory page, patients are prompted to specify&#xD;
      their target weight for the end of the 12-week intervention and to provide a list of reasons&#xD;
      for wanting to lose weight. Next, the website prompts patients to list specific strategies&#xD;
      that they plan to use to achieve their desired weight loss. The health educator will guide&#xD;
      the patient in entering an initial set of strategies and will provide the patient a list of&#xD;
      examples of weight-loss strategies and encourage the patient to generate his/her own&#xD;
      specific, personalized strategies. Patients will also be able to select and adapt strategies&#xD;
      from the example list that they feel are appropriate for them. The health educator will&#xD;
      ensure that the patient is comfortable using the website and will give the patient a one-page&#xD;
      written summary of how to use the website and a phone number and an e-mail address that they&#xD;
      can use to receive technical help with the website. Additionally, patients are advised to&#xD;
      login to the website twice a week during the 12-week intervention period and are prompted to&#xD;
      report their weight, to review and update their reasons for weight loss, to indicate their&#xD;
      success with implementing each of their weight-loss strategies, to rate the perceived&#xD;
      effectiveness of each weight-loss strategy, and to revise or create new strategies as needed.&#xD;
      Patients will also receive automated e-mails that prompt them to visit the website and that&#xD;
      provide them with weight-loss tips and motivational messages. The website also provides&#xD;
      additional resources, including a list of credible external websites with useful weight loss&#xD;
      information and healthy recipes, a summary of weight-loss tips, tips for creating appropriate&#xD;
      weight-loss strategies, and examples of weight-loss strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II (wait-list control): Patients are instructed to continue their usual dietary and&#xD;
           physical activity routines during a 12-week wait period. After the waiting period,&#xD;
           patients receive the Internet-based weight-loss intervention for 12 weeks as in arm I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both arms complete surveys at baseline and at 12 weeks to assess&#xD;
      sociodemographics, disease and treatment characteristics, prior Internet experience,&#xD;
      depressive symptoms, weight, dieting and weight-loss experiences, weight-loss expectations,&#xD;
      and physical activity and dietary outcome expectancies. Patients in arm II also complete an&#xD;
      additional follow-up survey at 24 weeks.&#xD;
