    <textblock>
      After surgical treatment, numerous trials using early postoperative enteral or parenteral&#xD;
      nutritional support have been attempted, in order to reduce morbidity and mortality. Although&#xD;
      it is difficult to compare among heterogeneous interventions, most of them have not been&#xD;
      successful, a fact generally attributed to the timing of the intervention. On the other hand,&#xD;
      nutrients that become &quot;conditionally essential&quot; under certain stressful circumstances, the so&#xD;
      called nutraceuticals, have been incorporated into nutritional formulations. Both facts have&#xD;
      prompted the idea of pre or perioperative nutrition support, using specific formulations&#xD;
      called &quot;immune enhancing&quot; formulas, containing arginine, nucleotides, glutamine and omega3&#xD;
      fatty acids in varying concentrations. The provision of these nutraceuticals prior and early&#xD;
      after the surgical, and particularly in oncologic surgery, theoretically permits to obtain&#xD;
      adequate circulating and tissue concentrations for the moment when they are most needed.&#xD;
      Exclusive postoperative provision of these substances would not be able to replenish depots&#xD;
      and provide them for an adequate immune response and wound healing after surgery. However,&#xD;
      regarding the preoperative approach, it is still not know which patients benefit more (less&#xD;
      or more severely malnourished), which specific nutrient(s) are responsible for the positive&#xD;
      effects, and the precise timing these nutrients should be provided. The present study aims to&#xD;
      demonstrate that immune-enhancing formulas are superior to standard enteral products in&#xD;
      reducing postoperative nutrition-related complications.&#xD;

      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receiving enteral nutrition support with immune-enhancing formulas (containing&#xD;
      higher concentrations of arginine, glutamine and omega 3 fatty acids compared with standard&#xD;
      polymeric formulas) during 7 days before a major oncological surgical procedure, have a lower&#xD;
      incidence of nutritional-related postoperative complications, compared with patients without&#xD;
      preoperative nutritional supplementation or those supplemented with standard formulas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To put in practice a routine nutritional assessment for every patient that is going to&#xD;
           be submitted to major digestive oncologic surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In these patients evaluate adherence and tolerance of enteral drinks, comparing&#xD;
           immune-enhancing with the standard polymeric formulations, during 7 days prior to&#xD;
           surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare frequency of postoperative nutrition-related complications (infections,&#xD;
           anastomotic leaks and hospital length of stay), among non-supplemented patients and&#xD;
           those receiving preoperative immune-enhancing or standard polymeric formulas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient proposed for major elective digestive oncologic surgery will be invited to a&#xD;
      nutritional assessment. Exclusion criteria will be emergency surgery or renal failure (serum&#xD;
      creatinine over 1.5 mg/dL). Some patients will not accept or will not be able to attend for&#xD;
      several reasons, however they will be assessed by the clinical nutritionist the day of&#xD;
      admission, before entering the OR, and followed as the other study patients, and will be&#xD;
      considered the control group. Nutritional assessment will include clinical story, dietary&#xD;
      recall, Global Subjective Assessment (GSA), calculation of percent weight loss respect&#xD;
      habitual weight, anthropometric measurements (height, weight, body mass index) and hand grip&#xD;
      strength. Functional involvement will be studied by the Karnofsky score. Among laboratory&#xD;
      analysis total proteins, albumin, creatinine, BUN and blood cells for lymphocyte count will&#xD;
      be included. All data will be registered in a special chart and then emptied in a&#xD;
      computational data base.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the nutritional assessment, both well nourished and undernourished patients will be&#xD;
      instructed to consume an enteral drink, orally or by gastrostomy or enteral feeding tube,&#xD;
      during 7 days before surgery. Seventy patients will receive 1 lt per day of a standard&#xD;
      polymeric formula (Fresubin 22%, which gives 1000 Kcal and 35 g protein, does not contain&#xD;
      free aminoacid nor omega fatty acids, and contains glutamine and arginine concentrations of&#xD;
      milk proteins. In order to increase protein intake, 50 g /día of Proteinex R will be added in&#xD;
      this group). The other 70 patients will be instructed to consume 600 ml of the special&#xD;
      immune-enhancing formula plus 20 g glutamine (Supportan R + Glutamine plus R , which contain&#xD;
      900 Kcal and 60 g protein/day, with 24.4 g glutamine, 2,2 g arginine and 4.4 g of omega 3&#xD;
      fatty acids, in a lower volume due to its higher energy density). Both products are enriched&#xD;
      with essential vitamins and minerals. The enteral formulas will be assigned through&#xD;
      randomized computer-generated numbers, in an open way. Patients that do not agree to&#xD;
      participate, do not have enough time before the operation, do not tolerate the product and&#xD;
      drink less than 100 cc/day will be considered control subjects. The enteral products will be&#xD;
      sold to the patients directly at the oncologic clinic, both the same prize, and lower to&#xD;
      marketing prizes, due to the participation of Fresenius-Kabi in the protocol. However if the&#xD;
      patients does not have the means, will receive it for free. All patients will be instructed&#xD;
      to maintain their previous diet, adding the enteral supplement, or completing their&#xD;
      requirement by tube feeding with standard or specific formulations (e.g. diabetic&#xD;
      formulation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed during the entire postoperative period, registering days of&#xD;
      stay at the critical ward, time of mechanical ventilation, days of fever, infections (wound,&#xD;
      intra-abdominal, pulmonary, urinary, etc), anastomotic leaks and time of hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participation of Fresenius-Kabi will consist of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paying the enteral formulas, thus avoiding payment for patients (considering that&#xD;
           Fundación Arturo Lopez Perez is a private institution, where patients must pay for their&#xD;
           treatment, according to their health insurance, which usually exclude nutritional&#xD;
           products).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collaboration with data registry (nutritional assessment, adherence to the supplements,&#xD;
           postoperative complications, etc.) due to the incorporation of one of their&#xD;
           professionals (nutritionist) to the study.&#xD;
