      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Cocaine affects the brain's ability to process information. However, different people&#xD;
      respond to cocaine in different ways, and differences in brain structure and function may&#xD;
      affect how cocaine alters brain activity. By using functional magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (fMRI) to monitor brain activity during tasks that provide simple rewards, researchers hope&#xD;
      to better understand how the brain responds to rewards and how this response is affected by&#xD;
      drugs like cocaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effect of cocaine administration on the reward experience in&#xD;
           cocaine-dependent individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study genetic and personality factors that may contribute to cocaine dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 45 years of age who either are cocaine-dependent and not seeking&#xD;
      treatment or are healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to avoid consuming alcohol and restrict consumption of&#xD;
           caffeine prior to the study. Participants provide urine and breath samples to be tested&#xD;
           for chemicals that may interfere with the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will complete a training session and at least one fMRI scanning&#xD;
           session. During the training session, participants will be introduced to the reward&#xD;
           tasks and MRI equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers will have a single fMRI session that will involve reward tasks to be&#xD;
           completed during the scanning. Rewards will include small amounts of fruit juice and the&#xD;
           opportunity to win money.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cocaine-dependent participants will have a training session and three experimental&#xD;
           sessions including 1) a mock MRI scan to test cocaine tolerance, 2) one fMRI scan with&#xD;
           reward tasks after administration of IV cocaine, and 3) one fMRI scan with reward tasks&#xD;
           after administration of IV placebo (saline solution). Rewards will include small amounts&#xD;
           of fruit juice and the opportunity to win money.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition to the scans, participants will provide a blood sample for further study and&#xD;
           will answer questionnaires provided by the researchers.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this study is to determine the effect that cocaine administration&#xD;
      has upon the experience of reward in dependent individuals and the contribution of reward&#xD;
      processing (or dysfunction) to the reinforcing effects of cocaine and the recidivism rates&#xD;
      noted in cocaine-dependent individuals. The primary goal is to employ functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI) to ascertain the function of neural systems that respond to cocaine&#xD;
      in human participants and to determine the role that they play in the processing of different&#xD;
      types of rewarding stimuli during episodes where individuals are drug-free and those where&#xD;
      they are under the acute influence of cocaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental population for this investigation will be non-treatment seeking,&#xD;
      cocaine-dependent adults (i.e. 18 45 years old). A cohort of healthy, drug-free, individuals,&#xD;
      matched for age, gender, ethnicity and IQ, will serve as a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This experiment employs a mixed-measures, counter-balanced design. Participants will complete&#xD;
      two measures of reward processing (i.e. the revised monetary incentive delay (MID) task and a&#xD;
      temporal difference error task (TDE/juice) task) while undergoing BOLD EPI fMRI. The scanning&#xD;
      procedure will be repeated for all subjects, such that each participant undertakes 2&#xD;
      sessions. Cocaine-dependent individuals will receive either two injections of cocaine (30&#xD;
      mg/70 kg body weight; intravenous (IV) administration) or two injections of saline during&#xD;
      scanning. Within each session, each IV injection will be given approximately 10 minute prior&#xD;
      to the start of one of the reward measures. The order of cocaine and saline scans will be&#xD;
      randomized and participants will be blind to the experimental condition prior to&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures will be the neural substrates of reward processing and how these&#xD;
      differ between cocaine-dependent individuals and controls, and the impact of acute cocaine&#xD;
      administration upon brain function associated with reward function.&#xD;
