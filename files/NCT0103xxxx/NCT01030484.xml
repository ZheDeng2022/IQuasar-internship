  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The NAFLD Database 2 will recruit at least 1,500 new adult participants suspected or known to&#xD;
      have NAFLD or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-related cirrhosis and will also invite&#xD;
      adult participants from the prior NAFLD Database and related studies (PIVENS trial and TONIC&#xD;
      trial) to enroll in the NAFLD Database 2. To elucidate, through the cooperative effort of a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary and multicenter group of collaborators, the etiology, natural history,&#xD;
      diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of NAFLD, and in particular its more severe form of NASH&#xD;
      and its complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To add to the existing NAFLD Database an additional 1,500 adult participants with a diagnosis&#xD;
      of NAFLD, supported by a recent liver biopsy, with a broad range of severity. Core data&#xD;
      collection will include clinical, demographic, laboratory, imaging, and histological features&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To increase the population diversity of the NAFLD Database to provide greater&#xD;
           representation of Hispanic, Native American, African American, and Asian patients among&#xD;
           the new adult participants recruited into the NAFLD Database 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To expand the current specimen bank comprised of liver tissue, serum, plasma, and DNA&#xD;
           obtained from new participants and continuing participants undergoing repeat liver&#xD;
           biopsy with the specific goal of optimizing the collection of plasma or serum suitable&#xD;
           for biomarker development studies by obtaining specimens in close temporal proximity to&#xD;
           the performance of liver biopsy&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Willingness to be followed for up to 4 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability and willingness to give written, informed consent to be screened for and, if&#xD;
             eligible, to be enrolled into the Database 2 study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Minimal or no alcohol use history consistent with NAFLD (see exclusion criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Collection of a standard of care liver biopsy that is obtained within 120 days of&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Collection of biosamples (serum, plasma, DNA, and, if available, liver tissue) within&#xD;
             90 days prior to enrollment and 0-90 days before or 4-90 days after the standard of&#xD;
             care liver biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition or circumstances, which, in the opinion of the investigator, would&#xD;
             interfere with completion of scheduled follow-up visits and procedures for the&#xD;
             duration of the Database 2 study&#xD;
&#xD;
