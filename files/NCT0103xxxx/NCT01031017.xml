  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Twin pregnancies are at substantial increased risk of preterm delivery. Prophylactic&#xD;
      administration of progesterone in singleton pregnancies at risk of preterm delivery has been&#xD;
      shown to be effective in reducing the rate of such complication. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of prophylactic administration of natural progesterone in twin&#xD;
      pregnancies on the rate of preterm births.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a double-blind, placebo controlled study performed in our Institution, Fonseca et al.,&#xD;
      investigated the use of micronized natural progesterone, crafted in vaginal capsules of&#xD;
      100mg, for the prevention of preterm delivery. The study involved 142 singleton pregnancies&#xD;
      at high risk for premature birth (previous premature birth, cerclage and uterine&#xD;
      malformation). The progesterone was introduced from 24 weeks to 34 weeks gestation. The&#xD;
      authors observed a significant reduction of premature birth before 37 weeks (28,1% within the&#xD;
      placebo group versus 13,8% within the treated group) and below 34 weeks (18,6% within the&#xD;
      placebo group versus 2,8% within the treated group). Also, it was observed a reduction in the&#xD;
      frequency of the uterine contractions in the progesterone group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the only study performed specifically among twin pregnancies, Anna Lisa et al. in 1980,&#xD;
      administrated 250mg of 17αOH-PC or placebo (still oil) weekly, in 70 pregnant women with twin&#xD;
      pregnancies, beginning before 28 weeks and continuing up to 37 weeks gestation. Seric levels&#xD;
      of progesterone, estradiol, estriol, testosterone, and placental lactogenic hormone were also&#xD;
      measured weekly. The differences among the achieved results within both groups, according the&#xD;
      average in pregnancy duration (36,9 within the treated group, versus 37,3 within the placebo&#xD;
      group), the average birthweight and the perimortality rate were not significantly different,&#xD;
      as well as the levels of progesterone, estriol, estradiol, testosterone and placental&#xD;
      lactogenic hormone. Nevertheless, this study was criticized for starting the use of&#xD;
      progesterone at a late stage of pregnancy, in a considerable number of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies suggest that in singleton pregnancies with a previous history of preterm birth&#xD;
      progesterone treatment may prevent the patients from having subsequent premature births.&#xD;
      Nonetheless, the results of these series must not be generalized to all pregnancies at high&#xD;
      risk. Additional studies to evaluate the use of progesterone ovules in multiple pregnancies&#xD;
      are necessary, as these pregnancies are increasing due to the advanced maternal age at the&#xD;
      conception time and also due to the widespread use of assisted reproductive techniques.&#xD;
