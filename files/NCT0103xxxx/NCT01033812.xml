  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is a sub-study of ATN 067. ATN 067 utilizes a cross-sectional research&#xD;
      design to recruit Latina and African American young women to undergo HIV screening. The&#xD;
      primary goal of this proposed pilot study, ATN 084, is to explore the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of index female recruiters identifying and recruiting their past and present&#xD;
      male sexual partners to undergo HIV screening and complete a one-time ACASI interview. In&#xD;
      addition, the study will also include female friendship network members who were enrolled in&#xD;
      ATN 067 and were diagnosed with HIV. These young women will also be asked to recruit their&#xD;
      past and present male sex partners to undergo HIV screening.&#xD;
