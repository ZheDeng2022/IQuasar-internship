      This is an open-label, dose escalation study designed to characterize the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of GNKG168 in patients with B-CLL that has&#xD;
      relapsed or is refractory to all prior standard therapy, or for which no standard therapy&#xD;
      exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As secondary objectives, baseline TLR-9 intracellular staining of B-CLL cells, and in vitro&#xD;
      assays to assess the potential of B-CLL cells to undergo apoptosis in conjunction with&#xD;
      GNKG168 therapy will be examined. Baseline characteristics of B-CLL will be examined&#xD;
      including interphase genetics, FISH CLL, IgVH mutational status, expression of ZAP70,&#xD;
      β2-microglobulin and the expression of the prognostic marker CD38 in peripheral blood cells&#xD;
      (at baseline and during treatment) and baseline immune SNPs (FcγRIIIa, FcγRIIa, TNF-α, IFN-γ,&#xD;
      CD40 and others). As pharmacodynamics parameters, the expression of B-cell and T-cell&#xD;
      activation markers (including IL-21 receptor upregulation), NK cell markers, and cytokines&#xD;
      will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial will also assess the ability of B CLL patients treated with GNKG168 to&#xD;
      elicit anti pneumococcal antibodies in response to adjuvant vaccination with the Prevnar™&#xD;
      vaccine.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have cytologically confirmed B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL)&#xD;
             that has relapsed or been refractory to all prior standard therapy, or for which no&#xD;
             standard therapy exists, or patients who refuse available therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients' B-CLL must be staged according to either the Rai or Binet systems23 (see&#xD;
             Appendix III) and assessed for chromosomal abnormalities, unmutated IgVH status, and&#xD;
             expression of ZAP70, and expression of CD38 (see Section 7.2 Pre-treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have recovered from all acute adverse effects of prior therapies to&#xD;
             grade 1, excluding alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of&#xD;
             0, 1 or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must be ≤ to 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must have normal organ function as defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
             total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT)≤&#xD;
             2.5 x ULN serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL OR creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for&#xD;
             patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal. The creatinine clearance&#xD;
             in male patients may be calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula: CrCl (mL/min) =&#xD;
             [(140 - age) x weight (kg)]/ 72 x Cr (mg/dL). Note: in female patients, this&#xD;
             calculation must be multiplied by a factor of 0.85.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must have serum sodium levels ≥ 135 mmol/L and serum chloride levels ≥ 98&#xD;
             mmol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Male patients must have a QTc interval of &lt; 450 msec and female patients must have a&#xD;
             QTc interval of &lt; 470 msec.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients must be able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
             document.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients must be at least 2 weeks from prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, major&#xD;
             surgery, or other investigational anticancer therapy. Patients may receive steroids to&#xD;
             control the secondary effects of CLL such as autoimmune cytopenia or painful lymph&#xD;
             nodes if this is considered by the treating physician to be in the best interest of&#xD;
             the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 2 weeks prior to beginning treatment on this study. Male and female patients&#xD;
             must use acceptable contraceptive methods during the entire study period and for 1&#xD;
             month after the end of study or after being discontinued from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who are currently receiving chemotherapy, radiotherapy, biological therapy,&#xD;
             or any other investigational therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to entering&#xD;
             the study or those who have not recovered from adverse effects due to agents&#xD;
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with uncontrolled known leukemic meningitis, because of their poor prognosis&#xD;
             and likelihood of developing progressive neurologic dysfunction which would confound&#xD;
             evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with a history of sensitivity or allergy attributed to compounds of similar&#xD;
             chemical composition to GNKG168 or to the Prevnar™ vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with concurrent serious infections (i.e., requiring an intravenous&#xD;
             antibiotic).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with active malignancy (excepting non-melanomatous skin cancers) which may&#xD;
             limit survival to less than 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with pre-existing autoimmune diseases (i.e. systemic lupus erythematosis,&#xD;
             rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, primary sclerosing&#xD;
             cholangitis, thyroiditis, scleroderma, etc.) are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;

             pregnancy, and women who are breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing&#xD;
             or active infection, unstable angina pectoris or psychiatric illness/social situations&#xD;
             that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients with significant cardiac disease including heart failure that meets New York&#xD;
             Heart Association (NYHA) class III and IV definitions, history of myocardial&#xD;
             infarction within six months of study entry, uncontrolled dysrhythmias or poorly&#xD;
             controlled angina.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients with known positive status for HIV or active hepatitis B or hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients with any medical condition which in the opinion of the Investigator places&#xD;
             them at an unacceptably high risk for toxicities.&#xD;
