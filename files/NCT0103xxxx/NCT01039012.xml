      This study will assess the effectiveness of Tai Chi to affect the rate of bone loss in&#xD;
      post-menopausal women who have been diagnosed with the initial stages of bone thinning.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteopenia is a serious and growing public health concern for women. Osteopenic women are at&#xD;
      greater risk for fractures than women with normal bone mineral densities (BMD). Low&#xD;
      BMD-related fractures are associated with significant long-term impairment, high morbidity&#xD;
      rates and high medical costs. Optimal preventive and sustainable interventions for osteopenic&#xD;
      women are not yet well-defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tai Chi, a mind-body exercise that is growing in popularity in the U.S., shows may be an&#xD;
      effective, safe and practical intervention for women with low bone density. Preliminary&#xD;
      studies suggest Tai Chi can reduce rates of BMD decline in post-menopausal women. While&#xD;
      suggestive, these studies have numerous design limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a pilot randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy and feasibility of Tai&#xD;
      Chi as an adjunct to standard care for post-menopausal osteopenic women. Eight-six osteopenic&#xD;
      women ages 45-70 will be recruited from a large multi-specialty group practice. Our primary&#xD;
      aim is to assess the feasibility for recruiting and retaining osteopenic women into a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial of 9 months of Tai Chi. Our secondary aim is to collect&#xD;
      preliminary data on the efficacy of Tai Chi in reducing rates of bone loss in osteopenic&#xD;
      women using sensitive markers of bone turnover and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. The&#xD;
      results of this study will inform the design of a future trial evaluating the benefits and&#xD;
      safety for Tai Chi for osteopenic women, as well as the physiological and biomechanical&#xD;
      mechanisms through which Tai Chi may impact BMD and fracture risks associated with&#xD;
      osteopenia.&#xD;

    <description>Participants randomized to the Tai Chi group select a Tai Chi school from a pre-screened list of community-based Tai Chi programs and enroll for 9 months. Participants are asked to attend classes twice a week for the first month and once a week for the remaining 8 months. They are also asked to practice at home, or attend more classes for 2-3 additional hours per week. While in the study they are also encouraged to follow the standard care as recommended by their physician.</description>
