      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Environmental cues frequently induce expectancies in individuals that may strongly&#xD;
           influence the actual experience associated with the cue. This has both positive and&#xD;
           negative consequences for behavior and decision making. For instance, when an addicted&#xD;
           individual experiences cues associated with imminent drug taking, an expectancy of the&#xD;
           coming experience is also formed and very likely has an effect on the subsequent&#xD;
           experience of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers are interested in studying how the brain responds to these kinds of&#xD;
           environmental cues and expectancies in order to learn more about addiction and craving&#xD;
           in substance-abusing individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the response to rewards (both drug-related and non-drug-related) in cocaine&#xD;
           users and non-using individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the effect of expectation on reward-related (both drug-induced and&#xD;
           non-drug-induced) responses and brain activity in cocaine users and non-using&#xD;
           individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Individuals between 18 and 45 years of age who are regular cocaine users but otherwise&#xD;
      healthy, or healthy individuals who are not cocaine users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study involves two experiments. Participants will be assigned to one or both&#xD;
           experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must not use any drugs for at least 3 days before the visit, may not&#xD;
           consume alcohol for 24 hours before the visit, and may not consume caffeinated beverages&#xD;
           for 12 hours before the visit. On the day of the visit, participants will provide both&#xD;
           urine and breath samples to test for drug/alcohol use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experiment 1: In the MRI scanner, participants will respond to questions and images on a&#xD;
           screen, and will receive small amounts of flavored liquid (chocolate or cherry) through&#xD;
           a tube in the mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experiment 2: In the MRI scanner, participants will respond to questions and images on a&#xD;
           screen, and will receive injections of liquid (saline solution or a drug that provides a&#xD;
           high similar to cocaine) through an intravenous line. Participants in this experiment&#xD;
           will return for follow-up visits and provide urine samples for further study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The specific assignment (to Experiment 1 or Experiment 2 or both experiments) will&#xD;
           determine the number of study days and follow-up visits required.&#xD;

      Objective: Environmental cues frequently induce expectancies in the course of normal daily&#xD;
      life. When an individual smells and sees the coffee before tasting it, an expectancy of the&#xD;
      coming experience is formed that influences the actual experience of consuming the coffee.&#xD;
      Similarly, when an addicted individual experiences cues associated with imminent drug taking,&#xD;
      an expectancy of the coming experience is also formed. This protocol will examine neural&#xD;
      responses to cues predictive of a stimulus (neutral or rewarding) and to the subsequent&#xD;
      receipt of the predicted stimulus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Study participants will include 18-50 year old, male and non-pregnant&#xD;
      female otherwise healthy cocaine dependent individuals and control individuals who have a&#xD;
      history of some stimulant use but no history of abuse or dependence on any other drug other&#xD;
      than nicotine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The study will employ fMRI to elucidate the neural underpinnings of reward&#xD;
      processing. The rewarding stimuli to be studied will be taste stimuli (small squirt of juice&#xD;
      or chocolate) and a drug stimulus (intravenous methylphenidate (IV MPH)). For taste stimuli,&#xD;
      cues will vary in sensory modality (visual vs. olfactory) and in novelty (well-known vs.&#xD;
      novel). Novel and well-known cue stimuli will be included on each experimental day so the&#xD;
      development of expectancy can be studied as the cue-taste pairing is learned and compared to&#xD;
      the well-known cue-taste pairing. The MPH/saline injections will receive a written cue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: BOLD fMRI signal to reward stimuli will be compared in the various cuing&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
