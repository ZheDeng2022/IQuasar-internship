  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuropathic pain occurs as a result of damage or disease of the peripheral or central nervous&#xD;
      system. Regardless of its cause, neuropathic pain (NeP) leads to a characteristic clinical&#xD;
      picture characterized by ongoing pain with steady or dysesthetic pain, such as burning or&#xD;
      aching, and paroxysmal pain such as shooting or stabbing. In conditions such as diabetic&#xD;
      neuropathy, changes in the membrane-bound proteins that form ion channels may alter the&#xD;
      electrical properties of the injured neuron, called remodeling. The net effect of membrane&#xD;
      remodeling is greater excitability of neurons, leading to a tendency towards action potential&#xD;
      generation and propagation in injured primary sensory neurons which occurs in the context of&#xD;
      nerve injury and disease. Over the past decade, a new endogenous cannabinoid&#xD;
      receptor-mediated system within the nervous system and upon immune-mediated cells has been&#xD;
      described. The cannabinoid receptor system consists of two receptors, CB1 and CB2 receptors,&#xD;
      as well as endogenously produced endocannabinoids which agonize these receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter trial amongst Western Canadian sites to compare the efficacy of&#xD;
      nabilone versus placebo in treating patients with chronic neuropathic pain (NeP) due to&#xD;
      diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A one-week screening period will occur, during which pain scores and sleep scores will be&#xD;
      tabulated. Following screening, a 4-week period of single blind treatment with flexible&#xD;
      dosing of nabilone at 0.5 - 4 mg/day will initiate. All subjects will begin with nabilone&#xD;
      therapy of 1 mg daily for a minimum of 4 days, with the dose of the study medication assessed&#xD;
      and adjusted either upwards or downwards as needed to balance efficacy for pain control with&#xD;
      tolerability of possible side effects. All subjects who experience at least a 30% reduction&#xD;
      in their weekly mean pain score during the single blind flexible dosing phase will be&#xD;
      considered a responder, and will be further continued in the study. During the double-blind&#xD;
      portion of the study, subjects randomized to nabilone will continue on the dose of nabilone&#xD;
      achieved at the completion of the single-blind phase, and this dose will be maintained&#xD;
      throughout the double-blind phase. Subjects randomized to placebo will receive 1 mg of&#xD;
      nabilone daily for one week, followed by 4 consecutive weeks of placebo. This dose of&#xD;
      nabilone will permit a tapering for those subjects achieving a higher daily dose of nabilone&#xD;
      during the single-blind phase, or will maintain those who were taking only 1 mg per day in&#xD;
      the single-blind phase, preventing an abrupt termination of treatment in subjects who are&#xD;
      randomized into the placebo portion of the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter trial amongst 3 Western Canadian sites to compare the efficacy of&#xD;
      nabilone versus placebo in treating patients with chronic neuropathic pain (NeP) due to&#xD;
      diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A one-week screening period will occur, during which pain scores and sleep scores will be&#xD;
      tabulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following screening, a 4-week period of single blind treatment with nabilone 0.5 - 4 mg/day&#xD;
      flexible dosing will take place. All subjects will begin with nabilone therapy of 1 mg daily&#xD;
      for a minimum of 4 days, with the dose of the study medication assessed and adjusted either&#xD;
      upwards or downwards as needed to balance efficacy for pain control with tolerability for&#xD;
      possible side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects who experience at least a 30% reduction in their weekly mean pain score during&#xD;
      the single blind flexible dosing phase will be considered a responder, and will be further&#xD;
      continued in the study. Those failing to achieve this level of pain relief will be&#xD;
      discontinued from further study. Responders will be randomized to 5 weeks of double-blind&#xD;
      treatment with nabilone or placebo. The double-blind phase of this study will permit&#xD;
      confirmation of efficacy observed during the single-blind phase of the study. During the&#xD;
      double-blind portion of the study, subjects randomized to nabilone will continue on the dose&#xD;
      of nabilone achieved at the completion of the single-blind phase, and this dose will be&#xD;
      maintained throughout the double-blind phase. Subjects randomized to placebo will receive a&#xD;
      direct switch to placebo. All subjects will maintain their pre-study doses of analgesic&#xD;
      medication for pain control throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be four total trial phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening Phase This will consist of a 7-day period of time following Visit 1 in which&#xD;
           subjects will be monitored for satisfaction of inclusion/exclusion criteria. If other&#xD;
           medications are being used for treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain, then these&#xD;
           subjects must be on a stable dose for ≥ 30 days prior to entering the single-blind phase&#xD;
           (Visit 2). At the end of this screening phase, subjects who meet all inclusion and&#xD;
           exclusion criteria will next enter the single-blind phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Single Blind Flexible Dose Nabilone Treatment Phase This is a 4 week (28 day) treatment&#xD;
           period when subjects will take nabilone in a single-blind fashion, at a dose of 1-4 mg&#xD;
           per day. All subjects will start with nabilone 0.5 mg po bid (1 mg daily) for at least 4&#xD;
           days, and then their study medication will be assessed and adjusted upwards, or&#xD;
           downwards, as needed to achieve optimal NeP relief as well as side effect tolerability.&#xD;
           Dosing adjustments will occur at a maximum of once weekly, with the maximum dose of 4 mg&#xD;
           per day preventing any further increase in dose, and a minimum dose of 0.5 mg per day&#xD;
           preventing any further decrease in dose. At the end of this single-blind phase, all&#xD;
           subjects who are deemed a responder (those who experience a ≥ 30% reduction in weekly&#xD;
           mean pain score) will be randomized to the double-blind phase. Those subjects who are&#xD;
           not a responder will enter the taper phase of the study, with end of treatment&#xD;
           assessments performed. Those patients receiving a dose of 0.5 mg daily will receive a&#xD;
           single capsule of 0.5 mg at qhs only. In order to prevent potential unmasking, those&#xD;
           patients who are intolerant of placebo will also have their placebo dose reduced from 2&#xD;
           capsules daily to one capsule daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Double Blind Treatment Phase This is a 5 week (35 day) treatment period where subjects&#xD;
           deemed to be a responder during the single blind phase will be randomized to double&#xD;
           blind treatment with the dose of nabilone achieved at the last week (Visit 5) of the&#xD;
           single-blind phase (the dose which optimized NeP relief with side effect tolerability)&#xD;
           or placebo. Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio,&#xD;
           nabilone or placebo respectively. Those subjects randomized to placebo will be directly&#xD;
           switched from active drug to placebo for the duration of the study. All subjects will&#xD;
           maintain their pre-study doses of analgesic medication for pain control throughout the&#xD;
           study. No further dose adjustments will be allowed during Week 4 onward.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Taper Phase This is a one week (7 day) period during which patients will taper off of&#xD;
           nabilone. All subjects using nabilone will have their dose adjusted (or continued) as&#xD;
           0.5-1 mg nabilone daily. Any subjects using placebo prior to the taper phase will be&#xD;
           continued on placebo during the taper phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the single blind phase, the dose of nabilone may be adjusted upward from 1 to 4 mg/day&#xD;
      based on tolerability at weekly visits.. Any upward dose adjustments will occur in increments&#xD;
      of either 1 or 2 mg/day (if the initial dose is 1 mg or 2 mg per day respectively). If&#xD;
      intolerable adverse events occur during any time of the single blind dose adjustment phase,&#xD;
      the dose of nabilone may be decreased by 0.5, 1 or 2 mg/day (if the initial dose is 1 mg, 2&#xD;
      mg or 4 mg per day respectively). A dose of 0.5 mg per day which is not tolerated will lead&#xD;
      to study termination. Once a dose reduction has taken place, no further dose adjustments will&#xD;
      be permitted. An unscheduled visit between study week 3 and study week 4 will be the last&#xD;
      opportunity for dose adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the double blind phase, subjects must maintain the same dosing regimen achieved at the&#xD;
      end of the single blind dose adjustment phase until the end of Week 8 (Visit 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At time of completion of the double blind phase, all subjects taking nabilone will taper off&#xD;
      of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be required to attend a minimum of 8 visits in person, with one optional&#xD;
      additional visit for dose adjustment permitted during the single blind phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a total of 9 clinic visits and 3 telephone interviews. Telephone interviews&#xD;
      will occur during weeks in which the subject will not be required to attend clinic. The&#xD;
      schedule of visits and telephone interviews is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening (beginning of Week [-1]) (Visit 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single Blind Dose Treatment - Day 0 (Visit 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single Blind Flexible Dose Treatment - Day 7 (Visit 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single Blind Flexible Dose Treatment - Day 14 (Visit 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Telephone Interview - Day 21&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End of Single Blind Flexible Dose Treatment with Determination of Responders, and&#xD;
           possible randomization to Double Blind Phase - Day 28 (Visit 5)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Double Blind Fixed Dose Treatment - Day 35 (Visit 6)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Telephone Interview - Day 42&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Double Blind Fixed Dose Treatment - Day 49 (Visit 7)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Telephone Interview - Day 56&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End of Double Blind Fixed Dose Treatment - Day 63 (Visit 8)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up Visit following tapering - Day 70 (Visit 9)&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an optional dose adjustment period (at the end of Week 3). The necessity of this&#xD;
      unscheduled visit is to be determined at the discretion of the investigator and is to be&#xD;
      arranged by a telephone contact between the investigator and subject If there are concerns&#xD;
      regarding dosing of nabilone, adjustments will be permitted at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a subject prematurely discontinues the study and stops study drug, the end of treatment&#xD;
      assessments will be completed as soon as possible, given continued subject consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All investigators will be aware of study design and subject treatment during the single-blind&#xD;
      phase of study. It is important that the subject remain blinded to the nature of treatment&#xD;
      during all phases of study. The subjects will be treated at all times, as if they were on&#xD;
      active treatment of nabilone. If any subject becomes aware of their treatment type during any&#xD;
      phase of the study, their participation must be discontinued.&#xD;
