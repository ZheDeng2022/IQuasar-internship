  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The application of Glyaderm for skin restoration intends to provide a more stable wound&#xD;
      closure with enhanced pliability and function of the skin and a more favourable scar. The&#xD;
      dermal substitute would be affordable for widespread application in full thickness skin&#xD;
      defects and burns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with burn wounds or large full thickness wounds will be evaluated before enrollment.&#xD;
      All burn wounds that are not clearly full thickness on clinical assessment will be treated&#xD;
      during the first 48 hours with a hydrocolloid paste and covered with a paraffin gauze&#xD;
      dressing. This hydrocolloid paste combined with paraffin gauze will ensure maintenance of a&#xD;
      moist wound environment for the first 48 hours prior to assessment by LDI and randomization.&#xD;
      This is the standard treatment for all burns admitted to the Ghent Burn Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wounds will be photographed on a daily basis. In order to obtain an optimal preparation for&#xD;
      LDI, the burn wounds will be meticulously debrided during dressing changes. LDI is most&#xD;
      reliable between 48-72 hours. Patients whose burn wounds meet the inclusion criteria, i.e.&#xD;
      full thickness burns with LDI values &lt; 200 will be randomized to receive either GLYADERM and&#xD;
      split skin graft versus split skin graft alone.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All burn wounds with flux values measured by Laser Doppler Imaging, corresponding with&#xD;
             an expected healing time longer than 28 days. Dark blue color on the palette of the&#xD;
             LDI software with flux values below 200&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All clearly full thickness burns on clinical assessment done by two plastic surgeons&#xD;
             and thereafter treated with FlammaceriumÂ®.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Wounds treated with a hydrocolloid paste prior to LDI and with low flux values &lt; 200&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All assessments are done during first days before final decision at day three&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Possibility to follow the complete treatment schedule until final graft take and&#xD;

             faster healing times ( flux values &gt;200 )&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  TBSA &gt;40 %&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not following the complete treatment schedule or missing some evaluations during the&#xD;
