    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder is associated with several sleep Polysomnograph (PSG) findings: (1)&#xD;
      impaired sleep continuity; (2) non-REM (NREM) changes; and (3) enhanced rapid eye movement&#xD;
      (REM) sleep. The first two patterns are common in other psychiatric disorders, while the REM&#xD;
      pattern is very characteristic in depression, so the phase-advance theory was accepted by&#xD;
      most of psychiatrists. Many researchers have focused on the biological rhythm to investigate&#xD;
      the etiological and pathophysiology of depression, and they think depression can be cured if&#xD;
      its sleep abnormality is ameliorated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well known that most of antidepressants treat depression through 5-hydroxytryptamine&#xD;
      (5-HT) neurons. 5-HT also affects the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle and the sleep&#xD;
      microarchitecture. Many all-night PSG studies have shown tricyclic antidepressants can&#xD;
      ameliorate the sleep architecture abnormality in depression by producing rapid suppression of&#xD;
      REM sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to TCAs, SSRIs are generally less sedating because of its high selectivity for&#xD;
      serotonin receptors. SSRIs can suppress REM sleep and delay REM latency too, but they&#xD;
      increase awakenings and reduce SWS at the same time. One PSG study shown sertraline minimally&#xD;
      increases sleep efficiency and reduces nocturnal wakefulness time, which may benefit&#xD;
      depressive patients. However, this study compared the sleep architecture before and after 12&#xD;
      weeks of pharmacotherapy, so the tolerance to the disturbance of sleep architecture in&#xD;
      antidepressants appears to develop over several weeks of treatment. Sertraline has a greater&#xD;
      potency against 5-HT reuptake as well as better selectivity for 5-HT reuptake relative to NE&#xD;
      reuptake than any other SSRIs, and the relative selectivity of sertraline for inhabiting 5-HT&#xD;
      reuptake relative to DA reuptake is somewhat less than of any other SSRIs. So it has chance&#xD;
      to exhibit better effect on sleep architecture in depressive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, it is difficult to be determined that the unique phenomenon of sertraline is its&#xD;
      genuine characteristics or the tolerance after 12-week treatment, so it is crucial to assess&#xD;
      the effect of sertraline on sleep architecture in acute treatment. We hypothesized that&#xD;
      sertraline could suppress the REM sleep, and have little damage to the sleep architecture of&#xD;
      depressive patient.&#xD;

      [Abstract] Purpose of the study: To evaluate the effect of sertraline on polysomnographic&#xD;
      (PSG) variables and clinical improvement in the treatment of depressive patients with&#xD;
      insomnia. Methods used: The study design was 8-week and open-label trial. Patients were&#xD;
      diagnosed as major depressive disorder. Their Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD)&#xD;
      score was more than 18, and HRSD-sleep disturbance score was more than 3. After 7-day&#xD;
      wash-out period and 2 nights PSG (the first night as adaptive and the second night as&#xD;
      baseline), 31 depressive patients were administered by sertraline as 50 mg in 8 am in the 1st&#xD;
      day. The dosage of sertraline would be titrated during the 8-week treatment, and the maximum&#xD;
      was lower than 200 mg/day. The primary endpoints were the changes of PSG variables from&#xD;
      baseline to the 56th Day. The secondary endpoints were the changes of subjective sleep&#xD;
      quality and clinical performance from baseline to the 56th Day. Their sleep quality was&#xD;
      evaluated with Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and&#xD;
      their clinical performance was evaluated with HRSD and Clinical Globe Impression (CGI).&#xD;
      Summary of results containing real data and appropriate statistical assessments: The&#xD;
      Intent-to-Treat analysis included 31 subjects. The final dosage was titrated as 130.6±47.8&#xD;
      mg/day. The Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep latency was prolonged significantly in the 1st day&#xD;
      and throughout 8-week treatment. The percentage of REM sleep decreased significantly in the&#xD;
      1st day, but increased gradually along the following treatment. AI reached the highest level&#xD;
      in the 1st day (13.8±7.2), and decreased along the following treatment. SL decreased&#xD;
      significantly and reached normal range (&lt;30minutes) after the visit of 14th day. The&#xD;
      percentage of stage 3 increased gradually, and became higher in the 14th, 28th, 56th days.&#xD;
      HRSD score was similar between baseline and the 1st day, and became significantly lower in&#xD;
      the 14th, 28th, and 56th day. Similar pattern was shown in CGI. Scores of HRSD-sleep&#xD;
      disturbance, PSQI, ESS decreased gradually throughout the treatment. The sleep latency in&#xD;
      multiple sleep latency test maintained stable throughout treatment. The reducing score rates&#xD;
      of HRSD and CGI-GI significantly correlated with the reducing score rate of REM latency in&#xD;
      all visits, and they also significantly correlated with sleep latency, sleep efficiency, and&#xD;
      stage 3 in some visits. Further, significant correlation was shown between the reducing score&#xD;
      rate of HRSD in the 56th day and the the reducing score rate of REM latency in the 1st day&#xD;
      (r=-0.733, P=0.003). Conclusions: Sertraline was an effective antidepressant, and its&#xD;
      effectiveness had relationship with the reduction of REM latency during the 8-week treatment.&#xD;
      Further, the final clinical improvement could be predicted by the extent of shorten REM&#xD;
      latency in the first night. So the suppression of REM sleep might be the key mechanism of&#xD;
      antidepressive[1]. On the other hand, Sertraline had little alerting property without sleep&#xD;
      disturbance in the treatment[2]. This property of sertraline must benefit the remission of&#xD;
      depression, and the remission contributed the sleep improvement in turn. It was virtuous&#xD;
      cycle in depressive treatment.&#xD;
