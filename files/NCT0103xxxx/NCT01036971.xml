      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The Neuroimaging Research Branch of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is&#xD;
      interested in developing a pool of potential research participants who may be eligible for&#xD;
      research studies on drug abuse and addiction, pharmacological and psychosocial therapies for&#xD;
      substance addiction, and the long-term effects of drugs on the development, function, and&#xD;
      structure of the brain and other organ systems. To develop this pool of potential&#xD;
      participants, researchers intend to screen adolescents and adults who may be eligible for&#xD;
      future research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To identify, recruit, and screen participants for NIDA neuroimaging research protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals 13 years of age and older who are able to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible participants will undergo two screening interviews: a telephone interview and&#xD;
           an in-person interview. The phone interview will determine eligibility for the in-person&#xD;
           interview. Adolescents who are eligible for further screening must bring a parent or&#xD;
           guardian with them to the in-person interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The in-person interview may require up to five visits to the NIDA clinical center. The&#xD;
           in-person visit will involve any or all of the following procedures: (1) full physical&#xD;
           examination and medical history; (2) psychiatric interview; (3) psychological testing;&#xD;
           (4) electrocardiogram; (5) samples of blood, urine, and hair; and (6) other minimally&#xD;
           invasive procedures as directed by the research staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the screening process, participants will be explicitly asked for permission to&#xD;
           recontact them after the 1-year duration of the screening protocol. For minors, both the&#xD;
           adolescent and the parent/guardian must agree to future contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No clinical care will be provided under this protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol describes the screening process used by the National Institute on Drug Abuse&#xD;
      (NIDA IRP) to assess potential research participants' eligibility for entering protocols of&#xD;
      the NIDA/IRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through its clinical research protocols, the IRP attempts to: elucidate the nature of drug&#xD;
      abuse and addiction; determine the potential use of new therapies, both pharmacological and&#xD;
      psychosocial; and decipher the long-term effects of drugs of abuse on the development,&#xD;
      maturation, function, and structure of the brain and other organ systems. In support of the&#xD;
      IRP's' work, the scientific goal of this screening protocol is to assess potential research&#xD;
      participants' eligibility for the IRP's research studies. Screening will include medical and&#xD;
      psychological tests and procedures. The data collected during screening are a unique and&#xD;
      valuable source of information that aids in the IRP's mission. Therefore, a secondary goal of&#xD;
      this protocol is to obtain data&#xD;
&#xD;
      that characterizes the population of subjects contacting the IRP about research participation&#xD;
      and to analyze data so obtained, such as that on the prevalence and consequences of HIV/AIDS,&#xD;
      viral hepatitis, and related diseases. The population screened includes male and female&#xD;
      adults age &gt;= 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening procedures include standard medical and psychological tests and procedures are&#xD;
      minimal risk. There is no direct benefit to subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are paid for undergoing the screening process. Most genetics data will be&#xD;
      collected under the aegis of protocol 10-DA-N457 and will be&#xD;
&#xD;
      compared with data collected under this study. Some studies require genotyping to be done as&#xD;
      part of screening. Those DNA samples will be stored so that if active or returning&#xD;
      participants are screened for future studies requiring genotyping during screening an&#xD;
      additional blood draw will not be required.&#xD;
