      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children who enter the foster care system are all too often exposed to illicit drugs in&#xD;
           the home. Children from these homes, known as drug endangered children, are not&#xD;
           routinely tested for harmful substances. Any short- and long-term physical or&#xD;
           developmental problems they may experience as a result of this exposure often go&#xD;
           undetected and untreated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children who are placed into protective custody are not always screened by physicians or&#xD;
           nurse practitioners. Although drug-endangered children under 18 years of age&#xD;
           automatically receive a urine toxicology screen to determine the types and levels of&#xD;
           illicit drugs in their systems, this procedure has difficulties and limitations that may&#xD;
           affect the quality of the data. Researchers are interested in developing more effective&#xD;
           methods of analyzing the presence or absence of illicit environmental drug exposure in&#xD;
           children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the most effective method of identifying long-term illicit stimulant drug&#xD;
      exposure in drug-endangered children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Children under 18 years of age who are being placed into protective custody after having&#xD;
      been found in a home where drugs are manufactured, used, or sold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will gain verbal consent for the procedure for children who are 7 years of&#xD;
           age or older. Children younger than 7 years of age will not be required to give verbal&#xD;
           consent for sample collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will collect standard urine samples for toxicological screening. Part of the&#xD;
           sample will be sent to the National Institute on Drug Abuse for evaluation; the rest&#xD;
           will remain with the local authority.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition to this standard procedure, researchers will collect a hair sample by&#xD;
           cutting a small amount of hair from the crown of the head as close to the root as&#xD;
           possible (and not pulling any hair out of the child's head).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will also use an oral swab to collect a saliva sample from the inside cheek&#xD;
           of each child.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No clinical care will be provided under this protocol....&#xD;

      This is a single-center, investigator-initiated study to determine the best method for&#xD;
      analyzing the presence or absence of illicit environmental drug exposure in children placed&#xD;
      into protective custody in Sacramento County. In collaboration with the National Institutes&#xD;
      of Health (NIH), National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) we will use diagnostic procedures to&#xD;
      determine the presence of illicit drugs in the following three samples: (1) hair; (2) oral&#xD;
      swab; and (3) urine. These samples will be sent to a designated NIH lab site where 100&#xD;
      de-identified samples will be analyzed for methamphetamine, amphetamine, Ecstasy (MDMA), and&#xD;
      MDEA.&#xD;

        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria are the following (and must have all of the following):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. children under the age of 18 (the vast majority - 87 percent - of children examined at&#xD;
             the Center are under the age of 6);&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. children placed into protective custody by Sacramento County CPS or law enforcement;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. children examined at the CAARE Center; and&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. children found in a home where drugs are manufactured, used and/or sold.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria are the following (any one of the following may apply):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. anyone who has reached the age of majority;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. those found to have parents who are not drug abusers;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. those where there was no definitive evidence of environmental drug exposure (i.e.,&#xD;
             suspicious parent, but no drugs were found in the home); or&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. any child, drug exposed or not, who is examined in the UCD Emergency Department (after&#xD;
             hours - 9:00 pm to 7:00 am - and weekends).&#xD;
