    <textblock>
      The PropR study will evaluate sensing during ventricular fibrillation (VF) in both bipolar&#xD;
      and extended bipolar configurations, in order to evaluate if both can be used interchangeably&#xD;
      in caring for patients. In addition, follow up evaluation of R wave amplitude over time would&#xD;
      allow us to determine whether one configuration is more likely to be associated with change.&#xD;
      This understanding would be important in selecting the proper configuration at the time of&#xD;
      implant.&#xD;

      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensing in bipolar and extended bipolar configurations are the same. However, sensing in&#xD;
      bipolar over time is more likely to decrease when compared to extended bipolar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare bipolar sensing and extended bipolar sensing in VF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare sensing in bipolar and extended bipolar over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. This study will be a randomized comparison of bipolar and extended bipolar sensing. As&#xD;
           per usual standard of care, at the end of ICD implantation two sensing tests in VF will&#xD;
           be performed. Patients will be randomized to sensing in VF through the device. Each&#xD;
           patient will undergo testing in one randomized configuration followed by a second test&#xD;
           in the other configuration. After testing at the time of implant, each patient will be&#xD;
           seen at one month in follow up. Sensing of each configuration will be reevaluated at&#xD;
           that time in sinus rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Each patient will serve as their own control, as data for sensing in both configurations&#xD;
           will be obtained in VF at the time of implant. During testing both signals types will be&#xD;
           recorded simultaneously through the ICD. The primary endpoint will be duration of&#xD;
           sensing (time to detection) in VF at the time of implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The secondary endpoint will be sensing in sinus rhythm at one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The patient population will include approximately 30-50 volunteers age &gt;18, male and&#xD;
           female, both ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy, with primary and secondary implant&#xD;
           indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients will be recruited when being evaluated for defibrillator implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Inclusion criteria: age &gt;18 with ability to give informed consent, who are expected to&#xD;
           live more than one year, with indication for defibrillator implant and who are not&#xD;
           pacemaker dependent. Patients will have either ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Exclusion criteria: age &lt;18, inability to give informed consent, or life expectancy less&#xD;
           than one year, pacemaker dependence, or use of preexisting lead for sensing, any&#xD;
           condition which would preclude ICD testing at the end of the implant. Patients who are&#xD;
           undergoing upgrade to an ICD from a pacemaker will also be excluded. In addition,&#xD;
           patients with inherited arrhythmias or ion channel related arrhythmias will be excluded&#xD;
           from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Withdrawal criteria: inability to implant device, implant lead at the RV apex, or make&#xD;
           follow up appointment (living out of state), patient death at time of implant, elevated&#xD;
           DFT (&lt;10 J margin between DFT and maximum output of the device) requiring additional&#xD;
           procedures, subcutaneous array etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Duration of patient participation would be one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Duration of study would be one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Procedures to be followed would include screening of all eligible patients undergoing&#xD;
           implant of a Medtronic defibrillator for either primary or secondary prevention. If&#xD;
           patients meet inclusion criteria they would then undergo informed consent and if willing&#xD;
           be enrolled in the study. Defibrillator implant and testing would be performed as per&#xD;
           usual practice of the implanting physician. The RV lead will be placed at the RV apex as&#xD;
           is usual for regular implantation of devices. However, if a lead is placed elsewhere,&#xD;
           the patient will need to be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. When VF induction is performed, sensing configuration would be tested in a randomized&#xD;
           fashion, unblinded to the operator. The untested configuration would then be tested&#xD;
           during second VF induction. Both tests would be performed at a sensitivity setting of&#xD;
           1.2mV, with a number of intervals to detection (NID) of 24/32. Final programming&#xD;
           polarity will be left at the initially tested polarity (first DFT test), unless the&#xD;
           operator sees a need to program differently for patient safety reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Medtronic defibrillators with both sensing configurations available will be used. Data&#xD;
           collection will be performed by Dr. Tolat, Dr. Berns, Dr. Lippman, Dr. Dell'Orfano, and&#xD;
           the study coordinator involved with the study. A data collection form and spreadsheet&#xD;
           will be kept for use when collecting data for analysis. Follow up will be performed at&#xD;
           one month post implant in the office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Anticipated risks are no more than that anticipated with usual ICD implant. To date,&#xD;
           usual implant includes induction of VF with analysis of sensing in VF and evaluation of&#xD;
           defibrillation threshold by delivery of shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There is no expected increased exposure to risk by performing this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Potential benefits would include gathering additional information on sensing in VF in&#xD;
           both configurations instead of performing the two sensing tests in one configuration.&#xD;
           This may directly benefit the patient by allowing for reprogramming defibrillator&#xD;
           without bringing the patient back to the hospital for further testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Data collection will include patient information kept in a database with name kept&#xD;
           confidential. Patients will only be identified by number in keeping with privacy laws&#xD;
           and practice. In addition to usual patient characteristics, data variables to be&#xD;
           collected in both configurations will include: R wave amplitude in sinus rhythm, time to&#xD;
           detection in VF, total episode duration (time to Vfib detection and charge delivered),&#xD;
           number of &quot;drop outs&quot; (undersensing) in VF, and follow up R wave amplitude in one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Statistical Methods will compare bipolar sensing configuration to the extended bipolar&#xD;
           configuration at baseline, sensing in VF (as measured by &quot;drop out&quot;, time to detection),&#xD;
           and follow up amplitude of the R wave at one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The current expected sample size with this pilot study is 30 patients. This may require&#xD;
           reevaluation depending on results at the time of interim analysis.&#xD;
