      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronic graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in&#xD;
           patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The symptoms of chronic GVHD&#xD;
           are similar to those of other autoimmune diseases, and treatment for the pain often&#xD;
           involves steroid use that can cause severe side effects over the long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At present, there is no research instrument that measures symptoms in children with&#xD;
           chronic GVHD. Treatment practitioners may use one of several pediatric quality of life&#xD;
           questionnaires, but because none of these is specific for chronic GVHD each instrument&#xD;
           has potential gaps in its ability to assess the full spectrum of problems experienced by&#xD;
           children with chronic GVHD. Researchers are interested in developing a better&#xD;
           understanding of the disease burden experienced by children and adolescents with chronic&#xD;
           GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To develop a Pediatric Chronic GVHD Symptom Scale (PCSS) that reliably measures the&#xD;
      disease-specific burden of chronic GVHD in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Children and adolescents 5 to 18 years of age who have undergone prior allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
      transplant and have been diagnosed with chronic GVHD that requires treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are two phases to the study; participants will enroll in phase I (question&#xD;
           generation) at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will interview participants and ask open-ended questions (requiring more&#xD;
           than a one- or two-word response) about symptoms that adults with chronic GVHD have&#xD;
           found problematic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both parents and children will participate in the interviews, which will be&#xD;
           audio-recorded. Depending on the child or adolescent s age, the interviews may be&#xD;
           conducted together with the parents or separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No treatment will be given as part of this study.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Currently, a large number of children with chronic GVHD have to deal with many years of&#xD;
           a disfiguring and painful chronic illness with the side effects of long term steroid&#xD;
           use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The broad categories of limited and extensive chronic GVHD are recognized by clinicians,&#xD;
           but are not particularly useful in clinical practice. Chronic GVHD may involve almost&#xD;
           every organ although it most commonly affects skin, eyes, mouth, liver, intestines, lung&#xD;
           and musculoskeletal system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recently, there has been a large effort through the NIH Consensus for chronic GVHD to&#xD;
           standardize response criteria for patients with chronic GVHD, on clinical trials.&#xD;
           Because of the absence of evidence suggesting which response criteria truly correlates&#xD;
           with improvement, the NIH Consensus Panel has recommended following not only physical&#xD;
           signs of chronic GVHD, but also symptoms of GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Develop a Pediatric Chronic GVHD Symptom Scale (PCSS) that reliably measures the disease&#xD;
      specific burden of chronic GVHD in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate high and low scores on the PCSS with standard quality of life measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine using the Rasch measurement model whether the PCSS has sufficient sensitivity&#xD;
           to change for the scale to be useful in clinical intervention trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children of 5 to 18 years of age, who have undergone prior allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
           transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical diagnosis of chronic GVHD with need for systemic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No evidence of primary disease relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Must be willing to sign informed consent, or if applicable, child assent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  With the final goal of developing a scale that is similar in design to the Lee Scale but&#xD;
           which measures the symptom burden more specifically for children with chronic GVHD, the&#xD;
           study will be conducted in two phases: item generation and psychometric validation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In phase I, the local team at each institution will interview participants using a&#xD;
           script to identify symptom concerns for pediatric chronic GVHD patients. Based on&#xD;
           interviews, we will decide whether to test different scales for the different age&#xD;
           groups, or a single scale for all.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data from Phase II will be used to finalize and validate the pediatric symptom scale,&#xD;
           through the assessment of test-retest characteristics, use of item reduction,&#xD;
           examination of construct validity, internal consistency, convergent and divergent&#xD;
           validity, and evaluation of sensitivity to change.&#xD;
