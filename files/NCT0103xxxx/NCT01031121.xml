      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-report and biochemical verification are used to determine smoking status in&#xD;
           treatment trials and clinical research. Each method has merits and limitations that make&#xD;
           it appropriate for particular situations. Participants who feel social pressure to&#xD;
           report tobacco abstinence may provide unreliable self-reporting results. Biochemical&#xD;
           verification using breath carbon monoxide (CO) is a more reliable indicator, but several&#xD;
           biological and environmental factors (including exposure to secondhand smoke) can affect&#xD;
           the sensitivity and specificity of breath CO measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An ideal biomarker of smoking status is cotinine, the major metabolite of nicotine.&#xD;
           Cotinine levels found in blood, urine, and saliva can be used to distinguish between&#xD;
           smokers and nonsmokers, as well as between light and heavy smokers. Researchers are&#xD;
           interested in using cotinine assessments to develop suitable breath CO cutoff levels to&#xD;
           categorize different types of smokers and nonsmokers for use in future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine a breath carbon monoxide (CO) cutoff level that optimally discriminates&#xD;
      between heavy and light smokers and nonsmokers who are and who are not exposed to&#xD;
      environmental tobacco smoke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals between 18 and 64 years of age who fall into one of the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  current smokers reporting more than 10 cigarettes per day for at least 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  current smokers reporting 10 or fewer cigarettes per day for at least 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  nonsmokers reporting regular environmental exposure to tobacco smoke&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  nonsmokers reporting limited or no exposure to tobacco smoke&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will involve a single outpatient session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide breath CO, urine, and saliva samples, and will complete&#xD;
           several smoking-related questionnaires on smoking history, current craving levels, and&#xD;
           perceived level of nicotine dependence.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine a breath carbon monoxide (CO) cutoff level that optimally discriminates between&#xD;
      heavy and light smokers and nonsmokers who are and who are not exposed to environmental&#xD;
      tobacco smoke. Breath CO will be compared against cotinine concentration, which is the gold&#xD;
      standard in verifying smoking status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include four groups: 1) 60 smokers reporting &gt; 10 cigarettes per day, 2) 60&#xD;
      smokers reporting less than or equal to 10 cigarettes per day, 3) 60 nonsmokers reporting&#xD;
      regular environmental exposure to tobacco smoke, and 4) 60 nonsmokers reporting limited or no&#xD;
      environmental exposure to tobacco smoke (total of 120 smokers and 120 nonsmokers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parallel groups design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) breath CO; 2) semiquantitative salivary cotinine; 3) quantitative salivary nicotine,&#xD;
      cotinine, and 3-hydroxycotinine; 4) semiquantitative urinary cotinine; 5) quantitative&#xD;
      urinary nicotine, cotinine, norcotinine, and 3-hydroxycotinine; and 6) self-reported smoking&#xD;
      variables.&#xD;
