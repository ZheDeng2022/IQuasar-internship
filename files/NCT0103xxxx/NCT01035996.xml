      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Schizophrenia is associated with cognitive impairment in different parts of the brain,&#xD;
      including those associated with learning and memory. The brain activity associated with these&#xD;
      impairments, however, is poorly understood. Researchers are interested in studying how the&#xD;
      brain chemical dopamine, which is involved in responding to incentives and rewards like money&#xD;
      or food, works differently in the brains of people who have schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study reward processing in individuals with schizophrenia who are taking different types&#xD;
      of medication, compared with healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 55 years of age who (a) have been diagnosed with&#xD;
      schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder and are taking the antipsychotic medication clozapine,&#xD;
      (b), have been diagnosed with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder and are taking a&#xD;
      different second-generation antipsychotic, or (c) are healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will involve one screening visit and one or more visits for testing and&#xD;
           functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans. During the screening visit,&#xD;
           participants will complete questionnaires and provide information about their physical&#xD;
           and psychological health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive training in the tasks to be performed at the scanning sessions&#xD;
           during the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the fMRI scans, participants will complete one or two of four possible&#xD;
           reward-based tasks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A task that enables participants to win money based on their response to a target item.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A task that provides small amounts of juice over specific time intervals, followed by a&#xD;
           procedure to be completed outside the scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A task that involves choosing figures or shapes and winning money based on responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A game of chance involving predictions based on shapes shown on a screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also provide blood samples for research and testing.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schizophrenia (SC) is associated with cognitive impairment in a variety of domains, including&#xD;
      learning and memory. The neural underpinnings of these cognitive deficits, however, are&#xD;
      poorly understood. Based on evidence that abnormal functioning of brain dopamine (DA) systems&#xD;
      is implicated in both schizophrenia and mechanisms of reinforcement processing, we proposed&#xD;
      to test theories of the functional role of dopamine in schizophrenia. Specifically, the&#xD;
      studies described here test two main ideas about DA function and its possible contribution to&#xD;
      SC: 1) its role in facilitating learning of cue-reward associations; and 2) its role in&#xD;
      signaling mismatches between expected and experienced outcomes (called prediction errors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess brain responses to outcomes, and cues predictive of outcomes, we will&#xD;
      enroll 135 total participants (SC patients and controls), aged 18 - 55. For a first set of&#xD;
      experiments, we enrolled 54 total subjects (37 SCs and 17 controls) to achieve 34 total&#xD;
      completers (24 SCs and 10 controls). In a second set of experiments, our goal is to examine&#xD;
      two types of SC patients (those taking clozapine and those taking a different&#xD;
      second-generation antipsychotic). For these experiments, we will enroll 81 total subjects (27&#xD;
      controls, 27 SCs taking clozapine, and 27 SCs taking a different second-generation&#xD;
      antipsychotic) to achieve approximately 47 total completers (15 controls, 16 SCs taking&#xD;
      clozapine, and 16 SCs taking a different second-generation antipsychotic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will measure brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in&#xD;
      conjunction with the performance of reinforcement processing tasks from the literature. These&#xD;
      paradigms involve either the passive observation of reinforcement contingencies, or the&#xD;
      requirement to make an appropriate response within a time window in order to earn positive&#xD;
      feedback. The ongoing study uses two specific paradigms: one examining the impact of brain&#xD;
      responses to feedback on subsequent learning, and one investigating how brain responses to a&#xD;
      monetary reinforcer are modulated by the unexpectedness of the event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, we will investigate differences in MRI responses to outcomes between SC&#xD;
      patients and controls, and between subgroups of patients. In particular, we are interested in&#xD;
      determining whether MRI responses in components of reward circuits, such as the midbrain,&#xD;
      basal ganglia, and orbitofrontal cortex, are attenuated in SC patients, in the context of&#xD;
      paradigms that require individuals to detect mismatches between expected and experienced&#xD;
      outcomes, and to modify responses based on those mismatches. We hypothesize that learning&#xD;
      deficits in SC stem primarily from impairments in the signaling of errors in reward&#xD;
      prediction, and that abnormalities in the signaling of errors in reward prediction will be&#xD;
      reflected in abnormal stimulus-evoked activation in the primarily in two brain areas in SC&#xD;
      patients (both DA target areas): prefrontal cortex and the neostriatum. We predict that these&#xD;
      signals will relate systematically to performance on a reinforcement-learning task.&#xD;

&#xD;
        All participants in the MRI scanning experiements will undergo standard screening as in the&#xD;
        clinical policies of the IRP:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All Participants in the MRI scanning experiments&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants in both experimental groups will be excluded from participation if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Are unable to undergo MRI scanning due to pregnancy (via pregnancy test), implanted or&#xD;
             attached metallic devices (e.g. cardiac pacemaker or neurostimulator; some artificial&#xD;
             joints metal pins; surgical clips; braces; or other implanted metal parts),&#xD;
             claustrophobia, or syncope, by self-report;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Show current evidence of severe hypertension, as indicated by a blood pressure&#xD;
             measurement at or above 190 systolic or 110 diastolic on two separate occasions.&#xD;
             Potential participants with evidence of chronic and/or poorly controlled hypertension&#xD;
             may be excluded by the MRP even with measurements below those values;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Show current evidence of diabetes, as indicated by a blood sugar measurement of over&#xD;
             300 mg/dl. Potential participants with evidence of chronic and/or poorly controlled&#xD;
             diabetes may be excluded by the MRP even with measurements below those values;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Suffer from HIV infection, coagulopathies, or other major medical illness which, in&#xD;
             the judgment of the MRP, would seriously compromise the quality of the data gathered;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have any neurological illnesses that would interfere with the quality of the&#xD;
             neuroimaging data gathered, i.e. to include (but not limited to): seizure disorders;&#xD;
             migraine; multiple sclerosis; movement disorders; or history of head trauma, CVA, or&#xD;
             CNS tumor;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Are notably cognitively impaired by history or observation;&#xD;
&#xD;

          8. Test positively for any of 7 common banned substances at the time of screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Are lactating, as hormonal fluctuations associated with lactation may interact with&#xD;
             dopamine system function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal, Healthy Control Participants&#xD;
&#xD;

          1. Have any current, or previous, diagnosis of any major psychiatric disorder, i.e. to&#xD;
             include (but not limited to) mood, anxiety, and psychiatric disorders, or any&#xD;
             substance-induced psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
