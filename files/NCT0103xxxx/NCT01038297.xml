    <measure>Part B: Expert Panel Scar Assessment Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 13 of Part B</time_frame>
    <description>Scar assessment by an expert panel was done on blinded photographs using 100 millimeter (mm) visual analog scale (VAS) where a score of 0 mm = best possible scar and a score of 100 mm = worst possible scar, where higher scores indicate worse condition. The difference was calculated for scars at Week 13 as EXC 001 score minus placebo score, thus a negative difference would indicate that the EXC 001-treated scars had lower scar severity. The score was defined as the within participant average difference between EXC 001- and Placebo-treated scars at Week 13.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part B: Physician Observer Global Assessment Scar Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 13 of Part B</time_frame>
    <description>Physician observer global assessment of scar score was done using a valid published 10-point rating scale. Physicians rated severity of each scar on a scale of 1 = normal skin to 10 = worst scar imaginable. Each scar was given a single score and the differences in scores between the matched pairs of scars were calculated. There were 4 differences within each dose level that were averaged to create a single score for each participant at each dose level. The score was defined as the within participant average difference between EXC 001 and Placebo.</description>

In Part B participants received intradermal injections of EXC 001 on 1 side of the abdominal incisions and on the other side received intradermal injections of placebo matched to EXC 001 at Week 2, 6 and 10. On the EXC 001 treated side 1 column received high dose (5.0 mg/linear cm) and other a low dose (1.0 mg/linear cm). Out of 2 lateral biomarker incisions 1 incision received high dose (5.0 mg/linear cm) and other a low dose (1.0 mg/linear cm). Participants received an abdominoplasty at week 13 with a follow-up post-surgery visit at week 14.</description>

        <title>Part B: Expert Panel Scar Assessment Score</title>
        <description>Scar assessment by an expert panel was done on blinded photographs using 100 millimeter (mm) visual analog scale (VAS) where a score of 0 mm = best possible scar and a score of 100 mm = worst possible scar, where higher scores indicate worse condition. The difference was calculated for scars at Week 13 as EXC 001 score minus placebo score, thus a negative difference would indicate that the EXC 001-treated scars had lower scar severity. The score was defined as the within participant average difference between EXC 001- and Placebo-treated scars at Week 13.</description>

        <description>The skin sensitivity reaction was assessed only at the skin sensitivity reaction testing sites. Erythematous, raised (indurated) and edematous reactions were considered as positive skin sensitivity reactions. The number of participants that experienced any positive skin sensitivity reactions were reported.</description>
        <time_frame>From Day 21 of Part A up to Week 2 of Part B</time_frame>
        <population>Safety population included participants who completed Part A Day 1 visit and received at least 1 dose of study drug. Safety assessment was not planned separately for EXC 001 and placebo in Part B.

            <description>In Part A participants received single intradermal injections of EXC-001 at a dose of 5 mg on Day 1 and 21. Third 5 mg intradermal injection was administered at the discretion of Investigator based on the event of an equivocal skin sensitization on Day 38 or at least 7 days prior to surgery (Day 1 in Part B). The injection site was evaluated immediately after the injection and on Days 21, 28, 38, 50 until day of surgery. Participants with negative skin sensitization in Part A were assigned to Part B of the study. In Part B Participants received intradermal injections of EXC 001 on 1 side of the abdominal incisions and on the other side received intradermal injections of placebo matched to EXC 001 at Week 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. On the EXC 001 treated side 1 column received high dose (5.0 mg/linear cm) and other a low dose (1.0 mg/linear cm). Out of 2 lateral biomarker incisions 1 incision received high dose (5.0 mg/linear cm) and other a low dose (1.0 mg/linear cm). Participants received an abdominoplasty at week 13 with a follow-up post-surgery visit at week 14.</description>
