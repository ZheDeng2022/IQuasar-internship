      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Beers list identifies medications that should be avoided in persons 65 years or older&#xD;
      because they are ineffective, pose an unnecessarily high risk, or a safer alternative is&#xD;
      available. In a recent study, we found a high rate of prescribing of Beers list medications&#xD;
      to hospitalized patients. At Baystate, 41% of medical patients received at least one Beers&#xD;
      list drug classified as &quot;high severity,&quot; meaning it carried a high risk for an adverse drug&#xD;
      reaction, while 5% received 3 or more. Some Beers drugs have been associated with delirium&#xD;
      and falls. When compared to Baystate patients who did not receive a high severity medication,&#xD;
      those who did had an increased risk of mortality (7.8% vs. 5.2%), longer length of stay (5.5&#xD;
      days vs. 3.9 days) and higher costs ($11,240 vs. 6243).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quantify the impact of synchronous electronic alerts on physician prescribing of&#xD;
           high-severity Beers' list drugs to hospitalized patients over the age of 65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare physician reactions to each drug-specific alert&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will develop a series of clinical alerts in CIS, Baystate's computerized provider order&#xD;
      entry system, to reduce the use of potentially inappropriate medications among hospitalized&#xD;
      elders. We will randomize providers to electronic alerts or usual care. Whenever a provider&#xD;
      randomized to alerts attempts to place an order for a high-risk medication on the Beers list&#xD;
      and the intended recipient is over 65 years of age, a synchronous alert (i.e. a &quot;pop-up&quot;)&#xD;
      will inform the physician about the risks associated with the medication and will propose&#xD;
      safer alternatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will collect data on physician ordering and patient outcomes comparing the number of Beers&#xD;
      list prescriptions from providers receiving electronic alerts to those not receiving alerts.&#xD;
      Our anticipated outcome is a decrease in inappropriate prescribing during the period when the&#xD;
      electronic alerts are activated. Other potential outcomes include decrease in length of stay&#xD;
      and a decrease in falls.&#xD;
