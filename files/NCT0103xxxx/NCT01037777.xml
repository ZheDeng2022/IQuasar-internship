  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of&#xD;
      autosomal dominantly inherited progressive ataxia disorders. It is estimated that there are&#xD;
      30,000 individuals in the European Community that directly descend from individuals affected&#xD;
      by a SCA disorder and thus carry a 50% risk of having inherited an SCA mutation. These at&#xD;
      risk individuals provide a unique research opportunity to prospectively study the&#xD;
      presymptomatic phase of SCA disorders and to identify the earliest and most sensitive&#xD;
      clinical signs and biological markers that herald the onset of the illness. This information&#xD;
      is of critical importance for the development of future therapeutic interventions aimed at&#xD;
      postponing the clinical onset of ataxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore propose to perform a prospective observational study of individuals at risk for&#xD;
      the most common SCA disorders, SCA1, SCA2, SCA3 and SCA6 (RISCA). It is our aim to answer the&#xD;
      following questions: (1) What is the incidence of disease manifestation in mutation carriers?&#xD;
      (2) Which clinical signs precede the onset of manifest ataxia in SCA1, SCA2, SCA3 and SCA6?&#xD;
      (3) What are the prevalence and incidence of preceding signs? (4) Are the prevalence and&#xD;
      incidence of preceding signs affected by genotype, gender, age, estimated time until disease&#xD;
      manifestation and repeat length? (5) Does the presence of certain preceding signs predict the&#xD;
      manifestation of ataxia ? (6) Are there MRI alterations that precede the onset of ataxia? It&#xD;
      is planned to enroll 480 study participants and to follow them at regular intervals over six&#xD;
      years. At each visit, study participants are asked in a structured interview for a number of&#xD;
      predefined clinical signs that potentially precede the onset of ataxia. In addition, the&#xD;
      following self-assessment scales will be applied: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI),&#xD;
      Diagnostic Criteria for Restless Legs Syndrome, Patient´s Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). All&#xD;
      study participants will undergo a physical examination including the Scale for the Assessment&#xD;
      and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). Study participants will further perform the SCA Functional&#xD;
      Composite (SCA-FC) which is a comprehensive measure of functional capacity based on results&#xD;
      in quantitative tests related to gait (8m timed walk), speech (PATA rate) and hand function&#xD;
      (9 hole pegboard). In a subset of study participants, we will record eye movements and obtain&#xD;
      volumetric MRIs. The study will also be used to collect and store blood and urine samples for&#xD;
      proteomic and gene expression studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISCA is conducted by the Ataxia Study Group (ASG). It relies on the network structure&#xD;
      created by the EUROSCA project.&#xD;
