  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The vascular endothelium (inner lining of cells in blood vessels) normally prevents vasospasm&#xD;
      and thrombosis by production of a variety of regulatory substances, including nitric oxide.&#xD;
      In patients with atherosclerosis, these functions of the endothelium are impaired and these&#xD;
      abnormalities may contribute to the development of heart attack and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational studies have shown that frequent nut consumption decreases the risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD), but the mechanisms of benefit have not been fully defined.&#xD;
      Recent studies suggest that specific fatty acids and flavonoids in nuts may have favorable&#xD;
      effects on cardiovascular disease. In addition, there is growing evidence that these&#xD;
      compounds may improve the function of the endothelium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is designed to test the hypothesis that an almond-enriched diet will&#xD;
      improve the function of the endothelium in patients with coronary artery disease. Subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled into a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study that will compare a&#xD;
      National Cholesterol Education Program Step 1 diet without nuts to a Step 1 diet that has the&#xD;
      same number of total calories but includes 3 ounces of almonds daily. Participants will&#xD;
      consume each diet for six weeks with a four-week rest period between diets. The order of&#xD;
      diets will be randomized (almonds or no almonds). Dietary assessments via food recall&#xD;
      questionnaires will be employed at the study entry, end of the four week washout period, and&#xD;
      end of the second intervention. If subjects are drifting from the recommendations of the STEP&#xD;
      1 diet, counseling will be given to urge compliance. The primary endpoint will be&#xD;
      endothelium-dependent flow- mediated dilation assessed by ultrasound. Secondary study&#xD;
      outcomes will include lipid profiles, markers of inflammation and oxidative stress.&#xD;
      Enrollment will continue until 40 subjects with complete data are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled at Boston Medical Center and the Jean Mayer US Department of&#xD;
      Agriculture Human Nutrition Research Center at Tufts Medical Center. Dietary interventions&#xD;
      will be performed at Tufts Medical Center or by telephone. Ultrasound studies and blood&#xD;
      collection will be performed in the principal investigator's research unit at Boston Medical&#xD;
      Center.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male and Female subjects.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Clinically defined coronary artery disease that is clinical stable and compensated&#xD;
             with appropriate treatment. Coronary disease (CVD) is defined by the presence of&#xD;
             lesions on coronary angiography, history of myocardial infarction, or positive stress&#xD;
             test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Willingness to give written informed consent and willingness and ability to&#xD;
             understand, to participate to and to comply with the study requirements.&#xD;
