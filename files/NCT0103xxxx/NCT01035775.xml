      Colonoscopy is not a perfect test. It misses a substantial number of neoplastic lesions and&#xD;
      has some risk of missing cancer. Nearly all work on detection during colonoscopy has focused&#xD;
      on the withdrawal phase of the examination. This randomized, controlled trial will compare&#xD;
      the additional effect on the rate of adenoma detection of mucosal inspection during&#xD;
      colonoscope insertion, with inspection during instrument withdrawal, in patients undergoing&#xD;
      colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening or surveillance.&#xD;

      Background: Colonoscopy is not a perfect test. It misses a substantial number of neoplastic&#xD;
      lesions and has some risk of missing cancer. Nearly all work on detection during colonoscopy&#xD;
      has focused on the withdrawal phase of the examination. Thus, colonoscopy is typically&#xD;
      performed by rapidly passing the instrument through the loops and bends of the colon in order&#xD;
      to reach the tip of the cecum, and then performing a slow withdrawal in which the tip of the&#xD;
      instrument is systematically deflected, and the mucosa is careful cleaned and suctioned, to&#xD;
      expose all of the colonic mucosa for viewing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many experienced colonoscopists recognize that small polyps seen incidentally but not removed&#xD;
      during insertion are sometimes quite difficult to find during withdrawal. The reason for this&#xD;
      observation is probably because the colon is in a very different anatomical conformation&#xD;
      during endoscope insertion and withdrawal. During insertion, the colon is in its natural&#xD;
      conformation in which the sigmoid and transverse colon has several sharp bends or flexures,&#xD;
      and the overall length has not yet been shortened. In this phase, the colon is often&#xD;
      significantly stretched because of the formation of loops and bends in the colonoscope. This&#xD;
      greatly affects the conformation of the colonic wall visualized proximal to the instrument&#xD;
      tip. During withdrawal, the colon is shortened and pleated over the colonoscope, with&#xD;
      successive regions of the colon being inspected as they slip off the end of the instrument.&#xD;
      Thus, segments of visualized colon are often much straighter during withdrawal than during&#xD;
      insertion. The insertion and withdrawal phases, therefore, expose somewhat different sections&#xD;
      of the mucosal surface to the colonoscope and inspection on insertion and withdrawal are,&#xD;
      quite possibly, complementary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: This randomized, controlled trial will compare the additional effect on the rate of&#xD;
      adenoma detection of mucosal inspection during colonoscope insertion, with inspection during&#xD;
      instrument withdrawal, in patients undergoing colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening or&#xD;
      surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure: In this study, we plan to investigate whether a specified interval of&#xD;
      inspection during insertion can increase overall adenoma detection. We will conduct a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial, in which patients will be randomized to have all of the&#xD;
      inspection performed during the withdrawal phase (as is usual care) versus having several&#xD;
      minutes of examination specifically devoted to inspection during insertion.&#xD;
