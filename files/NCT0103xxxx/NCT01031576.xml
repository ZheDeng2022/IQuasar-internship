      Osteoarthritis is the result of the degeneration of the cartilage to articulate, being&#xD;
      currently considered as having an multifactorial cause.The knees are one of the affected&#xD;
      joints more due to overload that constitutes the main activator or determinative mechanism&#xD;
      for the development of the illness. Beyond pain it has important reduction of the amplitude&#xD;
      of movement and the muscular force that causes functional limitation and posture's&#xD;
      alterations intervening with the activities of daily life. Therefore, the main objective of&#xD;
      this study will be to characterize the posture's alterations and the electromiographic&#xD;
      activity in patients with osteoarthritis of knees. For this study 30 citizens will be&#xD;
      evaluated, 15 with diagnosis of OA of knees unilaterally and 15 healthful citizens, both the&#xD;
      groups will be of the feminine sex with age between 60 to 80 years. The selected patients&#xD;
      will answer a questionnaire of personal dates and will have an evaluation fiche, in which&#xD;
      will be written down: age, index of corporal mass (IMC), index of Lesquene, index WOMAC&#xD;
      (Western Ontario and Mac Master), personal and familiar date of the diagnosis, antecedents,&#xD;
      instituted treatments, date of the last x-ray, radiological classification of the&#xD;
      osteoarthritis according to Scale of Kellgren, electromiographics date and seeming of the&#xD;
      postural evaluation. For the electromiographic evaluation the activity of the muscles vastus&#xD;
      lateralis and medial oblique in the isometric contraction maximum volunteer (ICMV) and in the&#xD;
      march will be analyzed. And for the postural evaluation will be made three photographs in the&#xD;
      sights previous frontal and sagittal right and left, being that, for the analysis of the&#xD;
      posturais alterations the program will be used SAPO.&#xD;

      Osteoarthritis is the result of the degeneration of the cartilage to articulate, being&#xD;
      currently considered as having an multifactorial cause. Of the histological point of view it&#xD;
      is characterized for alterations of the loss of the natural viscoelasticity, giving to origin&#xD;
      the foci of &quot;softening&quot; in the cartilaginous surface that if gets depressed becoming&#xD;
      discontinues for the appearance of &quot;fibrillation zones&quot; provoking reaction of the subcondral&#xD;
      bone that if condemns in the pressure areas (sclerosis) and proliferates together to the&#xD;
      edges of the joint (osteophytic). It is that affect millions of people annually and one of&#xD;
      the main and a common condition causes pain functional incapacity generating enormous&#xD;
      economic load for the community. The knees are one of the affected joints more due to&#xD;
      overload that constitutes the main activator or determinative mechanism for the development&#xD;
      of the illness. Beyond pain it has important reduction of the amplitude of movement and the&#xD;
      muscular force that causes functional limitation and posture's alterations intervening with&#xD;
      the activities of daily life. Therefore, the main objective of this study will be to&#xD;
      characterize the posture's alterations and the electromiographic activity in patients with&#xD;
      osteoarthritis of knees. For this study 60 citizens will be evaluated, 30 with diagnosis of&#xD;
      OA of knees unilaterally and 30 healthful citizens, both the groups will be of the feminine&#xD;
      sex with age between 65 to 75 years. The selected patients will answer a questionnaire of&#xD;
      personal dates and will have an evaluation fiche, in which will be written down: age, index&#xD;
      of corporal mass (IMC), index of Lesquene, index WOMAC (Western Ontario and Mac Master),&#xD;
      personal and familiar date of the diagnosis, antecedents, instituted treatments, date of the&#xD;
      last x-ray, radiological classification of the osteoarthritis according to Scale of Kellgren,&#xD;
      electromiographics date and seeming of the postural evaluation. For the electromiographic&#xD;
      evaluation the activity of the muscles vastus lateralis and medial oblique in the isometric&#xD;
      contraction maximum volunteer (ICMV) and in the march will be analyzed. And for the postural&#xD;
      evaluation will be made three photographs in the sights previous frontal and sagittal right&#xD;
      and left, being that, for the analysis of the posturais alterations the program will be used&#xD;
      SAPO (software for postural evaluation - version 0.63).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the analysis descriptive statistics the average, medium and shunting line will be used&#xD;
      standard. The level of significance will be established in α &lt; 0,05.&#xD;
