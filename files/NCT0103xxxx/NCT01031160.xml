    <textblock>
      NEXT is a seven-year longitudinal assessment of a representative sample of U.S. adolescent&#xD;
      and young adults starting at grade 10. The goals of the NEXT longitudinal study include: to&#xD;
      identify the trajectory of adolescent health status and health behaviors from mid-adolescence&#xD;
      through the post high school years; to examine individual predictors of the onset of key&#xD;
      adolescent risk behaviors and risk indicators during this period; to identify genetic,&#xD;
      personal, family, school, and social/environmental factors that promote or sustain positive&#xD;
      health behaviors; to identify transition points in health risk and risk behaviors and changes&#xD;
      in family, school, and social/environmental precursors to these transitions, and to examine&#xD;
      the role of potential gene-environment interactions in the development of health status and&#xD;
      health behaviors. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study collects reliable and valid data on health behaviors and health indicators and&#xD;
      their social, environmental, and biological contexts beginning with a nationally&#xD;
      representative probability cohort of 10th-grade children in the U.S in 2009 and following&#xD;
      them through 2016. Measures are collected annually for seven years beginning in the 2009-2010&#xD;
      school year and ending in the 2016-2017 school year. African-American youth are oversampled&#xD;
      to provide better population estimates of this group and to provide an adequate sample to&#xD;
      examine racial/ethnic differences in longitudinal predictors of health, health behaviors, and&#xD;
      health behavior change. Hispanic youth do not require oversampling because they currently&#xD;
      represent a sufficient proportion of the population of adolescents to provide an adequate&#xD;
      sample to examine racial/ethnic differences. Self-reports of health status, health behaviors,&#xD;
      and health attitudes are collected by in-school and online surveys. Anthropometric data,&#xD;
      genetic information, and neighborhood characteristics are gathered on all participants as&#xD;
      well. The study also incorporates an Administrator Survey and other data sources to obtain&#xD;
      related information on school-level health programs and community-level contextual data. The&#xD;
      NEXT Generation Health Study data support NICHD, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute&#xD;
      (NHLBI), National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and&#xD;
      Alcoholism (NIAAA) and the Maternal and Child Health Branch of the Health Resources and&#xD;
      Services Administration (HRSA/MCHB) in fulfillment of program requirements that address&#xD;
      supportive health environments for adolescents and young adults. In addition, a&#xD;
      representative subsample of overweight and normal weight adolescents has been identified:&#xD;
      additional data on behavioral risk factors and biological markers and risk factors are&#xD;
      gathered on these adolescents. Driving performance will also be evaluated in 150 young&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;

        This study will include two phases. Phase 1 will include a secondary data analysis with&#xD;
        emerging adults and peer driving data acquired from the NEXT Longitudinal Study collected&#xD;
        by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) at the NIH. Phase 2&#xD;
        will include conducting qualitative data collection through 4-5 focus groups on University&#xD;
        of Maryland College Park (UMCP) campus with undergraduate students (age 18-22) to&#xD;
        understand the influential factors associated with social norms on distracted driving&#xD;
