    <textblock>
      A PET scan drop less than 20% in SUVs or below a certain absolute SUV value after the first&#xD;
      course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy can predict pathological response, and could in the future&#xD;
      lead to an early surgical intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of neo-adjuvant systemic therapy in women recently diagnosed with breast cancer is&#xD;
      growing in popularity based on its proven benefit (1). Pre-operative chemotherapy not only&#xD;
      can assist in regards to breast conservation therapy (2) but data suggest prognostic benefits&#xD;
      in those subset of patient's obtaining complete pathological response (3,4) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is imperative for clinicians to detect as early as possible those patients likely to&#xD;
      obtain the desired clinical and /or pathologic response, thus identifying those patients who&#xD;
      don't benefit from the first line neoadjuvant treatment so that their treatment can be&#xD;
      modified accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response to treatment based on clinical data or structural imaging, usually requires several&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic cycles to establish degree of effectiveness (5). Lately, FDG-PET/CT has been&#xD;
      used in different types of neoplasms, breast cancer among them, to establish early response&#xD;
      to treatment (6,7). Recent data has established the usefulness of metabolic analysis via&#xD;
      FDG-PET, in separating subgroups of chemotherapy. For such analytical approach, sequential&#xD;
      estimation of SUVs (Standardized Uptake Value) have been measured along the duration of the&#xD;
      treatment. Reduction in SUVs presumes adequate response to treatment (8), while little or no&#xD;
      change in metabolic activity presumes sub-optimal response .&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, no definite consensus has been established in regards to what degree of metabolic&#xD;
      response is predictive of the desired clinical benefit, particularly early in the treatment .&#xD;
      Establishing such criteria could potentially serve as a guideline for monitoring neoadjuvant&#xD;
      treatment. Schelling et al, was able to separate a group of patients that eventually showed&#xD;
      either progression of the disease or no clinical response as early as the first course of&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to establish a simple formula using FDG-PET/CT, as early as the first&#xD;
      course of chemotherapy, to stratify patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for recently&#xD;
      diagnosed breast cancer. Those who will benefit from continuing the same treatment will be&#xD;
      regarded as responders versus non-responders, which are those in need of changing strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to correlate the results of FDG-PET/CT performed 15 days&#xD;
      after the first course of chemotherapy versus those of clinical assessment and breast MRI&#xD;
      obtained after the 3rd course of chemotherapy. At that time, a clinical decision on which&#xD;
      therapeutic path to be followed will be made.&#xD;
