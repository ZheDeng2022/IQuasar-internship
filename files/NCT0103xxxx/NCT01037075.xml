  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals with schizophrenia have a significantly higher tendency to develop substance&#xD;
           abuse or dependence than the general population. For instance, people with schizophrenia&#xD;
           smoke much more than the general population, and many are dependent on street drugs such&#xD;
           as cocaine and heroin. However, these individuals are rarely included in research&#xD;
           studies that might provide more information about treatments for both schizophrenia and&#xD;
           substance abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Strong evidence suggests that schizophrenia and substance dependence have similar&#xD;
           effects on the brain, affecting attention, memory, and eye movement. Other research&#xD;
           indicates that schizophrenia and substance dependence affect the same parts of the&#xD;
           dopamine system, contributing to problems in brain function that require treatment.&#xD;
           These new developments provide a strong rationale to study the combination of&#xD;
           schizophrenia and substance dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nicotine may help improve brain function and thinking in individuals with both&#xD;
           schizophrenia and drug dependence. Some of the thinking and memory problems experienced&#xD;
           by these individuals can be treated with nicotine. However, more research is needed to&#xD;
           determine exactly how nicotine affects individuals with both schizophrenia and drug&#xD;
           dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether individuals with schizophrenia and drug dependence show impairment&#xD;
           in tests of eye tracking, attention, and memory compared with healthy control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of nicotine on eye tracking, attention, and memory in individuals&#xD;
           with both schizophrenia and substance dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Current smokers (at least 10 cigarettes per day for the past year) between 18 and 55 years&#xD;
      of age who (1) have been diagnosed with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder, (2) have been&#xD;
      diagnosed with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder and are currently using heroin and/or&#xD;
      cocaine, or (3) are healthy individuals with no family history of psychotic illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will consist of one training session and three testing sessions. Each session&#xD;
           will last about 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The training session will introduce participants to the study tests and evaluate their&#xD;
           tolerance of the nicotine nasal spray used in the study. Participants who cannot&#xD;
           tolerate the higher dose of the spray will not continue in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the start of each testing session, smokers will have one cigarette to standardize the&#xD;
           time of the most recent exposure to nicotine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the testing sessions, participants will receive a placebo spray, a lower dose of&#xD;
           nicotine, or a higher dose of nicotine, and then will be asked to perform tests that&#xD;
           evaluate attention, memory, and other thinking tasks.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim 1: To test the hypothesis that individuals with comorbid schizophrenia and drug&#xD;
      dependence will show impaired neurocognitive functions in anticipatory learning of&#xD;
      eyetracking, attention, and memory performance compared to healthy controls subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim 2: To test the hypothesis that nicotine will dose-dependently improve&#xD;
      anticipatory learning of eyetracking, attention, and memory performance in individuals with&#xD;
      comorbid schizophrenia and substance dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male and nonpregnant-female smokers 18 to 55 years of age, from the following subject groups:&#xD;
      (1) patients with a DSM IV diagnosis of schizophrenia (2) patients with dual DSM IV diagnoses&#xD;
      of schizophrenia and heroin and/or cocaine dependence or abuse, or on methadone or&#xD;
      beprenorphine maintenance and (3) healthy individuals with no family history of psychotic&#xD;
      illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a double-blind, placebo controlled trial of nicotine or placebo nasal&#xD;
      sprays. Participants will have four visits. After the training session, participants will be&#xD;
      administered one dose (0, 1 or 2 mg) of nicotine nasal spray during each of the 3&#xD;
      experimental sessions. The dose will be given 5 minutes prior to the cognitive task&#xD;
      batteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital signs, moods, and performance on tasks assessing eye movement (initiation latency,&#xD;
      initiation acceleration, closed-loop pursuit gain), attention (Continuous Performance and&#xD;
      Digit Symbol Substitution Tasks), and memory (delayed recognition and nback).&#xD;
