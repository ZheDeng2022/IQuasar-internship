      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the well-known benefits of exercise, 64% of the Swiss population do not fulfill the&#xD;
      public health recommendation of physical activity. A survey of female staff members over 45&#xD;
      years of age from the University Hospital Zurich at the end of 2003 showed that physical&#xD;
      inactivity is also prevalent in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess whether inactive women working at a large hospital centre prefer Nordic Walking&#xD;
      (NW) or a Jogging (J) as a health promotion strategy. (2) To test whether the method chosen&#xD;
      by the majority improves physical performance, physical activity, body weight and&#xD;
      composition, and bone mineral density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators will send out a questionnaire to all female staff members at a&#xD;
      large hospital centre age 45 and older, ask whether they are inactive, and whether they&#xD;
      prefer Nordic Walking or Jogging as a health promotion strategy. Depending on the preference&#xD;
      of the majority of the women, the investigators will then ask inactive female staff members&#xD;
      age 45+ to participate in a 12-months randomized controlled trial comparing training plus&#xD;
      nutrition education to nutrition education alone. The training will have a 3-month&#xD;
      building-up phase followed up by an in part unsupervised training of 9 months. All&#xD;
      participants will receive a lecture on healthy nutrition once a months for 12 months. The&#xD;
      investigators will assess diet with a food frequency questionnaire at baseline and after 12&#xD;
      and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is: physical performance, measured with the 12-minute Coopertest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints are: level of physical activity, body mass index, body composition&#xD;
      and bone mineral density at the spine and the hip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance: This project will address the questions which physical activities are preferred&#xD;
      by inactive women and whether the preferred training improves physical performance, physical&#xD;
      activity, body mass index, body composition and bone mineral density. In addition, our study&#xD;
      will explore whether those women who changed their diet in addition to being randomized to&#xD;
      the training group have an enhanced benefit.&#xD;
