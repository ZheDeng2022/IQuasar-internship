  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of&#xD;
      multiple doses of MK-3614 in male participants with mild to moderate hypertension. The&#xD;
      primary hypotheses are: 1) Multiple oral doses of MK-3614 are sufficiently safe and well&#xD;
      tolerated to permit continued clinical investigation 2) Aortic Augmentation Index (Aix) is&#xD;
      reduced 24 hours post the last dose of MK-3614 administered compared to placebo and 3)&#xD;
      Increase in the 12-hour weighted averages (TWA 0-12hours) of the heart rate is within 15&#xD;
      beats per minute (bpm) of baseline on first day of multiple dosing of MK-3614 and within 10&#xD;
      bpm of baseline on last day of multiple dosing of MK-3614.&#xD;

    <description>Aortic AIx is the percentage of the central pulse pressure attributed to the reflected pulse wave, and is an indirect measure of systemic arterial stiffness. Aortic AIx was measured at pre-specified timepoints by aplanation tonometry of radial artery. Linear model containing panel as a fixed effect was used to report the change from baseline in aortic Aix at 24 hours postdose. The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the true mean difference (MK-3614-placebo) in change from baseline were obtained using the mean square error from the linear model. Placebo data was pooled across all panels for the analysis. A decrease in the point estimate of ≥ 5 percentage points was considered clinically meaningful.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Aortic Augmentation Index (AIx) at 24 Hours Postdose After Multiple Doses of MK-3614 or Placebo</title>
        <description>Aortic AIx is the percentage of the central pulse pressure attributed to the reflected pulse wave, and is an indirect measure of systemic arterial stiffness. Aortic AIx was measured at pre-specified timepoints by aplanation tonometry of radial artery. Linear model containing panel as a fixed effect was used to report the change from baseline in aortic Aix at 24 hours postdose. The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the true mean difference (MK-3614-placebo) in change from baseline were obtained using the mean square error from the linear model. Placebo data was pooled across all panels for the analysis. A decrease in the point estimate of ≥ 5 percentage points was considered clinically meaningful.</description>

        <description>Peripheral SBP was measured by the SphygmoCor® device. TWA 0-12hrs was obtained as follows: For all peripheral SBP values obtained over the 12-hour observation period (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12 hours postdose), multiplied the length of time that the participant spent at each peripheral SBP value by that peripheral SBP value, added these products together, and then divided by duration of the observation period.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Time-Weighted Average Across 12 Hours (TWA 0-12hrs) of Peripheral Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) on Last Day After Multiple Dosing of MK-3614 or Placebo</title>
        <description>Peripheral SBP was measured by the SphygmoCor® device. TWA 0-12hrs was obtained as follows: For all peripheral SBP values obtained over the 12-hour observation period (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours postdose), multiplied the length of time that the participant spent at each peripheral SBP value by that peripheral SBP value, added these products together, and then divided by duration of the observation period. Multiple dose effects of MK-3614 or placebo on peripheral SBP were estimated as a TWA change from baseline (0 hours) over the 12 hour postdose on last day of multiple dosing (Panels A, B, C: Day 10; Panel D: Day 13) and summarized descriptively. Placebo data was pooled across all panels for the analysis. Linear model containing panel as a fixed effect was used report the mean difference from placebo and associated 90% CIs after multiple doses of MK-3614 or placebo.</description>
        <time_frame>Panels A, B, C: Day 1: Baseline (0 hours) &amp; up to 12 hours; Panel D: Day 4: Baseline (0 hours) &amp; up to 12 hours; Placebo: Day 1 or Day 4: Baseline (0 hours) &amp; up to 12 hours</time_frame>
        <population>All participants who received multiple doses of MK-3614 or a matching placebo, who complied with the protocol sufficiently to ensure that these data exhibited the effects of treatment, according to the underlying scientific model and had available data for the SBP were evaluated. No participants were enrolled in Panel E.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Time-Weighted Average Across 12 Hours (TWA 0-12hrs) of Peripheral Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) on First Day of Multiple Dosing of MK-3614 or Placebo</title>
        <description>Peripheral DBP was measured by the SphygmoCor® device. TWA 0-12hrs was obtained as follows: For all peripheral DBP values obtained over the 12-hour observation period (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours postdose), multiplied the length of time that the participant spent at each peripheral DBP value by that peripheral DBP value, added these products together, and then divided by duration of the observation period. Multiple dose effects of MK-3614 or placebo on peripheral DBP were estimated as a TWA change from baseline (0 hours) over the 12 hour postdose on first day of multiple dosing (Panels A, B, C: Day 1; Panel D: Day 4) and summarized descriptively. Placebo data was pooled across all panels for the analysis. Linear model containing panel as a fixed effect was used report the mean difference from placebo and associated 90% CIs after multiple doses of MK-3614 or placebo.</description>
        <time_frame>Panels A, B, C: Day 1: Baseline (0 hours) &amp; up to 12 hours postdose; Panel D: Day 4: Baseline (0 hours) &amp; up to 12 hours postdose; Placebo: Day 1 or Day 4: Baseline (0 hours) &amp; up to 12 hours postdose</time_frame>
        <population>All participants who received multiple doses of MK-3614 or a matching placebo, who complied with the protocol sufficiently to ensure that these data exhibited the effects of treatment, according to the underlying scientific model and had available data for the DBP were evaluated.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Time-Weighted Average Across 24 Hours (TWA 0-24hrs) of Peripheral Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) on Last Day of Multiple Dosing of MK-3614 or Placebo</title>
        <description>Peripheral DBP was measured by the SphygmoCor® device. TWA 0-24hrs was obtained as follows: For all peripheral DBP values obtained over the 24-hour observation period (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 24 hours postdose), multiplied the length of time that the participant spent at each peripheral DBP value by that peripheral DBP value, added these products together, and then divided by duration of the observation period. Multiple dose effects of MK-3614 or placebo on peripheral DBP were estimated as a TWA change from baseline (0 hours) over the 12 hour postdose on last day of multiple dosing (Panels A, B, C: Day 10; Panel D: Day 13) and summarized descriptively. Placebo data was pooled across all panels for the analysis. Linear model containing panel as a fixed effect was used report the mean difference from placebo and associated 90% CIs after multiple doses of MK-3614 or placebo.</description>
        <time_frame>Panels A, B, C: Day 10: Baseline (0 hours) &amp; up to 24 hours postdose; Panel D: Day 13: Baseline (0 hours) &amp; up to 24 hours postdose; Placebo: Day 10 or Day 13: Baseline (0 hours) &amp; up to 24 hours postdose</time_frame>
        <population>All participants who received multiple doses of MK-3614 or a matching placebo, who received multiple doses of MK-3614, who complied with the protocol sufficiently to ensure that these data exhibited the effects of treatment, according to the underlying scientific model and had available data for the DBP were evaluated. No participants were enrolled in Panel E.</population>
