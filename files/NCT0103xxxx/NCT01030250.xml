  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to increase our understanding of the adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      experience in older and younger adults by prospectively describing the longitudinal&#xD;
      trajectory of functional status, comorbidity, and quality of life from before the initiation&#xD;
      of chemotherapy to 6 months after the completion of treatment in older (65 and older) and&#xD;
      younger (under 65) adults. In addition, we will determine the effect of pre-treatment&#xD;
      physical functioning on physical recovery after the course of adjuvant chemotherapy. The&#xD;
      secondary objective of this study is to explore if factors other than chronological age&#xD;
      (functional status, co-morbid medical conditions, nutritional status, psychological state,&#xD;
      cognitive function, and social support) predicts which patients are more likely to experience&#xD;
      morbidity (defined as grade 3-5 toxicity, hospitalization, dose reduction or delay, or&#xD;
      premature discontinuation of chemotherapy course) from adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      60% of all cancers and 70% of cancer mortality occur in people greater than 65 years of age,&#xD;
      defining cancer as a disease of older adults. Breast cancer is no exception to this rule&#xD;
      where almost half of all new breast cancers in the United States are diagnosed in women 65&#xD;
      years of age or older1. Despite the association between cancer and aging, treatment&#xD;
      recommendations and data acquired from prospective clinical trials in older women with breast&#xD;
      cancer are sparse. As a result, physicians and older adults have limited data to guide&#xD;
      treatment recommendation, make dose adjustments and manage toxicities in older adults. Aging&#xD;
      is invariably associated with changes in physiology which can impact the pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of cancer therapy. The potential for increased toxic effects in the older&#xD;
      patient becomes an important concern. Therefore, it may not be reasonable to extrapolate data&#xD;
      regarding toxicity from clinical trials, which primarily include younger, healthier patients.&#xD;
      In addition, the age-related impact of adjuvant therapy on the functional status and quality&#xD;
      of life of older versus younger adults has not been rigorously evaluated, and risk factors&#xD;
      for toxicity, other than chronological age, need to be studied among older adults receiving&#xD;
      anthracycline and non-anthracycline based chemotherapy regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to prospectively describe the longitudinal trajectory of functional&#xD;
      status, comorbidity, and quality of life from before the initiation of chemotherapy to 6&#xD;
      months after the completion of treatment in older (65 and older) and younger (under 65)&#xD;
      adults. We will determine the effect of pre-treatment physical functioning on physical&#xD;
      recovery (ie, physical function at end of chemotherapy and 6 months later) after the course&#xD;
      of adjuvant chemotherapy. In addition, we will explore if factors other than chronological&#xD;
      age (functional status, comorbid medical conditions, nutritional status, psychological state,&#xD;
      cognitive function, and social support) predict which patients are more likely to experience&#xD;
      treatment morbidity (defined as grade 3-5 toxicity, hospitalization or urgent care visits,&#xD;
      dose reduction or delay, or premature discontinuation of the planned chemotherapy course)&#xD;
