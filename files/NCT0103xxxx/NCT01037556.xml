  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current understanding of PR104 justifies the evaluation of PR104 in subjects with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory AML and ALL. These include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypoxia. Leukemic bone marrow is likely to demonstrate a level of hypoxia sufficient to&#xD;
           activate PR104 to its active metabolites PR104H and PR104M.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Myelotoxicity as the primary toxicity at MTD. In prior clinical studies in subjects with&#xD;
           solid tumors PR104 has demonstrated myelotoxicity as the primary toxicity. This&#xD;
           observation suggests that PR104 will exert a similar effect on leukemic cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AKR1C3. AML has been reported to exhibit high levels of AKR1C3 which should lead to&#xD;
           selective activation of PR104 within both hypoxic and oxic leukemic cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preclinical data. PR104 has demonstrated impressive activity in an initial study using&#xD;
           primary human ALL in a mouse model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial dose finding phase of the study will provide estimates of the activity and&#xD;
      toxicity of PR104 in subjects with refractory/relapsed AML, and determine the optimal&#xD;
      individualized dose to give each subject based on his/her covariates (prior CR duration,&#xD;
      prior number of salvage therapies, age). Once a potentially beneficial dose has been&#xD;
      determined, an expanded cohort of subjects with AML or ALL will receive PR104 at a uniform&#xD;
      dose. This information will prove valuable in defining the future clinical development of&#xD;
      PR104, and in determining if PR104 has sufficient activity and acceptable safety in AML to&#xD;
      warrant future phase II or phase III studies in this indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the toxicities and recommended dose of PR104 when administered IV to subjects&#xD;
           with relapsed/refractory AML and ALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of PR104 and a series of PR104 metabolites&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate any anti-tumor effects of PR104&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the expression of AKR1C3 in bone marrow and leukemic cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate potential biomarkers of hypoxia&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single arm study defining the recommended dose of PR104 for each subpopulation in this&#xD;
      patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following informed consent, subjects will undergo baseline evaluation with a history,&#xD;
      physical exams, blood work, and disease assessment. Subjects will be assigned a dose of PR104&#xD;
      based on a Bayesian model maintained at the Statistical department at MD Anderson Cancer&#xD;
      Center. The model will be updated with both toxicity and efficacy data as it is generated for&#xD;
      each subject. New subjects will receive the currently predicted best dose for their&#xD;
      respective subset based on prior treatment, age and duration of prior response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PR104 will be administered initially as induction therapy for up to 3 cycles. Response will&#xD;
      be assessed around day 42 (+/- 2 days) of the study. Subjects who obtain a CR or CRp will&#xD;
      receive consolidation therapy for up to 4 additional cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated each week during the induction phase of the study. During the&#xD;
      consolidation phase of the study, subjects will be evaluated on Day 1 of each cycle and as&#xD;
      clinically indicated. Subjects with clinically significant progression will be removed from&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
