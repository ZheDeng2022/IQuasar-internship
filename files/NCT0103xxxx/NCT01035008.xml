  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is a novel and highly promising imaging method for that&#xD;
      allows in vivo imaging of the mucosal layer at resolution of approximately 1 micron. Cellular&#xD;
      and sub-cellular structures as well as capillaries and single red blood cells can be&#xD;
      visualized. CLE is now well established as a highly accurate method for distinguishing&#xD;
      neoplasia in the gastrointestinal tract lumen via endoscopy. A major new breakthrough is the&#xD;
      development of sub-millimeter CLE probes that can be passed via an image guided needle (nCLE)&#xD;
      into solid organs and cysts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that nCLE will help distinguish the benign, premalignant and malignant&#xD;
      cystic lesions of pancreas by visualizing the cellular lining of the cysts, thereby, avoiding&#xD;
      unnecessary surgery in patient with benign cysts and guiding to early and effective surgical&#xD;
      removal of high risk neoplastic lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prototype minimal risk nCLE system has been developed that can be passed via standard&#xD;
      endoscopic ultrasound needles into the pancreas but FDA clearance for in vivo use is not&#xD;
      expected until late 2010. The investigators propose to evaluate this prototype nCLE system in&#xD;
      vivo during endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), as an initial pilot study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: the confocal laser endomicroscopy imaging of the nCLE can differentiate between&#xD;
      non-mucinous, mucinous non- malignant and malignant pancreatic cysts in vivo and has&#xD;
      increased sensitivity compared to endoscopic ultrasound-fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA)&#xD;
      tissue sampling. In this pilot study the investigators will primarily evaluate technical&#xD;
      feasibility and interobserver agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In patients undergoing EUS for suspected pancreatic cysts, the investigators will&#xD;
           evaluate the key nCLE image features of non mucinous, mucinous, and malignant pancreatic&#xD;
           cystic neoplasms (PCN).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The investigators will estimate the initial image quality, feasibility, and&#xD;
           interobserver agreement of nCLE&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The investigators will establish the preliminary accuracy of nCLE to be used for&#xD;
           planning a larger comparative trial&#xD;

    <description>The investigators are testing a new method called confocal laser endomicroscopy to see if it can detect pre-cancerous abnormalities in the lining of the cysts found in your pancreas. This will involve using a very thin fiber-shaped microscope which will be passed through a needle during the EUS procedure.</description>

    <description>The investigators will do the standard EUS procedure. If a cyst is seen in the pancreas during EUS, the investigators will administer a special dye called fluorescein through the IV, and then use the new fiber-shaped microscope to take pictures of the lining of the cysts.</description>
