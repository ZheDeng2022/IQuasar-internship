  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III, randomized, controlled, open label study with two vaccine regimens. The&#xD;
      study will assess the relative safety and immunogenicity of vaccine regimens comparing&#xD;
      adjuvanted versus non-adjuvanted formulations of A(H1N1) inactivated influenza virus vaccine&#xD;
      in subjects with Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) Infection and to compare safety&#xD;
      and immunogenicity data with a contemporaneously enrolled control group of age-comparable,&#xD;
      healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because certain individuals may be hypo-responsive to influenza vaccination, additional&#xD;
      studies with high-risk groups are warranted in order to determine the optimal vaccine&#xD;
      formulation and dosing schedule for prevention of novel H1N1 virus infection.&#xD;
