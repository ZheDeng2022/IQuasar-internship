    <textblock>
      To estimate the incidence of H1N1v influenza-like illness and to study the risk factors for&#xD;
      serious influenza forms during pandemic period in French HIV infected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Influenza like illness is defined as fever&gt; 37°8C and cough or pharyngalgia.&#xD;
                (Centers for Disease Control definition).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Serious forms of influenza-like illness is defined by hospitalization within 14&#xD;
                days onset of symptoms or death attributed to influenza like illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Survey sampling for estimating H1N1v influenza-like illness incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Out of approximately 50 000 patients under follow-up in one of the 40 ANRS centres,&#xD;
                a sub-group will be selected by random sampling. Sampling will be stratified by&#xD;
                centre and sampling fraction per site will vary in order to select 60 to 80&#xD;
                patients for this study per site. A total of 2500 to 3000 patients will be selected&#xD;
                to allow for estimating the incidence of H1N1v influenza-like illness with an&#xD;
                adequate precision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selected patients will be asked to contact the clinical staff on site as soon as any&#xD;
      influenza like symptoms appear. In the case of influenza like illness patients are requested&#xD;
      to attend to the clinic within 24 hours for physical examination and naso-pharyngeal swab for&#xD;
      diagnosis of A(H1N1)v infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nested case-control study for the determination of risk factors for serious forms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cases: Serious forms (see definition above) identified by any clinical site or&#xD;
           hospitalisation unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Controls: Patients of the randomly selected sample (see survey sampling above),&#xD;
           presenting with influenza-like illness without any criterion for severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exhaustivity check:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exhaustivity of symptomatic forms will be assessed a posteriori by merging information&#xD;
      from all available data sources.&#xD;
