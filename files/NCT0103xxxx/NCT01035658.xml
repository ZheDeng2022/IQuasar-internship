  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, patients with relapsed or refractory ovarian cancer will receive treatment&#xD;
      with pazopanib and liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil) until disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity occurs. The Phase I portion will define the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of&#xD;
      pazopanib and liposomal doxorubicin when administered in combination. Once the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose has been identified in the Phase I portion, the Phase II portion will evaluate&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of this combination in the same patient population.&#xD;

    <description>The response rate in the subsets of patients with platinum-sensitive and platinum-refractory ovarian carcinoma is evaluated as a measure of efficacy of pazopanib/liposomal doxorubicin. Response rate ( Percentage of patients whose disease decreased (Partial response - PR) and/or disappears (Complete response - CR) after treatment) was evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and CA-125 response in patients using the Rustin Criteria. CR: disappearance of all target and nontarget lesions and no evidence of new lesions documented by two disease assessments at least 4 weeks apart. Normalization of CA125, if elevated at baseline, is required for ovarian carcinoma studies. PR is &gt;= 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter(LD) of all target measurable lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of LD. There can be no unequivocal progression of nontarget lesions and no new lesions.</description>

        <description>The response rate in the subsets of patients with platinum-sensitive and platinum-refractory ovarian carcinoma is evaluated as a measure of efficacy of pazopanib/liposomal doxorubicin. Response rate ( Percentage of patients whose disease decreased (Partial response - PR) and/or disappears (Complete response - CR) after treatment) was evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and CA-125 response in patients using the Rustin Criteria. CR: disappearance of all target and nontarget lesions and no evidence of new lesions documented by two disease assessments at least 4 weeks apart. Normalization of CA125, if elevated at baseline, is required for ovarian carcinoma studies. PR is &gt;= 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter(LD) of all target measurable lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of LD. There can be no unequivocal progression of nontarget lesions and no new lesions.</description>
