    <textblock>
      Oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a global disease responsible for ~300,000 new cancer&#xD;
      cases each year. Local recurrence (~30% of cases) and formation of second primary malignancy&#xD;
      are common.2, 3 Cosmetic and/or functional compromise associated with treatment of disease&#xD;
      stage is often significant. These statistics underscore the urgent need to develop a better&#xD;
      approach in order to control this deadly disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is becoming increasingly apparent that oral cancers develop within wide fields of diseased&#xD;
      tissue characterized by genetically altered cells that are widespread across the oral cavity&#xD;
      and present in clinically and histologically normal oral mucosa. Complete removal of these&#xD;
      lesions is difficult because high-risk changes frequently go beyond clinically visible tumor.&#xD;
      In recognition of this, current 'best practice' is to remove SCC with a significant width&#xD;
      (usually 10 mm) of surrounding normal-looking oral mucosa. However, since occult disease&#xD;
      varies in size such approach often results in over-cutting (causing severe cosmetic and&#xD;
      functional morbidity) or under removal of disease tissue, as evidenced by frequent positive&#xD;
      surgical margins and high local and regional recurrence - a failure of the 'best practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a wealth of literature that supports the use of tissue autofluorescence in the&#xD;
      screening and diagnosis of precancers in the lung, uterine cervix, skin and oral cavity. This&#xD;
      approach is already in clinical use in the lung and the mechanism of action of tissue&#xD;
      autofluorescence has been well described in the cervix. Changes in fluorescence reflect a&#xD;
      complex interplay of alterations to fluorophores in the tissue and structural changes in&#xD;
      tissue morphology, each associated with progression of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As one of the internationally leading teams in applying tissue fluorescence technology, we&#xD;
      have shown that direct fluorescence visualization (FV) tools can identify clinically visible&#xD;
      or occult premalignant and malignant lesions that are associated with lesions at risk, with&#xD;
      high-grade histology and high-risk molecular change. In a recently small scaled,&#xD;
      retrospective study, we have shown that FV helped surgeons in the operating room to determine&#xD;
      the extent of the high-risk FV field surrounding the cancer and resulted in remarkably lower&#xD;
      2-year recurrence rates (0% for FV-guided vs. 25% for those without FV-guided approach).&#xD;
      There is need to design a larger scale prospective, randomized controlled (Phase III) trial&#xD;
      to gather strong evidence in proving the efficacy of the surgery approach using this adjunct&#xD;
      tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish the evidence supporting the change in clinical practice using FV-guided surgery.&#xD;
      There are 3 objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1. Objective 1 (Clinical evidence): To assess the effect of FV-guided surgery on the&#xD;
      recurrence-free survival of histologically confirmed disease within the context of a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (efficacy). Hypothesis: FV-guided surgery will increase the&#xD;
      recurrence-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. Objective 2 (Quality of Life evidence): To establish the cost per recurrence prevented&#xD;
      for this approach and assess quality of life issues. Hypothesis: FV-guided surgery can be&#xD;
      delivered in a cost effective manner and improve the quality of life of patients 2.3&#xD;
      Objective 3 (Scientific/Molecular evidence): To assess the presence of previously validated&#xD;
      molecular markers (microsatellite analysis, LOH) and histological change (quantitative&#xD;
      pathology) in surgical margins in a nested case-control study involving a tumor bank created&#xD;
      within this project. Hypothesis: FV-guided surgery will spare normal tissue at the same time&#xD;
      improving capture of high-risk tissue.&#xD;

      1.0. OBJECTIVES AND APPROACHES: 1.1. Objective 1 (Clinical evidence): To assess the effect of&#xD;
      FV-guided surgery on the recurrence-free survival of histologically confirmed disease within&#xD;
      the context of a randomized controlled trial (efficacy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: FV-guided surgery will increase the recurrence-free survival. Approaches: This&#xD;
      Aim requires the establishment of a randomized controlled trial of 200 patients which will&#xD;
      compare outcome for patients in 2 arms: one with conventional surgery with margin delineated&#xD;
      under white light, and the other using FV guidance for margin delineation. Please see&#xD;
      attached Appendix 1 for a step-by-step protocol. This comprises a multidisciplinary team of&#xD;
      surgeons, pathologists, project coordinators, and FV Specialists. In addition to the&#xD;
      presurgery assessment, all participating patients will have 3-month follow-ups for the first&#xD;
      2 years and 6-month for the rest of the study period. Biopsy will occur when clinically&#xD;
      warranted or at 2-year post-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2. Objective 2 (Quality of Life evidence): To establish the cost per recurrence prevented&#xD;
      for this approach and assess quality of life issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: FV-guided surgery can be delivered in a cost effective manner and improve the&#xD;
      quality of life of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approaches: This aim requires the collection of economic and quality of life (QoL) data to&#xD;
      establish the cost per recurrence prevented for FV-guided surgery and to assess quality of&#xD;
      life impacts. To asses potential psychosocial consequences of FV-guided surgery we will&#xD;
      measure global QoL. We will use the validated EQ-5D and Functional Assessment of Cancer&#xD;
      Therapy Head and Neck Module (FACT-H&amp;N) to determine the participant's QoL at each&#xD;
      assessment. The questionnaires will be applied at pre-surgery baseline, and at 6-week,&#xD;
      3-month, and 24-month post-surgery follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Objective 3 (Scientific/Molecular evidence): To assess the presence of previously&#xD;
      validated molecular markers (microsatellite analysis, LOH) and histological change&#xD;
      (quantitative pathology) in surgical margins in a nested case-control study involving a tumor&#xD;
      bank created within this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: FV-guided surgery will spare normal tissue at the same time improving capture of&#xD;
      high-risk tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approaches: This Aim requires the retrieval and cutting of the archive material for a nested&#xD;
      control study. The estimate number of cases reach outcome is 30 (5% of FV group (100) + 25%&#xD;
      of control group (100). Additionally, 60 matched controls will be selected (matched by&#xD;
      gender, age, smoking habit, and anatomical site). This Aim is critical to demonstrate a shift&#xD;
      in field, sparing normal tissue while catching high-risk occult tissue. Samples for the&#xD;
      nested molecular analysis will be performed in Rosin's Lab (for microsatellite analysis) and&#xD;
      Cancer Imaging at BC Cancer Agency (Dr. MacAulay for qualitative Pathology). The protocols&#xD;
      used to analyze these samples have been published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0. STUDY TOOL - VELSCOPE® We have recently developed a simple hand-held field-of-view&#xD;
      device for direct visualization of tissue fluorescence in the oral cavity. This tool is&#xD;
      currently commercially available as VELScope® (LED Med Inc., White Rock, BC). We have begun a&#xD;
      longitudinal study to explore the effect of FV in defining the surgical margin on outcome of&#xD;
      oral cancer surgery27. Between 2004 and 2008, 60 patients with a ≤4 cm oral cancer entered&#xD;
      the study. Each case was treated with surgical excision alone and was followed for at least&#xD;
      12 months. Thirty-eight patients had FV-guided surgery, with the surgical margin placed at 10&#xD;
      mm beyond the perimeter of autofluorescence loss. The remaining patients (control group) had&#xD;
      the surgical margin placed at 10 mm beyond the tumor edge defined by standard white-light&#xD;
      examination. Among those, 7 of the 60 cases (12%) have developed a recurrence of severe&#xD;
      dysplasia, carcinoma in situ or squamous cell carcinoma at the treated site, all in the&#xD;
      control group (25% versus 0%, P = 0.002). These data suggest the potential utility of&#xD;
      autofluorescence changes within this clinical setting. There is a need to design a larger&#xD;
      scaled randomized controlled clinical trial to confirm the efficacy of FV-guided surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are also using FV to monitor the potential re-emergence of regions of autofluorescence&#xD;
      loss at treated sites in the cases accrued to the longitudinal study and are currently&#xD;
      completing an interim assessment of these monitoring results. Autofluorescence loss persists&#xD;
      in some cases, increasing in size and intensity over time and giving rise to a clinical&#xD;
      lesion containing dysplasia or cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 Core members of the trial and project management We have a well-built core group with&#xD;
      long-term and strong working relationships, including surgeons (Drs. Anderson (Co-PI) and&#xD;
      Durham), Pathologists (Drs. Berean (Co-PI) and Zhang), and Oral Medicine (Drs. Poh (PI) and&#xD;
      Williams), and are in a world-leading position in using fluorescence visualization in&#xD;
      operating room and in follow-up. Dr. J. Lee, collaborator, from M.D. Anderson Cancer Centre&#xD;
      and has extensive experience in clinical trials with special expertise in randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial. He will be the trialist in this project, design a program for patient&#xD;
      randomization, oversee the trial protocol, and work with local statistician (Prof. Chen) for&#xD;
      day-to-day data management. Professor Jiahua Chen, Department of Statistics, the University&#xD;
      of British Columbia will serve as the biostatistician to the trial and will be responsible&#xD;
      for the data analysis and submission of interim analyses to the Data Safety Monitoring Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.0 Basic trial design The proposed study will be a double-blinded, randomized controlled&#xD;
      Phase III study to evaluate the effect of FV-guided surgery in patients diagnosed with severe&#xD;
      dysplasia, carcinoma in situ and invasive squamous cell carcinoma and undergoing surgery&#xD;
      treatment with an intent-to-cure. The trial will randomize 200 patients -100 in the FV arm&#xD;
      (using FV guided the surgery margin) and 100 in the control arm (using conventional white&#xD;
      light approach). The trial period is 5 years - 2 years to complete accrual and 3 more years&#xD;
      of follow-up.&#xD;
