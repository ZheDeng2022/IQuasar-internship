      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) is interested in developing a pool of potential&#xD;
      research participants who may be eligible for research studies on drug abuse and addiction,&#xD;
      pharmacological and psychosocial therapies for substance addiction, drug abuse and&#xD;
      co-occurring psychiatric disorders, and the long-term effects of drugs on the development,&#xD;
      function, and structure of the brain and other organ systems. To develop this pool of&#xD;
      potential participants, researchers intend to screen individuals who may be eligible for&#xD;
      future research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To identify, recruit, and screen participants for NIDA collaborative research protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals 18 years of age and older who are able to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible participants will undergo two screening interviews: a telephone interview and&#xD;
           an in-person interview. The phone interview will determine eligibility for the in-person&#xD;
           interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The in-person interview, which may require up to five visits to the clinical center,&#xD;
           will involve any or all of the following procedures: (1) full physical examination and&#xD;
           medical history; (2) psychiatric interview; (3) psychological testing; (4)&#xD;
           electrocardiogram; (5) samples of blood, urine, and hair; and (6) other minimally&#xD;
           invasive procedures as directed by the research staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide a photograph for confirmation of identity for subsequent&#xD;
           visits and protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No clinical care will be provided under this protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MPRC/NIDA collaborative research program attempts to: elucidate the nature of serious&#xD;
      mental illnesses, drug abuse and addiction; determine the potential use of new therapies,&#xD;
      both pharmacological and psychosocial; and decipher the long-term effects of drugs of abuse&#xD;
      on the development, maturation, function, and structure of the brain and other organ systems.&#xD;
      In support of this work, the scientific goal of this screening protocol is to assess&#xD;
      potential research participants' eligibility for research studies. Screening will include&#xD;
      medical and psychological tests and procedures. The data collected during screening are a&#xD;
      unique and valuable source of information that aids in the research mission. Therefore, a&#xD;
      secondary goal of this protocol is to obtain data that characterizes the population of&#xD;
      subjects contacting NIDA about research participation and to analyze data so obtained, such&#xD;
      as that on the prevalence and consequences of HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, and related diseases&#xD;
      and issues of selection and sample bias in clinical research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening process will be done in two stages, a telephone interview and an in-person&#xD;
      evaluation. The telephone interview will last approximately 20 minutes and be conducted&#xD;
      solely via the NIDA call center. Answers provided during the phone interview will indicate&#xD;
      whether a caller is eligible for in-person screening. Those who appear eligible will be given&#xD;
      an appointment at either NIDA or MPRC. This protocol pertains only to the in-person&#xD;
      participants at MPRC. Written informed consent will be obtained when the person arrives. The&#xD;
      screening process can involve up to 5 visits to MPRC.&#xD;
