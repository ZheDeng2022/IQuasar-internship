      This study will enrol patients with diabetes who have already elected to undergo pars plana&#xD;
      vitrectomy (eye surgery) to remove persistent vitreous haemorrhage (a complication of severe&#xD;
      diabetic eye disease in which blood fills the inner cavity of the eye, obscuring the vision&#xD;
      and preventing treatment to stop the bleeding). Those in the treatment arm will have an&#xD;
      intravitreal injection of ranibizumab (Lucentis) at the same dose used for the treatment of&#xD;
      neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (a disease that has some features in&#xD;
      common with diabetic eye disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesised that this will promote clearance of the vitreous haemorrhage and that&#xD;
      this, in turn, may mean that some patients do not need to proceed to vitrectomy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The eye is designed like a camera, with a lens at the front and a film at the back. Using&#xD;
      this analogy, the retina is the film in the camera and the vitreous is the space between the&#xD;
      lens and the retina. Light focused from the lens falls on the retina and creates an image of&#xD;
      the outside world which is then transmitted to the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the retina there are small blood vessels which supply it with nutrition. Sometimes in&#xD;
      eye disease such as diabetes these blood vessels can grow abnormal new branches (stimulated&#xD;
      by growth factors such as VEGF) which leave the retina and grow into the vitreous space.&#xD;
      Because these new vessels are very fragile they have a tendency to get damaged and bleed.&#xD;
      When they bleed into the vitreous space it creates a large collection of blood (haemorrhage)&#xD;
      which prevents the focused light from the lens reaching the retina. This dramatically reduces&#xD;
      the vision in this eye for the patient and prevents healthcare practitioners from examining&#xD;
      the eye and giving further treatment for the cause of the bleed. This often means an eye&#xD;
      operation is required to clear the blood from the vitreous space, to allow the patient to see&#xD;
      and to allow further treatment to prevent worsening of the eye disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic retinopathy is the name given to the damage caused by diabetes to the retina in&#xD;
      patients with this condition. It is the leading cause of vision loss in this group of&#xD;
      patients who are mostly of working age. Patients with diabetes require regular eye&#xD;
      examinations to look out for signs of these abnormal new vessels which can bleed into the&#xD;
      vitreous. In the most severe form of diabetic eye disease (proliferative diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy) laser therapy is used to treat the back of the eye to try and prevent any&#xD;
      further progression of these new proliferating blood vessels. However if a blood vessel has&#xD;
      bled into the vitreous space, it prevents examination of the retina and the ability to&#xD;
      provide any further preventative treatment for the patient. It can often take many months for&#xD;
      these haemorrhages to clear, in which time the patient is left without any useful vision in&#xD;
      that eye and the underlying disease is continuing to worsen. It is in these difficult&#xD;
      situations an eye operation (vitrectomy) is required to remove the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small, uncontrolled studies with intravitreal (injection into the vitreous space of the eye)&#xD;
      bevacizumab (Avastin) suggest that this agent enhances clearance of diabetic vitreous&#xD;
      haemorrhage(1,2,3). Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody licensed for the treatment of&#xD;
      metastatic cancer. It works by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a&#xD;
      chemical mediator that promotes new blood vessel growth within tumours. It has been used&#xD;
      off-label (without a licence)to treat neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD - a&#xD;
      common eye disease with loss of vision), and other conditions characterised by intraocular&#xD;
      new blood vessel growth (neovascularisation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ranibizumab (Lucentis) is another monoclonal antibody to VEGF: it was directly cleaved from&#xD;
      Bevacizumab to produce a lower molecular weight molecular that is more appropriate for use&#xD;
      inside the eye. Whereas bevacizumab has been used off-label to treat nAMD, ranibizumab has&#xD;
      been the subject of large Phase III controlled clinical trials (4,5) with robust safety&#xD;
      analysis, and is licensed for the treatment of nAMD in Europe, the USA, and most countries.&#xD;
      Neither bevacizumab nor ranibizumab are licensed for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If ranibizumab produces a similar effect to pilot studies of bevacizumab in diabetic vitreous&#xD;
      haemorrhage,(1,2,3) then it has the potential to speed visual recovery and reduce the&#xD;
      likelihood of patients requiring surgery, with the attendant costs, patient inconvenience,&#xD;
      and operative risks. Whilst bevacizumab is a cheaper alternative to ranibizumab, it does not&#xD;
      yet have such extensive safety data. Further, bevacizumab has to be prepared by the treating&#xD;
      clinician or intermediate pharmacies in a dosage appropriate for intraocular use, whereas&#xD;
      ranibizumab is provided by the manufacturer in a pre-packaged sterile syringe containing the&#xD;
      dose designed for intraocular administration. The relative cost disparity is likely to reduce&#xD;
      in the coming years, and a single intravitreal injection is a very small proportion of the&#xD;
      total treatment costs for proliferative diabetic retinopathy, which consumes considerable&#xD;
      health care resources, particularly if an eye operation is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enrol patients who have already decided to undergo an eye operation (pars&#xD;
      plana vitrectomy) to clear a persistent diabetic vitreous haemorrhage. Those in the treatment&#xD;
      arm will have an intravitreal injection of ranibizumab at the same dose used for nAMD. It is&#xD;
      hypothesised that this will promote clearance of the vitreous haemorrhage and that this, in&#xD;
      turn, may mean that some patients do not need to proceed to vitrectomy.&#xD;
