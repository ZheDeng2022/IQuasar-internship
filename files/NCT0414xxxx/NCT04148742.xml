    <textblock>
      This study will treat patients with non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma who have relapsed from,&#xD;
      refractory or intolerant to prior therapy. This study will help understand what type of side&#xD;
      effects may occur with the drug treatment. It will also measure the levels of drug in the&#xD;
      body and preliminarily assess its anti-cancer activity as monotherapy.&#xD;
