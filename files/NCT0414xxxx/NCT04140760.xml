      1. To evaluate the components and processes needed for a full-scale clinical study:&#xD;
           recruitment, randomisation, attrition, probiotic use, stool sample collection,&#xD;
           microbiome sequencing and behavioural/cognitive measures and determine the feasibility&#xD;
           and patient acceptability of these processes to inform a full-scale study in line with&#xD;
           NIHR pilot study guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To collect pilot data to determine sample size and power, reliability and sensitivity of&#xD;
           selected measures, to maximise the findings and minimise patient burden.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research is a pilot study with 70 participants, 35 in the probiotic and 35 in&#xD;
      the placebo arm of the study. The study will investigate the process of conducting&#xD;
      randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled research about probiotic use in Parkinson's&#xD;
      Disease patients. The primary aim of the study is to test elements of the study design for a&#xD;
      full-scale clinical study: recruitment, randomisation, probiotic use, stool sample collection&#xD;
      and DNA sequencing and behavioural/cognitive measures. The secondary aim is to collect pilot&#xD;
      data to determine the sample size, Power and appropriateness of measures needed for a&#xD;
      full-scale study that maximises findings and minimises patient burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition that affects motor functions and a&#xD;
      range of non-motor abilities. There is no cure and a definitive cause is not yet known. It&#xD;
      has a prevalence of 0.3% in the general population and 1-3% in the population over the age of&#xD;
      65. Globally, it is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and due to the lack of&#xD;
      early diagnosis and effective therapy, represents a large burden for society and healthcare&#xD;
      provision. The underlying pathology of PD is associated with accumulation of abnormal clumps&#xD;
      of alpha-synuclein protein termed Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in the central nervous system&#xD;
      (CNS) that impede the normal function of brain cells. Evidence from animal studies indicates&#xD;
      that the production of alpha-synuclein begins in the gut, and gastro-intestinal problems are&#xD;
      a common feature of PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gut contains millions of micro-organisms termed the microbiome. Over the past decade&#xD;
      research findings have identified a complex bidirectional interaction between the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the central nervous system (CNS), the Gut-Brain axis. It is&#xD;
      now known that the Gut-Brain axis is adversely affected by PD. Recently, probiotics have been&#xD;
      proposed as a potential intervention for systemic and neurological conditions by improving&#xD;
      microbiome composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data obtained from this pilot study will be used to identify challenges in conducting&#xD;
      research using probiotics in patients with Parkinson's Disease and provide a rationale for&#xD;
      conducting a full-scale study including information that may reduce or eliminate problems&#xD;
      that limit the successful delivery of a full-scale trial. The investigators will make no&#xD;
      claims here about any purported clinical effects of the chosen probiotic.&#xD;

    <measure>Patient Adherence to Study questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Thirteen weeks from study start</time_frame>
    <description>The patient experience questionnaire (Adherence To Study) provides data about patients' experience of taking part in the study to inform a full-scale trial. These data will enable evaluation of the patient experience of taking part in the study, the experience of providing two stool samples and taking a daily capful of the placebo or probiotic liquid. This scale is developed by the researcher's. The measure is a 5-point Likert scale that includes responses: Not at all, 2 = Not really, 3 = Somewhat, 4 = Quite a lot, 5 = Very much - in the first part of the questionnaire. A sample question is: Are you happy with the consent process for taking part in the research? Total score ranges from 6-30 - low score indicates dissatisfaction with the study method and information provided. Other questions in the scale require simple 'yes' and 'no' responses. For example, 'Were you comfortable providing a stool sample for the study?'</description>

    <measure>Patient Exit Study Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 and 24 weeks from study start date (only relevant for patients who withdrew).</time_frame>
    <description>The patient exit study scale is designed to evaluate why patients did not or were unable to complete the study. The scale was devised by the researchers and comprised a 5-point Likert scale. Scores range from 7-35 with lower scores indicating dissatisfaction with particular elements of of study design, recruitment, and/or data collection. These data will inform the full-scale study</description>

    <time_frame>Measure to be completed at week 1 of entry into study; second evaluation completed at week 13 after entry to study.</time_frame>
    <description>The user manual specifies that the questionnaire is particularly appropriate for use in clinical trials to assess treatments and interventions intended to benefit people with Parkinson's disease. Scale is 5-point Likert scale from 'Never' through to 'Always' with scores ranging from 0-4. Total score range = 0 - 156 (Lower score = better quality of life, higher score = poorer quality of life.</description>

    <time_frame>Measure to be completed at week 1 of entry into study; second evaluation completed at week 13 after entry to study.</time_frame>
    <description>The PDSS is a visual analogue scale addressing 15 commonly reported symptoms associated with sleep disturbance. Response options range from 0 = 'awful' to 10 = 'excellent' or 0 = 'always' to 10 = 'never.' Total score range from 0-150. Low scores indicate poor sleep or sleep related problems and high scores indicate good sleep quality.</description>

    <measure>Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measure to be completed at week 1 of entry into study; second evaluation completed at week 13 after entry to study.</time_frame>
    <description>This measure includes questions relating to 15 common gastrointestinal symptoms and requires patients to rate the severity of their symptoms over the past week or 2 weeks. It was developed from reviews of gastrointestinal symptoms and clinical experience, to evaluate common symptoms of gastrointestinal disorders. Responses range from 1 = 'No discomfort at all' to 7 = 'Very severe discomfort.' Total score range is 15-105, where 15 indicates minimal discomfort and higher rating scores indicate significant or severe discomfort.</description>
