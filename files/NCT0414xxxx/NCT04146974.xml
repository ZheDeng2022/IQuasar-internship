      The purpose of the Assessing Models of Coordinated Services for Low-Income Children and Their&#xD;
      Families (AMCS) project is to understand how states and local communities are coordinating&#xD;
      services across sectors to most efficiently and effectively serve low-income children and&#xD;
      their families. These coordinated services approaches vary along a range of dimensions,&#xD;
      including their number and types of partners, funding streams, target populations, goals and&#xD;
      objectives, locations, services provided, and monitoring processes. This qualitative study&#xD;
      aims to fill gaps in our knowledge by identifying and describing the features of state and&#xD;
      local approaches to coordinating early care and education services with family economic&#xD;
      security and/or other health and human services.&#xD;

      The purpose of the Assessing Models of Coordinated Services for Low-Income Children and Their&#xD;
      Families (AMCS) project is to understand how states and local communities are coordinating&#xD;
      services across sectors to most efficiently and effectively serve low-income children and&#xD;
      their families. Policymakers and program leaders across the country are experimenting with&#xD;
      innovative approaches to combine early care and education, family economic security, and&#xD;
      other health and human services (Hulsey et al. 2015; Ross 2018; Sama-Miller and Baumgartner&#xD;
      2017). This qualitative study aims to fill gaps in our knowledge by identifying and&#xD;
      describing the features of state and local approaches to coordinating early care and&#xD;
      education (ECE) services with family economic security and/or other health and human&#xD;
      services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AMCS study has six primary research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How do state and local coordinated services approaches coordinate partnerships and&#xD;
           service application and delivery? What are the experiences of those involved with these&#xD;
           coordinated services approaches?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How do coordinated services approaches intend to reduce barriers and road blocks for&#xD;
           families to access services? Are there federal barriers to implementing such approaches?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Are approaches that combine ECE, family economic security, and/or other health and human&#xD;
           services able to address other child development factors beyond ECE?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What have we learned from efforts to integrate enrollment and eligibility processes for&#xD;
           health and human services?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Are states and/or localities examining service delivery dynamics across ECE programs to&#xD;
           assess availability of care slots and services to meet the needs of eligible families?&#xD;
           How are they using data to understand service delivery dynamics?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. How is public and private ECE funding targeted to meet the needs of at-risk children and&#xD;
           families? Are there differences in the families that are able to access services?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has three primary ways of collecting information: model profile creation and&#xD;
      confirmation for up to 76 coordinated services approaches; telephone interviews with&#xD;
      leadership from 20 approaches; and site visits to six coordinated services approaches. Site&#xD;
      visits include interviews with staff at the coordinated services approaches and focus groups&#xD;
      with parents served by the approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information collected in this study will improve federal, state, and local policymakers',&#xD;
      practitioners', and other stakeholders' knowledge and understanding of approaches to&#xD;
      coordinating services to support low-income children and their families. Findings will be&#xD;
      used to inform the federal government and support their work to set program and evaluation&#xD;
      priorities; to inform researchers and others in the field about the state of coordinated&#xD;
      services; and finally, to inform practitioners who are currently developing, updating and&#xD;
      implementing coordinated services approaches.&#xD;
