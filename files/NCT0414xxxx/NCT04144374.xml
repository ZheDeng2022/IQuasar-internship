  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the tissue penetration of the novel tetracycline antibiotic,&#xD;
      omadacycline (Nuzyra, Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), into the extracellular, interstitial&#xD;
      fluid of soft tissue in diabetic patients with lower limb wound infections. Penetration will&#xD;
      be compared with a group of healthy volunteer control participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll 10 patients with diabetes who are admitted with a lower limb wound&#xD;
      infection and 6 healthy volunteer control participants. The study will take place in an&#xD;
      inpatient unit at Hartford Hospital for all patients and in the Clinical Research Center at&#xD;
      Hartford Hospital for all healthy volunteers. All participants will receive 3 to 5 doses of&#xD;
      omadacycline (200mg IV once daily on day 1, transitioned to 300 mg by mouth thereafter). A&#xD;
      microdialysis probe (Mdialysis Inc., N. Chelmsford, MA) will be inserted into the&#xD;
      subcutaneous soft tissue near the margin of the wound (patients) or in the thigh (healthy&#xD;
      volunteers). The microdialysis probe is perfused with normal saline solution and samples are&#xD;
      collected for the 24 hours following the final dose (i.e., 48-72 hours). A peripheral&#xD;
      intravenous catheter will be inserted into an arm vein to collect blood samples&#xD;
      simultaneously with microdialysis samples. Concentrations in tissue are compared with blood&#xD;
      to determine percent penetration.&#xD;

    <description>he area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC) in tissue reflects the actual tissue exposure to drug after administration of a dose of the drug and is expressed in mg*h/L. Venous blood was obtained via peripheral intravenous catheter at 48 hours from the start of the first dose (i.e., immediately before administration of the 3rd dose), and at 49, 50, 50.5, 51, 51.5, 52, 54, 56, 60, 64 and 72 hours. Dialysate samples of 120μL were collected in 200µL microvials simultaneously with plasma at 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 64, 68 and 72 hours following administration of the first dose.</description>

    <description>A 20 kilodalton microdialysis probe (63 MD catheter; MDialysis Inc., N. Chelmsford, MA) will be inserted into the subcutaneous tissue at the margin of the wound (patient group) or in the thigh tissue (healthy volunteers). The probe will be left in place for the final dose and all tissue sampling procedures thereafter. This probe is perfused with a physiologic solution to collect interstitial fluid samples. The probe will then be removed after completion of sample collection.</description>
