  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to test S 48168 (ARM210) in a Phase 1 trial in RYR1-RM patients,&#xD;
      specifically. The objectives of this study are to explore the safety and tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD)/target engagement (TE) of S 48168 (ARM210), as&#xD;
      well as effects on muscle/motor function, and fatigue in RYR1-RM patients. The study&#xD;
      population will include adult patients (≥18 years of age) who have demonstrated leaky RyR1&#xD;
      channels that are responsive to S48168 (ARM210) ex vivo.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RYR1- related myopathy comprises a group of rare neuromuscular diseases. Affected individuals&#xD;
      generally present with delayed motor milestones, muscle weakness, impaired ambulation, and,&#xD;
      in severe cases, scoliosis, ophthalmoplegia, and respiratory distress all due to skeletal&#xD;
      muscle weakness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Causative variants in RYR1, which encodes the major calcium (Ca2+) release channel in&#xD;
      skeletal muscle, RyR1, exert different effects on the RyR1 channel. They generally disrupt&#xD;
      the normal Ca2+ flow between the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and muscle cell cytosol and&#xD;
      commonly result in excessive Ca2+ leak into the cytosol. Persistent Ca2+ leaks reduce its&#xD;
      availability in the SR that is necessary for excitation-contraction coupling leading to the&#xD;
      muscle weakness characteristic of this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This open-label study consists of ten participants, randomized to two dose groups. All&#xD;
      participants will have a diagnosis of RYR1-RM. In addition they have a prior muscle biopsy&#xD;
      demonstrating a leaky RYR1 channel which responds to S48168 (ARM210) ex vivo. The first group&#xD;
      of three participants will receive a low dose of S 48168 (ARM210) daily for 28 days. The&#xD;
      second group of seven participants will receive a higher dose for 28 days. The decision to&#xD;
      escalate to the higher dose will be made by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board&#xD;
      (DSMB) after review of safety, tolerability and PK of the low daily dose. Safety and&#xD;
      tolerability will be the primary objective in this study. In addition, exploratory objectives&#xD;
      will include PK, PD/TE as well as measures of muscle/motor function and fatigue.&#xD;
