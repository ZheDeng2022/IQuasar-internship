  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether Living with Hope, a novel, 12-week coping skills class,&#xD;
      reduces suicidal thoughts and behaviors among individuals who have made a recent suicide&#xD;
      attempt. It is hypothesized that participants who complete the class will show significant&#xD;
      improvements on measures of suicidal thoughts, hopelessness, and related mental health&#xD;
      symptoms, and these improvements will be maintained over time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As the 9th leading cause of death worldwide, suicide is a major public health concern. One of&#xD;
      the groups as highest risk of death are those that have previously made a suicide attempt.&#xD;
      Effective treatment following a suicide attempt is imperative for reducing the risk of&#xD;
      suicide, with increasing evidence showing treatments that target suicide behavior are more&#xD;
      effective at reducing risk over treatments that target related mental health difficulties&#xD;
      (e.g., depression). However, these treatments are resource intensive and are difficult to&#xD;
      access in Manitoba, and many individuals who have made a suicide attempt do not receive any&#xD;
      mental health treatment. In order to ensure timely access to treatment following a suicide&#xD;
      attempt, we have created a non-resource intensive psychoeducational skills class grounded in&#xD;
      evidence-based suicide-specific treatment. The primary aim of this study is to examine the&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of a novel, 12-week cognitive behavior therapy-based, virtual&#xD;
      psychoeducational skills class (Living with Hope) in reducing suicidal thoughts and behaviors&#xD;
      among adults who have made a recent suicide attempt, and determine whether changes&#xD;
      post-treatment are maintained at over time. The secondary aim is to determine whether this&#xD;
      intervention also results in improvements on related mental health outcomes, and whether&#xD;
      changes on these constructs mediate improvements on suicidal thoughts and behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 years and older who have been referred to the Living with Hope class over the&#xD;
      2 year study period will be invited to participate in the proposed study (anticipated n=60).&#xD;
      Individuals are eligible for referral if they have made a suicide attempt in the past 3&#xD;
      months and are either seeking mental health crisis services. Participants will complete&#xD;
      standardized measures of primary (suicidal thoughts and behaviors) and secondary outcomes&#xD;
      (hopelessness, depressive symptoms, emotion regulation difficulties, and quality of life) at&#xD;
      pre-treatment, mid-way through the 12-week class, post-treatment, 1-month follow-up, and&#xD;
      3-months follow-up. Mixed-effects linear regression will determine whether there are&#xD;
      significant differences on outcome measures at any of these five time-points, as well as&#xD;
      whether secondary outcomes mediate improvements on primary outcomes. All research&#xD;
      participation will be conducted through virtual means.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study would be the first in Canada to examine the effectiveness of a low-cost,&#xD;
      targeted psychoeducational skills class in reducing suicidal thoughts and behaviors among&#xD;
      individuals who have made a recent suicide attempt. This will set the stage for future&#xD;
      linkage with administrative data and randomized controlled trials aimed at determining&#xD;
      whether the Living with Hope class results in reduced suicide attempts and deaths compared to&#xD;
      treatment as usual. If proven safe and effective through these rigorous evaluations, the&#xD;
      Living with Hope class could be widely disseminated in the public health system to provide&#xD;
      care to a large number of Manitobans, with the long-term goal of increasing access to timely,&#xD;
      targeted treatment, and in turn, reducing suicides in Manitoba.&#xD;
