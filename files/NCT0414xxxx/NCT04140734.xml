  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine which of three types of spacer grafts (hard palate vs autologous ear cartilage&#xD;
      vs Enduragen) are the most effective in lower eyelid retraction repair outcomes as measured&#xD;
      by MRD2 (margin to reflex distance 2)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lower eyelid retraction is a common eyelid malposition, typically caused by thyroid eye&#xD;
      disease, excessive resection of skin in a cosmetic lower eyelid blepharoplasty, vertical&#xD;
      rectus muscle recession, facial nerve paralysis, or a normal anatomical variant.[1] When the&#xD;
      lower eyelid is displaced inferiorly, exposing sclera between the limbus and the eyelid&#xD;
      margin, symptoms can vary from ocular irritation and discomfort to vision threatening corneal&#xD;
      decompensation. If medical management does not suffice, surgery is indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although lower eyelid retractor lysis alone has been described, supporting material (spacer&#xD;
      graft) placed to augment the posterior lamella is generally required for more effective&#xD;
      elevation of the eyelid.[2] Various materials have been utilized, including autologous&#xD;
      auricular cartilage, bovine acellular dermal matrix, porcine acellular dermal matrix, hard&#xD;
      palate mucosa, dermis and dermis fat grafts. Previous studies on acellular dermal matrix use&#xD;
      in lower eyelid retraction repair consist of retrospective efficacy studies with only 2&#xD;
      comparative studies. However, conflicting results raised doubt as to which material was&#xD;
      superior. In addition, a prospective, randomized comparative study of spacer grafts used for&#xD;
      lower eyelid retraction repair was done comparing autologous auricular cartilage, porcine&#xD;
      acellular dermal matrix, and bovine acellular dermal matrix. The results yielded no&#xD;
      statistically significant difference in surgical outcomes and complications.[3]. As of now,&#xD;
      surgery with any of the spacer grafts, including autologous hard palate, is accepted as&#xD;
      standard of care. [4] This study is designed to determine whether using hard palate as a&#xD;
      spacer graft will have statistically significant different surgical outcomes and&#xD;
      complications as compared to autologous ear cartilage and porcine acellular dermal matrix&#xD;
      spacer grafts. Although studied separately, this has not been studied before in a prospective&#xD;
      randomized manner and may prove to demonstrate improved surgical results and decreased&#xD;
      complications. This can guide future choice of spacer graft used in lower eyelid retraction&#xD;
      repair surgery.&#xD;

          -  Patients will be included if they undergo lower eyelid retraction repair requiring a&#xD;
             spacer graft between July 1, 2019 and July 1, 2022 .&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be excluded if they are younger than 18 years old, required concurrent&#xD;
