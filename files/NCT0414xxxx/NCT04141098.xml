      This study will be a prospective, open-label, multi-center study that will collect safety and&#xD;
      efficacy data for the minimally invasive PerQdisc Nucleus Replacement Device (NRD). Patients&#xD;
      will have degenerative disc disease (DDD) in one or more lumbar discs. The NRD is used for&#xD;
      surgical replacement of a single nucleus pulposus between spinal lumbar discs L1-S1 using an&#xD;
      anterior or lateral transpsoas approach. Currently the surgical gold standard involves spinal&#xD;
      fusion of the affected vertebral bodies, reducing range of motion and increasing stress on&#xD;
      other vertebral bodies. The goal of nucleus replacement is to reduce chronic low back pain by&#xD;
      maintaining disc height while preserving range of motion.&#xD;
