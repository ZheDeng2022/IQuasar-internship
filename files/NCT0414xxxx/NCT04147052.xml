  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbance, especially insomnia (i.e., difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep),&#xD;
      affects over half of people with MS. Cognitive behavioral strategies have been shown to&#xD;
      improve sleep quantity and quality in several neurologic populations (e.g., traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury, Parkinson's disease), and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is&#xD;
      considered the first-line insomnia treatment for adults in the general population. Although&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral interventions have historically been delivered in-person, a growing body&#xD;
      of literature supports telephone- and internet-delivered approaches. However, more work is&#xD;
      needed to understand the effects of internet-delivered CBT-I on patient-reported and&#xD;
      objective outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a pilot randomized controlled trial to test the preliminary effects of&#xD;
      iSLEEPms, a CBT-I-based online intervention with telephone support for individuals with MS.&#xD;
      After completing a baseline assessment (Week 1), 90 participants with MS will be randomized&#xD;
      (1:1) to four weeks (Weeks 2-5) of iSLEEPms (intervention group) or treatment as usual (TAU;&#xD;
      control group), and complete post-treatment (Week 6) and follow-up (Week 12) assessments.&#xD;
      iSLEEPms participants will complete daily sleep diary forms and weekly online educational&#xD;
      modules. TAU participants will continue usual care without access to the iSLEEPms materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes will be patient-reported and actigraphic measures of sleep quality and&#xD;
      quantity. Secondary outcomes will be treatment satisfaction, adherence, and integrity&#xD;
      (iSLEEPms group only). Exploratory outcomes will be fatigue symptoms, depression symptoms,&#xD;
      and cognitive function.&#xD;
