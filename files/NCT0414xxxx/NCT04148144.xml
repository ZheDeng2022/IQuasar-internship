  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background Low back pain (LBP) is the largest cause of years lived with disability worldwide&#xD;
      and often associated with low quality of life, inability to work and low physical activity&#xD;
      levels. In Danish general practice, LBP accounts for nearly 10% of all yearly consultations,&#xD;
      making it the number one reason for consulting a general practitioner in Denmark. An increase&#xD;
      in care-seeking children and adolescents with LBP in general practice is seen in the&#xD;
      pre-teen-age-years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, no study has investigated on the natural prognosis of LBP among care-seeking&#xD;
      adolescents in general practice. Furthermore, the potential impact of patient and&#xD;
      parent-related factors on prognosis remains unknown. The aims of the study are to 1)&#xD;
      investigate the natural prognosis of LBP and 2) identify patient and parent-related factors&#xD;
      which my influence prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Adolescents aged 8 to 19 years consulting their general practitioner due to LBP will&#xD;
      be invited to participate in this prospective cohort study. One parent of each patient will&#xD;
      be invited to be a part of the parallel cohort. Online questionnaires will be used to collect&#xD;
      data on patient characterises, pain intensity, pain frequency, medication, health-related&#xD;
      quality of life, physical activity and illness perception at baseline and at the one-year&#xD;
      follow-up. Data on pain intensity and parent-related worries will be collected through&#xD;
      biweekly text messages. LBP will be assessed by latent class analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion This study will be the first to uncover the natural prognosis of LBP within a&#xD;
      young, care-seeking population in general practice and to investigate if factors related to&#xD;
      the patient or parents influence prognosis.&#xD;
