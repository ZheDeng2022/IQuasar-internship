    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of Cabozantinib in combination with Nivolumab&#xD;
      and Ipilimumab and see what affects that this combination treatment has on those with&#xD;
      recurrent carcinosarcomas.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To estimate the proportion of patients with recurrent carcinosarcoma, who survive&#xD;
      progression-free for at least 6 months, treated with cabozantinib + nivolumab + ipilimumab in&#xD;
      the second-line and beyond setting (per iRECIST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate time to progression (Time Frame: From the date the patient received the&#xD;
           first study treatment dose until the date of first documented progression, assessed up&#xD;
           to 2 years). Progression Free Survival (PFS) according to iRECIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of cabozantinib + nivolumab + ipilimumab&#xD;
           in this cohort of patients. Toxicity according to CTCAE v4.03&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the overall survival (OS) of patients with carcinosarcoma treated with&#xD;
           cabozantinib + nivolumab + ipilimumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine expression of biomarkers, which will include PD-L1 and MET expression by&#xD;
           IHC, MSI status by NGS, and other relevant potential biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether these marker expression levels alone or in combination are&#xD;
           associated with response, PFS, and/or overall survival.&#xD;

                  before first dose of study treatment, and who have had no clinically significant&#xD;
                  hemorrhagic complications from the anticoagulation regimen or the tumor.&#xD;

&#xD;
             Note: If a single ECG shows a QTcF with an absolute value &gt; 500 ms, two additional&#xD;
             ECGs at intervals of approximately 3 min must be performed within 30 min after the&#xD;
             initial ECG, and the average of these three consecutive results for QTcF will be used&#xD;
