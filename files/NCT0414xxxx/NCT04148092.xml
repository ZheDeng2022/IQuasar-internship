      have locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and&#xD;
      have received treatment with at least 2 prior Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved&#xD;
      therapies early access to ripretinib until such time that ripretinib becomes commercially&#xD;
      available or the Sponsor chooses to discontinue the program.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female patients, ≥ 18 years of age at the time of informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Histologic diagnosis of GIST&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have received prior treatment with at least 2 of the FDA-approved drugs&#xD;
             for GIST: imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at&#xD;
             Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients of reproductive potential must agree to follow the contraception&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient is capable of understanding and complying with the protocol and has signed the&#xD;
             ICF. A signed ICF must be obtained before any study specific procedures are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Adequate organ function and bone marrow reserve as determined by the Investigator at&#xD;
             Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Resolution to Grade 1 or baseline of all serious toxicities from prior therapy prior&#xD;
             to initiating treatment with ripretinib&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Eligible to participate in another ongoing clinical study in which the patient may&#xD;
             have access to ripretinib&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Received treatment with anticancer therapy, including investigational therapy, or&#xD;
             investigational procedures within 7 days or 5 × the half-life (whichever is longer)&#xD;
             prior to the first dose of ripretinib. For prior biological therapies (eg, monoclonal&#xD;
             antibodies with a half-life longer than 3 days), the interval must be at least 28 days&#xD;
             prior to the first dose of ripretinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Received prior treatment with ripretinib&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Known active central nervous system metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. With a concurrent malignancy for which treatment is being received that may interfere&#xD;
             with the potential benefits of ripretinib to the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Undergone major surgeries (eg, abdominal laparotomy) within 4 weeks of the first dose&#xD;
             of ripretinib. Following major surgeries, &gt; 4 weeks prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             ripretinib, all surgical wounds must be healed and free of infection or dehiscence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Any other clinically significant comorbidities which in the judgment of the&#xD;
             Investigator, could predispose the patient to safety risks&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Known human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis C infection only if the patient is&#xD;
             taking medications that must be avoided or taken with caution per protocol, active&#xD;
             hepatitis B, or active hepatitis C infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. If female, the patient is pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any component of the investigational product.&#xD;
             Patients with a history of Stevens-Johnson syndrome on a prior tyrosine kinase&#xD;
             inhibitor are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Gastrointestinal abnormalities including but not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  inability to take oral medication&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  malabsorption syndromes&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  requirement for intravenous alimentation&#xD;
&#xD;
