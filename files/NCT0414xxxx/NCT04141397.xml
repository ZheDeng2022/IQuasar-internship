  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the clinical effectiveness of whole-genome and transcriptome&#xD;
      analysis (WGTA) to guide advanced cancer care. The study setting is the British Columbia (BC)&#xD;
      Personalized OncoGenomics (POG) program, a single group research study of WGTA guiding&#xD;
      treatment planning for patients with advanced, incurable cancers (NCT02155621). To&#xD;
      characterize clinical effectiveness, the survival impacts of POG's approach compared to usual&#xD;
      care in matched controls will be estimated.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      WGTA provides an opportunity to improve health outcomes for patients by tailoring treatments&#xD;
      to each individual's genomic profile. The BC POG Program is a single arm research study&#xD;
      integrating WGTA information into clinical decision-making for patients with advanced stage,&#xD;
      incurable cancers.The clinical effectiveness of POG's approach is unknown. This retrospective&#xD;
      quasi-experimental observational study will estimate the real-world effectiveness of WGTA for&#xD;
      guiding advanced cancer care. To identify a counterfactual for POG's single-arm approach,&#xD;
      matching methods combined with administrative healthcare data will be used. The survival&#xD;
      impacts of POG's approach compared to usual care in matched controls will then be estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims and Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to estimate the overall survival effects of POG's approach versus usual care&#xD;
      for patients with advanced cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis (null): there is no difference in survival across POG and usual care patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis (alternative): POG patients who initiated WGTA live longer, on average, than usual&#xD;
      care patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will apply a retrospective cohort design. Cohorts will include patients who&#xD;
      consented to POG and underwent a biopsy for WGTA between July 2014 and December 2017 and&#xD;
      matched usual care controls. POG patients who enrolled prior to July 2014 will be excluded&#xD;
      from our study because during this feasibility period, referring clinicians employed a high&#xD;
      level of case-by-case recruitment selection. Usual care patients will be matched to POG&#xD;
      patients using supervised learning techniques. The study period will range from patient's&#xD;
      time of metastatic cancer diagnosis to December 31 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Sources&#xD;
&#xD;
      De-identified linked population-based administrative datasets will be obtained from BC Cancer&#xD;
      for all adult patients (&gt;18 years) diagnosed with cancers in BC prior to December 2017. POG&#xD;
      patients will be identified from the BC Cancer Outcomes and Surveillance Integration System&#xD;
      (OaSIS) POG Module Database. Eligible control patients will be identified from the BC Cancer&#xD;
      Registry, a population-based provincial cancer registry. These data will be linked with data&#xD;
      from the BC Cancer Pharmacy Database, Radiotherapy Database, and Cancer Agency Information&#xD;
      System (CAIS) using agency-specific identifiers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Approach&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will match POG patients and usual care patients based on their date of&#xD;
      metastatic disease diagnosis. They will apply 1:1 genetic algorithm-based matching (1:2 in&#xD;
      sensitivity analysis) and match patients on propensity scores and baseline covariates,&#xD;
      including patient demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment histories, and healthcare&#xD;
      utilization prior to metastatic disease diagnosis. When necessary, matching analyses will be&#xD;
      stratified to account for variation across cancer types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate overall survival in POG patients and matched controls, non-parametric and&#xD;
      parametric survival analyses will be used. These analyses will be adjusted for censoring. The&#xD;
      investigators will explore heterogeneity in clinical effectiveness across cancer subtypes&#xD;
      through subgroup analysis and use scenario analysis to determine the impact of future changes&#xD;
      in the application of WGTA on clinical effectiveness.&#xD;
