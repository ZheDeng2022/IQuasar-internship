             or absence of characteristic Fabry disease symptoms including neuropathic pain,&#xD;
             clustered angiokeratoma and/or cornea verticillata, leucocyte α-GAL A enzyme activity&#xD;
             (3% or less compared to control), and genotype (optional).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are currently receiving agalsidase alfa for a minimum of 6 months at&#xD;
             an average dose of 0.2 mg/kg every other week (ie, every 2 weeks) at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are naïve to agalsidase beta.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 at&#xD;

             &lt;500 mg protein per 1 g creatinine) between the 2 samples. For participants on&#xD;
             angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers&#xD;
             (ARBs), the criterion is to be met both prior and after a temporary interruption of&#xD;
             ACEIs/ARBs for 4 weeks.&#xD;
