      Non-interventional PK sub-study of QUILT-3.032 (CA-ALT-803-01-16) and QUILT-2.005&#xD;

      QUILT-3.032 is a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm, three-cohort, multicenter study of&#xD;
      intravesical BCG plus ALT-803 in patients with BCG unresponsive high grade NMIBC. Patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled into one of three study cohorts. Cohort A will enroll 80 patients who have&#xD;
      histologically confirmed presence of BCG-unresponsive carcinoma in situ (CIS) [with or&#xD;
      without Ta or T1 disease]. Cohort B will enroll 80 patients who have histologically confirmed&#xD;
      BCG-unresponsive high-grade Ta or T1 disease. Cohort C will enroll up to 23 patients who also&#xD;
      have histologically confirmed presence of BCG-unresponsive CIS [with or without Ta/T1&#xD;
      papillary disease]. Patients in Cohorts A and B will receive ALT-803 plus BCG combination&#xD;
      treatment. Patients in Cohort C will receive ALT-803 alone. Enrollment of Cohort C will start&#xD;
      once the enrollment of Cohort A is complete. Cohorts A, B, and C are independent study&#xD;
      cohorts and will be separately evaluated for efficacy. All patients treated in the study will&#xD;
      receive via a urinary catheter in the bladder, BCG plus ALT-803 or ALT-803 alone weekly for 6&#xD;
      consecutive weeks during the induction treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUILT-2.005 is a phase 2b, randomized, two-cohort, open-label, multicenter study of&#xD;
      intravesical ALT-803 plus BCG versus BCG alone, in BCG naïve patients with high-grade NMIBC.&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled into one of two study cohorts and randomized into two arms to be&#xD;
      treated with either ALT-803 plus BCG or BCG alone. Cohort A will initially enroll 366&#xD;
      patients who have histologically confirmed CIS (with or without Ta/T1 papillary disease).&#xD;
      Cohort B will initially enroll 230 patients who have histologically confirmed high-grade&#xD;
      papillary Ta/T1 disease only. Cohorts A and B are two independent study cohorts and will be&#xD;
      evaluated separately for efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK sub-study: Blood samples to determine serum levels of ALT-803 will be collected on study&#xD;
      day 1 prior to dosing, and at post-bladder voiding (+ 15 minutes), 24 (±2), 48 (±4), 72 (±4),&#xD;
      96 (±4) and 168 (±4) hours after dosing administered at study Week 1 and again at the same&#xD;
      time points for study Week 6. Six subjects from either cohort A (either study) or cohort C&#xD;
      (QUILT 3.032) and six subjects from cohort B (either study) will be sampled initially. Up to&#xD;
      an additional 4 subjects for each cohort may also be sampled. Patients enrolled in QUILT&#xD;
      2.005 must have been randomized to receive ALT-803 plus BCG to be eligible for the PK&#xD;
      sub-study.&#xD;
