    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a study drug or who has undergone study procedures and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not related to the study drug.&#xD;
An AE is considered &quot;serious&quot; if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: Death, life-threatening, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly or birth defect, hospitalization, or medically important event.</description>
