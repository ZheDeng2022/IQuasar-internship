  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extrinsic or exogenous ageing is caused by repetitive exposure of the skin to harmful agents,&#xD;
      while primary cause the exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, known as photoageing,&#xD;
      including solar effect. Chronic solar UV exposure has multiple damaging effects on skin, such&#xD;
      as wrinkling, dryness, dyspigmentation, epidermal thinning and increasing fragility. In&#xD;
      addition, solar exposure and age increase a subepidermal band.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibrillar collagen, which is synthesized from fibroblasts, is the predominant extracellular&#xD;
      matrix (ECM) component of the dermis. Collagen type I and III are considered to be the major&#xD;
      interstitial, fiber forming collagen in normal human dermis. In addition, the dermis contains&#xD;
      collagen types IV (gelatine), V and VI. Other important component of the EMC of the dermis&#xD;
      are elastic fibers being elastin (ELN) their main component and play a critical role in skin&#xD;
      elasticity and the reduction of elastic fiber production results in impaired elasticity. UV&#xD;
      radiation induces ECM degeneration and consequently an increase in fragility and loss of&#xD;
      elasticity of the skin. This process is mediated by an increase in matrix metalloproteinases&#xD;
      (MMPs) expression in human skin which are responsible for degrading ECM proteins, such as&#xD;
      collagen, fibronectin and elastin. The natural inhibitors of MMPs are tissue inhibitors of&#xD;
      metalloproteinases (TIMPs), being TIMP-1 the most relevant TIMP affecting collagen&#xD;
      metabolism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Orally administered ingredients can have positive effects on skin characteristics by&#xD;
      modulating the internal factors leading to the changes associated with photoageing. Thus, the&#xD;
      use of food ingredients and supplements that claim to reduce the risk of skin disorders or&#xD;
      alleviate skin ageing is increasing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between these ingredients, polyphenols obtained from botanical extracts has been used for&#xD;
      cosmetic applications, including Pycnogenol®, a French Maritime Pine Bark extract (FMPBE).&#xD;
      showing photoprotective effect against UV-light induced skin damages, and an improvement in&#xD;
      hydratation and elasticity of skin in human clinical trials. In another clinical trial,&#xD;
      treatment with a different FMPBE called Flavangenol®, significantly decreased skin photo-aged&#xD;
      scores. Other human intervention studies with oral administration of polyphenol extracts of&#xD;
      different origins such as citrus extract (NutroxSun®), red orange fruit extract (Red Orange&#xD;
      Complex®), Polypodium leucotomos and Pomegranate extracts (PPmix® and Fernblock®) have&#xD;
      demonstrated beneficials effects of these supplements on improvement of skin characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the studies cited above suggest that oral administration of polyphenols rich&#xD;
      extracts and especially of FMPBE is a promising approach for nutritional photoprotection of&#xD;
      skin, reducing photoageing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, it must be taken into account that most of these studies have been done with a&#xD;
      low number of subjects, with combination with other ingredients and/or without placebo group.&#xD;
      Thus, well designed clinical trials with a correct volunteer's number are required to obtain&#xD;
      robust results about the effects of FMPBE on skin ageing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dérivés Résiniques et Terpéniques (DRT) is a company that has developed and commercialize&#xD;
      Oligopin®, a polyphenol extract derived from French maritime pine bark. Oligopin® is&#xD;
      characterized by a practical absence of tannins ( &lt; 1%) and a high content in low molecular&#xD;
      weight oligomeric procyanidins (OPC &gt; 70%; dimers about 20%), a distinctive feature of other&#xD;
      proanthocyanidin-rich extracts such as Pycnogenol® which contained about 5% of dimers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, although the insoluble products in water are low in both products, lower and&#xD;
      more adequate concentrations are present in Oligopin® (Oligopin ® typically 2 to 4% to a&#xD;
      maximum at 5% versus Pycnogenol®: 6% - 8.1%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The degree of polymerization of OPC can determine its absorption across cell membranes and,&#xD;
      as it has been observed in rats, only a certain OPC of a lower degree of polymerization is&#xD;
      absorbed during transit in the gut. Consequently, the effect of FMPB extract could be&#xD;
      determined, in part, by the quality of its OPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the present study is that circulating metabolic fraction of Oligopin® might&#xD;
      exert beneficial actions on collagen metabolism, which is directly linked to skin strength&#xD;
      and elasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In consequence, the daily consumption of Oligopin® will exert beneficial effects on skin&#xD;
      ageing through the modulation of the proteins involved in the metabolism of collagen in&#xD;
      humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to determine the beneficial effects of Oligopin® on skin&#xD;
      aging, through the improvement of skin elasticity in participants with photo-aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effects of Oligopin® on skin aging through the measurement of wrinkles,&#xD;
           spots, skin hydration and subepidermal band.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effects of Oligopin® on the dynamics of collagen and elastin through the&#xD;
           determination of different biomarkers in serum and the expression of genes in peripheral&#xD;
           blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To discover new biomarkers of the effects of Oligopin® through transcriptomic analysis&#xD;
           in PBMCs and serum metabolomic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the metabolites of Oligopin® (MFO) in plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish potential correlations between specific metabolites of MFO and the&#xD;
           beneficial effects of Oligopin® on the skin, as well as between serum biomarkers and&#xD;
           PBMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the ability of the MFO to modulate the dynamics of collagen through the use&#xD;
           of cellular models of human fibroblasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an initial phase, an acute postprandial study will be carried out with 20 of the 60&#xD;
      volunteers with the consumption of 700 mg of Oligopin® in a single day, with the aim of&#xD;
      obtaining the MFO. With MFO, the mechanisms by which Oligopin® exerts the beneficial effects&#xD;
      on skin aging will be studied through in vitro studies with cellular models. The 60&#xD;
      participants will participate in the second phase of the study, which will be randomly&#xD;
      divided into two groups of 30 participants, depending on whether they consume a 100 mg&#xD;
      Oligopin® capsule or a placebo capsule, with the same appearance as the Oligopin® capsule but&#xD;
      will not contain the botanical extract. In this second phase, participants will consume one&#xD;
      capsule each day for a total of 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study there will be 5 visits, one of selection (V0), one of the first phase of the&#xD;
      study (V1; week 1) and 3 visits of the second phase of the study (V2, V3 and V4; weeks 2, 3&#xD;
      and 4).&#xD;
