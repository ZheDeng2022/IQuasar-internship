  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the safety and clinical efficacy (death, overall hospitalization, hospitalization&#xD;
      for influenza or pneumonia) of ID QIV delivered via an intradermal device with imiquimod&#xD;
      cream pretreatment with conventional intramuscular (IM) standard dose QIV and IM high-dose&#xD;
      TIV&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective; double-blind randomized controlled study performed in the HKWC.&#xD;
      Recruited subjects include subjects ≥50 years and adult subjects ≥18 years with chronic&#xD;
      illness. Eligible subjects will be randomly allocated (3:3:2) into one of the three groups in&#xD;
      the first year. Group IQ: topical 5% 250mg imiquimod ointment followed by intradermal QIV,&#xD;
      Group IM: topical aqueous-cream followed by IM QIV and Group HD: topical aqueous-cream&#xD;
      followed by intramuscular high-dose TIV. Hemagglutination inhibition and neutralization&#xD;
      antibody titres will be assayed. We plan to recruit 4000 subjects, 1500 subjects in each of&#xD;
      the IQ and IM group (500 subjects in each subgroup with 3 subgroups) and 1000 subjects for&#xD;
      the HD group (500 subjects in each subgroup with 2 subgroups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the following year, the IQ and IM groups will be further randomized equally into three&#xD;
      subgroups: IQ1, IQ2 and IQ3; IM1, IM2 and IM3; and two subgroups for HD group: HD1 and HD2.&#xD;
      Subjects randomized to IQ1, IM1 will receive the QIV with the same topical treatment,&#xD;
      delivery mode and vaccine as the first year and HD1 will receive the TIV with the same&#xD;
      topical treatment, delivery mode and vaccine as the first year. Subgroup IQ2 and IM2 will be&#xD;
      vaccinated as follow: IQ2 will receive topical aqueous-cream followed by IM QIV, IM2 will&#xD;
      receive topical imiquimod ointment followed by ID QIV. Subgroup IQ3, IM3, HD2 will receive&#xD;
      normal saline as the vaccine for that year, but delivered by the same mode and topical&#xD;
      treatment. In the third year, subgroups IQ1, IQ2, IM1, IM2 and HD1 will receive the same&#xD;
      topical treatment, delivery mode and vaccine as the second year. Subgroup IQ3, IM3 and HD2&#xD;
      will receive the same topical treatment, delivery mode and vaccine as the first year.&#xD;
