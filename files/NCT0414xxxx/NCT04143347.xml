      Background: Patients with mild blunt traumatic brain injury (TBI) are frequently transferred&#xD;
      to Level 1 trauma centers (L1TC) if they have any positive finding of any acute intracranial&#xD;
      injury identified on a CT scan of the head. The hypothesis for the study is that patients&#xD;
      with such injuries and minor changes on the Head CT scan can be safely managed at community&#xD;
      hospitals (CH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Patients with blunt, mild TBI (defined as a GCS 13-15 at presentation) presenting to&#xD;
      CH, L1TC, and transferred from CH to L1TC between March, 2012 and February, 2014 were&#xD;
      included. Minor changes on head CT were defined as: 1) epidural hematoma&lt;2mm; 2) subarachnoid&#xD;
      hemorrhage&lt;2mm; 3) subdural hematoma&lt;4mm; 4) intraparenchymal hemorrhage&lt;5mm; 5) minor&#xD;
      pneumocephalus; or 6) linear or minimally depressed skull fracture. TBI-specific&#xD;
      interventions were defined as intracranial pressure monitor placement, administration of&#xD;
      hyperosmolar therapy, or neurosurgical operation. Three groups of patients were compared: 1)&#xD;
      those receiving treatment at CH, 2) those transferred from CH to L1TC, and 3) those&#xD;
      presenting directly to L1TC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint was the need for TBI-specific intervention and secondary outcome was&#xD;
      death of any patient.&#xD;

      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trauma registries at all participating centers were searched for patients who developed&#xD;
      mild TBIs following blunt trauma and were directly admitted either to L1TC, or CH, or&#xD;
      transferred from CH to L1TC. Patients with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) equal to or greater than&#xD;
      13 and a positive head CT scan for minor injuries were included in the study. Minor CT&#xD;
      findings were defined as: 1) an epidural hematoma less than 2 mm thick, 2) a subarachnoid&#xD;
      hemorrhage measuring less than 2 mm, 3) a subdural hematoma less than 4 mm thick, 4) an&#xD;
      intraparenchymal hemorrhage measuring less than 5 mm, 5) minor pneumocephalus, or 6) linear&#xD;
      or minimally depressed skull fracture. Patients with multiple findings were also included so&#xD;
      long as the above criteria were met. Patients were also included patients if they were taking&#xD;
      aspirin or if they were intoxicated with alcohol as long as their GCS could still be assessed&#xD;
      to be between 13-15. Patients with more severe CT scan findings were excluded. Patients were&#xD;
      also excluded if they were younger than 18 years of age, presented with open skull fractures,&#xD;
      were intubated or hemodynamically unstable upon presentation, or had prior history of&#xD;
      bleeding diathesis. Finally, patients with injuries in other areas of the body with an&#xD;
      abbreviated injury score (AIS) &gt; 2 were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining approval by the Institutional Review Board, data of interest was&#xD;
      retrospectively collected from one LITC and four CH. This was done by using the trauma&#xD;
      registries and reviewing individual medical charts. Collected data included baseline&#xD;
      demographics (e.g. age and gender), variables related to the blunt trauma (e.g. mechanism of&#xD;
      injury, injury severity score [ISS], and AIS scores), baseline comorbidities, vital signs and&#xD;
      GCS on arrival to the emergency department, CT scan findings and whether a repeat CT scan of&#xD;
      the head was performed, the administration of blood products, hospital and intensive care&#xD;
      unit (ICU) length of stay, as well as in-hospital complication and mortality rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three groups of patients were compared:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. those who were admitted and received definitive treatment at one of the four CH&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. those who initially presented at CH but were subsequently transferred to L1TC and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. those who presented directly to the L1TC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study was the need for TBI-specific interventions in these 3&#xD;
      groups. TBI-specific intervention was defined as a neurosurgical operation, insertion of an&#xD;
      intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor, or administration of hyperosmolar therapy. The secondary&#xD;
      endpoint was mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was performed using the STATA software (version 13.1). Numerical&#xD;
      variables are reported as medians with interquartile ranges (25th to 75th percentile), and&#xD;
      categorical ones as frequencies and percentages. The Kruskal Wallis non-parametric test was&#xD;
      used to compare the numerical variables and the chi-square or Fisher's exact test to compare&#xD;
      the categorical variables as appropriate. The multivariable logistic regression analyses to&#xD;
      identify independent predictors of TBI-specific interventions or independent risk factors for&#xD;
      mortality and overall morbidity could not be performed, given the rarity of these events in&#xD;
      the patient population. p-value of less than 0.05 was defined as the level of statistical&#xD;
      significance.&#xD;
