      This study aims to identify the optimal method to recognize, risk stratify, and provide&#xD;
      follow-up care for individuals at risk of hereditary cancer. The study team will conduct a&#xD;
      Hybrid Type II comparative effectiveness-implementation trial, with a mixed methods component&#xD;
      and process/formative evaluations for stakeholder engagement. The study team will evaluate&#xD;
      three methods for identifying and risk-stratifying individuals at risk of hereditary cancer&#xD;
      and providing post-risk stratification longitudinal care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study team proposes a randomized, Hybrid Type II comparative effectiveness-implementation&#xD;
      trial, with a mixed methods component and process/formative evaluations for stakeholder&#xD;
      engagement. The study team will evaluate three methods for identifying and risk-stratifying&#xD;
      individuals at risk of hereditary cancer and providing post-risk stratification longitudinal&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The study hypothesis is that Comparator 3 will identify more people at high risk&#xD;
      of hereditary cancers and result in more screening behaviors, greater resource use, increased&#xD;
      distress, higher perceived risk of cancer and higher satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long term objective: At study end, the study will show: 1) each comparator's strengths and&#xD;
      weaknesses, 2) patient preferences, clinical outcomes, and compliance with each step from&#xD;
      history collection to screening test completion, 3) the resources needed for each strategy,&#xD;
      and 4) the contextual factors that impact their sustainability, dissemination and&#xD;
      implementation. Study findings have high potential for generalizability because: 1) The&#xD;
      multidisciplinary stakeholder team will help to minimize barriers to dissemination and&#xD;
      implementation of the investigator's findings in other research settings; 2) Study results&#xD;
      are independent of study setting; 3) The tested methods of family history assessment can&#xD;
      occur remotely via paper or electronic interfaces; 4) The care coordination method has&#xD;
      successful precedent in other disciplines and can be delivered remotely; 5) A process and&#xD;
      formative evaluation with a diverse stakeholder team will inform sustainability,&#xD;
      dissemination, and implementation, and result in an implementation guide; 6) The results will&#xD;
      be relevant for both family history-based and direct-genetic testing strategies for&#xD;
      population screening for hereditary cancer; 7) The results will inform population screening&#xD;
      for any disease with hereditary risk.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will have their cancer risk assessed via usual care. Usual Care is defined as provider capture of family history during a clinical encounter and its entry into the electronic health record (EHR). Participants will take the a patient reported outcomes (PRO) survey once to assess participants experience, perspectives and thoughts on cancer, cancer risk, and cancer risk assessments.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Comparator 2</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will have their cancer risk assessed using a short, standardized web-based questionnaire that will populate validated cancer risk models (such as Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool/Gail model 2, PREMM and/or MMRpro) which will take 5-10 minutes to complete. Following the cancer risk assessment, participants will be asked to take a PRO survey. PRO surveys will also be administered at the time of the cancer risk assessment and then 6 and 12 months following.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Comparator 3</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will have their cancer risk assessed using a more detailed, full version of the family history survey than the one comparator 2 participants take. This version is a full pedigree assessment, which entails family health history for all 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-degree relatives. Time needed for completion is 15-25 minutes, depending on family size and cancer risk. Participants will also be asked to take the PRO survey following the full cancer risk assessment and also at 6 and 12 months.</description>
