    <textblock>
      This study is being performed to assess the relative effectiveness of genicular nerve&#xD;
      ablation with the COOLIEF* Cooled Radiofrequency probe to manage moderate to severe knee pain&#xD;
      in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee when compared to radiofrequency ablation&#xD;
      using a Standard Radiofrequency probe.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, single-blind comparison study examining the&#xD;
      outcomes of subjects with osteoarthritic knee pain undergoing a procedure to create a&#xD;
      radiofrequency lesion of the genicular nerves with either Cooled Radiofrequency Ablation&#xD;
      (CRFA) or Conventional (Standard) Radiofrequency Ablation (SRFA). Approximately 148&#xD;
      participants from up to 15 sites will be enrolled into this study, with subjects undergoing&#xD;
      either CRFA or SRFA in a 1:1 randomization scheme. Follow-up will be conducted for 24 months&#xD;
      post-treatment, with the primary endpoint being completed at month 12. Pain, overall outcome,&#xD;
      quality of life, pain medication use, and adverse events will be compared between the two&#xD;
      treatment groups to determine success.&#xD;

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of subjects whose knee pain is reduced by ≥ 50% based on the NRS. The NRS is an 11-point scale (0 points to 10 points), where 0 points equals &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 points equals &quot;worst pain&quot;. There are no sub-scales.</description>

    <measure>Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement (KOOS, JR)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The change in KOOS JR score from baseline. The KOOS JR is a short form of the KOOS that assesses patient stiffness (1 item), pain (4 items), and functions of daily living (2 items). Scores range from 0 to 100 with a score of 0 indicating total knee disability and 100 indicating perfect knee health.</description>

    <measure>EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The change in measured EQ-5D-5L scale from baseline. This outcome instrument is composed of five sub-scales containing five questions each. The point range for each sub-scale is from 1 to 5, with &quot;1&quot; indicating the best study subject condition and &quot;5&quot; indicating the worst study subject condition. Thus, the minimum and maximum scores per sub-scale are 1 and 5, respectively, and such scores for the entire instrument are 5 (best study subject condition) and 25 (worst study subject condition). The sub-scale topics are: Mobility, Self-Care, Usual Activities, Pain/Discomfort, and Anxiety/Depression</description>
