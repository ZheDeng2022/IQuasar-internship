&#xD;
               -  III Burns moderately, tans gradually&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No ultraviolet exposure of the test areas 4 weeks prior to baseline photo testing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal skin response during preliminary photo testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed and dated written informed consent in accordance with ICH-GCP and local&#xD;
             legislation prior to admission to the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP)1 must be ready and able to use highly&#xD;
             effective methods of birth control per ICH M3 (R2) that result in a low failure rate&#xD;
             of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. A list of contraception&#xD;
             methods meeting these criteria is provided in the patient information&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including blood pressure, pulse rate or ECG)&#xD;
             deviating from normal and judged as clinically relevant by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the Investigator considers to be&#xD;
             of clinical relevance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,&#xD;
