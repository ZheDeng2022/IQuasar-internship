  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is open to individuals with Actinic Keratoses (skin lesions that have the&#xD;
      potential to turn into skin cancer), who are receiving photodynamic therapy (PDT) as part of&#xD;
      their clinical care. The purpose of this study is to test and demonstrate that vitamin D&#xD;
      pre-treatment can enhance PDT efficacy in the treatment of Actinic Keratoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to take vitamin D supplements prior to their standard of care PDT&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the research will last about 3-4 months.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether acute supplementation&#xD;
      (neoadjuvant Vitamin D3), adjusted according to baseline Vitamin D status, can improve the&#xD;
      clinical PDT response relative to participants receiving PDT alone&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to determine whether gene polymorphisms in VDR and&#xD;
      CYP27B1 are predictive for the degree of responsiveness to Vitamin D as a neoadjuvant for&#xD;
      PDT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a non-randomized interventional trial, in which the study group will be&#xD;
      compared to a baseline cohort of patients from a previous study who received the same regimen&#xD;
      of PDT, but without any Vit D. It is anticipated that 30 participants will be involved in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Update: April 2021 - removed arm from other study&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Using topical retinoids, since these can exacerbate the post-PDT erythema reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Using any topical treatment on their AKs; must stop at least one month prior.&#xD;
