      This clinical trial studies the impact of CONNECT on biochemically confirmed smoking&#xD;
      abstinence among diverse current smokers who are undergoing lung cancer screening.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study team will develop and test a novel smoking cessation intervention, CONNECT, which&#xD;
      will start at the time an individual is receiving lung cancer screening (LCS). CONNECT will&#xD;
      include an interactive Video Doctor which will provide participants with information tailored&#xD;
      to their individual responses as well as proactive outreach using brief telephone calls and&#xD;
      text messaging to follow up smokers with motivation enhancement to refer and engage patients&#xD;
      in evidence based smoking cessation interventions (such as quitline utilization). After&#xD;
      development and usability testing, we will conduct a small feasibility study followed by a&#xD;
      pilot randomized controlled trial to estimate the impact of CONNECT on biochemically&#xD;
      confirmed 30-day smoking abstinence among diverse current smokers seen at the San Francisco&#xD;
      Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the University of California San Francisco Division of&#xD;
      General Internal Medicine. Participants will be randomized to CONNECT or a control condition.&#xD;
      Data will include self-report from participants obtained at baseline, 1 and 3 months, and the&#xD;
      electronic health record. Outcomes will be biochemically confirmed 30-day smoking abstinence&#xD;
      at 3 months post LCS and satisfaction as well as self-reported quit attempts, and use of&#xD;
      evidence-based smoking cessation resources (quitline, pharmacotherapy or counseling). The&#xD;
      knowledge gained will provide the pilot data necessary to apply for a larger study to test&#xD;
      our novel intervention for promoting smoking cessation among a diverse population of&#xD;
      high-risk smokers undergoing Lung Cancer Screening.&#xD;
