  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The epidemic of non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      is attributable in large part to unhealthy eating habits and physical inactivity. In the Fall&#xD;
      of 2016, the Québec Government launched its first-ever Government Health Prevention Policy&#xD;
      (PGPS) to act on a set of factors to improve the health status and quality of life of the&#xD;
      population of Quebec and to reduce social inequalities in health. NutriQuébec is a web-based&#xD;
      prospective cohort study whose primary aim is to quantify the impact of the implementation of&#xD;
      the PGPS on the Québec population's eating habits over the years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NutriQuébec will recruit over the next 3 years 20,000 adults living in the Province of Québec&#xD;
      in Canada through a vast multimedia campaign designed to reach different segments of the&#xD;
      population, including subgroups with a low socioeconomic status. Participants will be invited&#xD;
      to complete on a web-based platform nine core questionnaires on a yearly basis.&#xD;
      Questionnaires will assess several dimensions related to lifestyle, including eating habits&#xD;
      and physical activity habits, as well as a large number of personal characteristics and&#xD;
      global health status. The time course of the changes in eating habits will be analyzed in&#xD;
      conjecture with the implementation of the PGPS to quantify its impact at a population level.&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed while accounting for sociodemographic weight of participants, to&#xD;
      achieve representativeness of the adult Québec population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NutriQuébec will provide essential data for the long-term evaluation of eating habits after&#xD;
      Québec's PGPS is launched.&#xD;

      NutriQuébec is an open cohort with continuous and uninterrupted recruitment over the study&#xD;
      duration, which is currently funded until 2022. The target sample size is 20,000 adults based&#xD;
      on a non-probability sampling. A vast multimedia campaign will be deployed to reach the&#xD;
      target population throughout the province of Québec. More specifically, television, radio and&#xD;
      print interviews will be organized periodically. Key leading figures in the area of food and&#xD;
      health will be solicited to promote the project on various media platforms. The project will&#xD;
      also be publicized on social networks, including on the NutriQuébec Facebook page. The Québec&#xD;
      Government and several of its community partners will be invited to promote NutriQuébec via&#xD;
      their website, newsletters and/or the social networks they use. In addition, recruitment ads&#xD;
      will be distributed through several channels, including: 1) email lists from partners and&#xD;
      universities in Québec; and 2) public places such as community centers, health institutions&#xD;
      and companies. All of the above-mentioned recruitment methods will invite individuals&#xD;
      interested in the study to visit the NutriQuébec website for more information and to&#xD;
      register.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After having created an account on the secured PULSAR platform, each individual will be&#xD;
      invited to provide informed consent to participate in the project.Their eligibility (age and&#xD;
      address of residence) will be automatically verified at registration. Once registered and&#xD;
      having consented, participants will be invited through email to complete the core&#xD;
      questionnaires by logging into their personal and secured account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Core questionnaires will be completed on a yearly basis, based on the date of the&#xD;
      participants' first registration. These core questionnaires assess lifestyle habits including&#xD;
      eating habits, physical activity habits, sleep quality, tobacco, alcohol and drug habits as&#xD;
      well as personal characteristics, food security and health status.&#xD;
