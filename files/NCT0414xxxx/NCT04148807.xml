    <textblock>
      This study investigates the feasibility of a gait-retraining program for older adults with&#xD;
      knee osteoarthritis. The study will enroll 40 participants, with 20 receiving a gait&#xD;
      retraining intervention and 20 receiving a graded walking program without gait retraining.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic condition affecting ~12% of older adults in the United&#xD;
      States and is a leading cause of disability. Knee pain is a common clinical manifestation&#xD;
      that leads individuals with OA to seek medical care. Current rehabilitation approaches (e.g.,&#xD;
      bracing, taping, foot orthoses, strengthening, etc.) aim to reduce knee joint loading, a&#xD;
      well-accepted risk factor for knee OA and pain, but are not always effective. Altering gait&#xD;
      mechanics to reduce knee loading has also been suggested. Gait retraining studies for&#xD;
      individuals with knee OA have focused on increasing trunk lean and toe out angle to reduce&#xD;
      the knee adduction moment (a surrogate measure of joint loading). However, these strategies&#xD;
      create an abnormal gait pattern and may not be the best long-term solutions due to the&#xD;
      potential injury to other joints which may limit their overall effectiveness and&#xD;
      applicability to clinical practice. Impact loading, another mechanical factor related to knee&#xD;
      OA, has been reduced using gait retraining strategies in runners with knee pain. It is&#xD;
      unknown if gait retraining strategies to decrease impact loading can reduce symptoms of knee&#xD;
      OA. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of a gait retraining&#xD;
      program focusing on decreasing impact loading in individuals with knee OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, following 8 intervention sessions, and at 1-month follow-up, participants will&#xD;
      complete questionnaires, undergo three-dimensional gait analysis, and assessment of pressure&#xD;
      pain threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: For participants enrolled during COVID-19 outbreak, only questionnaires will be&#xD;
      collected at follow-up assessments.&#xD;

    <description>A progressive walking program with gait retraining will be performed on a treadmill at self-selected comfortable walking speed wearing an inertial measurement unit (IMU) on the medial aspect of the distal tibia. The (vertical) peak positive acceleration (PPA) of the tibia is a measure of tibial shock. Subjects will be provided real-time audio feedback to reduce PPA by 20% of their average peak PPA. During retraining sessions, a faded feedback approach will be used. Feedback will be provided continuously during the first four sessions and will be faded over the last 4 sessions. Walking time will increase over the 8 sessions.</description>
