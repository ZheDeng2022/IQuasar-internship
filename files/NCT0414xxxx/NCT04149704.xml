  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized trial of adolescent and young adults with advanced cancer and&#xD;
      their caregivers to assess preferences for care in advanced cancer. This research study is&#xD;
      examining the similarities and differences between patient's and caregiver's goals of cancer&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study interventions involved in this study may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Video&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phone Interview&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research study procedures include: screening for eligibility and study interventions&#xD;
      including questionnaires and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Patients and their caregivers will be randomized into the same group; either ACP video&#xD;
      decision aid intervention or usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients' and caregivers' knowledge, preferences (goals of care, CPR, ventilation), and&#xD;
           decisional conflict be assessed before and after the ACP video decision aid intervention&#xD;
           or usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be in this research study for up to 3 months with only 2 study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is expected that about 100 people (50 patients and 50 caregivers) will take part in&#xD;
           this research study.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        All patients will be recruited from the outpatient clinics of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute&#xD;
        (both pediatric and adult clinics),the inpatient settings of Boston Children's Hospital and&#xD;
        Brigham and Women's Hospital, the inpatient or outpatient clinics of Massachusetts General&#xD;
        Hospital, or virtually. Eligible study participants will give written consent to the&#xD;
        primary investigator or study staff member before initiation of study procedures if&#xD;
        recruited in-person. If participants are enrolled and complete study procedures virtually,&#xD;
        they will provide verbal consent before initiating study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If in-person visits cannot be conducted, eligible participants will be still be mailed a&#xD;
        pre-notice letter that offers the chance for participants to opt-out or opt-in via email or&#xD;
        phone call. After one week, we will call participants we have not heard from and ask if&#xD;
        they would consider participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient Eligibility criteria will include patients who are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        i) Diagnosed with advanced cancer (i.e., initial first-line therapy is unsuccessful, marked&#xD;
        by progression or relapsed disease) ii) Aged between 18-39, which is the legal age for&#xD;
        completing an ACP document (e.g., POLST/MOLST); iii) Speak English; and iv) Have a&#xD;
        caregiver or identified surrogate decision maker who is able to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        v) Treated at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute or Massachusetts General Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        i) A diagnosis of low-grade glioma given the fact that progressive or relapsed low grade&#xD;
        may not be clinically characterized as advanced disease and associated poor prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ii) Visually impaired (note, hearing impaired is not an exclusion as the video is closed&#xD;
        captioned); iii) Psychological state not appropriate for ACP discussions as determined by&#xD;
        the primary oncologist; and, iv) Unable to participate in ACP discussions due to mental&#xD;
        incapacity as determined by the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire&#xD;
