  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the efficacy of blood flow restriction&#xD;
      therapy on patients with lower limb extensor injuries by measuring pre and post blood flow&#xD;
      restriction therapy strength and muscle mass.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to restrict venous outflow with an inflatable cuff to create a high intensity&#xD;
      environment increases muscle hypertrophy, thus promoting a more efficient form of&#xD;
      rehabilitation. Blood flow restriction therapy is a blood pressure cuff placed around the&#xD;
      desired limb with a handheld device that controls the pressure exerted by the cuff. The cuff&#xD;
      is placed around the desired limb before a specific exercise, the physical therapist&#xD;
      determines the appropriate pressure and time, and the patient completes the exercise as they&#xD;
      normally would. The monitor determines the limb occlusion pressure and has an automatic timer&#xD;
      that will deflate after the specified time has elapsed. There are also audio and visual&#xD;
      alarms that alert the user of under or over pressurization. The specific pressure will vary&#xD;
      based on patient's tolerance and will stay consistent through each exercise. Thus far blood&#xD;
      flow restriction therapy has been tested in patients with several pathologies but there is&#xD;
      limited literature on its effect on lower limb extensor injuries.&#xD;
