  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether the Potlako+ intervention of community education, clinical&#xD;
      provider support, and patient navigation can improve access to cancer case for patients&#xD;
      presenting with symptoms of cancer. Half of communities will receive the Potlako+&#xD;
      intervention, while the other communities will continue to receive standard programs.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Potlako+ trial is a pair-matched, community-randomized study involving 20 rural and&#xD;
      peri-urban communities in Botswana (population ~190,100 with ~100,000 30 years or older).&#xD;
      Communities will be randomized 1:1 to the Potlako+ intervention versus standard care. The&#xD;
      goal of the intervention is to identify individuals with symptoms/signs suggestive of cancer&#xD;
      and expedite diagnosis (and treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial includes a community education component focused on cancer awareness and importance&#xD;
      of early diagnosis and a patient navigation component that aims to expedite the diagnostic&#xD;
      evaluation. Community education will be directed at approximately 50,000 community residents&#xD;
      (30 years and older). We anticipate approximately 1500 cancer suspects will be identified by&#xD;
      their clinic providers.&#xD;
