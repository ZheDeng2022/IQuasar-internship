  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Personalized nutrition is one of the most up to date trends in human nutrition and gains much&#xD;
      interest of general public and scientists as well. Although we have gained some knowledge on&#xD;
      gene-trait associations, the real effectiveness and usefulness of genotype-based nutritional&#xD;
      recommendations is unknown. Many personalized nutrition companies are on the market today,&#xD;
      some of them use personalized nutrition based on genotype analysis. For this reason,&#xD;
      scientific basis of this approach should be clarified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our project can thus increase knowledge which can be applied in dietary counseling practice.&#xD;
      Although we focus on increase vegetable and fruits intake, the study is designed as a proof&#xD;
      of concept.&#xD;

      In humans, the TAS2R38 receptor gene is responsible for differences in the perception of&#xD;
      bitter taste. This gene codes for a G protein that is associated with a flavor receptor&#xD;
      regulated by phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) and propylthiouracil (PROP) ligands, which by binding&#xD;
      to the receptor determines the degree of bitter taste. Cruciferous vegetables contain&#xD;
      glucosinolates and isothiocyanates, which resemble PTC and PROP and thereby affect their&#xD;
      perception of bitter taste through the TAS2R38 regulated receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The polymorphism of this gene allows to distinguish three phenotypes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  insensitive to bitter taste [bitter-non tasters]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  moderately sensitive to bitter taste [intermediate-bitter tasters]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sensitive to bitter taste [bitter taster] Previous studies have shown that people who&#xD;
           are carriers of one PAV haplotype experience a bitter taste more than AVI / AVI&#xD;
           homozygotes, which are less sensitive to bitter taste. Hence, the TAS2R38 gene&#xD;
           polymorphism is associated with nutritional decisions, including choice of vegetables&#xD;
           and coffee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study is to verify effectiveness of the genotype based dietary intervention in&#xD;
      people with or without polymorphism of TAS2R38 gene.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>To achieve the goals of the study, a group of healthy adults will be qualified. Genotype will be assed at the baseline. Consumption of fruit and vegetables will be assessed before and after intervention. The duration of the study will be 20 weeks. Blood results and body analyze will be assessed at the beginning and after the intervention. Overall food consumption will be assessed at the beginning. For the basic characteristics of study participants, their anthropometric and biochemical parameters will be analyzed twice at the baseline and after intervention. The intervention effect, including the TAS2R38 polymorphism, will be analyzed by statistical analysis.&#xD;
In a randomized manner volunteers will be assigned to one of three groups: intervention and two control group.</intervention_model_description>
