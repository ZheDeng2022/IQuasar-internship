  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a Health Canada approved treatment for&#xD;
      major depression. Theta burst stimulation (TBS) is a very promising new treatment for major&#xD;
      depression that allows a 15-fold reduction in duration of daily sessions. However, no large&#xD;
      scale naturalistic study has assessed the superiority of bilateral TBS in comparison with&#xD;
      unilateral left TBS. In fact, no TBS study thus far has included both unipolar and bipolar&#xD;
      depression, or other psychiatric comorbidities such as anxiety. Maintenance has yet to be&#xD;
      studied with TBS, along with an effective maintenance protocol to prevent relapse. Our study&#xD;
      aims to explore and address these gaps.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a Health Canada approved treatment for&#xD;
      major depression. Typical treatments involve 30 to 45 minutes daily session delivered over 4&#xD;
      to 6 weeks. Recent technical advances allowed the development of theta burst stimulation&#xD;
      (TBS), a novel rTMS paradigm which reduces daily sessions to 3 to 4 minutes while maintaining&#xD;
      the same clinical efficacy. However, it remains to be determined if applying TBS to both&#xD;
      sides of the frontal cortex (i.e. bilateral TBS) is more efficient than delivering it to only&#xD;
      one side (i.e. unilateral TBS). In addition, it is difficult to predict treatment response as&#xD;
      there is a lack of tools to identify potential responders early on in the treatment phase.&#xD;
      Finally, the effects of rTMS are known to last up to 12 months after the treatment. To avoid&#xD;
      relapse, a maintenance phase is typically introduced after treatment in which treatment&#xD;
      sessions are delivered at a gradually decreasing rate. However, it is unknown whether it is&#xD;
      better to offer a fixed schedule of treatment or adjust the treatment schedule according to&#xD;
      symptomatology. This study proposes to bridge these gaps by conducting a randomized&#xD;
      double-blinded naturalistic superiority trial in which the efficacy of bilateral and&#xD;
      unilateral TBS will be compared in individuals with a diagnosis of major depressive episodes.&#xD;
      Neurobiological markers of response will be assessed at different time points. In people that&#xD;
      respond to treatment, a 6-month maintenance phase will be conducted in which a fixed schedule&#xD;
      will be compared to a flexible schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has four primary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the efficacy of bilateral and unilateral TBS on symptoms of depression, as&#xD;
           well as rates of remission and response&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate how unilateral and bilateral TBS modulates brain activity in the&#xD;
           dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) using interleaved TMS-EEG&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate neural predictors of the clinical response to TBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare the efficacy of a fixed versus a flexible schedule of maintenance on a period&#xD;
           of 6 months on symptoms of depression and rate of relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT PHASE TBS treatment will be administered 5 days/week (Monday to Friday) over a&#xD;
      first phase of 4 weeks (20 sessions). If remission is achieved (Hamilton Rating Scale for&#xD;
      Depression-17 scorescore ≤ 8), treatment will cease and the patient will move on to the&#xD;
      maintenance phase. Non-remitters will receive a second phase of treatment, consisting of an&#xD;
      additional 2 weeks (10 sessions, for a total of 30). After 6 weeks, all responders may move&#xD;
      on to the maintenance phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE PHASE The maintenance phase which will be of 6 months duration from the end of&#xD;
      the randomized treatment. For each TBS condition, responders will be randomized to two&#xD;
      possible maintenance treatments 1) a fixed maintenance protocol, or 2) a flexible maintenance&#xD;
      protocol based on symptom emergence. The fixed protocol will consist of two sessions per week&#xD;
      for the first month, followed by a weekly TBS session for two months, bimonthly sessions for&#xD;
      two months and a monthly session for the last month. Outcome will be measured weekly for&#xD;
      months 1-2-3, bimonthly for months 4-5 and monthly for month 6. For the flexible protocol,&#xD;
      participants will receive a fixed 2x/week schedule for the month 1. For month 2 and 3, a&#xD;
      brief weekly assessment (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-17 score) will be conducted in&#xD;
      which it will be determined if they will receive 0, 1 or 2 sessions in the week. For month 4&#xD;
      and 5, a bimonthly assessment (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-17 score) will be&#xD;
      conducted in which it will be determined if they will receive 0, 1 or 2 sessions over the two&#xD;
      weeks. For month 6, one brief assessment (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-17 score) will&#xD;
      be conducted in which it will be determined if they will receive 0, 1 or 2 sessions in the&#xD;
      month.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Both participants and research team members conducting the interviews and the TBS treatment will be blinded to the TBS treatment condition. In the unilateral arm, the right-sided stimulation will be applied with the placebo side of the coil. In the bilateral arm, the right-sided stimulation will be applied with the active side of the coil. As such, all participants will receive a total of 4 minutes of daily TBS. The master randomization list was created by a scientist of the research centre that is not involved in the research project.&#xD;
The patient's study ID code is entered into the device and a software-controlled switch then automatically selects the active or the sham coil for stimulation. The electronic positioning sensor built in the coil for monitoring the coil orientation checks against the entered patient's study ID and will enable the device and start the treatment procedure only if the coil orientation is matching the patient's study ID value.</masking_description>
