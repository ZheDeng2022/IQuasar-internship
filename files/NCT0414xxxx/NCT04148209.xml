    <intervention_model_description>This study is a double-blinded (investigator- and participant-blinded), sponsor-open, randomized, single-ascending oral dose, 4-period crossover, placebo substitution design in 2 interleaving cohorts of healthy adult participants. An additional cohort, enrolling healthy adult participants in up to 4 crossover periods, may be included to permit assessment of any of the following: repeat of a previously administered dose level; studying additional dose levels as dictated by the evaluated safety, tolerability or PK of earlier dose levels; or any other assessment needed to meet the objectives of this study. A cohort enrolling Japanese participants to receive PF-07081532 or placebo in up to 3 periods, may be included.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male and female (of non-childbearing potential) participants must be 18 to 55 years of&#xD;
             age, inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent document (ICD).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male and female participants who are overtly healthy as determined by medical&#xD;
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, including blood pressure&#xD;
             (BP) and pulse rate measurement, temperature, standard 12-lead ECG, telemetry and&#xD;
             laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment&#xD;
             plan, laboratory tests, lifestyle considerations, and other study procedures. Note&#xD;
             that participants enrolling as Japanese must have 4 biological Japanese grandparents&#xD;
             who were born in Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Body mass index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lb).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Capable of giving signed informed consent as described in Appendix 1, which includes&#xD;
             compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the ICD and in the&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,&#xD;
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal (including pancreatitis), cardiovascular, hepatic,&#xD;
             psychiatric, neurological, dermatological, or allergic disease (including drug&#xD;
             allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at the time of&#xD;
             dosing).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy, cholecystectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C;&#xD;
             positive testing at screening for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis&#xD;
             B core antibody (HBcAb), hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) or hepatitis C antibody&#xD;
             (HCVAb).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or multiple endocrine&#xD;
             neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN2), or participants with suspected MTC per the&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the&#xD;
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may&#xD;
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product&#xD;
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the&#xD;
             judgment of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary and herbal supplements within&#xD;
             7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Previous administration with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined&#xD;
             by the local requirement) or 5 half-lives preceding the first dose of investigational&#xD;
             product used in this study (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. A positive urine drug test at screening or admission.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Screening standard 12-lead single ECG that demonstrates clinically relevant&#xD;
             abnormalities that may affect participant safety or interpretation of study results&#xD;
             (eg, baseline Fridericia-corrected QT [QTcF] interval &gt;450 msec, complete left bundle&#xD;
             branch block [LBBB], signs of an acute or indeterminate-age myocardial infarction,&#xD;
             ST-T interval changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia, second- or third-degree&#xD;
             atrioventricular [AV] block, or serious bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Participants with ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at&#xD;
             screening, as assessed by the study-specific laboratory and confirmed by a single&#xD;
             repeat test, if deemed necessary: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine&#xD;
             aminotransferase (ALT) level &gt;=1.25 × upper limit of normal (ULN); total bilirubin&#xD;
             level &gt;=1.5 × ULN, participants with a history of Gilbert's syndrome may have direct&#xD;

             level is &lt;= ULN; TSH &gt; ULN; HbA1c &gt;= 6.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. History of alcohol abuse or binge drinking and/or any other illicit drug use or&#xD;
             dependence within 6 months of Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Use of tobacco/nicotine containing products more than 5 cigarettes/day.&#xD;
