  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal will prospectively assess the social, physical, and emotional recognition&#xD;
      function in participants with synkinesis. It will measure the effectiveness of neuromuscular&#xD;
      retraining therapy to improve muscle coordination compared to chemodenervation, the more&#xD;
      established treatment modality, in a single-blinded, randomized control trial using&#xD;
      clinician- and patient-reported outcomes measures. The hypothesis tested is that participants&#xD;
      undergoing neuromuscular retraining therapy will achieve greater improvement on clinical&#xD;
      outcome measures as compared to participants receiving chemodenervation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this clinical trial, 36 participants undergoing treatment for synkinesis will be enrolled&#xD;
      into one of two treatment arms: chemodenervation or neuromuscular retraining therapy.&#xD;
      Participants can expect to be on study for approximately 8 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who enroll in this mixed methods investigation will be recruited from patients&#xD;
      of the University of Wisconsin Facial Nerve Clinic and also be enrolled in a another study&#xD;
      for assessment [Perception of Emotion Expression in Clinical Populations with Facial&#xD;
      Paralysis, IRB approval 2015-0366].&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Facial nerve paralysis is a devastating event that in up to 30% of cases may result in&#xD;
      chronic weakness and/or the disfiguring condition of synkinesis, a long-lasting muscle&#xD;
      discoordination of facial movement caused by aberrant facial nerve regeneration after facial&#xD;
      nerve paralysis. This is believed to have a detrimental effect on social interactions, mental&#xD;
      health, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuromuscular retraining therapy and ipsilateral chemodenervation into discoordinated muscles&#xD;
      by injection (onabotulinumtoxinA/Botox, Allergan or incobotulinumtoxinA/Xeomin, Merz) are two&#xD;
      common treatments for the abnormal muscle movements found in synkinesis. No study has&#xD;
      compared the effectiveness of these treatment modalities for synkinesis. Retrospective data&#xD;
      including our series at the University of Wisconsin Facial Nerve Clinic show significant&#xD;
      benefit of retraining therapy using clinician- and patient-reported outcome measures.&#xD;
      However, the manner in which this therapy may be optimized for use in treatment of the&#xD;
      sequelae of facial paralysis is unclear. While literature shows beneficial improvement in&#xD;
      outcomes with chemodenervation in prospective studies, no study has explored the&#xD;
      effectiveness of physical therapy for synkinesis in a controlled, prospective manner.&#xD;
      Further, the efficacy of therapy has not been shown to improve recognition and emotional&#xD;
      information interpretation, both thought to be impaired in synkinesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has 3 specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: Determine the effect of neuromuscular retraining or chemodenervation on&#xD;
      clinician-reported and patient-reported outcomes. The primary outcome measure after four and&#xD;
      eight months of treatment will be the clinician-reported Sunnybrook Facial Grading System&#xD;
      (SFGS) scored on participant videos by blinded reviewers. Further, the investigators seek to&#xD;
      measure the efficacy of treatment with existing patient-reported instruments. A correlation&#xD;
      of clinician-reported outcome measure changes to changes in patient-reported instruments with&#xD;
      treatment will be calculated, including the widely utilized disease specific Synkinesis&#xD;
      Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) and Facial Clinimetric Evaluation Scale (FaCE), and with two&#xD;
      disease non-specific instruments, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and&#xD;
      Brief-Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ). The efficacy of our clinical intervention will&#xD;
      be measured with social-perceptual and mental health outcome measurement before and after&#xD;
      treatment (AIM 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: Determine the social, emotional, and functional burden of synkinesis, not captured in&#xD;
      current patient-reported outcome measures as well as effect of treatment. Qualitative&#xD;
      interviews with individual participants collected before treatment, after four months of&#xD;
      treatment, and after eight months of treatment will be analyzed to study the burden of&#xD;
      disease, experience with treatment, and potential differences in both treatments. The primary&#xD;
      outcome is to identify the domains that may be missing from existing patient-reported&#xD;
      measures collected in AIM 1. To do this, findings to assessment domains (i.e. decreased&#xD;
      engagement, negative mood, etc.) in the FaCE, SAQ, and the two disease non-specific&#xD;
      instruments, HADS and BIPQ will be compared. The investigators will then evaluate their&#xD;
      findings based on domains in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System&#xD;
      (PROMIS) measures, an NIH-supported collection of validated and standardized scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 3: Quantify the disruption in social functioning caused by synkinesis using innovative&#xD;
      social-perceptual outcomes and emotion recognition tasks. Prior to treatment, participants&#xD;
      will enroll in IRB Protocol 2015-0366 and complete a series of social functioning and mental&#xD;
      health instruments and emotion expression recognition tasks. Results will be compared to&#xD;
      control participants without facial disability to reveal the social-perceptual impairment&#xD;
      attributable to synkinesis. Repetition of these tasks after four months of either treatment&#xD;
      may show improvement in recognition and emotional information interpretation when compared to&#xD;
      initial measurements.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Sunnybrook Facial Grading System (SFGS) from Baseline to 4 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be videotaped as part of routine care and undergo a blinded SFGS scoring. Scoring is determined by a voluntary movement score (5-items scored from 1-5 where 1 is unable to move and 5 is complete voluntary movement - total range of 5-25, multiplied by 4) minus a resting symmetry score (total of 0-4 where 0 is normal and 4 indicates some asymmetry, multiplied by 5) minus a synkinesis score (5-items scored from 0-3 where 0 is none and 3 is severe). Total possible range of scores is 20-65.</description>

    <measure>Synkinesis Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SAQ is a 9-item questionnaire where each item is scored on a scale from 1-5, 1 is seldom or not at all, and 5 is all of the time, or severely. The total range in possible scores is 9-45 with higher scores indicating more severe facial paralysis symptoms. SAQ scores will be collected as part of routine care throughout the study. Scores will be reported for baseline, 4 months (mid-study), and 8 months (end of study).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Facial Clinimetric Evaluation Scale (FaCE)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The FaCE scale is 15-item self-report survey to assess the symptoms of facial paralysis in the past week. The total possible range of scores is 15-75 where the higher the score, the lesser the symptoms. Scores will be reported for baseline, 4 months (mid-study), and 8 months (end of study).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS instrument measures anxiety and depressive tendency. 7-items are scored for depression with a total score of 0-21 where the higher the score, the more symptoms of depression. 7-items are scored for anxiety with a total score of 0-21 where the higher the score, the more symptoms of anxiety. Scores will be reported for baseline, 4 months (mid-study), and 8 months (end of study).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief-Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BIPQ is a 9-item questionnaire, where the first 8-items are scored from 0-10. To determine a composite score, items 3, 4, and 7 should be reversed scored and added to 1, 2, 5, 6, and 8 (total range of possible scores from 0-80). The higher the score the more threatening the illness is perceived to be. Scores will be reported for baseline, 4 months (mid-study), and 8 months (end of study).</description>
