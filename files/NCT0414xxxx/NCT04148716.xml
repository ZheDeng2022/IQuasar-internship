  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No studies have investigated the expression of miRNAs in Dig-ScS tissues. In the absence of&#xD;
      specific treatment for this frequent impairment in this connectivity, the team proposes to&#xD;
      study miRNA profiles in the esophagus and duodenum to identify new therapeutic targets. The&#xD;
      team is studying the involvement of pro-fibrotic &quot;key&quot; miRNAs called &quot;FibromiRs&quot;, including 3&#xD;
      miRNAs from the DNM3os locus (miR-199a-3p, miR-199a-5p and miR-214 - characterized by the&#xD;
      host laboratory) associated with monitoring the response to TGF-β in fibroblasts and their&#xD;
      potential interaction with pharmacological treatments such as nintedanib and/or PPARγ&#xD;
      agonists. The approach is part of a pilot study that can lead to a larger project after&#xD;
      validation of the hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It also seems interesting to make a precise anatomopathological description with a gradation&#xD;
      of the digestive fibrotic damage in view of the paucity of medical literature in this field&#xD;
