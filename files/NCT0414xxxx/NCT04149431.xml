  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter prospective double blinded placebo-controlled randomized study is designed&#xD;
      to to evaluate clinical efficacy, tolerability and safety of medical product Derinat®,&#xD;
      solution for external and local use 0.25% in acute infections of respiratory system in&#xD;
      children&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized phase III-IV clinical trial in parallel&#xD;
      groups to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Derinat versus Placebo in patients with acute&#xD;
      upper respiratory tract infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include only patients with mild to moderate acute upper respiratory tract&#xD;
      infection, without complications. According to the recommendations of the FDA (Guidance for&#xD;
      Industry Influenza: Developing Drugs for Treatment and/or Prophylaxis) this category of&#xD;
      patients is the best suited for placebo-controlled studies, because the expected serious&#xD;
      risks without treatment are negligible. For studies evaluating the therapy of patients with&#xD;
      mild to moderate acute respiratory upper respiratory tract infection without complications, a&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial design is preferred, as opposed to designs with no less efficacy&#xD;
      (non-inferiority).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study provides for the inclusion of both outpatient patients and patients admitted to&#xD;
      the hospital for epidemiological indications (i.e. patients with acute respiratory infection&#xD;
      of the upper respiratory tract of mild and moderate severity without complications that pose&#xD;
      an epidemic risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of criteria of severity of acute respiratory infection of the upper respiratory&#xD;
      tract will be carried out by Investigator based on standards of diagnosis and treatment of&#xD;
      infectious diseases in children at the stages of medical care, depending on the forms of&#xD;
      severity of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is planned sequentially in 5 age groups. The study begins with the older age group&#xD;
      and as the results on the safety of the drug are obtained, in the course of the study, it is&#xD;
      possible to move to younger age groups&#xD;
