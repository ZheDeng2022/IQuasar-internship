  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, open-label study to assess the safety and efficacy of AVR-RD-02 in&#xD;
      approximately 8 to 16 subjects (male or female) who are ≥18 and ≤45 years of age and&#xD;
      postpubertal at Screening with a confirmed diagnosis of Type 1 Gaucher disease (based on&#xD;
      clinical phenotype, genotyping, and deficient GCase enzyme activity in whole blood).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Five study periods (Screening, Baseline, Pre-transplant, Transplant, and Post-transplant&#xD;
      Follow-up) comprise the study. During the Screening Period (up to 60 days), written informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained and the subject will complete other Screening procedures to confirm&#xD;
      study eligibility. Once study eligibility is confirmed, subjects will enter the Baseline&#xD;
      Period (up to 3 days) during which time assessments will be performed to establish&#xD;
      pre-transplant baseline. Once baseline assessments are complete, the subject will enter the&#xD;
      Pre-transplant Period (approximately 6 to 8 weeks) during which time mobilization, apheresis,&#xD;
      AVR-RD-02 investigational product preparation and testing for release, conditioning regimen&#xD;
      administration, and conditioning washout period will take place. Enzyme replacement therapy&#xD;
      must be discontinued at least 2 weeks before the scheduled transplant day. Following&#xD;
      completion of the Pre-transplant Period, the subject will enter the Transplant Period (1 day)&#xD;
      during which AVR-RD-02 transplant will take place. After AVR-RD-02 transplant, the subject&#xD;
      will enter the Post-transplant Follow-up Period (approximately 52 weeks) during which time&#xD;
      periodic safety and efficacy assessments will be performed to assess measures of safety,&#xD;
      engraftment, and clinical response post-transplant. During the post-transplant period,&#xD;
      subjects will not receive ERT unless pre-specified laboratory and clinical criteria, which&#xD;
      suggest the need for ERT initiation, are met.&#xD;
