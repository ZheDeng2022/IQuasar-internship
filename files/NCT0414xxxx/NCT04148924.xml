  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In palliative care, anxiety and depression in advanced cancer are under evaluated, under&#xD;
      diagnosed and therefore under treated. 5 to 30% of patients present anxious and depressive&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical symptoms are easy to assess. But in palliative care it is important to take care of&#xD;
      moral suffering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, evaluation and management of patient's anxiety and depressive symptoms are difficult&#xD;
      for physicians and caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would like to specifically compare the patient's evaluation of anxious and&#xD;
      depressive symptomatology in palliative care with the evaluation by the physician, the nurse&#xD;
      and the caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then the investigators will try to collect the caregivers's difficulties in the management of&#xD;
      anxious and depressive symptoms.&#xD;

    <description>The Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) will be used for assess anxiety and depression intensity. The ESAS is a self-reported outcome tool assessing the intensity of nine symptoms (pain, tiredness, nausea, depressive mood, anxiety, drowsiness, lack of appetite, wellbeing, and breathlessness). Intensity is rated using 10-point Likert-scales from &quot;no-symptom&quot; (scored 0) to &quot;worst possible symptom&quot; (scored 10)&#xD;
The difference of evaluation for anxiety and depressive symptoms is considere significant when there are two points and more between ESAS patient's and ESAS caregivers'.</description>
