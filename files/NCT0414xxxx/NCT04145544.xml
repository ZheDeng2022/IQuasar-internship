  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ArtiFascia® in&#xD;
      comparison with commercially available dural substitutes in patients requiring Dural repair&#xD;
      following neurosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with planned cranial neurosurgery can take part in this study. During the surgery&#xD;
      the soft membrane that covers the brain (called dura) is likely to be cut and damaged. A&#xD;
      damaged dura can cause a leakage of brain fluids (cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] leakage) and&#xD;
      increase the risk of infections. Sponsor of this study has developed the ArtiFascia®.&#xD;
      ArtiFascia® is a medical synthetic dural substitute that is absorbed by the body. ArtiFascia®&#xD;
      supports the re-formation of a new dura. In addition it has a sealant layer that can reduce&#xD;
      CSF leakage and infection.&#xD;

      A Prospective, randomized, controlled multi-center study of ArtiFascia® Dural repair patch&#xD;
      compared with commercially available dural substitutes- NEOART Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dura mater is a fibrous connective tissue that surrounds the nervous system (brain and&#xD;
      spinal cord) and provides a mechanical barrier that contains the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).&#xD;
      The dura mater may be damaged as a result of trauma or planned surgery. When dural defects&#xD;
      cannot be repaired by primary closure, a dural substitute must be utilized in order to reduce&#xD;
      CSF leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are devices that have been used as dural substitutes. Among the devices that are based&#xD;
      on natural raw materials, collagen-based matrices are widely used. Although collagen was&#xD;
      proven to be biocompatible, using collagen-based materials still possess several limitations&#xD;
      such as CSF leaks. Synthetic dural substitutes are also used to repair dura mater. The most&#xD;
      widely used raw-material for these synthetic products are polyesters - resorbable and&#xD;
      biocompatible polymers. There are several dural substitutes based on synthetic polyesters&#xD;
      that were successfully tested pre-clinically as well as in human studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sponsor of this study has developed the ArtiFascia®. ArtiFascia® is a medical synthetic dural&#xD;
      substitute that is absorbed by the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the study, the patients will have their blood taken and they will undergo neurological&#xD;
      assessment. If they are suitable to participate in the study, and agree to participate, they&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated into one of the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental group (ArtiFascia® device);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group (Other commercially available suturable dural substitutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will undergo a surgery that is identical to the one that was planned by the&#xD;
      surgeon. At the end of the surgery, the investigator will use ArtiFascia® patch or standard&#xD;
      dural substitute to repair the damaged Dura. ArtiFascia® graft will be placed in areas where&#xD;
      the native dural layer was damaged or missing. ArtiFascia® will be applied via a routine and&#xD;
      well-known procedure, using a suturing technique. After implantation, the porous fibrous&#xD;
      structure of ArtiFascia® provides a scaffold, which enables infiltration of fibroblasts and&#xD;
      cells from the intact tissue, ultimately replacing damaged dural tissue. The patch is&#xD;
      expected to resorb within a few months and to be replaced by the native tissue with complete&#xD;
      dural closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the surgery and until patient's release from the hospital the patient's health will be&#xD;
      closely monitored. Before the discharge patients will have to undergo neurological&#xD;
      examination. Patients will be obligated to attend the follow up visits after the surgery at&#xD;
      the dates scheduled by the attending physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each of the visits physical and neurological examinations will be performed. Radiographic&#xD;
      Evaluation (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) will be performed also 6 months post operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 90 patients will be enrolled and implanted with test or control device. Up to 10&#xD;
      centers in Europe and Israel are planned to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be achieved when the final study subject has completed a 6-months&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
