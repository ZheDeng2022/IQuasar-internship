      To assess the feasibility of coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) and fractional&#xD;
      flow reserve derived from CTA (FFRCT) to replace invasive coronary angiography (ICA) as a&#xD;
      surgical guidance method for planning and execution of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) in&#xD;
      patients with 3-vessel disease with or without left main disease. The FASTTRACK CABG study is&#xD;
      an investigator-initiated single-arm, multicentre, prospective, proof-of-concept, and&#xD;
      first-in-man study with feasibility and safety analysis. Surgical revascularization strategy&#xD;
      and treatment planning will be solely based on coronary CTA and FFRCT without knowledge of&#xD;
      the anatomy defined otherwise by ICA that will be viewed and analyzed only by the&#xD;
      conventional heart team. Clinical follow-up visit including coronary CTA will be performed 30&#xD;
      days after CABG in order to assess graft patency and adequacy of the revascularization with&#xD;
      respect to the surgical planning based on non-invasive imaging with functional assessment and&#xD;
      compared to ICA. Primary feasibility endpoint is CABG planning and execution solely based on&#xD;
      coronary CTA in 114 patients. Primary safety endpoint based on 30-day coronary CTA is graft&#xD;
      assessment either at the ostium, in the shaft or at the anastomoses of each individual graft&#xD;
      either single or sequential. The FASTTRACK CABG study is the first study to assess safety and&#xD;
      feasibility of planning and execution of surgical revascularization in patients with complex&#xD;
      coronary artery disease, solely based on coronary CTA combined with FFRCT.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients referred to CABG treatment (as assessed by 'conventional heart team') having&#xD;
             at the time of the conventional heart team evaluation at least 1 de novo stenotic&#xD;
             lesion (with a visually assessed DS with ≥ 50%) in all 3 major epicardial territories&#xD;
             [left anterior descending (LAD) and/or side branch, left circumflex artery (LCX)&#xD;
             and/or side branch, right coronary artery (RCA) and/or side branch] supplying viable&#xD;
             myocardium with or without left main involvement&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with hypoplastic RCA with absence of descending posterior and presence of a&#xD;
             lesion in the LAD and LCX territories may be included in the trial as a 3VD&#xD;
             equivalent. Ostial LAD plus ostial LCX may be included in the trial as a left main&#xD;
             equivalent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Distal vessel size should be at least 1.5 mm in diameter as visually assessed in the&#xD;
             diagnostic angiogram (as requested by the surgeons)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with silent ischemia, chronic coronary syndrome or stabilized acute coronary&#xD;
             syndrome with normalized (stable or decreasing) cardiac biomarker values. For patients&#xD;
             showing elevated troponin (cTn) (e.g. non-ST elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI]&#xD;
             patients) at baseline (within 24h pre-CABG) an additional blood sample must be&#xD;
             collected prior to CABG to confirm that: a) hs-cTn or troponin I or T levels are&#xD;
             stable, i.e. the value should be within 20% range of the value found in the first&#xD;
             sample at baseline, or have dropped 25; b) creatine kinase-muscle/brain (CK-MB) and&#xD;
             creatine kinase (CK) levels are within normal range. If hs-cTn or troponin I or T&#xD;
             levels are stable or have dropped, or the CK-MB and CK levels are within normal ranges&#xD;
             and the ECG is normal, patients may be included in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All anatomical SYNTAX Scores are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are amenable to coronary CTA (e.g. no claustrophobia, high heart rate not&#xD;
             amenable to beta-blockers, poor renal function, etc., up to the discretion of the&#xD;
             investigator)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients have been informed of the nature of the study and agree to its provisions and&#xD;
             have provided written informed consent as approved by the Ethical Committee of the&#xD;
             respective clinical site&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients agree to 1-month follow-up visit including coronary CTA&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Unable to give informed consent&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior PCI or CABG; history of coronary stent implantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of evolving or ongoing ST-elevation MI (STEMI) on ECG and/or elevated cardiac&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known renal insufficiency (e.g. serum creatinine &gt;2.5mg/dL, or creatinine clearance&#xD;
             ≤30 mL/min), or need for dialysis, or acute kidney failure (as per physician judgment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant cardiac valve disease requiring surgical therapy (repair or replacement)&#xD;
             and/or aneurysmectomy&#xD;
