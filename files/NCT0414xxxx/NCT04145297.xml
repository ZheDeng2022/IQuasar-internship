      This is an open-label Phase I basket trial designed to determine the phase 2 recommended dose&#xD;
      of ulixertinib in combination hydroxychloroquine. The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be&#xD;
      determined by using a standard 3+3 dose-escalation design with a minimum of 3 evaluable&#xD;
      subjects accrued to dose level one and two. Should dose level one be deemed intolerable,&#xD;
      enrollment will proceed at dose level 0. The RP2D will be affirmed according to the rules of&#xD;
      the 3+3 dose-escalation scheme&#xD;
