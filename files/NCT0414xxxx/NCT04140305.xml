  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, longitudinal, single-arm, open-label study to describe the change from&#xD;
      baseline in cognitive processing speed, measured by the SDMT, in subjects with RMS treated&#xD;
      with ozanimod HCl 1 mg at 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive orally administered ozanimod HCl 1 mg. The primary efficacy&#xD;
      endpoint is the proportion of subjects with a clinically meaningful increase in raw score of&#xD;
      ≥ 4 points or 10% from baseline (improved). The treatment period is 36 months. For all&#xD;
      subjects who finish the subject and for those who discontinue, there will be a 30-day (± 15&#xD;
      days) and a 90-day (± 10 days) Safety Follow-up Visit. There is no planned protocol extension&#xD;
      following the end of the study. Approximately 250 subjects with RMS will be recruited for&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with RMS will be enrolled in this study if they have received ≤ 1 DMT, have an EDSS&#xD;
      ≤ 3.5, and have been diagnosed with RMS within 5 years of study entry. The Investigator will&#xD;
      be responsible for the overall conduct of the study at the site, confirmation of subject&#xD;
      eligibility, routine study subject clinical management including for MS relapses, and&#xD;
      management of AEs.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Following are some criteria that would exclude the subject from participation. Additional&#xD;

             pulmonary disease [COPD]) may be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has a presence of other neurologic disorders to explain the progressive&#xD;
             neurologic disability (as defined in the key inclusion criteria) or that might affect&#xD;
             cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has a visual or other sensorimotor impairment likely to confound test&#xD;
             performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has a presence of &gt; 10 GdE lesions on the Baseline brain MRI scan.&#xD;
