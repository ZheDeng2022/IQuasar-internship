  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label extension study aimed to assess long-term safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of SPN-812 when administered alone or in conjunction with an Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA)-approved Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) medication in&#xD;
      the treatment of ADHD in adult subjects who completed a blinded study of SPN-812 (812P306).&#xD;
      Subjects initiate SPN-812 dosing at 200 mg/day once daily (QD) during first 2 weeks. At or&#xD;
      after Visit 2 (Week 2), per the Investigator's discretion and based on Investigator's&#xD;
      assessment of subject's clinical response and tolerability, the dose of SPN-812 can be&#xD;
      titrated up or tapered down in increments of 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, 150 mg/day, or 200 mg/day&#xD;
      per week to a target dose within the ranges between 200 and 600 mg/day. Additionally, after&#xD;
      12 weeks of dosing (after Visit 4), at the discretion of the Investigator and based on&#xD;
      subject's clinical response, the optimized dose of SPN-812 may be supplemented with an&#xD;
      adjunctive FDA-approved stimulant treatment. Total treatment duration per subject from Visit&#xD;
      1 to Visit 22 (end of study) is approximately 3 years (156 weeks ± 1 week) or until SPN-812&#xD;
      becomes commercially available.&#xD;
