      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate sufficiency of the vaccine seroresponse to meningococcal serogroups A, C, W,&#xD;
      and Y following administration of a single dose of Meningococcal Polysaccharide (Serogroups&#xD;
      A, C, Y, and W 135) Tetanus Toxoid (MenACYW) Conjugate vaccine to Group 1 participants (who&#xD;
      received primary vaccination with Menomune vaccine greater than or equal to [&gt;= 3] years&#xD;
      earlier at &gt;= 56 years of age in Study MET49).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective 1 - To demonstrate sufficiency of the vaccine seroresponse to&#xD;
      meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y following administration of a single dose of MenACYW&#xD;
      Conjugate vaccine to Group 2 participants (who received primary vaccination with MenACYW&#xD;
      Conjugate vaccine &gt;= 3 years earlier at &gt;= 56 years of age in Study MET49).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective 2 - To describe vaccine seroresponse rates with respect to serogroups A,&#xD;
      C, W, and Y in serum specimens collected 6 days (window, 5-7) post-vaccination in&#xD;
      approximately 60 participants from Group 1 (Menomune-primed) and approximately 60&#xD;
      participants from Group 2 (MenACYW Conjugate vaccine-primed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective 3 - To describe antibody persistence &gt;= 3 years after primary vaccination&#xD;
      with Menomune vaccine or MenACYW Conjugate vaccine for participants from all groups.&#xD;

      Study duration per participant in Group 1 and Group 2 is approximately 30 days including: 1&#xD;
      day of screening and vaccination, a phone call and a safety-follow up/end of study visit at&#xD;
      Day 8 and Day 30 after vaccine administration, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration per participant in Group 3 and 4 is approximately 2 years and 30 days&#xD;
      including: 1 day of screening, 1 day of vaccination 2 years later, a phone call and a&#xD;
      safety-follow up/end of study visit at Day 8 and Day 30 after vaccine administration,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration per participant in Group 5 and 6 is 1 day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessment includes solicited reactions within 7 days after vaccination, unsolicited&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse event of special interest&#xD;
      (AESI)s throughout the study &quot;active phase&quot; (i.e., period of time from revaccination with&#xD;
      MenACYW Conjugate vaccine to the end of the short-term [i.e., ~30 days] follow-up after the&#xD;
      vaccination).&#xD;

    <description>GMTs of antibodies against meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y 135 were measured by hSBA. Titers are expressed in terms of 1/dilution. At Baseline, Group 1 was equivalent to Group 3 (both groups were Menomune-primed in MET49) and Group 2 was equivalent to Group 4 (both groups were MenACYW Conjugate Vaccine-primed in MET49), therefore it was planned to collect and present pooled data of Groups 1 and 3 and Groups 2 and 4 for Day 0 (pre-vaccination) in this outcome measure. Here, &quot;0&quot; in the number analyzed field for Day 30 signifies that data were not planned to be collected and analyzed for Groups 3 and 4 participants as pre-specified in the protocol.</description>

        <description>GMTs of antibodies against meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y 135 were measured by hSBA. Titers are expressed in terms of 1/dilution. At Baseline, Group 1 was equivalent to Group 3 (both groups were Menomune-primed in MET49) and Group 2 was equivalent to Group 4 (both groups were MenACYW Conjugate Vaccine-primed in MET49), therefore it was planned to collect and present pooled data of Groups 1 and 3 and Groups 2 and 4 for Day 0 (pre-vaccination) in this outcome measure.

At Baseline, Group 1 was equivalent to Group 3 (both groups were Menomune-primed in MET49) and Group 2 was equivalent to Group 4 (both groups were MenACYW Conjugate Vaccine-primed in MET49), therefore it was planned to collect and present pooled data of Groups 1 and 3 and Groups 2 and 4 for Day 0 (pre-vaccination) in this outcome measure.</population>

          <description>Antibody titers against meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y were measured by hSBA.</description>
          <population>Analysis was performed on FAS population. At Baseline, Group 1 was equivalent to Group 3 (both groups were Menomune-primed in MET49) and Group 2 was equivalent to Group 4 (both groups were MenACYW Conjugate Vaccine-primed in MET49), therefore it was planned to collect and present pooled data of Groups 1 and 3 and Groups 2 and 4 for Day 0 (pre-vaccination) in this outcome measure.</population>
