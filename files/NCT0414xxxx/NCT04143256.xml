      An Open-Label, Multi-Center Study to Evaluate Selected Constituents in the Exhaled Breath&#xD;
      Samples From the Use of JUUL Nicotine Salt Pod System Product (5% and 3% Virginia Tobacco,&#xD;
      Mint, Mango, Menthol) Users and Conventional Cigarettes (Non-Menthol and Menthol Flavors)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the baseline-adjusted level of selected&#xD;
      constituents in the exhaled breath sample (EBS) between the two JUUL NSPS products (5% vs 3%&#xD;
      nicotine by weight) for Virginia Tobacco, Mint, Mango and Menthol flavor and to compare the&#xD;
      change in absolute level of selected constituents in EBS before and after the use of JUUL&#xD;
      NSPS (5% and 3% nicotine by weight; Virginia Tobacco, Mint, Mango, Menthol flavors) to the&#xD;
      change in absolute level of selected constituents before and after the use of menthol and&#xD;
      non-menthol cigarettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened for participation in the trial up to 28 days before Day 1. Along&#xD;
      with screening procedures, all subjects will receive training on EBS collection procedures.&#xD;
      All subjects will be further trained on the CPS using a training video and site instructions.&#xD;
      Trained subjects will have the opportunity to try the JUUL NSPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be scheduled for a Day 1 clinic visit. Within 24 to 48 hours prior to&#xD;
      Check-in, the clinic staff will provide a courtesy phone call to subjects to remind them to&#xD;
      abstain from the use of alcohol, any nicotine-containing products and mint/mentholated&#xD;
      products for at least 12 hours prior and xanthines/caffeine for at least 24 hours prior to&#xD;
      screening and Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of the check-in events, including re-instruction on the EBS sample&#xD;
      collection technique and CPS instructions, subjects will participate in the exhaled breath&#xD;
      collection test sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups I - IV will complete two periods of baseline and test sample collections with a 3-hour&#xD;
      break in between each period. Each period will consist of two baseline samples (the first for&#xD;
      analysis of nicotine, propylene glycol and glycerin and the second for analysis of&#xD;
      acetaldehyde, acrolein, benzoic acid, formaldehyde, and menthol), followed by product use,&#xD;
      and then two test samples (similar to baseline). Exhaled CO will be measured before the first&#xD;
      baseline sample, after the second baseline sample, before the first test sample and after the&#xD;
      second test sample. Pods used during the test sessions will be weighed before and after use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups V and VI will complete only one period of baseline and test sample collections,&#xD;
      consisting of two baseline sample collections and two test sample collections similar to that&#xD;
      noted above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up phone call with subjects will be made the day after Check-out (or early&#xD;
      withdrawal). Provided there are no adverse events which require further attention, the&#xD;
      subject's participation in the trial will be complete.&#xD;
