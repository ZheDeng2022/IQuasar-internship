    <textblock>
      Objective of this study is to investigate the bystanders' exposure to e-cigarette emissions&#xD;
      in controlled conditions in confined settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: a cross-sectional experimental study developed in two settings: a car and a room. The&#xD;
      experimental study will be replicated 5 times in each setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three volunteers will be enrolled: 2 non-users of e-cigarettes (and non-smokers of any&#xD;
      tobacco or nicotine product) and 1 exclusive e-cigarette user (not using any other tobacco or&#xD;
      nicotine product) to create aerosol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In brief, during the experimental session the e-cigarette user will be asked to use&#xD;
      electronic cigarette during 30 minutes and two non-smokers will sit next to the user.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual exposure will be measured through saliva sample collection and irritation symptoms&#xD;
      questionnaire to be collected 4 times: before exposure, just after 30 minutes of exposure, 30&#xD;
      minutes after the end of exposure and 3 hours after the end of exposure. Moreover,&#xD;
      environmental exposure will be measured prior (5 min), during (30 min) and after (5 min) the&#xD;
      exposure; particulate matter and airborne nicotine concentrations will be measure for this&#xD;
      purpose.&#xD;

      Objective: to investigate the bystanders' exposure to e-cigarette emissions in controlled&#xD;
      conditions in confined settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: this is a cross-sectional experimental study developed in two settings: a car&#xD;
      and a room. The experimental study will be replicated 5 times in each setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to notice that this study is an ad hoc experiment with volunteers and&#xD;
      therefore it is not a clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 3 volunteers will be enrolled: 2 non-users of e-cigarettes (and non-smokers&#xD;
      of any tobacco or nicotine product) and 1 exclusive e-cigarette user (not using any other&#xD;
      tobacco or nicotine product). Participants will be recruited through personal contacts of the&#xD;
      research team and, if necessary, through social networks. All volunteers will receive a&#xD;
      compensation for their participation in all replicates in both settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the participation of three volunteers will be required:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Two healthy non-smokers, one male and one female, to be exposed to e-cigarette emissions&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. One healthy e-cigarette user, to create the e-cigarette exposure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each volunteer will be given appropriate information about the experiment, including its&#xD;
      potential health effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment Conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to investigate the passive exposure to the aerosol produced by e-cigarette use in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers in controlled conditions, the following procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One week prior to the experiments a briefing session will be conducted inviting all&#xD;
           three participants to provide them detailed information about the study and to explain&#xD;
           the process of the experiment. During this day the information sheet will be provided to&#xD;
           the participants and those willing to participate will sign a written consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Similar-to-real-life exposure to e-cigarette aerosol will be emulated by the use of one&#xD;
           e-cigarette in each of the confined spaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The experiment will be done in conditions with a relative humidity lower than 85% to&#xD;
           obtain reliable measurements of airborne markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any system of ventilation, heating or air conditioning during the experiment will be&#xD;
           avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During different periods of time, environmental and biological samples will be collected&#xD;
           to objectively measure passive exposure to aerosol produced by the use of the&#xD;
           e-cigarette.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some observational information regarding the environmental conditions, e-cigarette use&#xD;
           and potential short-term health effects will be also gathered during the experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The experiment will be replicated in 5 consecutive days in each setting, from Monday to&#xD;
           Friday. After each daily replication, the setting will be ventilated and will be only&#xD;
           used for the following replication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First conduct the experiment in the car will be conducted and after at least 10 days the&#xD;
           experiment in the room will be performed, to assure no biological exposure will remain&#xD;
           in the bodies of non-smoker participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Particular conditions in the car&#xD;
&#xD;
      A similar-to-real-life exposure to e-cigarette aerosol will be emulated in a medium-size car&#xD;
      by the use of one e-cigarette.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The experiment will include a driver, 1 e-cigarette user, 2 non-smokers and a&#xD;
           researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All the procedures will last 40 minutes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. 5 minutes of baseline environmental and biological measurements. During this period&#xD;
                the car will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. 30 minutes of exposure to aerosol produced by an e-cigarette: the e-cigarette user&#xD;
                will be asked to use the e-cigarette ad libitum. During this period, environmental&#xD;
                measurements will be done and observational data will be collected. The car will be&#xD;
                running continuously on a short circuit of 1.3 km at a speed of up to 70 km/h, with&#xD;
                the front windows semi-open and the rear windows closed. During this period the car&#xD;
                will be moving.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. 5 minutes of environmental measurement as an indicator of residual exposure. A&#xD;
                biological measurement will be also done during these 5 mins. During this period&#xD;
                the car will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Particular conditions in the room&#xD;
&#xD;
      A similar-to-real-life exposure to e-cigarette aerosol will be emulated in a room of about&#xD;
      20-30 m3 by the use of one e-cigarette.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The experiment will include 1 e-cigarette user, 2 non-smokers and a researcher, who will&#xD;
           be seated around a table.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All the procedures will last 40 minutes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. 5 minutes of baseline environmental and biological measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. 30 minutes of exposure to aerosol produced by an e-cigarette: the e-cigarette user&#xD;
                will be asked to use the e-cigarette ad libitum. During this period, environmental&#xD;
                measurements will be done and observational data will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. 5 minutes of environmental measurement as an indicator of residual exposure. A&#xD;
                biological measurement will be also done during these 5 mins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the experiments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the experiments are finished, the participants will move to a different room and they&#xD;
      will remain there for additional 3 hours. It will not be allowed to use e-cigarette during&#xD;
      that period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological measurements will be taken from all participants at 30 minutes and at 3 hours&#xD;
      after finishing the experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Environmental measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Airborne nicotine. Nicotine will be collected using a sampler device of 37 mm in diameter&#xD;
      containing a filter treated with sodium bisulphate. The sampler device will be connected to&#xD;
      an air pump (flow 3 L/min) for active measurement. Two nicotine monitors will be used during&#xD;
      the experiments in the car and two during the experiment in the room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Particulate matter: Real-time measurement of airborne PM2.5 concentration will be done with a&#xD;
      TSI SidePak AM510 at 1-sec interval and 10-min interval, respectively. Data will be&#xD;
      downloaded to a local computer from internal storage for further data analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva sample: Saliva samples will be collected from all participants four times in each&#xD;
      experiment session: while measuring baseline environmental measurements, just at the end of&#xD;
      the proper experiment period (exposure times), after 30 min and after 3 h of the exposure&#xD;
      period. Saliva samples will be prepared into 2 aliquots for storage at -20 Cº at ICO. At the&#xD;
      end of all the experiments saliva samples will be analysed to determine the concentration of&#xD;
      nicotine and its main metabolites such as cotinine, 3'-OH-cotinine and nornicotine (in&#xD;
      nl/mL), tobacco-specific nitrosamines (NNN, NNK and NNAL, in pg/mL), propylene glycol and&#xD;
      glycerol (in nmol/mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data from questionnaires, environmental measurements and saliva analysis will be managed&#xD;
      by researchers from the Tobacco Control Unit (UCT) at the Catalan Institute of Oncology&#xD;
      (ICO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected in paper and will be digitalised in a protected database. All the&#xD;
      samples will have a unique code to be linked with the already anonymised data from the&#xD;
      questionnaires, and this data will be stored in the same database. Only a selected number of&#xD;
      pre-designated members of the research team (who will sign a confidentiality document) will&#xD;
      have access to the database and the freezer with the biological samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selected personal data, including the names of respondents, will be collected separately to&#xD;
      enable quality assurance procedures and to allow participants' willingness to withdraw from&#xD;
      participation in the study to have their records deleted from the database. This information&#xD;
      will remain dissociated from the specific information generated in the experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The database will be held securely on a password-protected file server at ICO. The Principal&#xD;
      Investigator, Dr Fernández, will designate a limited number of researchers from the UCT team&#xD;
      to access this database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent: All participants taking part in the study will be properly informed orally&#xD;
      and a written information sheet will be delivered to them. Researchers will answer all the&#xD;
      questions that could arise during the brief session, as well as information regarding the&#xD;
      following issues:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The purpose of the information to be collected, including aims, methods and implications&#xD;
           of the research;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The extent to which personal data is used and accessed by the researchers (it will be&#xD;
           made clear that all data pertaining to them is stored and handled in an anonymous manner&#xD;
           using encrypted -not personally identifiable- codes);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The participant's right to access personal data and/or study data; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The participant's right to withdraw from participation in the study, at any point,&#xD;
           without consequences and without obligation of explanation or justification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolling in the study will be voluntary and signing a written informed consent will be&#xD;
      mandatory. All original written informed consents will be stored in accordance with the&#xD;
      Spanish legislation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For their participation in the whole study (5 experiments in a car and 5 experiments in a&#xD;
      room), each participant will be compensated. They will be asked to sign a compensation&#xD;
      receipt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to personal data and withdrawal from the study: It will be made clear, orally and in&#xD;
      the information sheet, that the subjects are completely free to withdraw their records from&#xD;
      participation in the study, regardless of having had compensation for their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consent given by participants can be withdrawn at any time, without any explanation or&#xD;
      justification. In this case, all data pertaining to the subjects will be destroyed, both in&#xD;
      paper and digital supports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human cells/tissues: Biological samples (saliva) will be collected after obtaining informed&#xD;
      consent, in which it will be specified that these samples will be used only for the study&#xD;
      aims, this is, the measurement of markers of tobacco-related products and other markers of&#xD;
      exposure to aerosols from e-cigarettes, but not for the use of the cells or genetic material&#xD;
      also contained in the saliva. The remaining saliva will be stored at the certified biobank&#xD;
      (at ICO) and can be used for future determinations of compounds from cigarettes and&#xD;
      e-cigarettes related to the objectives of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Privacy and confidentiality: All personal information will be treated as confidential and&#xD;
      will be stored in agreement with the current laws. The study will be conducted in accordance&#xD;
      with the Good Clinical Practice Guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and the current&#xD;
      legal regulation about the confidentiality of data in the European Union (Regulation EU&#xD;
      2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Environmental protection and safety: This study will require some exposure from the&#xD;
      participants; however, this exposure will be minimal and the participants will not be forced&#xD;
      to be exposed if they expressed their disagreement. Similarly, the researchers will be also&#xD;
      exposed to emissions from e-cigarettes in these confined spaces. All the researchers&#xD;
      participating in the study will be informed and will sign a written consent for their&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidental findings: In case that while reviewing the results from the chemical analysis of&#xD;
      nicotine metabolites in saliva any unexpected abnormality observed (what is called an&#xD;
      &quot;incidental finding&quot;), the participant will be informed about it. Depending on the type of&#xD;
      incidental finding, the participant will be contacted by mail or by phone. The participant&#xD;
      does not have an option to decline information about an incidental finding. The costs for any&#xD;
      care that will be needed to diagnose or treat an incidental finding would not be paid for the&#xD;
      research study. These costs would be the responsibility of the participant.&#xD;
