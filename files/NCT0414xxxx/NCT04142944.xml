      Observational, within-subject, crossover study&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the impact of Dexcom G6 RT-CGM with a predictive hypoglycaemia alert function on&#xD;
      the frequency, duration and severity of hypoglycaemia occurring before, during and after&#xD;
      regular physical activity in people with type 1 diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust have established the multi-disciplinary Imperial&#xD;
      Physical Activity and Diabetes (IPAD) clinic to empower, educate and enable people with&#xD;
      diabetes to manage their blood glucose when they undertake physical activity. The&#xD;
      investigator utilise the skills and expertise of a consultant diabetologist, a diabetes&#xD;
      dietitian, a consultant in sports &amp; exercise medicine, and a diabetes specialist nurse with&#xD;
      expertise in diabetes technology. The investigator have access to diagnostic &amp; therapeutic&#xD;
      radiology, physiotherapy and psychology services.&#xD;

      CLINIC VISIT 1: Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following informed consent study participants will give a full medical and medication&#xD;
      history. Venous blood tests will be taken to assess HbA1c and renal function. C-peptide will&#xD;
      be measured in participants who have not had previous tests to confirm T1DM diagnosis.. Women&#xD;
      of childbearing age will have a urine pregnancy test. An ECG will be performed in&#xD;
      participants with longstanding Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (&gt;10 years) or participants who are&#xD;
      &gt;40 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINIC VISIT 2: Run-in&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants meet the inclusion criteria they will be enrolled on to the study, within a&#xD;
      month of screening and at a time that is convenient to them. For the 10 days of the run-in&#xD;
      period, participants CGM will be blinded, meaning that they will be wearing the CGM sensor&#xD;
      but will not see any of the glucose data. They will wear a sensor which will be attached to a&#xD;
      transmitter which will send data to a Dexcom receiver. The receiver must be kept within 6&#xD;
      meters of the transmitter most of the time as the transmitter can only store three hours of&#xD;
      data. After the run in they will be able to use the Smartphone app instead of carrying the&#xD;
      receiver if they wish. They will be taught to insert the sensor at the run-in visit, and&#xD;
      provided with spares in case of sensor failure. Participants will be instructed to test their&#xD;
      capillary blood glucose levels and self-manage their type 1 diabetes as normal during the&#xD;
      run-in period. The run in phase will last 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on food intake, and insulin usage will be collected for the full duration of the study&#xD;
      using a smart phone app (mySugr) in those treated with insulin injections, or using the&#xD;
      built-in system in the pumps of those using insulin pump therapy. Both the app and the&#xD;
      insulin pumps allow participants to input their own insulin doses, or use the bolus&#xD;
      calculator which uses the participant's individual insulin:carbohydrate ratio to help&#xD;
      calculate insulin doses based on the carbohydrate intake. There will be no change in&#xD;
      participants' insulin dosing, and participants will make all their insulin dosing decisions&#xD;
      themselves, based on their pre-study insulin:carbohydrate ratios. The advantage of using the&#xD;
      app or bolus advisor is that the tracking of the insulin action (which lasts for 3-5 hours)&#xD;
      allows participants to see how much insulin is still active. This is important when the CGM&#xD;
      is unblinded as it can prevent participants giving additional insulin unnecessarily when they&#xD;
      see their blood glucose levels on the CGM. Those using insulin injections will be provided&#xD;
      with a smart insulin pen, a device similar to the participants' usual insulin delivery device&#xD;
      use, but with a memory capable of storing dosing data until the end of the study (Inpen,&#xD;
      produced by Companion Medical).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A structured education refresher focusing on carbohydrate counting, hypoglycaemia avoidance,&#xD;
      recognition, and management, insulin action and the theory and practicalities of CGM will be&#xD;
      provided. All education will be delivered by the research dietitian with a checklist of&#xD;
      topics that are provided as part of routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will wear a GPS-enabled sports watch with built-in heart rate monitor (Garmin&#xD;
      Forerunner 935) for the entire duration of the study. Participants will be asked to download&#xD;
      the Garmin Connect App for data from the Garmin watch to be transmitted to the app via&#xD;
      Bluetooth. They will be provided with anonymised log in details for the app and a charger for&#xD;
      the watch. Volunteers will be asked to record their activity type and perceived physical&#xD;
      exertion after every session of exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life data will be collected by mixed quantitative and qualitative methodologies.&#xD;
      Validated questionnaires (HFS-II, Gold, RPAQ, DDS17) will be used to assess fear of&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia, hypoglycaemia awareness, recent physical activity and diabetes distress. The&#xD;
      investigator will undertake a short interview about the participants perceptions and&#xD;
      experience of CGM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINIC VISIT 3: Randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten days after visit 2, participants will attend the research clinic for the randomisation&#xD;
      appointment. The CGM, Garmin data and insulin bolus data (from mysugr or insulin pump) will&#xD;
      be downloaded. Participants will have their weight and body composition measured using&#xD;
      electrical impedance scales. Participants will start using their CGM unblinded, so that they&#xD;
      are able to view their glucose levels either on the receiver or on the Dexcom app on their&#xD;
      smartphones, depending on choice. Participants will be randomised to real-time continuous&#xD;
      glucose monitoring with Predictive Hypoglycaemia Alert Algorithm enabled (ON group) or&#xD;
      real-time continuous glucose monitoring with Predictive Hypoglycaemia Alert Algorithm&#xD;
      disabled (OFF group). Randomisation will be done using sealedenvelope.com and stratified by&#xD;
      insulin delivery modality and previous CGM experience. Participants will be provided with&#xD;
      sensors for the rest of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed to test their capillary blood glucose if symptoms of hypo- or&#xD;
      hyperglycaemia occur, in case of sensor failure or if the sensor glucose is out of the&#xD;
      desired range, in line with the device license. Participants will change sensor every ten&#xD;
      days (or sooner in the event of sensor failure). Low glucose alert settings will be&#xD;
      standardised at 4.4 mmol/L (80mg/dL) for all participants at the start of the study and can&#xD;
      be reduced to 4 mmol/L (70mg/dL) at week 2 during the telephone visit depending on&#xD;
      participant preference. High glucose alerts may be personalised. Participants will be&#xD;
      provided with a contact number for technical support but insulin titration decisions will be&#xD;
      made by the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two weeks after visit 3 and 4, all participants will receive a telephone call from the&#xD;
      research dietitian to discuss any queries they have regarding the CGM, sports watch or any&#xD;
      other element of the study. Those in the ON group will also be able to adjust the predictive&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia alert level from 4.4 mmol/L (80mg/dL) to 4 mmol/L (70mg/dL) if preferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study period will last 40 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINIC VISIT 4: Cross-over&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty days after visit 3, participants will attend the research clinic and be switched onto&#xD;
      the opposite intervention (ON/OFF) for the second phase of the study, which will last 40&#xD;
      days. Participants will continue to use the mySugr app or bolus advisor on their pumps, the&#xD;
      Garmin watch and inpen or pump. The CGM, Garmin data and bolus data from mysugr will all be&#xD;
      downloaded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires assessing fear of hypoglycaemia, hypoglycaemia awareness, recent physical&#xD;
      activity and diabetes distress will be repeated, as well as a short CGM interview on&#xD;
      perceptions and experience of CGM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT 5: End of study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty days after visit 4, and 90 days after the start of the study, the study will end. All&#xD;
      participants will be reviewed by the research dietitian at the research clinic for data to be&#xD;
      collected and uploaded and to address any issues arising from the study. Smart insulin pens,&#xD;
      G6 CGM and garmin watches will be returned and downloaded. Insulin pumps, mysugr apps and&#xD;
      blood glucose meters will also be downloaded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CSV files will be downloaded from mySugr. There is no patient identifiable information in the&#xD;
      CSV file. Garmin data is sent from phone to the Garmin connect app via Bluetooth, without any&#xD;
      identifiable information, and CSV files can be downloaded from Garmin connect with a secure&#xD;
      login. There is no patient data on the inpen, which will be downloaded onto Imperial College&#xD;
      London computers, and will be associated with the anonymous email containing the study ID&#xD;
      number for each participant. Insulin pumps and blood glucose meters will be downloaded onto&#xD;
      NHS computers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HbA1c will be rechecked at this point via venous blood tests. Weight and body composition&#xD;
      measurements will also be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validated questionnaires to assess fear of hypoglycaemia, hypoglycaemia awareness, recent&#xD;
      physical activity and diabetes distress, will be repeated. A short interview about the&#xD;
      participants perceptions and experience of CGM will be undertaken.&#xD;
