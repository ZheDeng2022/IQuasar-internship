  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several types of human cells convert cholesterol into other molecules, including oxysterols.&#xD;
      Oxysterols can promote breast cancer growth and help tumours to spread. Some breast cancer&#xD;
      types recruit other cells (host cells) able to produce oxysterols within the local cancer&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How these other cells help breast tumours metastasize or resist chemotherapy is not well&#xD;
      understood, but epidemiological and clinical studies suggest elevated LDL-C is associated&#xD;
      with worse survival, poorer response to therapy and an increased propensity for disease&#xD;
      relapse in breast cancer patients. In this trial the investigators will test how an LDL-C&#xD;
      lowering dietary intervention (using commercially available phytosterol added food products),&#xD;
      alters the ability of non-cancer cells (adipocytes, fibroblasts and macrophages) collected&#xD;
      from high LDL-C volunteers to change chemotherapy response and metastatic process in breast&#xD;
      cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, volunteers with high LDL-C levels will be recruited by the University of&#xD;
      Leeds, and divided randomly into two arms that cross over. The experimental period (yogurt&#xD;
      drink enriched with phytosterols) and placebo period (non-enriched yogurt drink) will each&#xD;
      last for 8 weeks, alternated with a 4 weeks of wash-out period. Samples will be collected 4&#xD;
      times (week-0, week-8, week-12, week-20) during the study and will include blood, white blood&#xD;
      cells (macrophages), and fat tissue cells. Measurements will include oxysterol, LDL-C and&#xD;
      phytosterol concentrations (volunteers' serum/plasma, media from the host cells/breast cancer&#xD;
      experimental culture) and how the host cells alter the behaviour of cancer cells in the&#xD;
      laboratory.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delivery of cholesterol to extra-hepatic tissues by LDL has a profound impact on different&#xD;
      host cell types, many of which themselves have been implicated in BCa metastasis and&#xD;
      chemoresistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite accumulating data, it is still unknown how host-cells help breast tumours metastasise&#xD;
      or evade chemotherapy. The molecular link between cholesterol and metastasis may involve the&#xD;
      enzymatic hydroxylation (an intermediate step in bile acid synthesis) of cholesterol. The&#xD;
      synthesis and secretion of oxysterols into the tumour microenvironment and this is&#xD;
      exacerbated in individuals with elevated LDL-cholesterol. This process, occurring largely in&#xD;
      macrophages, adipocytes and fibroblasts, leads to biosynthesis and cellular export of&#xD;
      oxysterols , which drive DNA mutations through oxidative stress, confer resistance to&#xD;
      chemotherapy, enhance BCa growth and metastasis, and are elevated in serum of BCa patients at&#xD;
      metastatic relapse. Our pilot data show non-cancer host-cells activate oxysterols signalling&#xD;
      and drug resistance protein expression and confer chemotherapy resistance in adjacent cancer&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore propose to test the hypothesis that the reason epidemiological&#xD;
      and clinical studies find elevated LDL-C and its co-morbidities associate with worse survival&#xD;
      in BCa patients, is because the host-cells of these patients have enhanced cholesterol&#xD;
      metabolic flux leading to increased oxysterols production and improved tolerance of&#xD;
      chemotherapy and promotion of cancer metastatic pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is a multicentre cross-over double blind clinical trial in which volunteers with&#xD;
      LDL-C ≥160mg/dL (4.1 mmol/L), recruited at the University of Leeds and/or identified through&#xD;
      Horizon 2020 project PATHWAY-27, will be randomised into two arms of intervention, Group A&#xD;
      (experimental arm) will be given an yoghurt drink enriched with PSS and Group B (placebo&#xD;
      comparator) will be given yoghurt drink non-enriched with PSS. Each dietary intervention will&#xD;
      last for 8 weeks, alternated with a 4 weeks of wash out period. This trial wants to highlight&#xD;
      the superiority of the PSS (yoghurt drink enriched) to placebo (yoghurt drink non-enriched)&#xD;
      intervention on the improvement of the serum/plasma and host cells (adipocytes and&#xD;
      macrophages) LDL-C, oxysterols , PSS levels in high LDL-C levels volunteers and in respective&#xD;
      conditioned media from the host cells/BCa cell lines co-culture, and superiority of the PSS&#xD;
      to placebo intervention on the improvement of the cholesterol panel levels involved in BCa&#xD;
      tolerance of chemotherapy and metastatic progression, according also to the molecular and&#xD;
      genetical pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the unknown effect of PSS on the oxysterols metabolism and of its consequent&#xD;
      chemotherapy and anti-metastatic proprieties, the trial will be divided in two phases (I and&#xD;
      II):&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. In this pilot phase the investigators will explore the effects of PSS intervention in 10&#xD;
      volunteers, evaluate feasibility of study protocol (participant recruitment and retention),&#xD;
      and changes in mean and SD in oxysterols /PSS concentrations making changes to dose and power&#xD;
      calculations if necessary. If the intervention causes any noteworthy effect in oxysterols&#xD;
      serum/blood levels and/or on host cell co-culture with BCa cells the study will continue to&#xD;
      Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. In this phase a further 40 volunteers will be enrolled in the study satisfying our power&#xD;
      calculation prediction to observe an effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized cross-over double blind clinical trial will be run mainly at the School of&#xD;
      Food Science and Nutrition, of the University of Leeds (FS&amp;N). Each site will have a&#xD;
      nominated principle investigator. This will be in collaboration with the NHS - Leeds Teaching&#xD;
      Hospitals Trust (LTHT), the Leeds Institute of Biomedical &amp; Clinical Sciences of the Faculty&#xD;
      of Medicine and Health of the University of Leeds (LIBACS) and the Department of Chemistry of&#xD;
      the University of Oslo (DC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each step point (Day 56, day 84 and day 140), the following trial assessments and&#xD;
      procedures will be taken:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight measurement;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants diary card checking;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse effects and safety;&#xD;

        -  Food intervention compliance checking by asking participants to return yoghurt packages&#xD;
           back to trial team and relative recordings;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24h dietary recall questionnaire interview;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LDL-C, HDL-C, Total Cholesterol, Triglycerides, non-HDL-C blood concentration and&#xD;

    <description>The investigational food product &quot;Cholesterol Reducing Strawberry Yogurt Drink (Tesco)&quot; is a strawberry yogurt drink with added plant sterols. A 100g bottle (one serving) of cholesterol lowering strawberry yogurt drink contains 2g of free plant sterols. The magnitude of the effect given by this enriched food product, providing a daily intake of 1,5-2,4 g plant sterols/stanols, refers to the lowering/reducing blood cholesterol effects in the range &quot;7 % to 10 %&quot; within 2 to 3 weeks of treatment, as specified by Commission Regulation (EU) 384/2010 of 05/05/2010.&#xD;
The dietary intervention will consist in 8 weeks consumption of PSS enriched Yogurt Drink, which provide a daily PSS intake of 3.4g/100g bottle plant sterols ester equivalent to 2g/100g bottle of free plant sterols.</description>
