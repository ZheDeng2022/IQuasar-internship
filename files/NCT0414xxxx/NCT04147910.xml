  <brief_summary>

      This is an open-label, single-dose study in healthy male subjects to investigate the&#xD;
      absorption, metabolism, and excretion (AME) of KW-6356.&#xD;

      Subjects will be screened to assess their eligibility to enter the study within approximately&#xD;
      4 weeks prior to dose administration. Subjects will be confined to the Clinical Research Unit&#xD;
      (CRU) for their entire participation in this study. Eight subjects will be enrolled to allow&#xD;
      6 subjects to complete the study. Each subject will report to the CRU and be confined from&#xD;
      Day -1 (the day before dosing) through at least Day 8 (168 hours postdose). A single dose of&#xD;
      study drug will be administered on Day 1 (0 hour). On Day 8, subjects can be asked to remain&#xD;
      as a resident within the CRU for an additional period to allow for ongoing 24-hour urine,&#xD;
      fecal, and blood sample collections. These collections can continue up to a maximum of 336&#xD;
      hours postdose (Day 15). Subjects can be discharged prior to Day 15 if the following&#xD;
      individual subject discharge criteria have been satisfied: ≥ 90% of the 14C dose recovered in&#xD;
      combined urine and feces, and ≤ 1% of the total radioactive dose is recovered in combined&#xD;
      excreta (urine and feces) in 3 consecutive 24-hour periods in which a fecal sample is&#xD;
      provided.&#xD;
