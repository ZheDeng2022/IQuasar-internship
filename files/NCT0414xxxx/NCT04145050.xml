  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To examine the effect of varying amounts of carbohydrate ingestion on performance,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal experiences, and other physiological markers in elite wheelchair racers&#xD;
      during a simulated marathon.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The metabolic demands created by endurance activities, which include muscle and liver&#xD;
      glycogen depletion as well as losses in body fluids and electrolytes, are significant&#xD;
      limitations to the performance potential of the athlete. For this reason, a well-supported&#xD;
      recommendation exists for such athletes to consume a carbohydrate (CHO) formula, in&#xD;
      particular, one containing electrolytes during their activity. Furthermore, the current CHO&#xD;
      recommendations to support prolonged activity have been developed specifically for&#xD;
      able-bodied athletes, thus are potentially inappropriate for para athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic and physiological functions are altered in individuals with physical disabilities,&#xD;
      so it is unknown how transferable these recommendations are to para athletes. As such, it is&#xD;
      important to understand this population's unique carbohydrate requirements for performance&#xD;
      optimization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, our group showed stable elevated circulating glucose concentrations by utilizing&#xD;
      two different sources of CHO dosed at 60 g/h when compared to water. Significantly improved&#xD;
      performance was observed with both CHO conditions. These findings, combined with studies&#xD;
      showing decreased net muscle glycogen degradation during intravenous glucose infusion (3.5&#xD;
      g/min), show the importance of plasma glucose concentration for sustained performance.&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the SCI-specific responses to&#xD;
      exogenous CHO during a full marathon simulation (MS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve highly trained men and women (20-50 yrs old) will be recruited to the study. The&#xD;
      inclusion criteria are: 1.) Best marathon time lower than 2h 2.) and â‰¥6 months of prior&#xD;
      training history. After initial screenings, participants will perform three marathon (MS)&#xD;
      trials. In cross-over trials, each subject will participate in a MS trial consisting of a&#xD;
      challenge (90% of subject's best marathon time) followed by a time trial (TT) representing&#xD;
      the last 10% of the marathon time. During each MS trial, participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive either water, 30g, or 60g of carbohydrate (CHO) every 15 minutes in the&#xD;
      form of a sports nutrition beverage. Repeated blood and breath sampling will occur throughout&#xD;
      the MS. These samples will be used to determine glucose concentration, lactate concentration,&#xD;
      as well as CHO and fat oxidation. Heart rate, core temperature, blood pressure, ratings of&#xD;
      perceived exertion and GI symptoms will also be assessed throughout the MS and after the time&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completion of this research study will help to identify more appropriate CHO recommendations&#xD;
      for para athletes to support prolonged endurance exercise. This will aid in the understanding&#xD;
      of the unique physiological and metabolic needs of para athletes as compared to their&#xD;
      able-bodied counterparts, thus enhancing inclusivity within sports nutrition literature.&#xD;
