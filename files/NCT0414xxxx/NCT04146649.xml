  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be prospective study of patients with knee effusion associated with degenerative&#xD;
      osteoarthritis or symptomatic primary total knee arthroplasty that undergo therapeutic joint&#xD;
      arthrocentesis. The diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis will be based on knee radiographs&#xD;
      (including AP, Rosenburg view, lateral and Merchant views) read and interpreted by one of our&#xD;
      clinical providers (PA, Fellow or Surgeon). Patients with at least Grade II Outerbridge&#xD;
      changes or higher will be included in the osteoarthritis group. Patients in the arthroplasty&#xD;
      group must have had a primary total knee arthroplasty without infection (as determined by&#xD;
      knee aspirate) to be included. Patients will be clinically evaluated at the time of their&#xD;
      visit for presence of a knee effusion using a bulge test and graded on a 4-point scale (none,&#xD;
      mild, moderate, severe) which has shown good interobserver reliability (reliability&#xD;
      coefficient = 0.97)23. Patients with a moderate or severe effusion will be included in the&#xD;
      study. Patients with no or only mild effusion will not be included due to the increased risk&#xD;
      for a dry tap or minimally effective fluid volume reduction with arthrocentesis. Patients&#xD;
      having significant pain associated with their effusion will be offered a therapeutic&#xD;
      arthrocentesis as part of their treatment plan discussion.&#xD;

      Pain and Self-Reported Function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knee pain will be assessed with an 11-point numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) where 0&#xD;
      represents 'no pain' and 10 represents 'worst imaginable pain'. Self-reported physical&#xD;
      function will be assessed using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis&#xD;
      Index (WOMAC) for each knee separately. The WOMAC assesses the impact of knee osteoarthritis&#xD;
      on multiple domains-pain, stiffness, and disability. A composite score (0-100 scale) will be&#xD;
      used for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Range of Motion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knee range of motion (ROM) is a direct measure of joint mobility following TKA. Knee ROM will&#xD;
      be measured in the supine position both actively and passively using a long-arm goniometer.&#xD;
      Goniometry has been shown to be a reliable measure of knee ROM after TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quadriceps Strength and Activation Testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum voluntary isometric quadriceps strength and quadriceps activation will be assessed&#xD;
      before surgery and at week 3 using an electromechanical dynamometer (Humac Norm, CSMI) and a&#xD;
      doublet interpolation test. Patients will be seated on the electromechanical dynamometer with&#xD;
      their hips flexed to approximately 85° and their knees flexed to 60°. Two 3&quot; by 5&quot;&#xD;
      self-adhesive neuromuscular stimulation electrodes will be placed over the motor points of&#xD;
      the rectus femoris and the vastus medialis. A Grass S48 stimulator with a Grass Model SIU8T&#xD;
      stimulus isolation unit will be used to deliver 600 µs doublet pulses. A Biopac MP150WSW&#xD;
      system will be used for data acquisition during testing with sampling frequency of 300 Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following two warm-up contractions, a practice maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC)&#xD;
      will be performed against the dynamometer's force transducer. Visual torque targets will be&#xD;
      set on the feedback monitor at slightly higher torques than produced during the practice MVIC&#xD;
      trial. Trials will be repeated until maximal torque is within 5% of the previous attempt.&#xD;
      Torque from quadriceps MVIC will be normalized to body weight for between-subject&#xD;
      comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Voluntary activation of the quadriceps muscle will be assessed using the doublet&#xD;
      interpolation technique, where a supramaximal stimulus will be applied by a Grass S48&#xD;
      stimulator during an MVIC and immediately afterwards while the quadriceps muscle is at&#xD;
&#xD;
      rest. Normalization of the force from the superimposed doublet to the resting doublet allows&#xD;
      for comparisons of quadriceps activation across individuals and lower extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timed-Up-and-Go&#xD;
&#xD;
      The timed-up-and-go (TUG) test is a responsive, valid, and reliable functional measure of&#xD;
      basic mobility and dynamic balance. The examiner measures the time, in seconds, required by&#xD;
      the patient to a) rise from an arm chair; b) walk 3 meters; c) turn and walk back to the arm&#xD;
      chair; and d) return to the seated position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30-second Sit-to-Stand Test&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 30-second Sit-to-Stand test (30STS) is a responsive, valid, and reliable functional&#xD;
      measure of lower extremity strength after TKA. This test counts the number of times a patient&#xD;
      can rise to a full standing position in 30 seconds. The test starting position is sitting on&#xD;
      an armless chair with seat plate 17 inches from the floor. Patients rise from this position&#xD;
      with hands placed on opposite shoulders. If the patient must use his/her arms to stand, the&#xD;
      test is stopped. If the patient is over halfway to a standing position when 30 seconds have&#xD;
      lapsed, this counts as a stand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioimpedance Spectroscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) is a reliable, responsive measure of swelling that has been&#xD;
      validated in observational studies of individuals after TKA. The RJL Systems Quantum®&#xD;
      (Clinton Township, MI) bioelectrical impedance device delivers a 2.5 µA alternating current&#xD;
      at a frequency of 50 kHz. The tissue impedance to this current is displayed in Ohms (Ω) and&#xD;
      is recorded at a precision of 1 Ω. The level of impedance met by the current reflects the&#xD;
      composition of the tissue, but will also fluctuate with the presence of swelling in the lower&#xD;
      extremity. Lower levels of impedance represent the increased fluid content present with&#xD;
      greater levels of swelling. Measuring the impedance of both the involved and uninvolved limb&#xD;
      allows for calculation of a ratio (W-involved limb: W-uninvolved limb). To measure impedance,&#xD;
      a four-wire measurement method will be used. The most proximal electrode pair will be placed&#xD;
      10 and 20 centimeters above the superior patellar pole. The most distal electrode pair will&#xD;
      be placed at a point bisecting the medial and lateral malleolus, and also 10 cm distal to&#xD;
      that point along the second ray of the foot. New electrodes will be used for each testing&#xD;
      session, and skin will be cleaned with an alcohol swab prior to electrode placement.&#xD;
