      This is a Phase 2a study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of luspatercept in&#xD;
      pediatric participants who require regular red blood cell transfusions due to β-thalassemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 2 parts: Part A will be in adolescent participants aged 12 to&#xD;
      &lt;18 years with two dose escalation cohorts of 6 participants each, followed by a dose&#xD;
      expansion cohort of 30 participants. Part B will begin after a review of the safety in&#xD;
      participants completing at least one year of treatment in Part A and will be in participants&#xD;
      aged 6 to &lt;12 with two dose escalation cohorts of 6 participants each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the Treatment Period, participants of any cohort who are benefiting from&#xD;
      the study treatment, will be offered the opportunity to continue luspatercept treatment in&#xD;
      the Long-term Treatment Period for up to 5 years from their first dose (Cycle 1 Day 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who discontinue study treatment any time will continue in the Posttreatment&#xD;
      Follow-up Period for at least 5 years from their first dose of luspatercept (Cycle 1 Day 1),&#xD;
      or 3 years from their last dose, whichever occurs later, or until they withdraw&#xD;
      consent/assent, are lost to follow-up, or the End of Trial, whichever occurs first.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of luspatercept in&#xD;
      pediatric participants who require regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusions due to&#xD;
      β-thalassemia and to determine the recommended dose (RD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoints are the determination of the RD and PK parameters (including Cmax, AUC,&#xD;
      t1/2, CL/F and Vd/F).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints include the safety of luspatercept in pediatric participants, the&#xD;
      immunogenicity (frequency of antidrug antibodies) of luspatercept, mean change in RBC&#xD;
      transfusion burden, mean change in hemoglobin levels, mean change from baseline in mean daily&#xD;
      dose of iron chelation therapy (ICT), and mean change from baseline in serum ferritin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of the following periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening/Run-in Period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long-term Treatment Period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Posttreatment Follow-up Period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant screening procedures will occur during the Screening/Run-in Period, within 12&#xD;
      weeks prior to the start of study treatment. Participants who meet the study eligibility&#xD;
      criteria will be enrolled into the Treatment Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in a staggered manner, in descending order of age, with 2 parts&#xD;
      as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescent participants aged 12 to &lt; 18 years: Luspatercept 0.75 will be enrolled as outlined&#xD;
      below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A Dose Escalation Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A Dose Escalation Phase will explore up to 2 dose levels of luspatercept, 0.75 mg/kg and&#xD;
      1.0 mg/kg, to evaluate the safety and tolerability of luspatercept in this age group and&#xD;
      determine the RD to be used for Part A Expansion Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: 6 adolescent participants 12 to &lt; 18 years of age receiving luspatercept 0.75&#xD;
           mg/kg, administered subcutaneously (SC) once every 21 days (for up to 4 cycles in the&#xD;
           Treatment Period)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: 6 adolescent participants 12 to &lt; 18 years of age receiving luspatercept 1.0&#xD;
           mg/kg, administered SC once every 21 days (for up to 4 cycles in the Treatment Period)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A Expansion Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Cohort 3 - The Expansion Cohort: 30 adolescent participants (12 to &lt; 18 years of age)&#xD;
      receiving luspatercept at the RD for up to 12 months in the Treatment Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children from 6 years to &lt; 12 years of age will be enrolled into Part B as outlined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B Dose Escalation Phase will explore 2 dose levels of luspatercept, 1.0 mg/kg and 1.25&#xD;
      mg/kg, to evaluate the safety and tolerability of luspatercept in this age group and&#xD;
      determine the RD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 4: 6 participants (6 to &lt; 12 years of age) receiving luspatercept 1.0 mg/kg,&#xD;
           administered SC once every 21 days (for up to 4 cycles in the Treatment Period)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 5: 6 participants (6 to &lt;12 years of age) receiving luspatercept 1.25 mg/kg,&#xD;
           administered SC once every 21 days (for up to 4 cycles in the Treatment Period)&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Treatment Period of both Part A Dose Escalation Phase and Part B Dose Escalation&#xD;
      Phase, once all 6 participants in a dose escalation cohort have completed the first cycle&#xD;
      (Study Day 22), the Dose Review Team (DRT), will review all available safety data, including&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and&#xD;
      laboratory results (including hematology and chemistry) reported during Cycle 1 of each dose&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A DLT, using the current active version of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, is defined as any of the&#xD;
      following toxicities at any dose level occurring within 21 days of the first administered&#xD;
      dose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment-related SAE of ≥ Grade 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment-related nonhematologic AE of ≥ Grade 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment-related hematologic AE of ≥ Grade 4&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DRT will make a recommendation as to whether or not to enroll the next cohort at the next&#xD;
      planned dose level based in part upon the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If a DLT occurs in ≤ 1 participant (out of 6) in a cohort within 21 days following the&#xD;
           initial dose of luspatercept, the next planned dose level may proceed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If a DLT occurs in ≥ 2 participants (out of 6) in a cohort within 21 days following the&#xD;
           initial dose of luspatercept, the next planned dose level should not proceed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If a hemoglobin increase of ≥ 2.0 g/dL (confirmed by central lab after initial study&#xD;
           treatment administration and not attributable to RBC transfusion) occurs in ≥ 2&#xD;
           participants (out of 6) in a cohort, the decision to proceed to the next planned dose&#xD;
           level will need to be evaluated by the DRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 6 participants eligible for the Dose Determining Set (DDS) are planned to be&#xD;
      enrolled per dose escalation cohort with up to 2 cohorts per age group. With up to 4 2 age&#xD;
      groups being considered, a total of up to 24 participants are to be included in the DDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To minimize safety risk to participants, best supportive care will be available, including&#xD;
      RBC transfusions, iron-chelating agents, use of antibiotic therapy, antiviral and antifungal&#xD;
      therapy, and/or nutritional support as needed.&#xD;
