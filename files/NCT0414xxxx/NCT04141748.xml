  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to compare hand casting to standing hydrostatic pressure casting&#xD;
      using a water cylinder in persons with lower limb amputation. Our overall hypothesis is that&#xD;
      standing hydrostatic pressure casting with a water cylinder will lead to more consistent and&#xD;
      efficient residual limb shape capture and improved initial socket fit and comfort compared to&#xD;
      hand casting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the most important components of restoring function in persons with lower limb&#xD;
      amputation is the precise fitting of the prosthetic socket to the residual limb. However,&#xD;
      this is challenging because the residual limb is dynamic in shape and volume. Additionally,&#xD;
      prosthetic socket fabrication processes influence socket fit. These processes typically&#xD;
      consist of residual limb shape capture, positive mold rectification, initial diagnostic&#xD;
      socket fitting, and definitive prosthesis delivery. The most prevalent residual limb shape&#xD;
      capture method involves a negative wrap cast in a non-weight bearing position and manual&#xD;
      manipulation of the cast to conform to the residual limb shape. With this technique it is&#xD;
      challenging to accurately capture the bony contours and distribute pressure evenly around the&#xD;
      residual limb. To improve shape capture, techniques that rely less on manual manipulation by&#xD;
      the prosthetist, such as standing hydrostatic pressure casting with a water cylinder have&#xD;
      been developed. Given the use of physics to shape the residual limb, it has been proposed&#xD;
      that pressure casting results in better fitting and more comfortable sockets, however this&#xD;
      has not yet been demonstrated. The overall objective is to compare hand casting to standing&#xD;
      hydrostatic pressure casting using a water cylinder in persons with lower limb amputation.&#xD;
      Our overall hypothesis is that standing hydrostatic pressure casting with a water cylinder&#xD;
      will lead to more consistent and efficient residual limb shape capture and improved initial&#xD;
      socket fit and comfort compared to hand casting.&#xD;
