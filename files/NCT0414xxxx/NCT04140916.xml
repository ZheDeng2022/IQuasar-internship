      Central venous catheters are routinely used, however, with a complication rate exceeding 15%.&#xD;
      Therefore, other types of venous catheters have been introduced such as a midline catheter.&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study is to assess the efficacy and the safety of midline&#xD;
      catheters compared to the standard care being a central catheter also inserted peripherally.&#xD;
      Patients with indication for intravenous fluids or medicines for 5 to 28 days will be&#xD;
      included in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States more than 5 million patients each year get a central venous catheter.&#xD;
      Indications for central venous catheterization include infusion of irritant drugs like&#xD;
      chemotherapy or total parenteral nutrition, poor peripheral venous access and long term&#xD;
      administration of drugs such as antibiotics. This ubiquitous procedure has many associated&#xD;
      complications that result in morbidity, mortality, and increased healthcare cost. The overall&#xD;
      complication rate is more than 15% and a great preventive effort is done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catheter Related Bloodstream Infection (CRBSI) is a serious and feared complication&#xD;
      associated with prolonged hospital stays, increased costs and risk of mortality. CRBSI is&#xD;
      defined as the presence of bacteremia originating from an intravenous catheter. A lot of&#xD;
      effort is done to reduce CRBSI including heightened attention to hygiene in placement and&#xD;
      care, improved education and training, and placement of a team with specialized skills.&#xD;
      Adherence to best practice for central line placement is shown to reduce risk of CRBSI .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, central venous catheters (CVCs) are associated with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism. Besides interruption in treatment, catheter-related DVT increases&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Cancer and admission to intensive care are independent risk factors.&#xD;
      Existing data report wide estimates of this adverse outcome, ranging from less than 1% to as&#xD;
      high as 38.5%, dependent on the population studied, method of diagnosis, and use of&#xD;
      prophylaxis measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) is a CVC which placement and use have been&#xD;
      widespread since it was first described in 1975. It is a well-established alternative to CVCs&#xD;
      placed via subclavian or jugular veins. It is easy to place, safe and cost-effective compared&#xD;
      to others often used central lines. PICC is inserted via a peripheral vein in the upper arm&#xD;
      and terminates like other central lines in the vena cava superior. Placement and use is&#xD;
      associated with few complications .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another peripherally inserted catheter is the midline which by definition is 7.5 to 20&#xD;
      centimeters long (3-8 inches) and thus not a CVC. The midline catheter was introduced in&#xD;
      1950s. It has undergone major improvement in material technology and techniques for achieving&#xD;
      vascular access. It is inserted in the same peripherally veins as the PICC, but the tip is&#xD;
      advanced no further than the distal axillary vein and is therefore classified as a peripheral&#xD;
      intravenous catheter with corresponding advantages and disadvantages. The midline cannot be&#xD;
      used to vesicants or irritants like most chemotherapy, vasoactive agents, or medications with&#xD;
      extremely low or high pH values. The midline is suitable for use from 5 days until 4 weeks to&#xD;
      drugs and solutions, which safely can be administrated in a peripheral venous catheter.&#xD;
      Severe complication to placement and use of midline is rare, but due to previous problems&#xD;
      primarily related to the midline catheter material, its use is limited .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a large review from 2006 the incidence of CRBSI among in- and outpatients having PICC or&#xD;
      midline were estimated to 3.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.6-3.7) and 0.4% (95% CI&#xD;
      0.0-0.9), respectively. It has been demonstrated that CVCs can be decreased through the use&#xD;
      of midline catheters . A retrospective descriptive review from two hospitals in America&#xD;
      showed the effectiveness of implementing a midline program resulted in a 78% reduction in CVC&#xD;
      line-associated bloodstream infection. In a similar Australian retrospective cohort study in&#xD;
      a ventilator unit population, a significant decrease in the rate of CVC line-associated&#xD;
      bloodstream infections was found after use of midlines. It seems that the introduction and&#xD;
      regular use of midlines when warranted may reduce the overall incidence of CRBSI and its&#xD;
      sequelae in certain hospital environments. In a meta-analysis including 11,476 hospital&#xD;
      admitted patients with PICC, DVT was found in 3.44% (95% CI 2.46-4.43). DVT occurrence in&#xD;
      relation to midline is understudied, but is reported with a low incidence between 0-2 %. The&#xD;
      overall incidence of DVT and related potentially secondary complications of both catheters&#xD;
      seems low. The risk of minor complications such as pain, leakage or phlebitis is in a&#xD;
      retrospective comparison study found to be 11.5% for midlines and 1.5% for PICC, respectively&#xD;
      (P&lt;0.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of the PICC is well studied, the incidence of side effects is known and its use&#xD;
      is implemented all over the world. However, the efficacy of midlines compared to PICCs has&#xD;
      not been evaluated prospectively. The present study aim to examine the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      midline catheters using standard care with PICC as reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients eligible for screening for inclusion are identified among all patients where staff&#xD;
      from a general ward requests a central line. The randomization is 1:1 between the PICC&#xD;
      (control group) and a midline catheter (intervention group). After placement the patients&#xD;
      will be closely followed until the day of removal of the catheter. To obtain information on&#xD;
      length of hospital stay and mortality, the electronical journal will be checked until 90 days&#xD;
      after catheter removal. The incidence of complications that occur will be registered and the&#xD;
      two catheter groups will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk and benefits by participating in the trial: In patients with poor peripheral venous&#xD;
      access or need of long time administration of medicine or fluids a central line is routinely&#xD;
      placed. The puncture site on the upper arm and placement technique are the same for both&#xD;
      catheter types. Therefore the complications during placement are expected to be independent&#xD;
      of catheter type. PICC require x-ray confirmation of tip placement, leading to additional&#xD;
      costs and exposing the patient to unnecessary radiation. X-ray verification of tip position&#xD;
      is not necessary when placing the midline catheter. By participating in this study the&#xD;
      patients have benefit of more close observation and patients in the intervention group have&#xD;
      the possible benefit of reduced risk of having a CRBSI. In the intervention group, the risk&#xD;
      of minor complications like pain in relation to fluid or medicine administration,&#xD;
      infiltration or phlebitis is expected to be increased compared with the control group. The&#xD;
      discomfort in relation to the minor complications is expected to disappear without any&#xD;
      persistent complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Single-center randomised controlled trial with in- and out-patients from medical and&#xD;
      surgical departments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catheter placement: The informed consent and randomization is performed prior to placement of&#xD;
      catheters. With the patient supine ultrasound is used to identify the desired vein on the&#xD;
      relevant upper extremity. Full sterile technique is used and includes the operator wearing&#xD;
      sterile gown, mask, cap, and sterile gloves. The area is then prepared with chlorhexidine&#xD;
      followed by adequate sterile draping. The Seldinger technique is used to insert the catheter.&#xD;
      Successful placement in a vein is secured by aspirating blood from the catheter. The catheter&#xD;
      is then flushed with minimum 20 mL saline. Depending on the randomization a PICC is placed&#xD;
      and the tip position in vena cava superior is verified by a chest x-ray or a midline is&#xD;
      placed without the need of x-ray verification. The patient is then returned to the medical or&#xD;
      surgical ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment procedure: Subjects are recruited among patients where staff from a general ward&#xD;
      requests a central line. The anesthesiologist or special trained nurse responsible for&#xD;
      inclusion will apply to the national regulations regarding informed consent to participation&#xD;
      in a clinical trial. Hence, in addition to oral information the potential participant will&#xD;
      receive written information including both the specific information on the current study as&#xD;
      well as the general information pamphlet on participant rights when entering a clinical&#xD;
      trial. All information and inclusion will be given by physicians or special trained nurses&#xD;
      who possess the sufficient professional prerequisites to be authorized by the sponsor to have&#xD;
      a direct involvement in the project. Information will be given in private and the participant&#xD;
      will be allowed to have an assessor present. The participant will be given a brief reflection&#xD;
      period before making their decision. As always it is voluntary to participate and the&#xD;
      subjects can withdraw their commitment to participate at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline variables: Date of birth, age, gender, ethnicity, height, weight, and medical&#xD;
      history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure related variables: Date of randomization, date placement, time used for placement,&#xD;
      number of skin punctures, type and length of placed catheter, name of the access-vein,&#xD;
      accidental arterial puncture, bleeding complications, and tip placement on chest x-ray&#xD;
      (control group only - assessed from an anterior and posterior X-ray of thorax).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registrations at the wards: CRBSI, deep vein thrombosis, catheter removal date and cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phlebitis scale score: 0 No symptoms; 1 Erythema at access site with or without pain; 2 Pain&#xD;
      at access site with erythema or edema; 3 Pain at access site with erythema or edema; streak&#xD;
      formation; palpable venous cord; and 4 Pain at access site with erythema or edema; streak&#xD;
      formation; palpable venous cord &lt; 2.5 cm Infiltration scale score: 0 No symptoms; 1 Skin&#xD;
      blanched; edema &lt; 2.5 cm in any direction; cool to touch; with or without pain; 2 Skin&#xD;
      blanched; edema in 2.5 to 15 cm in any directions; cool to touch; with or without pain; 3&#xD;
      Skin blanched, translucent; gross edema &gt; 15 cm in any directions; cool to touch;&#xD;
      mil-to-moderate pain; possible numbness'; and 4 Skin blanched, translucent; skin tight;&#xD;
      leaking: skin discoloured: bruised; swollen; gross edema &gt; 15 cm in any direction; deep&#xD;
      pitting tissue edema; circulatory impairment: moderate-to-severe pain; infiltration of any&#xD;
      amount of blood product, irritant, or vesicant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation and power calculation: The primary outcome is CRBSI. The power&#xD;
      calculation is based on an expected incidence of 5% in the PICC group with reference to the&#xD;
      literature and an expected incidence of 0% in the midline group with reference to a follow-up&#xD;
      of the first 107 midline catheters inserted in patients at Aalborg University Hospital from&#xD;
      the 5th of October 2017 to the 26th of February 2018. With an alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 0.2&#xD;
      (power 0.8) the sample size is 304 with 152 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods: Descriptive data will be presented in a baseline table according to&#xD;
      catheter type. For normally distributed measurements the differences between groups will be&#xD;
      compared using Student´s t-test. Variables considered not to be normally distributed will be&#xD;
      analysed by Mann-Whitney´s U-test. The results from primary and secondary endpoints will be&#xD;
      presented in a separate table also according to catheter type. The differences between groups&#xD;
      will be compared using Wilcoxon two-samples test/Fisher´s exact or unpaired t-test.&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be performed using STATA software (version 14; STATA, Corporation,&#xD;
      College Station, TX). A two-sided P value of less than 0.05 will be considered statistical&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
