  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The TricValve® Transcatheter Bicaval Valves System is indicated for relief of tricuspid&#xD;
      insufficiency in patients with symptomatic heart disease who are judged by a heart team,&#xD;
      including a cardiac surgeon, to be at extreme risk or inoperable for open surgical therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TricValve® Transcatheter Bicaval Valves is a system of two self-expanding biological valves&#xD;
      for the treatment of patients with hemodynamically relevant tricuspid insufficiency and caval&#xD;
      reflux. The prostheses are implanted percutaneously into the inferior and superior vena cava&#xD;
      without disturbing the native tricuspid valve. It is especially intended for use for patients&#xD;
      at extreme risk or who are inoperable for open surgical therapy. Pre-Clinical and Clinical&#xD;
      preliminary studies have shown an acceptable safety and performance profile of the TricValve®&#xD;
      Transcatheter Bicaval Valves System. Given that the medical device is a potential long-term&#xD;
      treatment for patients with tricuspid insufficiency, clinical data for long-term treatment&#xD;
      periods is necessary. Thus, the current study with the aim of CE certification is designed to&#xD;
      investigate the safety and performance for at least 30 days and up to 6 months.&#xD;
