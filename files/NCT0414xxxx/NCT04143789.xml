  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to define an effective and safe dose of AP-002 in advanced or&#xD;
      recurrent solid tumors for which there are no standard therapies to use in subsequent studies&#xD;
      in advanced or recurrent breast, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or prostate cancers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The Phase 1 portion of this study will determine the Pharmacodynamically Active Dose (PAD) of&#xD;
      AP-002 in humans, defined as the dose at which the plasma concentration of AP-002, as&#xD;
      measured by Ga, is 300-500 ng/mL and which is at or below the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD),&#xD;
      to use in the clinical setting of advanced or recurrent solid tumors. This will be followed&#xD;
      by a Phase 2 expanded cohort treated at the PAD, to estimate the efficacy of AP-002 in&#xD;
      patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer, NSCLC and prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive AP-002 orally, once daily for 14 days of a 21 day cycle.&#xD;
