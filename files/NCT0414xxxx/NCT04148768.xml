  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The Y balance test is a dynamic test that requires strength, flexibility, and&#xD;
      proprioception. It is a measure of dynamic balance that provides a significant challenge to&#xD;
      athletes and physically active individuals. The test can be used to assess physical&#xD;
      performance, but can also be used to screen deficits in dynamic postural control due to&#xD;
      musculoskeletal injuries (e.g. chronic ankle instability), to identify athletes at greater&#xD;
      risk for lower extremity injury, as well as during the rehabilitation of orthopedic injuries&#xD;
      in healthy active adults&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To know the effect of 4 sessions of treatment by interferential therapy (IFT)&#xD;
      15-20 minutes, and SWD 15 min on the balance and dynamic postural component using Y balance&#xD;
      test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Subjects will be randomized into IFT and laser group (n=20 each). After the first&#xD;
      session, the balance component will be measured pre-post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome assessment: Y Balance tests score.&#xD;

      on the balance and dynamic postural component using Y balance test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Random sampling through lottery methods Blinding: Participants were not aware&#xD;
      of the group they were in Allocation concealment: Not done Inclusion criteria: Physical&#xD;
      assessment of the knee joint participants complains of pain, osteoarthritis, Patellofemoral&#xD;
      knee pain syndrome, pain due to altered biomechanics of knee joints (structural and&#xD;
      functional) Exclusion criteria: History of previous surgeries, participants on steroids,&#xD;
      Vitamin deficiencies, osteoporosis, open wounds, recurrent ACL repair, Affliction due to&#xD;
      metastasis or post-cancer patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment specifications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of intervention: Treatment will continue for 4 sessions/week, with each session&#xD;
      lasting 15-20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group-1: Interferential therapy will be given to the patients with knee pain for&#xD;
      4 sessions for 15-20 minutes and the examination of the balance will be done with Y balance&#xD;
      tests Pre-Post. 4 electrodes methods placed diagonally to each other creating a beat&#xD;
      frequency at the center. Intensity to the percieved tolerable limits. The 'medium frequency'&#xD;
      currents (medium frequency in electromedical terms is usually considered to be 1KHz-100KHz).&#xD;
      These medium frequency currents, passed through the tissues simultaneously, where they are&#xD;
      set up so that their paths cross &amp; they literally interfere with each other. This interaction&#xD;
      gives rise to an interference current (or beat frequency) which has the characteristics of&#xD;
      low-frequency stimulation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group-2: SWD will be given to the patients with knee pain for 4 sessions for&#xD;
      10-15 minutes with Continuous Mode and intensity: comfortable warmth, timing 15 mins and&#xD;
      examination of the balance will be done with Y balance tests Pre-Post.&#xD;

    <description>Interferential therapy(IFT) utilises two of these medium frequency currents, passed through the tissues simultaneously, where they are set up so that their paths cross &amp; they literally interfere with each other - hence another term that has been used in the past but appears to be out of favour at the moment - Interference Current Therapy. This interaction gives rise to an interference current (or beat frequency) which has the characteristics of low-frequency stimulation.</description>
