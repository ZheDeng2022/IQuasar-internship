    <textblock>
      The purpose this study is to measure sensitivity to visual and vestibular or balance motion.&#xD;
      It is hoped that the results may help researchers better understand how aging and disease&#xD;
      affect motion perception.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As people move through natural environments, they experience both visual and inertial&#xD;
      stimuli. These can be integrated into a unified perception of self-motion (i.e. common&#xD;
      causation) or segregated so that inertial or vestibular stimuli represents self-motion and&#xD;
      visual represents external motion. There has been very little work on how causal inference&#xD;
      (CI) or determination of common causation occurs for visual and inertial stimuli. Yet this is&#xD;
      an important factor in fall risk, motion sickness, simulator sickness, concussion, dementia,&#xD;
      and migraine. This proposal aims to develop and establish methods for studying CI in visual&#xD;
      and inertial heading perception. This will be used to define the relevant variables in CI for&#xD;
      these sensory systems. Common causation is likely a plastic process that occurs when stimuli&#xD;
      occur simultaneously. The proposal will also examine this hypothesis by adapting heading&#xD;
      perception, which may form the basis for a novel vestibular rehabilitation method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim I: Causal inference (CI) for visual and inertial headings. During natural movements&#xD;
      visual and inertial cues occur together. Inertial cues always represent self-motion, visual&#xD;
      cues are ambiguous as they can represent motion through a fixed environment, environmental&#xD;
      motion relative to the observer, or a combination of both. IA. Techniques for measuring CI&#xD;
      for visual and inertial stimuli are not well established. The investigatorshave developed a&#xD;
      technique to measure CI by presenting offset visual and inertial headings simultaneously&#xD;
      using a full range of possible directions within the horizontal plane. Subjects report the&#xD;
      perceived direction of the visual and inertial stimuli independently and whether or not they&#xD;
      share common causation. These trial blocks can be repeated to determine reproducibility. IB.&#xD;
      Parameters that influence perception of CI will be varied to determine their relative&#xD;
      influences. These parameters will include stimulus timing, duration, and visual field size.&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that full-field visual stimuli that are most consistent with the inertial&#xD;
      stimulus will be perceived as having common causation. IC. Subjects with unilateral&#xD;
      vestibular lesions will be tested using the techniques in IA. These individuals may have&#xD;
      increased reliance on visual cues as well as decrease reliability and biases in inertial&#xD;
      heading perception. As such, this may cause inertial headings to be more influenced by vision&#xD;
      and result in a greater range of common causation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim II: Visual-inertial heading adaptation. Plasticity in vestibular perception has received&#xD;
      minimal attention, despite perception being the primary issue in common disorders such as&#xD;
      vertigo, motion, and simulator sickness. Better understanding of how adaptation occurs could&#xD;
      form the basis for improved therapeutic options as well as better tolerated virtual&#xD;
      environments and simulations. IIA. Exposure to visual and inertial headings with similar&#xD;
      characteristics, that are systematically offset, will be studied. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      exposure to this situation will influence subsequent visual and inertial heading perception&#xD;
      as well as their common causation. These factors will also be measured before and after&#xD;
      adaptation. The limits of what types of offsets can induce adaptation, and the range of&#xD;
      headings that can be adapted will be explored. IIB. Preliminary data demonstrate that heading&#xD;
      adaptation can also be induced by exposure to a virtual environment with an angular velocity&#xD;
      offset in the visual stimulus. This method of adaptation will also be studied with regard to&#xD;
      its influence on perception of rotation, visual and inertial headings and common causation of&#xD;
      these headings. As with IIA, the potential limitations of the method will be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim III: Heading adaptation after vestibular loss. Errors in heading perception are a&#xD;
      clinically significant problem. Abnormal perception of rotation often quickly normalizes&#xD;
      after vestibular lesions, but preliminary data indicate heading perception remains deviated&#xD;
      for years afterwards. This could be due to asymmetry in the otolith system which current&#xD;
      vestibular rehabilitation methods do not address. Abnormal heading perception may be a&#xD;
      significant factor in other disorders including vestibular migraine, dementia, and&#xD;
      concussion. Understanding long-term adaptation is potentially important in these populations.&#xD;
      IIIA. Time course and etiology of perceptual pathology after acute vestibular lesions is&#xD;
      unclear. This will be investigated by sequentially measuring bias and perceptual thresholds&#xD;
      of yaw rotation, sway, and heading in individuals with acute loss of vestibular function.&#xD;
      Initially subjects have a rotation bias towards the intact side which normalizes over time.&#xD;
      The heading bias may correlate with rotational bias or may be related to otolith dysfunction,&#xD;
      as measured with sway translation perception, or may occur as a result of adapting to the&#xD;
      rotatory vertigo. IIIB. Study of long-term heading adaptation in subjects with chronic&#xD;
      unilateral vestibular hypofunction (e.g. those who have had vestibular schwannomas removed,&#xD;
      gentamicin ablative therapy for Meniere's disease). Since these subjects often have biased&#xD;
      heading perception at baseline, they may be able to exhibit long term adaptation. Heading&#xD;
      perception as well as visual-inertial common causation will be measured using the techniques&#xD;
      described in Aim IC. Ability to adapt these patients to heading offsets will be measured&#xD;
      using the methods established in normal controls (Aim II) but the adaptation will always be&#xD;
      in a consistent direction to attempt to normalize baseline deviation in heading perception.&#xD;
      It will be determined if durable long-term heading adaptation can be achieved. The proposal&#xD;
      aims to understand how visual and inertial cues inform motion perception and how adaptation&#xD;
      has the potential to improve pathological perception.&#xD;
