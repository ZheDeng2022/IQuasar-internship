      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many people experience fatigue as a side effect of their illnesses and treatments. There are&#xD;
      no medicines to treat fatigue, but a drug called ketamine has reduced fatigue in depressed&#xD;
      people. Researchers hope that ketamine, compared to a drug called midazolam, can reduce&#xD;
      fatigue in people with illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test whether ketamine reduces fatigue in cancer survivors and people with chronic illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults between the ages of 18 and 70 who have fatigue and are cancer survivors or have been&#xD;
      diagnosed with a chronic illness such as chronic fatigue syndrome and lupus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, blood and urine tests,&#xD;
      questions about their fatigue, and breathalyzer test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During phase 1, participants will complete rating their fatigue using questionnaires. They&#xD;
      will be provided thinking, memory, and motivation tests. They will also take a handgrip test.&#xD;
      For this study, the participant will have an IV, which a needle guides a thin plastic tube&#xD;
      (intravenous or IV line) into an arm in their vein. An IV will be required for two of the&#xD;
      visits. They will get a single dose of either ketamine or midazolam through an IV line over&#xD;
      40 minutes. Participants must be accompanied by a responsible friend/family/colleague to take&#xD;
      them home after getting the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have follow-up visits where they repeat the above tests. They will also&#xD;
      have follow-up phone calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 is the same as phase 1, but participants get the other study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study lasts 1 month. Each phase lasts 2 weeks. Participants will have 6-8 total NIH&#xD;
      visits. For the whole study, they will wear a device on their wrists that records physical&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug side effects can include vivid dreams, seeing colors, perceiving time as moving slower&#xD;
      or faster than normal, dizziness, headache, restlessness, nausea, or vomiting, among others.&#xD;

      Purpose: The purpose of the study is to investigate the anti-fatigue effects of ketamine in&#xD;
      individuals with chronic illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Although the underlying mechanisms of fatigue have been studied in several&#xD;
      disease conditions, the etiology, mechanisms, and risk factors remain elusive and this&#xD;
      symptom remains poorly managed. Fatigue is conceptualized as a multidimensional symptom which&#xD;
      incorporates temporal, sensory, cognitive/mental, affective/emotional, behavioral, and&#xD;
      physiological dimensions. It is described as a common, chronic, and disabling symptom in&#xD;
      individuals with Sjogren s syndrome and those with systemic lupus erythematosus. We recently&#xD;
      observed that upregulation of glutamate receptors (e.g.,GRM5) can predict individuals who&#xD;
      will develop chronic fatigue one year after completing cancer therapy, suggesting that&#xD;
      fatigue may share common glutamatergic markers with depression. Ketamine is an&#xD;
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist and has been reported to have rapid&#xD;
      anti-depressant effects, and we recently found that it also has rapid anti-fatigue effects.&#xD;
      Evidence suggest that severe fatigue in diverse medical conditions is driven by similar&#xD;
      biological mechanisms, hence identifying a potential anti-fatigue agent in one medical&#xD;
      condition may be a valuable anti-fatigue therapy for other fatiguing conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population for Study: This proof-of-concept study will enroll 59 individuals (target n of&#xD;
      completers = 50) with chronic fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: Participants must have a fatigue visual analog scale&#xD;
&#xD;
      (VAS) score of greater than or equal to 50 mm (on a 0-100 mm horizontal scale). The greater&#xD;
      than or equal to 50 mm fatigue VAS score is considered clinically important fatigue cutoff&#xD;
      score for patients with chronic illness, and also captures the effectivity outcome of a&#xD;
      previous pharmacologic intervention for fatigue. The participants must not have any&#xD;
      progressive or unstable conditions or be taking medications that cause fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: This is a phase II, randomized, double-blind (study team and participants),&#xD;
      active comparator-controlled, cross-over trial. After determining eligibility during the&#xD;
      screening visit, the participant will be randomized to determine the sequence of study&#xD;
      drug/active comparator to take during each phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Study Events / Estimates of Duration and Time Commitments: The study has two periods,&#xD;
      and each period is approximately two weeks long (total of four weeks). The study (both&#xD;
      periods, excluding the screening visit) will require eight NIH outpatient visits and three&#xD;
      phone calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and Representative Secondary Outcomes: The primary outcome measure of the study is&#xD;
      the change in self-reported fatigue VAS score before and three days after receiving ketamine&#xD;
      or active comparator (midazolam). A 20% decrease in fatigue VAS score three days after&#xD;
      ketamine treatment will be considered the primary indicator of efficacy in this study. The&#xD;
      secondary outcomes of this study include: symptoms, physical activity count, skeletal muscle&#xD;
      strength, motivation score, cognitive function test scores, changes in gene expression or&#xD;
      protein levels of pro-inflammatory markers (e.g., lymphotoxin, IFNy, TNF alpha) typically&#xD;
      seen in fatigue, and neurometabolite (e.g., BDNF) levels and mitochondrial markers (e.g.,&#xD;
      glucose transporte) and after a dose of ketamine or active comparator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Analytic Plans: A linear mixed model with restricted maximum likelihood estimation&#xD;
      will be used to examine changes in fatigue symptoms over the course of the trial where all&#xD;
      participants with at least a pre-dose and one post-dose measure will be included.&#xD;
      Within-subjects factors will include time with pre-dose and all other points. The interaction&#xD;
      between time and ketamine treatment will be included along with the fixed intercept. Multiple&#xD;
      test corrections (e.g., Bonferroni post hoc tests) will be used to examine differences&#xD;
      between levels of significant effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure of the study is the change in fatigue score as measured by the&#xD;
      self-reported fatigue instrument.&#xD;
