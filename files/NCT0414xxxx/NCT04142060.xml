  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main hypothesis of the study is that enzalutamide induces a significant proliferative&#xD;
      arrest in HR+/HER2-negative breast cancer falling into the PAM50 HER2-E subtype. Currently,&#xD;
      enzalutamide clinical development is ongoing in different prostate cancer indications but the&#xD;
      breast cancer development program has been discontinued. As the role of the AR in HR-positive&#xD;
      breast cancer and the predictive value of previously identified biomarker are still unclear,&#xD;
      further research is needed to effectively utilize enzalutamide in this disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A strong rationale accumulated over the years suggests that within HR+/HER2-negative breast&#xD;
      cancer, tumors falling into the PAM50 HER2-enriched subtype have androgen receptor&#xD;
      (AR)-dependency. To test this hypothesis directly in patients' tumors, we propose an&#xD;
      exploratory, open-label, non-randomized, two-cohort, multicenter, prospective, phase II study&#xD;
      which evaluates the effect of enzalutamide on proliferation after 2 weeks (14-21 days) of&#xD;
      treatment in patients with endocrine-resistant, locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      HR+/HER2-negative breast cancer. After 2 weeks (14-21 days) of treatment, patients will&#xD;
      continue enzalutamide. Exemestane will be allowed to be added to enzalutamide per&#xD;
      investigator discretion and will be administered until progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

                  post-menopausal range per local standards.&#xD;
&#xD;

             Investigator's assessment, and be a candidate for tumor biopsy according to the&#xD;
             treating institution's guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
