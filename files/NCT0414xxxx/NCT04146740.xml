  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rehabilitation in the field of Obstetrics is an emerging field worldwide although it is still&#xD;
      very much neglected in a country like Pakistan. Increasing prevalence of GDM has highlighted&#xD;
      the importance of rehabilitation in this specific area. In USA upto14% of pregnancies get GDM&#xD;
      problem, 6.8 to 10.4 % in China while in India 27.5% which is exceptionally high. Similarly&#xD;
      in Pakistan it has become a common issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many observational studies have been done to find the risk factors and causes of GDM. However&#xD;
      to the best of investigator's knowledge no experimental study have been done so far on the&#xD;
      effects of exercise on physical, physiological and psychological aspects of GDM. Hence a&#xD;
      randomized control trial is planned on diagnosed GDM patients in Fauji Foundation Hospital&#xD;
      Rawalpindi who will recieve supervised structured exercise regeme for 5 weeks and their data&#xD;
      will be recorded using reliable tools at the baseline and after 5 weeks to assess the effects&#xD;
      of exercise.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      GDM is a medical condition of high maternal glucose level which is diagnosed only when women&#xD;
      are pregnant and overcome after pregnancy. It results in various maternal and neonatal&#xD;
      complications like caeserean delivery in mothers and obesity in children. Women having GDM&#xD;
      have greater risk of diabetes and cardiovascular problems later in life which is threatening&#xD;
      for us. Obese women are at increased risk of developing GDM and it is also a risk factor for&#xD;
      developing high blood pressure and protein in the urine after 20 weeks of pregnancy that&#xD;
      condition is known as preeclampsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have shown that physically active women are less prone to develop GDM as compare&#xD;
      to those women who have sedentary life style which draws attention towards the role of&#xD;
      antenatal exercises for prevention and management of GDM and has become the first line&#xD;
      treatment in developed countries. In addition to obesity and sedentary life style other known&#xD;
      risk factors are family history, age of mother and number of children but there is no&#xD;
      definite single cause of GDM yet discovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercises programs during pregnancy are not usually practiced in our population and routine&#xD;
      domestic activities are considered as enough for fitness. We have a common myth that pregnant&#xD;
      women should not do treadmill or stationary cycle or any other aerobic activity which is&#xD;
      really wrong and resulting in problems like GDM. Women following moderate exercise programs&#xD;
      during their pregnancy have reported reduction in daily insulin administration dosage in&#xD;
      comparison with women not doing any prescribed exercise. As Gestational weight gain is a&#xD;
      major risk factor for GDM, exercises have given evidence to facilitate weight reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise programs prescribed by physical therapists during pregnancy for preventing and&#xD;
      managing GDM are considered useful and recommended by researchers and practitioners around&#xD;
      the world but in developing countries like Pakistan, women are not receiving this method of&#xD;
      treatment due to lack of awareness in general public, lack of referral system from&#xD;
      gynaecologists and obstetricians and unavailability of women health Physical therapists in&#xD;
      hospital set ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide data showing the effects of exercise in biomarkers level and give the&#xD;
      option of treatment to obstetricians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will fill the research gap in the area of rehabilitation in GDM. This will also&#xD;
      highlight the importance of women health physical therapists in obstetric conditions as there&#xD;
      is less awareness of this speciality in Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will provide the data regarding which type, intensity and duration of exercise should be&#xD;
      recommendable while treating GDM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will open new doors for researchers to do long term studies on different&#xD;
      biomarkers with different exercise types.&#xD;
