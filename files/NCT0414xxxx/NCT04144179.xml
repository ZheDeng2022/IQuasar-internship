      The primary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the safety profile of the different quadrivalent recombinant influenza&#xD;
           vaccine (RIV) formulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and seroneutralization (SN) antibody&#xD;
           responses against hemagglutinin (HA) (H1, H3, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata) antigens&#xD;
           present in the control vaccine in all groups at all timepoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe antigenic coverage in each group by assessing the HAI and SN antibody&#xD;
           responses against a panel of H3 antigens (not present in any of the vaccine&#xD;
           formulations).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe HAI and SN antibody responses in each group against each of the H3 antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the HAI and SN antibody responses for the groups with different H3 antigens&#xD;
           to the control group.&#xD;
