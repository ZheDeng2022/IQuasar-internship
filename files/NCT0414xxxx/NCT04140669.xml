  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are using Myocardial performance index (MPI) to assess fetal cardiac function&#xD;
      before, during, and after fetal surgery in order to gain more knowledge about fetal cardiac&#xD;
      function in high risk pregnancies and the relationship to outcomes of fetal surgical&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the cardiac function in fetuses with specific conditions before,&#xD;
      during, and after fetal interventions using an automated myocardial performance index. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that automated MPI can used to diagnosis and predict fetal cardiac dysfunction&#xD;
      in fetal surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound examination, including Doppler assessment, has served an axial rule in diagnosis&#xD;
      and management of complex maternal-fetal conditions. Sonographic findings have been&#xD;
      indicative of prognosis and have guided intervention at particular situations including&#xD;
      intrauterine growth restriction and fetal alloimmunization. As researchers continue to&#xD;
      investigate various sonographic parameters that would identify fetuses at increased risk of&#xD;
      adverse outcomes, which would warrant intervention, fetal cardiac function has substantially&#xD;
      attracted attention as a potential predictor of fetal status; subtle cardiac dysfunction may&#xD;
      reflect functional adaptation to fetal insult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial performance index (MPI) is a Doppler derived sonographic tool that is used to&#xD;
      assess global fetal cardiac function. Higher MPI values have been proven to indicate&#xD;
      ventricular dysfunction. Several studies have adopted the use of MPI as a part of fetal&#xD;
      echocardiography, either to study normal values among fetal population or to assess fetal&#xD;
      cardiac dysfunction in high risk pregnancy and in response to fetal intervention. Initial&#xD;
      results have correlated MPI to adverse outcomes particularly in the presence of maternal and&#xD;
      fetal disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetal surgery is a unique stressful situation in which fetal cardiac function presents a&#xD;
      critical aspect. In part, because underlying indications are commonly associated with&#xD;
      clinically relevant myocardial dysfunction e.g. twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS),&#xD;
      congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), neural tube defect (NTD) and lower urinary tract&#xD;
      obstruction (LUTO). Moreover, surgery itself may be associated with significant fetal cardiac&#xD;
      compromise. Therefore, perioperative (before, during and after the procedures) MPI may&#xD;
      present a predictive parameter of fetal and neonatal outcomes in these high risk surgeries.&#xD;
