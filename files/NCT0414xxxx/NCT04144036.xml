  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center Phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose and safety of&#xD;
      Neihulizumab for the treatment of Minnesota standard-risk aGVHD. Patients undergoing&#xD;
      allogeneic transplant with either a myeloablative or non-myeloablative conditioning regimen,&#xD;
      and recipients of all donor sources will be enrolled to this trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will receive Neihulizumab weekly, for up to four doses. Responding&#xD;
      patients, and patients with stable disease should receive all four weekly doses. Patients&#xD;
      with skin only disease that clinically progresses by one stage (e.g, from stage 2 to stage&#xD;
      3), but remains less than stage 4, will receive a minimum two doses of Neihulizumab. At 72&#xD;
      hours after the second dose, non-responding patients will be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
      Responding patients should remain on study and receive four total doses. Patients with lower&#xD;
      GI GVHD that progresses by at least one stage at 4 or more days after first dose will be&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study. All patients receiving at least 1 dose of Neihulizumab will be&#xD;
      evaluated for dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose-escalation will be conducted according to a 3+3 design. The initial dose of Neihulizumab&#xD;
      will be 6 mg/kg weekly (Dose level 1), and the highest dose administered will be 9 mg/kg&#xD;
      weekly (Dose level 2). The DLT observation period will be 28 days. Patients will be entered&#xD;
      sequentially to each dose level. For each dose level, if none of the first 3 patients at that&#xD;
      level experiences a DLT, new patients may be entered at the next higher dose level. If 1 of 3&#xD;
      patients experiences a DLT, up to 3 more patients are to be treated at that same dose level.&#xD;
      If none of the additional 3 patients at that dose level experiences a DLT, new patients may&#xD;
      be entered at the next higher dose level. However, if 1 or more of the additional 3 patients&#xD;
      experience a DLT, then no further patients are to be started at that dose level and the&#xD;
      preceding dose is the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD). If 2 of 3 of the initially dosed patients&#xD;
      experience a DLT on the first dose level, Neihulizumab will be administered at a lower dose,&#xD;
      3mg/kg weekly (Dose level -1). Finally, if 0 of 3 patients experience DLT at the highest dose&#xD;
      level, an additional 3 patients will be enrolled to ensure that 6 patients are treated at the&#xD;
      MTD. The MTD will be defined as the highest dose level at which no more than 1 of 6 treated&#xD;
      patients, experiences a DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon determination of MTD, an expansion cohort of 4-7 patients will be enrolled so that a&#xD;
      total of 10 patients are enrolled at the potential Phase II dose. This will be done to&#xD;
      preliminarily assess efficacy.&#xD;
