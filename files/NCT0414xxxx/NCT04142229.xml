  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This feasibility study is a randomized crossover trial that will compare the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of an automated insulin delivery (AID) system in patients with type 1 diabetes using a&#xD;
      Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm versus sensor augmented pump therapy&#xD;
      (SAP)/Predictive Low Glucose Suspend (PLGS), and will include different stress induction and&#xD;
      assessments over a 4 week period.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms: 1) AID for two&#xD;
      weeks and SAP/PLGS for two weeks , or 2) SAP/PLGS for two weeks and AID for two weeks. During&#xD;
      the 4-week trial, subjects will wear the Empatica E4 wristband every day to record&#xD;
      electrodermal activity, accelerometer and heartrate data. Subjects will also complete&#xD;
      logbooks to record activity and stress. During each two-week period, subjects will come to&#xD;
      the clinical center twice for stress induction tests in a medically supervised setting.&#xD;
