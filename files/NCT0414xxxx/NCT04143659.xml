    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I multicenter, open-label, dose-ranging, two-dose PK and PD study of&#xD;
      injectable LB at administered as a SQ or IM injection at 40 mg and subsequently at 80 mg SQ&#xD;
      or IM depending on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results obtained at 40 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal weight and healthy obese women will be enrolled and followed as outpatients&#xD;
      until return to ovulation and normal menses. The participation time is estimated to be&#xD;
      approximately nine months. During this study, subjects will undergo a screening period prior&#xD;
      to enrollment to confirm normal ovulatory function, and then receive active treatment with&#xD;
      injection of LB administered via IM or SQ injection. A dose of LB administered IM (40 mg) or&#xD;
      SQ (40 mg) was selected for initial evaluation for this study. Once preliminary&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results are available for the 40 mg dose groups, a&#xD;
      decision will be made whether to move forward with 80 mg LB administered IM and/or SQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo frequent study and safety evaluations and will have serum samples taken&#xD;
      to evaluate drug levels and ovulatory function, in addition to a transvaginal ultrasound&#xD;
      (TVUS) at selected visits. Follow up will continue until normal ovulatory cycles resume.&#xD;
      Based upon detailed studies in non-human primates, it is expected that most subjects will&#xD;
      resume menstrual cycles within 12 - 26 weeks after the injection. Subjects will continue to&#xD;
      be followed for one normal cycle after return of menses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This dose-ranging, PK/PD study will be conducted by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National&#xD;
      Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) at seven of the female Contraceptive&#xD;
      Clinical Trials Network (CCTN) sites in the U.S. and will enroll approximately 160 women who&#xD;
      demonstrate normal ovulatory function during the baseline cycle. Enrollment will be&#xD;
      stratified to target that 50% of the subjects have a BMI &gt;30 kg/m^2 and &lt;40 kg/m^2 and&#xD;
      approximately 50% of subjects have a BMI &lt;30 kg/m^2 in each dose group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LB injections will be administered at the study site by a trained research nurse or&#xD;
      physician. The SQ injections should be done slowly under the skin in the abdomen to ensure&#xD;
      drug is dispensed into the tissue layer between the skin and the muscle following standard&#xD;
      procedures for subcutaneous injections. For IM injections, the staff should inject LB slowly&#xD;
      in the deltoid avoiding the injection into blood vessels following standard procedures for&#xD;
      intramuscular injections. (The SQ injection may be given in a different location than the&#xD;
      abdomen and the IM injection in a different location than the deltoid with the approval of&#xD;
      the Medical Monitor.) The study subject will be observed for at least 30 minutes after the&#xD;
      injection before release from the study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The different combinations of doses and methods of administration (IM or SQ) will be given in&#xD;
      sequential stages, using two different LB concentrations (20 mg/mL or 70 mg/mL) as described&#xD;
      below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment Stage A: 40 mg IM with 20 mg/ml concentration (32 subjects [16 with BMI &lt;30&#xD;
      kg/m^2; 16 with BMI &gt;30 kg/m^2 and &lt;40 kg/m^2])&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment Stage B: 40 mg SQ with 20 mg/ml concentration (32 subjects [16 with BMI &lt;30&#xD;
      kg/m^2; 16 with BMI &gt;30 kg/m^2 and &lt;40 kg/m^2])&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment Stage B2: 40 mg SQ with 70 mg/ml concentration (32 subjects [16 with BMI &lt;30&#xD;
      kg/m^2; 16 with BMI &gt;30 kg/m^2 and &lt;40 kg/m^2])&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment Stage C: 80 mg IM with 70 mg/ml concentration (32 subjects [16 with BMI &lt;30&#xD;
      kg/m^2; 16 with BMI &gt;30 kg/m^2 and &lt;40 kg/m^2])&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment Stage D: 80 mg SQ with 70 mg/ml concentration (32 subjects [16 with BMI &lt;30&#xD;
      kg/m^2; 16 with BMI &gt;30 kg/m^2 and &lt;40 kg/m^2])&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stages will be performed sequentially; PK/PD assessments will be performed. The target&#xD;
      numbers for enrollment in each BMI category are approximate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once preliminary PK/PD results are available for the IM and SQ 40 mg dose, a decision will be&#xD;
      made for whether to move forward with 80 mg LB administered IM (Stage C) and/or SQ (Stage D).&#xD;
