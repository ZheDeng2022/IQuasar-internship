  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and drug detection of the dapivirine (DPV) vaginal ring&#xD;
      (VR) and oral Truvada in breastfeeding mother-infant pairs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mother-infant pairs will be randomly assigned to receive either the DPV VR or oral Truvada.&#xD;
      Mothers randomized to the DPV VR will use the VR continuously for approximately one month (4&#xD;
      weeks), replacing the VR each month for approximately three months (12 weeks). Mothers using&#xD;
      the Truvada tablet will take one tablet by mouth daily for approximately three months (12&#xD;
      weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits will occur at Day 0, Weeks 1 and 2, and Months 1, 2, 3, and 3.5. Study visits&#xD;
      may include behavioral assessments; product acceptability assessments; infant feeding&#xD;
      assessments; physical examinations; blood, urine, and breast milk collection; and pelvic&#xD;
      examination and specimen collection.&#xD;
