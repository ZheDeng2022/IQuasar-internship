  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the DAN-VNS study is to investigate the effects of non-invasive vagal nerve&#xD;
      stimulation on gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, bloating, and diarrhea in&#xD;
      people with diabetes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled, parallel group clinical trial,&#xD;
      which will include participants with diabetes and gastrointestinal (GI) problems. These&#xD;
      problems may be manifestations of diabetic autonomic neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomised to received either active non-invasive transcutaneous vagal nerve&#xD;
      stimulation (tVNS) or inactive sham stimulation. The study period is divided in two phases.&#xD;
      The first phase investigates the effects of short-term, high-intensity tVNS treatment on GI&#xD;
      symptoms. The second phase investigates the effects of long-term, middle-intensity tVNS&#xD;
      treatment. The primary outcome of both phases is subjective patient evaluation of GI symptoms&#xD;
      by the use of validated questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third phase, conducted only on participants, who proved to be responsive to tVNS treatment,&#xD;
      will investigate the acute endocrine and metabolic response to short-term tVNS in a&#xD;
      randomised cross-over design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, healthy volunteers will be included in a cross-sectional, descriptive study in order&#xD;
      to provide a comparable baseline dataset.&#xD;

    <time_frame>At baseline and after 7 days (period 1) of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>40 electrodes will be used to record EEG during a period of 5 minutes rest. The results will be used to model connectivity between brain centres as well as the dominating centres of brain. EEG power will be assessed in the Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma bands between 1 and 70 Hertz. Finally inverse modelling will be conducted to explore the dominating centres of brain activity.</description>
