  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conduct this project for integrating the point-of care ultrasound skill&#xD;
      (POCUS) in to the American Heart Association (AHA) Advanced Cardiopulmonary Life Support&#xD;
      (ACLS) guidelines and other critical conditions. Through lecture, head-on practice and&#xD;
      scenario simulations, junior physicians who are the participants would be more familiar with&#xD;
      the practice of POCUS in the settings of resuscitation and on the critical condition&#xD;
      patients. The investigators aimed to increased the success rate of resuscitation and improve&#xD;
      the outcomes of critical condition patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also try to make a template of ultrasound education in the board of&#xD;
      emergency medicine and critical care medicine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced life support (ALS) is an important training course for junior physicians to learn&#xD;
      how to manage critical patients. Ultrasound is an indispensable and easily accessible tool in&#xD;
      emergency departments and critical care settings. Current guidelines suggested that&#xD;
      ultrasound could be an integral part of resuscitative medicine. However, structured training&#xD;
      is needed for better efficacy of ultrasound use during clinical use. The aim of this project&#xD;
      is to incorporate ultrasound into the ALS course, including common critical diseases, such as&#xD;
      dyspnea, shock, major trauma and cardiac arrests. Junior physicians at the National Taiwan&#xD;
      University Hospital will be enrolled in this study as participants. Through lectures and&#xD;
      hand-on practice, the junior physicians could be familiar with managing critical patients&#xD;
      with ultrasound assistance. This study will be lasted for two years. In the 1st year, the&#xD;
      investigators will establish the echo-assisted ALS (eALS) training course, set up assessment&#xD;
      modules and simulation scenarios. In the 2nd year, the investigators will provide the formal&#xD;
      eALS training course for 4 to 6 times, analyze the data and establish on-line learning&#xD;
      modules. In addition, the investigators will promote the eALS course to other hospitals and&#xD;
      other countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pioneer study can provide experience of eALS training course and contribute to current&#xD;
      medical education. Moreover, it can improve decision-making process and quality of care of&#xD;
      the participants. Furthermore, the integrated on-line learning programs can be used to lessen&#xD;
      the maturation time of the participants and would provide them to other departments and&#xD;
      hospitals to improve patients' care.&#xD;
