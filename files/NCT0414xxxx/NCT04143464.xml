  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thoracic hyperkyphosis, an exaggerated curvature between the first thoracic vertebra body&#xD;
      (T1) and the 12th thoracic vertebra body (T12), has a high prevalence among older adults. The&#xD;
      cross-sectional study conducted by the Principal Investigator found 72% of older adults in&#xD;
      the Chinese community have thoracic hyperkyphosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thoracic kyphosis has been found having negative effects on self-image, physical function,&#xD;
      respiratory function, pain, balance, and gait performance. Treatment options of thoracic&#xD;
      hyperkyphosis included surgery, peptides injection, menopausal hormone therapy, bracing,&#xD;
      traditional Chinese medicine therapies, and exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The previous studies reported that different types of exercise such as strength training,&#xD;
      pilates, yoga, and corrective exercise were effective in reducing the thoracic hyperkyphosis.&#xD;
      However, the previous studies either excluded older adults who have exercise habits or lack&#xD;
      of information about participants' daily activity levels. Besides, all the group spine&#xD;
      exercise interventions in previous studies were delivered by professional trainers or&#xD;
      physical therapists in the form of face-to-face exercise classes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current RCT will be conducted to provide kyphosis-specific exercise in the form of short&#xD;
      video and face to face exercise classes as the intervention to Chinese older adults with&#xD;
      thoracic hyperkyphosis. The RCT can test the effects of such kyphosis-specific exercise&#xD;
      intervention on the angle of kyphosis, physical performance, pain, and self-image among&#xD;
      Chinese older adults with thoracic hyperkyphosis. The investigator hypotheses that older&#xD;
      adults receive kyphosis-specific exercise intervention (video and exercise class) have&#xD;
      reduced the angle of kyphosis. And older adults receive kyphosis-specific exercise&#xD;
      intervention (video and exercise class) have decreased pain, better self-image, and improved&#xD;
      overall physical performance.&#xD;

      Thoracic hyperkyphosis, an exaggerated curvature between the first thoracic vertebra body&#xD;
      (T1) and the 12th thoracic vertebra body (T12), has a high prevalence among older adults. The&#xD;
      cross-sectional study conducted by the Principal Investigator found 72% of older adults in&#xD;
      the Chinese community have thoracic hyperkyphosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thoracic kyphosis has been found having negative effects on self-image, physical function,&#xD;
      respiratory function, pain, balance, and gait performance. Treatment options of thoracic&#xD;

      The previous studies reported that different types of exercise such as strength training,&#xD;

      exercise interventions in previous studies were delivered by professional trainers or&#xD;
      physical therapists in the form of face-to-face exercise classes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise protocol used by the current RCT was based on that developed by Katzmen and&#xD;
      team. The previous studies using the same protocol reported three to five degrees decrease in&#xD;
      the angle of kyphosis. Current RCT provides kyphosis-specific exercise in the form of short&#xD;
      video and face to face exercise classes. The intervention of the proposed study contains two&#xD;
      parts. One is the group kyphosis-specific exercise class given by a certified physical&#xD;
      trainer. Another is the home practice following kyphosis-specific exercise videos. The&#xD;
      intervention arrangement is : 1. Group learning and practice: a 1-hour kyphosis-specific&#xD;
      exercise training session will be provided two times in the first week; 2. Weekly follow-up:&#xD;
      a 1-hour kyphosis-specific exercise will be conducted with reinforcement of learning and&#xD;
      remedial teaching by a certified physical trainer once a week for five consecutive weeks&#xD;
      after the group learning and practice; 3. Self-practice: the participant will following the&#xD;
      kyphosis-specific exercise videos doing self-practice every day for the whole intervention&#xD;
      period lasting 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The group kyphosis-specific exercise class will be led by a licensed physical trainer and a&#xD;
      trained assistant. The participant to instructor (assistant) ratio will no less than 5:1. The&#xD;
      content of kyphosis-specific exercise videos is the same as an exercise class.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants are to be selected from the communities located in different regions in&#xD;
      Wuhan by convenient sampling. Every potential participant will have a trained research&#xD;
      assistant responsible for explaining the RCT details with the information sheet and&#xD;
      re-assuring the respondents that data collected in the study will be kept strictly&#xD;
      confidential, and then seeking permission for conducting the screening. The potential&#xD;
      participants will be screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The eligible&#xD;
      participants will sign the written consent and accomplish the baseline questionnaire and&#xD;
      assessments (T0). After that, the participant will be randomly divided into the intervention&#xD;
      group or the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A block randomization method will be used. The investigator will randomly select block sizes&#xD;
      such as two, four, or six, to make randomization sequences for 156 participants (sample size&#xD;
      calculation results). Then randomization sequences will be printed and placed in a&#xD;
      sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelope. After older adult sign consent and finishing&#xD;
      the baseline questionnaire and assessments, the researcher will open the envelope according&#xD;
      to the numbered sequence for the grouping allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will receive a group kyphosis-specific exercise class,&#xD;
      kyphosis-specific exercise video, and a logbook. Before every exercise class, the researcher&#xD;
      will send them time and location as reminders. Class attendance is recorded every time. The&#xD;
      participants are asked to record the time of home kyphosis-specific exercise practice and&#xD;
      other daily exercises. The participants will also be encouraged to write down questions or&#xD;
      comments in the logbook. The investigator will check the logbook and respond once a week. The&#xD;
      Control group will receive a booklet introducing general health education material, and a&#xD;
      logbook recording the time of daily exercises. After the end of 6 weeks of intervention, all&#xD;
      participants will be invited to finish the postintervention assessment (T1). The data will be&#xD;
      analyzed according to the intention to treat after T0 and T1.&#xD;
