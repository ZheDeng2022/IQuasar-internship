  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this observational study researcher want to learn more about the effectiveness of drug&#xD;
      VITRAKVI (generic name: larotrectinib) and how well the drug is tolerated during routine use&#xD;
      in patients with TRK fusion cancer which is locally advanced or spread from the place where&#xD;
      it started to other places in the body. TRK fusion cancer is a term used to describe a&#xD;
      variety of common and rare cancers that are caused by a change to the NTRK (Neurotrophic&#xD;
      Tyrosine Kinase) gene called a fusion. During this fusion, an NTRK gene joins together, or&#xD;
      fuses, with a different gene. This joining results in the activation of certain proteins (TRK&#xD;
      fusion proteins), which can cause cancer cells to multiply and form a tumor. VITRAKVI is an&#xD;
      approved drug that blocks the action of the NTRK gene fusion. This study will enroll adult&#xD;
      and paediatric patients suffering from a solid tumor with NTRK gene fusion for whom the&#xD;
      decision to treat their disease with VITRAKVI has been made by their treating physicians.&#xD;
      During the study, patients' medical information such as treatment information with VITRAKVI,&#xD;
      other medication or treatments, changes in disease status and other health signs and symptoms&#xD;
      will be collected within the normal medical care by the treating doctor. Participants will be&#xD;
      observed over a period from 24 to 60 months.&#xD;
