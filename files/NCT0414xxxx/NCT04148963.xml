    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group,&#xD;
      efficacy and safety study of Staccato Loxapine or placebo in treating acute agitation in&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (manic or mixed episodes) as defined by DSM-V&#xD;
      criteria.Patients may receive up to 3 doses of study drug in a 24-hour period, depending on&#xD;
      their clinical status. The primary endpoint is the change from baseline in the PANSS&#xD;
      (Positive and Negative Symptom Scale) Excited Component (also known as PEC) score, performed&#xD;
      at 2 hours after the first dose.&#xD;

    <description>The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Excited Component (PANSS-EC) comprises 5 items associated with agitation: poor impulse control, tension, hostility, uncooperativeness, and excitement; each scored 1 (min) to 7 (max). The PANSS-EC, the sum of these 5 subscales, thus ranges from 5 to 35. Individuals were eligible if they had a PANSS-EC of ≥14 (out of 35) and a score ≥4 (out of 7) on at least 1 of the 5 items.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Male and female patients between the ages of 18 to 65 years, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;

             criteria for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3. Patients are judged to be clinical mild to moderate agitation at baseline with a&#xD;
             total value of ≥ 14, and have a score ≥4 on at least 1 of 5 items on the PANSS-EC&#xD;
             scale, and with a value of ≥3 on CGI-S scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4. Patients are judged to be cooperative by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  5. Written informed consent from patients (and/or legally acceptable representative,&#xD;
             legally acceptable representative preferred) is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Patients with agitation caused primarily by Delirium, Dpilepsy, Developmental&#xD;
             Retardation, acute alcohol or psychoactive drugs intoxication/withdrawal symptoms (as&#xD;
             per Investigator's judgment).&#xD;
&#xD;

             disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  6. Patients who are considered by the Investigator, for any reason, to be unsuitable&#xD;
             candidates for receiving inhaled loxapine, or are likely to be unable to use the&#xD;
