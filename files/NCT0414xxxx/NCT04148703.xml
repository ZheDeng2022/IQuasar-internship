  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TELEPACE is an economic evaluation that aims to determine the probability at which Home&#xD;
      Monitoring without physical examinations, could be cost effective, compared to the&#xD;
      conventional treatment by face to face consultations. Patient will be randomized in a control&#xD;
      group followed according to the current guidelines and and active group exclusively followed&#xD;
      by remote monitoring. The study will end after a 4 year follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Professional practice guidelines recommend that pacemakers be followed with at least one to&#xD;
      two in-office follow-ups per year, which is both a public health issue (the average time to&#xD;
      get a consultation with a cardiologist being 42 days) but also an economic issue considering&#xD;
      the number of patients implanted (Brignole EHJ 2013). Remote monitoring of pacemakers could&#xD;
      allow an optimization of the long-term follow-up of pacemaker recipients in hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to CRT and ICD, few studies have highlighted the economic advantage of remote&#xD;
      monitoring with PM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COMPAS study (Eur Heart J. 2012) demonstrated that remote monitoring is a safe alternative to&#xD;
      conventional care over a 2 year-follow-up. This study also demonstrated that long-term remote&#xD;
      monitoring of pacemakers decreased the number of ambulatory visits and enabled the early&#xD;
      detection of important clinical and device-related adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the study shows data up to 18 months, this is not sufficient to define the benefit of&#xD;
      telecardiology in this population of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SETAM study (Pacing Clin Electrophysiol 2017) demonstrated the benefit of remote monitoring&#xD;
      showing an earlier diagnosis and management of atrial arrhythmias and a subsequently&#xD;
      reduction of atrial fibrillation (AF) burden. The incidence and prevalence of AF is expected&#xD;
      to increase with time, resulting in significant societal and economic impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither COMPAS nor SETAM were designed as economic evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
      TELEPACE study proposes the first economic evaluation of an exclusive follow-up by&#xD;
      Home-Monitoring of patients implanted with pacemaker for a period of 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be implanted with a single or dual chamber pacemaker according the&#xD;
      implantation guidelines. Patients enrolled will be then randomized to a control group or an&#xD;
      active group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients randomized in the control group will be followed accordingto the&#xD;
           guidelines; i.e. with an in-office follow-up at 30 days post-implantation and after&#xD;
           followed with in-office follow-ups according toclinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active group: in-office follow-up at 30 days post-implantation and after by remote&#xD;
           monitoring (daily) without scheduled in-office follow-up during the study period (48&#xD;
           months). A remote FU will be planned every 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, compared to the guidelines, the patients in the active group will be followed&#xD;
      according to the guidelines; except for the in-office follow-ups annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By collecting real costs directly on health insurance reimbursement bases (SNIIRAM), this&#xD;
      study will define the medico-economic benefit of remote monitoring of pacemakers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cost-utility analysis is needed to address the question. The use of QALYs is not intended&#xD;
      to demonstrate a difference in clinical efficacy but to ensure that efficacy and costs are&#xD;
      studied simultaneously which is required in order to avoid risk inflation when differences in&#xD;
      efficacy and costs are studied sequentially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is no significant differences in QALYs (as expected) but there are savings in terms&#xD;
      of HSR then the cost-utility ratio will allow to estimate a &quot;net benefit criterion&quot; (NBC)&#xD;
      that translates QALYs into money as follows: NBC = WTP.(differences in QALYs) - (differences&#xD;
      in costs) where WTP represents the (societal) willingness to pay a QALY.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is no differences in QALYs the NBC will then reduce to a cost-minimisation calculus&#xD;
      (WTP.(diff QALYs) = 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-minimisation alone can only be used (HAS regards it as a sub-category of&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness analysis whose use has to be duly justified) provided that there is strong&#xD;
      evidence of equivalence in terms of clinical efficacy. If this is not the case, a&#xD;
      cost-utility analysis will be more relevant as it will test simultaneously for both&#xD;
      differences in efficacy and in costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the study will confrim the safety of telecardiology and evaluate patients'&#xD;
      individual preferences for the different management strategies.&#xD;
