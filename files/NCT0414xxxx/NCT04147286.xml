      This is a proof-of-concept phase IIB, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of 40 mg atorvastatin to reduce persistent lung inflammation&#xD;
      after successful TB treatment completion in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected adults measured&#xD;
      by PET/CT.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) causes 1.8 million deaths annually. Sub-Saharan Africa&#xD;
      carries the highest burden of tuberculosis (TB) with recurrent TB rates between 3-5% after&#xD;
      treatment completion accounting for 10-30% of all cases within some TB control programs.&#xD;
      Multiple risk factors have been identified to cause recurrent diseases. A recent study has&#xD;
      identified persistent lesion activity by 18F-fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography&#xD;
      (PET/CT) suggesting ongoing inflammation and Mtb mRNA suggesting ongoing infection after&#xD;
      cure. The presence of inflammation and mRNA implies that current curative treatment options&#xD;
      for pulmonary TB may not eradicate Mtb in most patients and more potent treatment options&#xD;
      including host-directed therapy (HDT) to sterilize during or after TB treatment is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mtb accumulates host cholesterol ester in foamy macrophages and utilizes cholesterol for its&#xD;
      persistence within macrophages. Statins lower cholesterol in cardiovascular diseases through&#xD;
      inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-controlling enzyme of the mevalonate pathway. In&#xD;
      addition, statins also have broad-range immune-modulatory and anti-inflammatory properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As previously reported in pre-clinical models that statins reduced Mtb burden by enhancing&#xD;
      autophagy, phagosomal maturation and decreasing pulmonary pathology, suggesting a role for&#xD;
      statins as HDT in TB. Others reported that statins as adjunctive therapy reduced the time for&#xD;
      TB cure and decreased lung pathology in mice. A recent population-based study consisting of 1&#xD;
      million people reported that statin treatment was associated with a decreased risk of active&#xD;
      TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol builds upon successful studies suggesting that directly monitoring lung&#xD;
      pathology using PET/CT correlates better with treatment outcome than culture and persistent&#xD;
      inflammation measured by PET/CT is present after tuberculosis cure in most patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a proof-of-concept phase IIB, double-blind, randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 40 mg atorvastatin per os&#xD;
      daily to reduce persistent inflammation after TB treatment completion in HIV-infected and&#xD;
      HIV-uninfected adults measured by PET/CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful, this trial has proven that statins as HDT can be safe and effective adjunctive&#xD;
      therapy to TB treatment in general and further efficacy trials can be undertaken to translate&#xD;
      the results of this trial into reduced TB relapse rate and reduced post-TB chronic lung&#xD;
      disease, thus decreased long-term TB-related morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that 12 weeks of 40 mg atorvastatin therapy per os initiated at&#xD;
      the end of successful TB treatment in HIV infected and HIV-uninfected participants will&#xD;
      significantly reduce persistent lung inflammation on PET/CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective To compare persistent lung inflammation measured by total lung glycolysis&#xD;
      (TLG) on PET/CT after 12 weeks of 40 mg atorvastatin therapy and placebo.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome measure is total lung glycolysis (TLG) on PET/CT imaging.&#xD;
Total lung glycolysis (TLG), is the total glycolytic activity (TGA) in regions of interest (both lungs). Primary outcome measurement is semi-automated using nuclear medicine medical imaging software (MIM Software Inc.). Total lung masks are drawn on every participant's PET/CT scans. Glycolytic activity is derived for each lung (SUVbw*mL), total lung glycolytic activity is the sum of both lungs TGA.</description>
