      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of a vaccine called H2NVAC before&#xD;
      surgery in treating patients with HER2 expressing ductal carcinoma in situ. H2NVAC is a&#xD;
      vaccine designed to stimulate specialized white blood cells in hopes of increasing immune&#xD;
      response and protecting against breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of multi-epitope HER2 peptide vaccine H2NVAC&#xD;
      (H2NVAC) given every 2 weeks for 4 cycles in patients with HER2 expressing ductal carcinoma&#xD;
      in situ (DCIS) prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the dose level of H2NVAC with maximum systemic and intratumoral&#xD;
      immunogenicity as measured by activated HER2-specific T lymphocytes or high-affinity&#xD;
      antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine intratumoral immunogenicity of H2NVAC in patients with HER2-expressing DCIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the complete pathological response after 4 cycles of neoadjuvant H2NVAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the systemic immunogenicity of H2NVAC in patients with HER2-expressing DCIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess changes in HER2 expression in the DCIS after 4 cycles of neoadjuvant H2NVAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess the distribution of the helper T cell response among T helper cell&#xD;
      differentiation states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of multi-epitope HER2 peptide vaccine H2NVAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to standard of care surgery, patients receive granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating&#xD;
      factor (GM-CSF) admixed with multi-epitope HER2 peptide vaccine H2NVAC intradermally on day&#xD;
      1. Treatments repeat every 14 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months after&#xD;
      surgery and optionally at 18 and 24 months after surgery.&#xD;
