  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of gilteritinib and to see how&#xD;
      well it works in combination with azacitidine and venetoclax in treating patients with&#xD;
      FLT3-mutation positive acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, or high-risk&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm that has come back (recurrent) or has&#xD;
      not responded to treatment (refractory). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as azacitidine,&#xD;
      work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Venetoclax may stop the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cancer cell survival.&#xD;
      Gilteritinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth. Giving azacitidine, venetoclax, and gilteritinib may work better compared to&#xD;
      azacitidine and venetoclax alone in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia, chronic&#xD;
      myelomonocytic leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of azacitidine,&#xD;
      venetoclax and gilteritinib in patients with relapsed/refractory FLT3-mutated acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (AML) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) or high-risk myelodysplastic&#xD;
      syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN). (Phase I) II. To determine the complete&#xD;
      remission/complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CR/CRi) rate of the regimen in&#xD;
      patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory fms-like tyrosine kinase 3&#xD;
      (FLT3)-mutated AML or CMML or high-risk MDS/MPN. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess other efficacy endpoints (CR rate, minimal residual disease negativity by flow&#xD;
      cytometry, relapse-free survival, overall survival).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess proportion of patients proceeding to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      (HSCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the safety of the combination regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the impact of baseline genomic alterations on response and survival of the&#xD;
      combination regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the impact of baseline FLT3 allelic ratio on response and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate clonal evolution from diagnosis to relapse using single-cell sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is phase I, dose-escalation study of gilteritinib followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on&#xD;
      days 1-7, venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 of cycle 1 and on days 1-21 of&#xD;
      subsequent cycles, and gilteritinib PO QD on days 1-28. Treatment of azacytidine and&#xD;
      venetoclax repeats every 28 days for up to 24 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Cycles of gilteritinib repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;

                  hepatitis C viral load&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment is&#xD;
             not anticipated to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the&#xD;

             investigator. Prior recent treatment with corticosteroids, hydroxyurea and/or&#xD;
             cytarabine (given for cytoreduction) permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women will not be eligible; women of childbearing potential should have a&#xD;
             negative pregnancy test prior to entering on the study and be willing to practice&#xD;
             methods of contraception throughout the study period and for at least 6 months after&#xD;
             the last dose of study drugs. Women do not have childbearing potential if they have&#xD;
             had a hysterectomy or are postmenopausal without menses for 12 months. In addition,&#xD;
             men enrolled on this study should understand the risks to any sexual partner of&#xD;
             childbearing potential and should practice an effective method of birth control&#xD;
             throughout the study period and for at least 4 months after the last dose of study&#xD;
             drugs. Lactating women (or those planning to breastfeed) should not breastfeed during&#xD;
             treatment of gilteritinib and for at least 2 months after the last dose of&#xD;
             gilteritinib&#xD;
