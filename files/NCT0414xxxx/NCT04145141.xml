      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Liver Cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. It is&#xD;
      the cancer with the fastest rising incidence and mortality in the United States. Researchers&#xD;
      want to learn more about liver cancer to help them design better treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better understand liver cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older who have liver cancer and had or are planning to have immune therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a review of their medical records. They will be asked&#xD;
      about their medical history and test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will come to the NIH Clinical Center. During this visit, their medical records,&#xD;
      test results, imaging studies, and tissue samples (if available) will be gathered.&#xD;
      Participants will learn the results of a test to see if they have any mutations known to be&#xD;
      connected to cancer. They will learn if there are treatment options for them. Participants&#xD;
      will give blood, urine, and stool samples or rectal swabs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will not have follow-up visits just for this study. If they join another NIH&#xD;
      research study and have visits for this other study, their medical records; test results; and&#xD;
      blood, urine, and stool samples may be collected. This will occur about every 3 months. If&#xD;
      they have a biopsy or surgery on another study or as part of treatment and there is leftover&#xD;
      tissue, researchers would like to collect some of that tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted every 6 months by phone or e-mail. They will be asked about&#xD;
      their health. They will provide any medical records, test results, and imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed on this study for life.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary liver cancer (PLC) is the 2nd most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and&#xD;
      the one cancer with the fastest rising incidence and mortality in the U.S. PLC consists of&#xD;
      two main histological subtypes, i.e., hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma&#xD;
      (CCA), in which diagnoses and treatment decisions are solely based on their baseline clinical&#xD;
      features. However, whether these subtypes are truly distinct or share some fundamental&#xD;
      features which can be pursued to improve clinical management is currently unclear. In&#xD;
      addition, chronic liver diseases, due to complex etiologies such as viral hepatitis, alcohol&#xD;
      consumption, chemicals, parasites or dietary factors, underlie and contribute to liver&#xD;
      damage, increasing the risk of HCC and CCA development and progression. Consequently, PLC is&#xD;
      clinically and biologically heterogeneous which has impeded biological assessment and&#xD;
      clinical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite considerable efforts towards improving diagnosis and development of new treatment&#xD;
      modalities, the improvement of PLC patient survival is minimal. For certain patients at early&#xD;
      or intermediate disease stages, resection and percutaneous local ablation or Transarterial&#xD;
      chemoembolization are available. However, the majority of patients present at advanced stages&#xD;
      of disease, where the current gold standard of treatment is sorafenib, providing only a&#xD;
      minimal improvement in survival time. PLC therefore remains among the most difficult-to-treat&#xD;
      malignancies, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 15% in the United States. Thus, it is&#xD;
      imperative that new treatment modalities are developed to limit cancer development and treat&#xD;
      advanced PLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunotherapy (IO) is a promising new approach in PLC treatment. Alterations of the immune&#xD;
      system, a component of the revised hallmarks of cancer, is recognized as a central player in&#xD;
      carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Thus, strategies to inhibit or re-direct the immune&#xD;
      response to the presence of tumors are currently being employed or developed.&#xD;
      Immune-checkpoint inhibitors have shown promise in clinical trials of several solid tumors.&#xD;
      Of particular note are monoclonal antibody-based therapy to block immune-inhibitory&#xD;
      molecules, including programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), programmed cell death 1 ligand 1&#xD;
      (PDL-1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4), which block anti-tumor T cell activity.&#xD;
      However, the capacity of these therapies to reduce incidence and progression of PLC are still&#xD;
      relatively unknown. Currently, several trials are underway to study the impact of immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitors as single agents or in combination with targeted therapy, on PLC&#xD;
      development and outcome. Initial findings from Phase I/II clinical trials of PLC are&#xD;
      promising but suggest that only certain patients respond to such treatment regimens while&#xD;
      others do not or suffer from resistance/relapse. At the moment, it is difficult to determine&#xD;
      which patient may benefit from immune therapy, due in large part to the lack of large&#xD;
      comprehensive studies, biobank resources of specimens and biospecimen collection in clinical&#xD;
      trial protocols, which deter our ability to understand and define critical genomic or genetic&#xD;
      factors that contribute to patient response. Hence, we plan to collect PLC patient specimens&#xD;
      and clinical data from those undergoing immunotherapies at NIH Clinical Center and a few&#xD;
      extramural clinical sites to develop predictors for (a) response or resistance to&#xD;
      immunotherapy and (b) acquired resistance to immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish a biospecimen repository for genomic, genetic and epigenetic analysis to study&#xD;
      the biology of PLC development and progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with histologically/ultrasound/imaging confirmed or suspicious lesions of HCC or&#xD;
      CCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with planned or a history of at least 1 dose of immunotherapy for HCC or CCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age &gt;= 18 years old at date of study consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a long-term multi-center study to comprehensively study patients with primary&#xD;
      liver cancer (PLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will provide clinical information (including medical history, clinical tests,&#xD;
      imaging studies and reports, surgical pathology reports, genetic test results).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue samples, blood, urine and fecal samples will be obtained from participants during this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Broad spectrum of scientific experiments, including genomics, metabolome, microbiome and&#xD;
      immune monitoring will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local physicians will be provided with test results of genomics panel evaluation (TruSight&#xD;
      Oncology 500 (TSO-500).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since long-term follow-up of individuals with PLC is a major feature of the study, local&#xD;
      sites intend to maintain active contact with study subjects for as long as possible. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed throughout the course of their illnesses, with particular attention to&#xD;
      patterns of disease recurrence and progression, response to therapies and duration of&#xD;
      responses. National death index data can also be utilized to obtain patient outcome&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
