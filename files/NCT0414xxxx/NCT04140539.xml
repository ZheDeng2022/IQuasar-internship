    <textblock>
      The safety and efficacy of OTL-101 for the treatment of patients with ADA- SCID have been&#xD;
      established in previous clinical trials. The purpose of the current study is to treat at&#xD;
      least 3 ADA-SCID patients with OTL-101 prepared by the commercial manufacturing process in&#xD;
      order to facilitate collection of data necessary for final manufacturing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will focus on monitoring safety and engraftment, through the evaluation of&#xD;
      parameters describing immunological recovery, ADA enzyme activity and persistence of gene&#xD;
      marking (VCN) at 6 months and 12 months. After completion of 12 months of follow-up on the&#xD;
      current study protocol, subjects will be enrolled in an observational long-term follow-up&#xD;
      study, in order to monitor the long-term safety of treatment with OTL-101.&#xD;
