  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study protocol is to evaluate the feasibility of biopsies using the new&#xD;
      system called Archimedes® in 12 patients with solitary pulmonary nodules (SPN) suspicious of&#xD;
      malignancy not accessible through current bronchoscopy techniques.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to the improvement of screening techniques, the detection of peripheral and isolated&#xD;
      lesions is an increasingly frequent situation. However these SPN cause difficulties in&#xD;
      obtaining a sample. Indeed, current endoscopic techniques remain insufficient in terms of&#xD;
      performance. Moreover, computed tomography-guided percutaneous needle biopsy despite a very&#xD;
      good sensitivity has many limitations related to the size of the lesions, the accessibility&#xD;
      and important complications. The Archimedes® system is an improved version of LungPoint® and&#xD;
      combines 3D reconstruction of chest images with intraoperative radioscopy. It uses a catheter&#xD;
      to access through the bronchial wall the pulmonary parenchyma and navigate to the SPN. All&#xD;
      included patients will receive anesthesia consultation, biological assessment and chest CT&#xD;
      scan in thin sections. A surgical treatment will always be planned after presentation of the&#xD;
      file in a meeting of multidisciplinary consultation of thoracic oncology. The Archimedes®&#xD;
      procedure will be performed during a bronchoscopy under general anesthesia. Immediate&#xD;
      monitoring consisted in a chest x-ray 1hour after the procedure. Patients' participation in&#xD;
      the study will stop once they benefit from their thoracic surgery&#xD;

             tumor or metastasis of another solid tumor whose largest diameter is greater than or&#xD;
             equal to 8 mm):&#xD;
