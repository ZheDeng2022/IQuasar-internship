  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with one or more organ failure (heart, lung) require hospitalization in intensive&#xD;
      care where these failures can be managed. Nearly 30% of patients in intensive care units are&#xD;
      hospitalized for acute respiratory distress (lung failure). This failure occurs in about 20%&#xD;
      of postoperative patient, but it can also occur in the context of a pathology specific to the&#xD;
      lung or after weaning of mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore interesting to develop several techniques to provide oxygen to these patients&#xD;
      with the aim in particular to avoid the use of intubation (insertion of a tube into the&#xD;
      trachea to achieve artificial ventilation). For the past ten years, High-Flow Nasal Canula&#xD;
      (HFNC) has developed. This technique reduces the need for intubation but the studies are&#xD;
      contradictory, however they agree on its ease of use and the few risks associated with it.&#xD;
      The principle of this technique is to deliver a humidified and heated gas mixture at a high&#xD;
      rate through large nasal cannula. The advantage of this device is its non-invasive and the&#xD;
      possibility of administering a large amount of oxygen. There is a certain craze for this&#xD;
      oxygenation technique despite few scientific studies in the literature. However, it requires&#xD;
      the expertise of the medical and paramedical team so as not to delay intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to carry out an observational study (without any modification of&#xD;
      the usual practices) with epidemiological aim in order to make an inventory of the modes of&#xD;
      use of the HFNC, in particular on its frequency of use and on its duration of use per patient&#xD;
      hospitalized in intensive care. The investigators will recruit all HFNC patients in intensive&#xD;
      care units (20 centers) (30 patients / center): 15 after weaning of mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      and 15 others for other reasons. Patients will be followed every day and up to 48 hours after&#xD;
      removal of the HFNC.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Oxygen therapy is one of the most prescribed treatments in medicine, especially in intensive&#xD;
      care patients. It is an adjuvant therapy as a respiratory support whose goal is to maintain&#xD;
      optimal ventilation and oxygenation and to improve alveolar gas exchange. HFNC is in full&#xD;
      swing and increasingly used as an alternative to standard oxygen therapy in patients with&#xD;
      acute respiratory failure (ARF). This nasal oxygenation technique, humidified and heated at&#xD;
      high flow, initially developed in pediatrics is a simple and effective alternative for adults&#xD;
      in IRA hospitalized in intensive care. The OHD makes it possible to deliver a gas mixture&#xD;
      with a maximum flow rate of 70 l/min of oxygen via a generator connected to a chamber for&#xD;
      humidifying and heating gases at 37 °. OHD offers several physiological benefits that could&#xD;
      encourage its use: administration of a high oxygen-inspired fraction (FiO2), generation of a&#xD;
      low level of flow-dependent PEP, reduction of nasopharyngeal resistance, and wash-rinse of&#xD;
      the anatomic dead space, thanks to the high nasal flow. It is also a comfortable technique&#xD;
      compared to the NIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This means of oxygen therapy is increasingly used in routine practice in our patients&#xD;
      admitted to intensive care for non-hypercapnic respiratory insufficiency, especially since&#xD;
      this reason for admission represents approximately 30% of our patients. HFNC is interesting&#xD;
      because of the pathophysiological advantages mentioned above, especially in patients with ARI&#xD;
      who are hypoxemic. These patients have a greater respiratory work with an increase in&#xD;
      inspiratory flow of up to 30-40l/min on average and exceed 60l/min or 120l/min. This flow&#xD;
      rate can not be compensated by conventional oxygen therapy, limited to 15 l / min, which is&#xD;
      insufficient to guarantee a constant and high oxygen concentration during inspiration, hence&#xD;
      the interest of OHD capable of delivering a maximum flow rate of 70 l/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its use has grown exponentially since 2015, the year of publication of the multicenter study&#xD;
      FLORALI, comparing different methods of oxygen therapy (OHD vs conventional oxygen therapy vs&#xD;
      NIV / OHD) in 310 patients with acute non-hypercapnic respiratory failure (2). In this study,&#xD;
      the primary endpoint is the rate of intubation. There was no significant difference (p =&#xD;
      0.17) between the 3 techniques used: OHD (37.7%), conventional oxygenation (46.8%) and VNI /&#xD;
      OHD (50%), despite a clear decrease in mortality at J90 (p = 0.02) in the OHD group (12%)&#xD;
      compared to the other 2 strategies but this is a secondary endpoint. However, in the most&#xD;
      hypoxemic patients (P / F ≤ 200), post-hoc analysis found a significantly lower intubation&#xD;
      rate (p = 0.009) in patients treated with OHD alone (35%) compared with conventional oxygen&#xD;
      therapy group (53%) and NIV / OHD (58%), with the same observation regarding the number of&#xD;
      days without mechanical ventilation. These authors also published a post-hoc analysis of this&#xD;
      study. They analyzed the effect of OHD in 82 immunocompromised patients and concluded that&#xD;
      OHD patients had a better prognosis compared to those treated with conventional oxygen&#xD;
      therapy or NIV. They found a significantly lower intubation rate (p = 0.04) in the HFNC group&#xD;
      (31%) compared to conventional oxygen therapy (43%) and NIV (65%). These results should be&#xD;
      interpreted with caution since Lemiale et al., In a large multicenter randomized study, did&#xD;
      not show a significant difference in morbidity-mortality intubation in 374 immunosuppressed&#xD;
      IRA patients treated with NIV (HFNC alone or NIV / HFNC) or standard oxygen therapy. These&#xD;
      results are interesting, although they are post-hoc analyzes and secondary judgment criteria.&#xD;
      A multicenter French randomized study was published recently and confirms the results of the&#xD;
      Lemiale team (HFNC is no better than standard oxygen therapy in immunocompromised patients).&#xD;
      For these patients, another multicenter randomized controlled French trial is underway&#xD;
      (NCT02978300).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently more and more patients, admitted for non-hypercapnic ARF, are treated with HFNC in&#xD;
      first intention as well as post-extubation, because of its pathophysiological advantages, its&#xD;
      comfort and its simplicity of setting up and use, despite the result of a single multicenter&#xD;
      randomized study, positive only on secondary endpoints and post-hoc analyzes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a recent meta-analysis, by Corley et al., Of randomized studies on the use of&#xD;
      HFNC concluded in an insufficient level of evidence to recommend HFNC in ARF patients with a&#xD;
      risk of delayed intubation of these patient. It should be noted, however, that the studies&#xD;
      analyzed are heterogeneous in terms of patients, mode of administration of HFNC and etiology&#xD;
      of ARF. Some authors are interested in parameters such as the ROX index to target patients at&#xD;
      risk or not to progress to intubation in patients treated with HFNC which would secure its&#xD;
      use and guide clinicians. Studies are underway to investigate the benefit of this device in&#xD;
      patients with chronic respiratory failure admitted for hypercapnic ARF compared to standard&#xD;
      oxygen between NIV sessions (NCT03406572). These authors also published a study concerning&#xD;
      the use of HFNC in pre-oxygenation compared with BAVU and demonstrated a decrease in&#xD;
      desaturation in pre-intubation. However, other authors have moderated these results in&#xD;
      another randomized study with a different methodology, especially in terms of the use of OHD&#xD;
      in apneic oxygenation (absence of mandibular sub-luxation). These results still show the&#xD;
      heterogeneity of the practices as for its use in pre intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding its use in weaning mechanical ventilation, HFNC is increasingly used especially in&#xD;
      post-operative without real benefit proven in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For example, in the University Hospital of Nantes in the Intensive Resuscitation Medicine&#xD;
      (ICU) department, in 2017, 110 patients in ARF, were treated by HFNC out of 191 patients&#xD;
      admitted for IRA, or 58% (institutional figures). There is a certain craze for this&#xD;
      oxygenation technique in intensive care despite the low level of evidence, hence the interest&#xD;
      of our epidemiological study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a prospective, observational, multicentric (20 centers), epidemiological French study&#xD;
      whose main objective is to evaluate the incidence of HFNC use. In order to calculate the&#xD;
      incidence of use of the HFNC, The investigators will ask the different centers to provide us&#xD;
      with the number of patients hospitalized in intensive care during the period of inclusion.&#xD;
      the secondary objectives are: evaluation of morbidity and mortality in intensive care:&#xD;
      intubation rate, weaning failure, weaning mode of HFNC. Epidemiological data: modalities of&#xD;
      use, duration of use and indications.&#xD;
