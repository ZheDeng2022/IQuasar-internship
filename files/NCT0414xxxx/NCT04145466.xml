    <textblock>
      A person's genetic code is believed to affect how much weight he/she will lose during diets&#xD;
      that vary in carbohydrate and dietary fat content. 'Carbohydrate responders' are hypothesized&#xD;
      to lose more weight on diets that are high in carbohydrates, as compared to high in fats.&#xD;
      'Fat responders' are hypothesized to lose more weight on diets that are high in dietary fat,&#xD;
      as compared to high in carbohydrates. The purpose of the proposed study is to test these&#xD;
      hypotheses in a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and its comorbidities are major public health challenges. To combat the obesity&#xD;
      pandemic, many weight-loss strategies have been studied, often emphasizing either high&#xD;
      carbohydrate (low fat) diets or high fat (low carbohydrate) diets. Mean weight loss&#xD;
      differences between high-carbohydrate and high-fat diets that induce equal caloric deficits&#xD;
      have been reported to be small; however, the individual weight loss response varies&#xD;
      substantially within diet groups, suggesting that different individuals react differently to&#xD;
      high-carbohydrate or high-fat diets. This assumption is supported by retrospective data&#xD;
      showing that participants with carbohydrate-responsive polymorphisms lost 2-3 times more&#xD;
      weight when assigned to a high-carbohydrate diet compared to a high-fat diet, and vice versa&#xD;
      for those with dietary fat-responsive polymorphisms. Conversely, a recent randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial aimed to determine the effect of a healthy high-fat diet (high in unsaturated fats) vs.&#xD;
      a healthy high-carbohydrate diet (high in whole-grain foods) on 12-month weight change but&#xD;
      did not find significant differences between the two groups and failed to find the&#xD;
      hypothesized association between genotype patterns and weight loss induced by diets that&#xD;
      varied in fat and carbohydrate content. However, an important caveat of their approach is&#xD;
      that the single nucleotide polymorphisms selected by the investigators had not been&#xD;
      previously associated with obesity or with dietary responses, which may explain their lack of&#xD;
      predictive value in identifying differences in inter-individual responses. In addition, the&#xD;
      fat composition of the diets was relatively high in both high- and low-fat groups. The&#xD;
      inconsistent findings in the literature indicate a need for further research to determine if&#xD;
      genetic factors affect weight loss when exposed to diets that vary in carbohydrates and&#xD;
      dietary fats.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this randomized controlled parallel arm trial is to test the following&#xD;
      hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1 will test if participants assigned to the diet that corresponds to their&#xD;
      genotype lose more weight than those assigned to a diet inconsistent with their genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2 will analyze the fat responders and carbohydrate responders separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 2a: Fat responders will lose more weight on the high-fat diet vs. the&#xD;
           high-carbohydrate diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 2b: Carbohydrate responders will lose more weight on the high-carbohydrate&#xD;
           diet vs. the high-fat diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carbohydrate responders and fat responders will be randomized to one of the following two&#xD;
      diets:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A high-quality high-carbohydrate diet that is rich in whole-grain foods, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A high-quality high-fat diet that is rich in unsaturated fats and oils&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Food Cravings</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Food cravings are assessed via the total score of the 33-item Food Craving Inventory (FCI). The FCI is scaled in a frequency format, assessing the frequency with which an individual experiences a craving for a particular food. All items are scored in the following manner: Never = 1, Rarely = 2, Sometimes = 3, Often = 4, &amp; Always = 5.&#xD;
Change in food cravings is calculated as FCI total score at 12 weeks minus FCI total score at baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change in Fat Preference Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Preference for high- versus low-fat foods is measured with the Food Preference Questionnaire (FPQ) and a fat preference index is calculated as the mean rating for high-fat foods divided by the mean rating for low-fat foods. Values greater than 1.0 reflect a higher fat preference, and values less than 1.0 reflect a lower fat preference. Items in the FPQ are rated on a 9-point Likert scale with the following anchors: 1 = dislike extremely; 5 = neutral, neither like nor dislike; 9 = like extremely.&#xD;
Change in Fat Preference Index is calculated as Fat Preference Index at 12 weeks minus Fat Preference Index at baseline.</description>
