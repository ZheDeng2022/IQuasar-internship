    <textblock>
      This study is a validation study to evaluate efficacy of a neuroplasticity-based,&#xD;
      computerized cognitive training program INHANCE (Improving Neurological Health in Aging via&#xD;
      Neuroplasticity-based Computerized Exercise) to improve neurological and neuropsychological&#xD;
      health in older adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of a targeted speed and&#xD;
      alertness training program (INHANCE) to improve cognition in healthy older adults, as&#xD;
      evidenced by standard measures of cognition, and positive improvements in the neuromodulatory&#xD;
      cholinergic system as measured via positron-emission tomography (PET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will employ a double-blind, parallel-arm, placebo-controlled, randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial design comprised of a treatment group using INHANCE, a computerized program&#xD;
      that trains speed of processing and attention, compared to an active control group using&#xD;
      computer games in 90 healthy older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 108 participants will be consented to ensure the successful completion of 90&#xD;
      participants (post 20% attrition). Participants will then complete the Screening (V0)&#xD;
      assessments to determine eligibility. Following inclusion, participants will complete the&#xD;
      Baseline (V1) assessments, PET imaging and structural MRI scan; participants will then be&#xD;
      randomized into either the INHANCE training or Computer Games, and will engage in&#xD;
      approximately 35 hours of program use for the 10-week intervention period. Approximately&#xD;
      halfway through the intervention period (~5 weeks), participants will complete Interim (V2)&#xD;
      assessments to be compared to the Post-Intervention assessments. Following the 10-week&#xD;
      intervention, participants will complete a Post-Intervention (V3) assessment and PET imaging&#xD;
      to evaluate changes in cognitive function. Participants will then stop using their assigned&#xD;
      program for 3 months and return for a Follow-up (V4) end-of-study assessment to evaluate the&#xD;
      endurance of changes in cognitive function in the absence of further program use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol will be conducted in accordance with the protocol submitted to and approved by&#xD;
      the National Institute on Health (NIH), and subject to Institutional Review Board review and&#xD;
      approval prior to implementation.&#xD;

    <description>The EXAMINER is a computer based battery of executive function tests which yields a total or 'composite' score to represent global executive functioning. Executive composite scores can range from -3.0 to 3.0 with higher scores corresponding to better executive functioning, and negative scores indicating impairment.</description>

    <description>This is a computerized assessment that serves as a positive control for task learning. A single exposure duration (in milliseconds) required for users to achieve approximately 80% criterion accuracy in identification of central and peripheral targets. The score range is 10ms - 5000ms (lower scores indicate better performance).</description>

    <description>This is a computerized assessment that serves as a positive control for task learning. A single target frequency required for users to achieve at least 80% accuracy in target and foil identification for a pre-specified target image presented among similar foil images. The score range is 1-7 corresponding to 40%, 35%, 30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, and 10% target frequencies (higher scores indicate better performance).</description>
