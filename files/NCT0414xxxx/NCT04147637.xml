  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advanced glucose monitoring systems have revolutionized diabetes care and enabled people with&#xD;
      diabetes to achieve better diabetes control with reduced risk of hypoglycaemia. Continuous&#xD;
      glucose monitoring (CGM) systems provide real-time glucose monitoring and alarms when glucose&#xD;
      approaches extreme readings (hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia) or when the change in glucose&#xD;
      is rapid. All available CGM systems, except Dexcom G6, require daily calibrations with&#xD;
      capillary glucose readings in order to attain accuracy of glucose readings. Decom G6 system&#xD;
      is not widely accessible and only available in certain countries. Flash glucose monitoring&#xD;
      systems (Flash) provide glucose readings when users actively scan their sensors. FreeStyle&#xD;
      Libre (FSL) is the only Flash glucose monitoring system currently available in market. FSL is&#xD;
      factory calibrated and sensors are ready to use after placement and initiation. The two main&#xD;
      differences between Flash and CGM are user interaction and the alarm facility. While CGM&#xD;
      provide real-time glucose readings, Flash is user-dependent for actively scanning and&#xD;
      understanding the readings. Moreover, CGM systems provide alarms for low or high glucose and&#xD;
      for rapid glucose changes, while Flash does not routinely provide alarms. This is&#xD;
      particularly relevant when patients have impaired or lost hypoglycaemia awareness. CGM&#xD;
      systems are costlier compared to Flash, which has contributed to the wider adoption of FSL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several Bluetooth adjuncts have been introduced to market for FSL. These devices attach to&#xD;
      Libre sensor and connect to the user's mobile phone via Bluetooth. This enables continuous&#xD;
      and real-time feed of glucose readings from the sensor to patient's mobile phone, which&#xD;
      enables a wide range of customizable alarms for high and low glucose levels and for rapid&#xD;
      glucose changes. This setup also enables calibration of Libre sensor with capillary glucose&#xD;
      which, anecdotally, has been reported to improve sensor accuracy. None of these adjuncts have&#xD;
      been validated clinically. FSL with Bluetooth adjunct such as MiaoMiao remain cheaper than&#xD;
      current CGM options and could be more accessible in some countries than CGM. However, without&#xD;
      robust evidence to support effectiveness and safety of such setup it is not possible to&#xD;
      recommend this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Objective of this study is to determine whether FSL with Bluetooth Adjunct is superior to&#xD;
      FSL alone in accuracy and reduction of hypoglycaemia burden.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-label, crossover, single center, randomized controlled trial of FreeStyle Libre with&#xD;
      MiaoMiao Bluetooth transmitter adjunct with calibrations (FSL-M) compared to FreeStyle Libre&#xD;
      alone (FSL-A) in people with T1DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following informed written consent, subjects will be randomized to either FSL-M group using&#xD;
      FSL with Miaomio and Tomato App premium version, or FSL-A with Libre Link app (stage 1).&#xD;
      Subjects will spend 8 weeks in the assigned group followed by 2 weeks washout then subjects&#xD;
      will switch over to the other group for further 8 weeks (stage 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While in FSL-M, subjects will be asked to calibrate FSL with daily capillary glucose values&#xD;
      using Contour Plus, or on days 1, 2, 4, 8, 13 of sensor life. Alarms for low glucose&#xD;
      (&lt;3.9mmol/L, &lt;70mg/dL) and high glucose (&gt;13.9mmol/L, 250mg/dL) will be set in Tomato App.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7-point capillary glucose profiles will be carried out by subjects in both groups on days&#xD;
      2/3, 5/6, 9/10, 13/14 of each sensor life to enable paired comparison with sensor values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have routine labs at randomization, end of stage 1, and end of stage 2. All&#xD;
      subjects will be asked to complete the following questionnaires: GOLD, Problem Areas in&#xD;
      Diabetes (PAID) and Diabetes Quality of Life (DQOL) at randomization, at end of stage1 and&#xD;
      end of stage 2. The group randomized to FSL-M at stage 1 will have qualitative interview at&#xD;
      randomization, end of stage 1 and end of stage 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events will be collected including, but not limited to, all hypoglycaemia,&#xD;
      diabetic ketoacidosis, hospital admissions for any reason, and device related skin reaction&#xD;
      for the duration of the study in all subjects in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will be carried out on glucose data retrieved from Libre view web-platform and&#xD;
      Tomato App downloads in addition to Contour Plus meter downloads.&#xD;
