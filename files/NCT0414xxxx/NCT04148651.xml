    <textblock>
      Subjects with vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS) will undergo fractional carbon dioxide (CO2)&#xD;
      laser treatment to the vulvar area. Subjects will be evaluated for changes in clinical signs&#xD;
      and architectural changes associated with VLS at designated follow-ups to 1-year post&#xD;
      treatment series.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, non-randomized, single-group assignment, interventional clinical&#xD;
      trial. Female subjects with vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS) supported by histologic findings on&#xD;
      biopsy and/or clinical signs on physical examination and recalcitrant to mid- to high-potency&#xD;
      steroid therapy, will undergo up to 5 monthly treatments to the vulva with a fractional CO2&#xD;
      laser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will assess clinical signs and architectural changes associated with VLS.&#xD;
      Baseline measurements will be compared to follow-up at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12&#xD;
      months after the final treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will self report sexual function using a validated FSFI Questionnaire at baseline&#xD;
      and at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups.&#xD;

    <measure>Average Scores for Clinical Signs Present at Baseline as Assessed by the Investigators</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 , 6 and 12 months after the final treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical signs of VLS (loss of elasticity, sclerosis, lichenification, whitening, parchment-like skin, fissures, extent of the disease, erosions, ulcerations, hyperkeratosis, excoriation, telangiectasia) were each separately assessed by the investigator, using a 4-point scale (0=not present, 1=mild, 2=moderate or 3=severe) for each subject at baseline and at the follow-up visits. The scores of all clinical signs present at baseline were then averaged at each follow-up visit to report a total score for change in clinical signs. This total score was compared to the baseline total score. A lower score than at baseline indicated improvement.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Scores for Architectural Changes Present at Baseline as Assessed by the Investigators</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 , 6 and 12 months after the final treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The architectural changes of VLS (labial fusion, clitoral hood fusion, narrowing of the introitus, anterior changes, perianal involvement, formation of posterior commissure bands) were each separately assessed by the investigator, using a 4-point scale (0=not present, 1=mild, 2=moderate or 3=severe) for each subject at baseline and at the follow-up visits. The scores of all architectural changes present at baseline were then averaged at each follow-up visit to report a total score that was compared to the baseline total score. A lower score than at baseline indicated improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in The Mean Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) Score at Follow-up Visits</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months and 6 months after the final treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The validated Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) was used to compare sexual function to baseline. FSFI score, a 19-item validated questionnaire assesses domains of sexual function, including desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain, in addition to providing an overall score regarding sexual function. The aggregated FSFI score is a sum of weighted answers for each of the 19 items in the questionnaire, with a maximum score 36.0 (high level of sexual functional) and minimum score of 2.0 (low level of sexual functional). Subjects completed the FSFI questionnaire at baseline or before first treatment, and at the 3- and 6-month follow-up visits. The mean change in total FSFI score compared to baseline was calculated. A positive change (above 0 points) indicates improvement in sexual function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6 and 12 months after the final treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate Subject satisfaction at 3, 6 and 12 months post-last treatment visit, using a satisfaction scale [(-2) Very dissatisfied, (-1) Dissatisfied, (0) Uncertain, (1) Satisfied, (2) Very satisfied]. The analysis quantify the percentage of Subject satisfaction (score 1 or 2)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Associated Pain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th monthly treatments post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects underwent 3-5 monthly treatments and reported discomfort associated with treatment on a 10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS) of 0 = no pain to 10 = worst possible pain, immediately after each treatment. The outcome presented here is the mean grade of discomfort/pain associated with all treatments. Lower value presents lower treatment-associated discomfort. Since patients received 3-5 monthly treatments these values were collected at each treatment over a period of 2 to 4 months for each patient.</description>

FSFI score, a 19-item validated questionnaire assesses domains of sexual function, including desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain, in addition to providing an overall score regarding sexual function. The aggregated FSFI score is a sum of weighted answers for each of the 19 items in the questionnaire.</description>

        <description>The clinical signs of VLS (loss of elasticity, sclerosis, lichenification, whitening, parchment-like skin, fissures, extent of the disease, erosions, ulcerations, hyperkeratosis, excoriation, telangiectasia) were each separately assessed by the investigator, using a 4-point scale (0=not present, 1=mild, 2=moderate or 3=severe) for each subject at baseline and at the follow-up visits. The scores of all clinical signs present at baseline were then averaged at each follow-up visit to report a total score for change in clinical signs. This total score was compared to the baseline total score. A lower score than at baseline indicated improvement.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and 3 , 6 and 12 months after the final treatment</time_frame>

Due to delayed enrollment at one site and scheduling deviations with the COVID-19 pandemic, at 3- and 6-month visits, 11 subjects (89 clinical signs) were assessed.

        <title>Change From Baseline in The Mean Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) Score at Follow-up Visits</title>
        <description>The validated Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) was used to compare sexual function to baseline. FSFI score, a 19-item validated questionnaire assesses domains of sexual function, including desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain, in addition to providing an overall score regarding sexual function. The aggregated FSFI score is a sum of weighted answers for each of the 19 items in the questionnaire, with a maximum score 36.0 (high level of sexual functional) and minimum score of 2.0 (low level of sexual functional). Subjects completed the FSFI questionnaire at baseline or before first treatment, and at the 3- and 6-month follow-up visits. The mean change in total FSFI score compared to baseline was calculated. A positive change (above 0 points) indicates improvement in sexual function.</description>
        <time_frame>3 months and 6 months after the final treatment</time_frame>
        <population>At Baseline, 12 patients completed FSFI questionnaires. At the 3-month visit, 11 subjects completed the FSFI (one subject misses the visit). At the 6-month follow-up, 12 subjects completed the FSFI (one subject missed her visit but provided her self-assessments remotely).</population>
