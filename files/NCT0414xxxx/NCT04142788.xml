  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will investigate the potential for patiromer-facilitated use of higher doses of&#xD;
      mineralocorticoid antagonists in addition to standard care (compared to standard care alone)&#xD;
      to improve congestion, well-being and mortality in people who have worsening congestion due&#xD;
      to heart failure and hyperkalaemia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with worsening congestive heart failure may benefit from treatment with higher doses&#xD;
      of MRA if they are administered patiromer to treat or prevent hyperkalaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants with worsening heart failure will be identified by their care teams&#xD;
      and asked to participate in a research registry. If eligible, registry participants will be&#xD;
      asked to take part in the RELIEHF randomised trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomised trial will investigate whether patiromer allows patients with worsening heart&#xD;
      failure to be titrated to higher doses of MRA (predominantly spironolactone). Participants&#xD;
      assigned to patiromer may be titrated to 200mg/day spironolactone or the highest licensed&#xD;
      dose of eplerenone (50mg/day). Participants who are not assigned to patiromer should have&#xD;
      titration to guideline-recommended doses of MRA attempted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry and trial will take place in about 100 secondary care sites across the UK. At&#xD;
      the end of the trial, participants will be followed through their electronic medical records&#xD;
      via record linkage for up to 10 years&#xD;

                  they have severe hyperkalaemia requiring, in the investigators opinion,&#xD;
                  intravenous treatment or a potassium binding agent.&#xD;

                  exceeds 5.0mmol/L. Those intolerant of or unwilling to take spironolactone should&#xD;

               -  A run-in period of up to 35 days is permitted (the run-in period will usually&#xD;
                  occur during hospitalisation or a course of day-care or intense management).&#xD;
