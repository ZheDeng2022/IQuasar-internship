      The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of an enhanced recovery after surgery&#xD;
      (ERAS) pathway incorporated with pre-operative physical therapy and education on immediate&#xD;
      and short-term outcomes of minimally-invasive surgery of total hip arthroplasty (MIS-THA). We&#xD;
      hypothesized that this ERAS pathway can shorten post-operative length of hospital stay and&#xD;
      ensure same-day independent mobilization in MIS-THA. The first specific aim was to compare&#xD;
      primary immediate outcomes, including post-operative length of hospital stay and the rate of&#xD;
      same-day independent mobilization, between ERAS for MIS-THA patients and conventional MIS-THA&#xD;
      patients. The second aim was to compare other immediate outcomes, including post-operative&#xD;
      pain scores, analgesics usage, the rate of blood transfusion and post-operative nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting (PONV), between the two groups of patients. Third, we aimed to compare short-term&#xD;
      outcomes, including post-operative 1-year Harris hip score, Oxford hip score and EQ-5D index&#xD;
      of quality of life, between the two groups of patients. We also compared hospital cost and&#xD;
      profit between the two groups of patients. Moreover, we identified the factors affecting&#xD;
      post-operative length of hospital stay in ERAS for MIS-THA patients.&#xD;

      Study subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We conducted a prospective comparative study to investigate 50 patients receiving an ERAS&#xD;
      pathway incorporated with pre-operative physical therapy and education for MIS-THA and 25&#xD;
      patients receiving conventional MIS-THA. We included the patients with advanced osteonecrosis&#xD;
      of femoral head or hip osteoarthritis receiving unilateral primary MIS-THA performed by the&#xD;
      same surgeon at the same hospital. We excluded patients with renal or hepatic function&#xD;
      impairment which precluded multimodal pain control. However, we did not preselect patients&#xD;
      with younger age or better activity level. This study was approved by the Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board at National Taiwan University Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained&#xD;
      from all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ERAS for MIS-THA versus conventional MIS-THA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, ERAS for MIS-THA was defined as the ERAS pathway incorporated with&#xD;
      pre-operative short-term physical therapy and education for MIS-THA. On the other hand,&#xD;
      conventional MIS-THA in this study was defined as the conventional pathway without&#xD;
      pre-operative physical therapy and education for MIS-THA. Both of ERAS for MIS-THA and&#xD;
      conventional MIS-THA comprised the same MIS-THA techniques, multimodal pain control,&#xD;
      standardized volume management and PONV prophylaxis, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis and&#xD;
      post-operative rehabilitation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative physical therapy and education:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operatively in the outpatient clinics, we informed patients that the discharge days&#xD;
      depended on the rehabilitation progress by oral and written information. We also gave&#xD;
      patients the detailed information about rehabilitation program and discharge criteria. We&#xD;
      consulted physical therapy specialists for one session of physical therapy intervention&#xD;
      before operation. The standardized pre-operative physical therapy programs included three&#xD;
      parts. First, posterior dislocation precautions were well explained to the patients,&#xD;
      including no hip flexion greater than 90 degrees, no hip adduction or hip internal rotation&#xD;
      beyond neutral, and no combination of the above motions. Then, therapeutic exercise programs&#xD;
      given in acute post-operative inpatient phase were demonstrated and practiced, including&#xD;
      ankle pumps, quadriceps sets, gluteal sets, bed-supported knee bends, active hip abduction,&#xD;
      and straight leg raising. The patients were instructed to do these exercises by themselves at&#xD;
      home until the day of operation. Last, the patients received activity and functional&#xD;
      training, including bed mobility, transfer skills, gait training with appropriate assistive&#xD;
      device and weight bearing to tolerance, stair training, and modified activities of daily&#xD;
      living following precautions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MIS-THA techniques:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We utilized posterolateral mini-incision techniques with posterior capsulotendinous repair to&#xD;
      the posterolateral aspect of greater trochanter bone for every patient receiving MIS-THA. The&#xD;
      incision size was routinely 5-8 cm with hip in flexion position based on body build. We did&#xD;
      not use surgical drains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multimodal pain control:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For post-operative analgesia, we used multimodal pain control protocols including pre-emptive&#xD;
      oral analgesics (acetaminophen, celecoxib, tramadol, gabapentin), intra-operative&#xD;
      periarticular injection with cocktail mix of analgesics and antibiotics (levobupivacaine,&#xD;
      ketorolac, epinephrine, cefazolin), post-operative oral analgesics (acetaminophen, celecoxib,&#xD;
      tramadol, gabapentin), and intramuscular ketorolac as needed to control pain without reliance&#xD;
      on morphine. Levobupivacaine used in our periarticular injection is a safer analgesic&#xD;
      compared with bupivacaine in terms of cardiovascular adverse effects. We did not routinely&#xD;
      use patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pumps containing morphine unless there was a request&#xD;
      from the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized volume management and PONV prophylaxis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For standardized volume management, we used tetrastarch colloid solutions and restrictive&#xD;
      strategy of allogenic blood transfusion (hemoglobin &lt; 9 g/dl with altered vital signs or&#xD;
      hemoglobin &lt; 7 g/dl without altered vital signs). For PONV prophylaxis and treatment, we used&#xD;
      esomeprazole, metoclopramide, ondansetron, and normovolemic fluid control with tetrastarch&#xD;
      colloid solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, we used anti-embolism stockings and daily enoxaparin&#xD;
      (40mg) starting from 12 hours after operation for 2 days then oral aspirin for 6 weeks. We&#xD;
      used a short-duration anti-thrombotic agent combined with aspirin and early mobilization&#xD;
      because the risk of deep vein thrombosis after THA with short-duration pharmacological&#xD;
      prophylaxis and early mobilization was quite low. Besides, Asians have a 70% lower prevalence&#xD;
      of venous thromboembolism compared to Caucasians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative rehabilitation program:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative rehabilitation program was the same as pre-operative physical therapy and was&#xD;
      conducted with close observation of patient's pain tolerance and general conditioning. All&#xD;
      patients were discharged direct to their residences without any home-care rehabilitation&#xD;
      service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discharge criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For ERAS for MIS-THA patients and conventional MIS-THA patients, we used uniform discharge&#xD;
      criteria including being self-dependent, being able to walk with crutches or walkers,&#xD;
      sufficient pain control with oral analgesics, no infection signs, well knowledge of position&#xD;
      restriction, and being able to perform home exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A database was established for prospective collection of patient demographic, pre- and&#xD;
      post-operative data for statistical analysis. The evaluator was blinded to the grouping of&#xD;
      patients in data collection. Primary immediate outcomes were post-operative length of&#xD;
      hospital stay and the rate of same-day independent mobilization (ambulation without&#xD;
      assistance from another person within 24 hours after operation). Other immediate outcomes&#xD;
      included post-operative visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores, analgesics usage, the rate of&#xD;
      blood transfusion and PONV. Short-term outcomes were post-operative 1-year Harris hip score,&#xD;
      Oxford hip score, and EQ-5D index of self-reported health-related quality of life. We also&#xD;
      recorded adverse events as well as hospital cost and profit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A priori sample size determination was based on post-operative length of hospital stay, which&#xD;
      was the primary outcome measure. The sample size was calculated to detect a mean difference&#xD;
      of 3 days in post-operative length of stay between ERAS for MIS-THA patients and conventional&#xD;
      MIS-THA patients assuming a standard deviation of 3.5 days. We assumed a two-sided type I&#xD;
      error of 0.05 and a power of 80%. This resulted in a required sample size of 22 in each&#xD;
      group. In this study, we included 50 patients in ERAS group and 25 patients in conventional&#xD;
      group, respectively. The case number in this study was sufficient for a priori sample size&#xD;
      calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation and ratio. Student t-test, Mann-Whitney U&#xD;
      test, Chi-square test and Fisher exact test were used to compare continuous or categorical&#xD;
      variables between different groups of subjects. Multivariable regression analysis by best&#xD;
      subset regression was used to identify significant variables affecting post-operative length&#xD;
      of hospital stay. Longitudinal analysis by Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) using&#xD;
      robust standard errors was used to compare repeated measurements such as post-operative VAS&#xD;
      pain scores. STATA 11 statistical software (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA) was used&#xD;
      for statistical analysis. A two-tailed p value of &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
