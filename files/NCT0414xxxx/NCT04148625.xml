  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minimally invasive surgical procedures have been advocated as an alternative to catheter&#xD;
      ablation for the treatment of persistent atrial fibrillation. Initial results have been&#xD;
      promising in maintaining sinus rhythm compared to catheter ablation, but are associated with&#xD;
      a considerably greater number of procedural-related adverse events compared to catheter&#xD;
      ablation. This study investigates the safety and feasibility of a new subxyphoid&#xD;
      epicardial/endocardial hybrid atrial fibrillation ablation and LAA exclusion approach for&#xD;
      patients with persistent and longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the ability of a subxyphoid and percutaneous hybrid&#xD;
      epicardial/endocardial ablation approach consisting of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), LAA&#xD;
      exclusion, isolation of the left atrial (LA) posterior wall and cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI)&#xD;
      line (Hybrid Sub-X MAZE) to (1) demonstrate that the hybrid procedure does not result in an&#xD;
      unacceptable risk of serious adverse events (SAEs) in persistent or longstanding persistent&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation (AF) subjects for whom an ablation procedure is planned; and (2) assess&#xD;
      freedom from episodes of persistent AF &gt; 30 seconds duration during the observation period&#xD;
      through 12 months post PVI.&#xD;
