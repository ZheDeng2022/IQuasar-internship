  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized 2-arm clinical trial of two lifestyle interventions varying&#xD;
      in intensity and format, in 400 older African American and non-Hispanic whites at increased&#xD;
      risk of cognitive decline and dementia in the East San Francisco Bay Area. The trial will&#xD;
      include two lifestyle interventions that differ in intensity and format:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Aerobic Exercise (AEx) Intervention that involves aerobic activities with in-class&#xD;
           walking workouts and tutorials and carried out at the East Oakland Sports Center (EOSC)&#xD;
           and Tice Creek Fitness Center (TICE).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dietary counseling to support adherence to the Mediterranean-Diet Approaches to Stop&#xD;
           Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet to encourage&#xD;
           increased consumption of berries, green leafy and other vegetables, whole grains, nuts,&#xD;
           fish, poultry, beans and olive oil, and to reduce consumption of fried/fast foods, red&#xD;
           meat, whole fat cheese, sweets, butter and trans-fat margarines.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 8-month diet and AEx regimens used here are theoretically motivated by implementation&#xD;
      science and use the best available practices to treat multisystemic disabling processes. The&#xD;
      recent Centers for Disease Control (CDC) review of Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)&#xD;
      implementation literature found that 1 hour per week is the optimal length and frequency to&#xD;
      balance cost and attentional demands of the participants. DPP class structure generally&#xD;
      involves a 10-min weigh-in, a discussion of adherence to personal weight loss and exercise&#xD;
      goals, formal DPP content delivery, and lastly a discussion of barriers to adherence. Diet&#xD;
      module content focuses on calorie restriction by altering the composition of participants'&#xD;
      meals. These goals include reducing trans-fats, saturated fats, sodium, and carbohydrates and&#xD;
      increasing fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fiber. Participants set weight reduction&#xD;
      goals for themselves with personalized goals between 5% and 10% of total body weight&#xD;
      dependent on the participant's level of obesity - effectively replacing prepared foods with&#xD;
      traditional (Mediterranean) diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because cognitive abilities do not appear to change without a corresponding improvement in&#xD;
      cardio respiratory (CR) fitness, the 8-month AEx module content optimizes CR fitness&#xD;
      improvement with in-class walking workouts and tutorials. All health instructors at TICE and&#xD;
      EOSC will have at least an Associates level degree in exercise physiology and be required to&#xD;
      have personal training certification. They will always be under the direct supervision of the&#xD;
      PI. Direct supervision of the participants by these health instructors will occur for all&#xD;
      exercise sessions until the weekly duration target of 150 minutes a week is reached (Week 6).&#xD;
      We introduce more flexibility in scheduling exercise when the participant is consistently and&#xD;
      safely meeting their goals by allowing unsupervised exercise sessions at the facility when&#xD;
      exercise trainers may not be available (i.e. early morning, nights, and weekends).&#xD;
      Participants are still required to have at least one directly supervised exercise session per&#xD;
      week to maintain contact with program staff and encourage adherence to the program.&#xD;
      Unsupervised exercise sessions are conducted similarly to supervised exercise and session&#xD;
      data will be reviewed by the exercise instructor at the weekly supervised session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per a well-developed literature on DPP best practices,159,160 we will limit intervention&#xD;
      class sizes to about 20 people. Over the course of 5 years, we will run 30 to 35 full DPP&#xD;
      groups, each session meeting weekly for 20 consecutive weeks of diet-focused or AEx-focused&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies suggest that salivary hormones such as cortisol, alpha-amylase and&#xD;
      testosterone all measure glucocorticoid (GC) sensitivity, a potent biomarker of age-related&#xD;
      stress. We will measure three stress markers in spit before and after a participant exercises&#xD;
      during the 6-minute walk challenge at baseline and at each follow-up visit. Because better&#xD;
      fitness is believed to improve one's reaction to stressful events, changes in these hormones&#xD;
      may reflect the adaptation of a person's ability to cope with emotional and physical stress&#xD;
      as they become more cardiorespiratory fit.&#xD;
