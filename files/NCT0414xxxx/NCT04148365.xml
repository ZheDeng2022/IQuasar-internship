  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about eye drop regime adherence in the paediatric population. In particular,&#xD;
      no previous research has investigated this in the paediatric uveitis population, a group who&#xD;
      can require doses up to six times daily, and at frequencies that change month to month. The&#xD;
      aim of the study is to quantify the range of adherence to eye drop medication, and to&#xD;
      investigate some of the reasons for non-compliance in a child specific study. By learning&#xD;
      more about compliance, this will help create treatments that are better suited to children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit 50 children receiving eye drop treatment. After an interval of 1 week&#xD;
      or more the children and their parents will be asked to complete a questionnaire about the&#xD;
      frequency of the drops prescribed, and the frequency that they have used over the last&#xD;
      interval. It will also ask questions about difficulties encountered administering the drops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in eye drop bottle weight will be measured during the interval and the result&#xD;
      compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information gathered from the questionnaires will be used to compare reports of adherence&#xD;
      between the parent and child, the child's age and the bottle weight. The reasons reported for&#xD;
      difficulties with adherence will also be reported. This is a preliminary investigatory study&#xD;
      to identify whether an issue with medication non-adherence exists. The findings will be used&#xD;
      to tailor further research into this area.&#xD;

      Purpose This study aims to provide new information about compliance with medications amongst&#xD;
      children and adolescents in an outpatient Ophthalmic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have demonstrated in other conditions that adherence to eye drop regimes is&#xD;
      extremely varied (50% to 90% of prescribed drops (Tan 2005)) in a range of paediatric&#xD;
      conditions including myopia, amblyopia, herpes simplex keratitis, allergic conjunctivitis.&#xD;
      There has not been any research into eye drop adherence in the paediatric uveitis population.&#xD;
      Previous enquiries into quality of life in JIA have not included questions about drop&#xD;
      adherence, frequency of flare ups or drop side effects (van Dijkhuizen 2018). Although this&#xD;
      condition is not common, the prevalence of paediatric uveitis is 27.9 per 100,000&#xD;
      (Päivönsalo-Hietanen 2000), it has severe sight threatening complications despite modern&#xD;
      treatment. The burden of disease can be substantial due to eye drops up to six times daily&#xD;
      and weekly appointments during active episodes, as well as surveillance every 3-4 months in&#xD;
      between flares.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are certain issues that are specific to uveitis which require investigation. These&#xD;
      include the high frequency of steroid drops, changes in frequency on a week by week basis,&#xD;
      and the fact that it is an asymptomatic condition in the early stages. Other studies&#xD;
      reporting drop adherence in the paediatric population are limited because definitions of&#xD;
      adherence and its measurement is inconsistent, and often not the primary outcome of a study.&#xD;
      Parents and clinicians have expressed concerns about how achievable very frequent dosing is.&#xD;
      If a threshold above which eye drop adherence becomes very unreliable exists, for instance&#xD;
      more than four times each day, then clinicans could adjust treatment regimes to reflect this.&#xD;
      This may encourage clinicans to be able to confidently advocate moving on to alternative&#xD;
      therapies, such as biological treatment rather than increasing drop frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By measuring and understanding medication adherence in the paediatric and adolescent&#xD;
      population helps design interventions to improve compliance and assess their success.&#xD;
      Evidence of paediatric specific issues may also lead to the development of age adapted&#xD;
      formulations or trial of existing products in novel ways, for instance slow release steroid&#xD;
      inserts following paediatric cataract surgery (SY Lee 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Treatment will not be impacted by the study. There is no randomisation. Compliance may&#xD;
      be impacted by awareness of being involved in a study. This is a major limitation of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However previous studies have been conducted investigating compliance and their finding have&#xD;
      been held to be valid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A effort has been made in the design of PIS to provide patients with information about the&#xD;
      study while limiting the impression that their medication compliance is under scrutiny.&#xD;
      Additional vague questions have been added to the questionnaire to obscure the focus of the&#xD;
      questions.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any child attending the Paediatric Ophthalmology Department Uveitis Clinic who is&#xD;
             receiving eye drop treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children with a diagnosis of uveitis receiving eye drop treatment between 0-18 years&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children with follow up more than 3 months after the first meeting and consent will&#xD;
             subsequently be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At present the study does not have sufficient funding for translators. Potential&#xD;
             participants that do not speak sufficient English to understand and respond to the&#xD;

             preliminary research. A priority of any further work will be to provide translators&#xD;
             and achieve a more inclusive approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children not accompanied by a person with parental responsibility will be excluded if&#xD;
             they cannot provide their own consent.&#xD;
