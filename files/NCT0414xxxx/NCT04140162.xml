  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 2 trial will test whether the combination of DaraRd (daratumumab + lenalidomide +&#xD;
      dexamethasone) as induction therapy, followed by DRVd (daratumumab + lenalidomide +&#xD;
      bortezomib + dexamethasone) consolidation therapy, if needed, will result in more patients&#xD;
      achieving minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative status, relative to the standard of care.&#xD;
      Consolidation therapy will be administered only to those patients with MRD-positive status&#xD;
      after induction therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a study based on adaptive design for decision making of treatment options. Duration&#xD;
      of therapy (daratumumab cycles) will depend on individual approach, response, evidence of&#xD;
      disease progression and tolerance.&#xD;
