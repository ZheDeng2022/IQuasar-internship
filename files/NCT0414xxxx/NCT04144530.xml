  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and long-term disability. A major unresolved&#xD;
      problem in MRI-based stroke assessment is to relate image features to brain function in a way&#xD;
      that can properly guide stratification for treatment and rehabilitation. This requires&#xD;
      extracting meaningful and reproducible models of brain function from stroke images, a&#xD;
      daunting task severely hindered by the great variability of lesion frequency and pattern.&#xD;
      Large datasets are imperative to uncover possible lesion-function relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project the investigators will create a large database of acute strokes MRIs. The&#xD;
      investigators will retrospectively archive an estimated 3,000 MRIs of patients with acute&#xD;
      stroke, acquired at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, 2009-2019. This dataset will include 1.5 and&#xD;
      3 Tesla scans, diverse protocols and sequences (e.g., diffusion and perfusion weighted images&#xD;
      (DWI/b0, PWI), T1, T2, FLAIR, susceptibility weighted images), with typical clinical low&#xD;
      voxel resolution (4-7 mm3). Lesions will be initially delineated on DWI/b0, the most&#xD;
      informative MRI sequence for acute stroke. After anonymization and defacing, two trained&#xD;
      evaluators will perform the manual lesion segmentation. Two expert neuroradiologists will&#xD;
      create consensual structured radiological reports with information about stroke type and&#xD;
      location according to different criteria (e.g., 34 brain structures and 11 vascular&#xD;
      territories). The investigators will also archive structured information from discharge&#xD;
      (demographics, laboratory, and neurological evaluation of patients, including NIH stroke&#xD;
      scale and modified Rankin scale, mRS), as well as the 90-days follow-up mRS.&#xD;
