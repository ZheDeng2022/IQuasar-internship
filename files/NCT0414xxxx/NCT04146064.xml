      Immunotherapy with agents stimulating the immune system to act against cancer are now a new&#xD;
      standard of care in various cancers as lung cancer and melanoma, but also bladder cancer,&#xD;
      kidney cancer and head &amp; neck cancer. However, even though a subset of patients derives&#xD;
      long-term benefit from these agents, depending of cancer type still at least half of patients&#xD;
      do not respond to these new drugs. Our understanding of possible factors predicting whether a&#xD;
      patient might actually benefit from immunotherapy is poor. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)&#xD;
      are gases exhaled with a person's breath, which are released into the lung from blood and&#xD;
      bacteria and therefore can give information about infections as well as inflammation and&#xD;
      possibly cancer cells in a person's body. Breath analysis of these VOCs with special devices&#xD;
      called electronic noses (eNose) generate a specific electric signals patterns called&#xD;
      breathprints. There is early evidence that specific breathprints can actually help to select&#xD;
      patients who will be likely to benefit from immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being undertaken in an effort to evaluate breathprint analysis as a potential&#xD;
      predicting factor for benefit from immunotherapy, so that treatment selection can further be&#xD;
      improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to help us identify the role of breathprint analysis to better select&#xD;
      patients for immunotherapy.&#xD;

      Immune checkpoint blockade with anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies has become a new standard&#xD;
      of care in several cancer types as NSCLC and melanoma. However, in biomarker-unselected&#xD;
      patient populations, overall response rate (ORR) depending on type of cancer and whether&#xD;
      single or combination treatment is chosen remains still only 20%-60%. Though overall well&#xD;
      tolerated approximately 5-10% of patients treated with PD1/PD-L1 targeting agents will&#xD;
      experience grade 3 or 4 toxicities, including potentially life-threatening auto-immune&#xD;
      toxicities such as colitis, hepatitis, and pneumonitis. Therefore, due to high costs of&#xD;
      treatment and its possible complications, improved selection of patients is a crucial goal&#xD;
      and an easily available non-invasive, point-of-care test for better patient selection is very&#xD;
      much needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A promising approach in this regard is the analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in&#xD;
      breath. Breath analysis for the detection of VOCs is increasingly investigated for its&#xD;
      utility in diagnosis and management of cancer. Electronic noses (eNoses) are promising as&#xD;
      cheap and clinically-practical devices that are designed to detect patterns of VOCs. Recently&#xD;
      published prospective observational data showed very promising discriminant function for&#xD;
      breathprint analysis for non-response to immunotherapy in NSCLC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principle goal of this study is to validate a prior study that found that&#xD;
      breathomics-based classifiers predicted 12-week early progression vs non-progression in&#xD;
      advanced NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab. Secondarily, we will expand&#xD;
      assessment of breathomic-based classifiers to include other cohorts of advanced tumors&#xD;
      treated with ICI, and also consider using response instead of non-progression as an endpoint.&#xD;
      Exploratory goals include refinement of the breathomics classifier using alternative&#xD;
      machine-learning techniques, and correlate with other biomarkers of immunotherapy outcomes.&#xD;
