  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the ability of Bio-Active Silver Hydrosol™ in&#xD;
      providing immune support in healthy adult males and females participating in intense aerobic&#xD;
      exercise. Sixty eligible participants are planned to be randomized into either the&#xD;
      investigational product or treatments arms and will consume the study product for 60 days&#xD;
      (check-in visit on day 28). Questionnaires will be completed and blood and saliva samples&#xD;
      will be collected to measure the endpoints.&#xD;

    <description>The Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS) is a questionnaire used to evaluate the negative impact of acute URTIs. The WURSS-24 contains 24 items scored on a Likert-type severity scale. It contains the same items as the WURSS-21 along with headache, body ache, and fever to capture influenza-like illness symptoms. The items are scored on a 0 (do not have this symptom) to 7 (severe) scale.</description>
