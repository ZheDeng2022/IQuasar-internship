  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is the implementation of a telemedical geriatric co-evaluation&#xD;
      in the area of the emergency department. The use of telemedicine is intended to improve the&#xD;
      care of geriatric emergency patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primarily, it should be checked whether there is any difference at all compared to the normal&#xD;
      standard treatment by the doctors of the emergency department. For this, the different drug&#xD;
      recommendations are compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the qualitative evaluation, the second step is an analysis of the recommended drugs with&#xD;
      regard to the use of inadequate preparations for older patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the changed age structure with a steady increase in life expectancy, doctors with&#xD;
      geriatric expertise are lacking in many hospitals. In the &quot;Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische&#xD;
      Hochschule&quot; (RWTH) Aachen University Hospital there is also the problem that the Department&#xD;
      of Geriatrics is outsourced and therefore geriatric expertise is not always available in the&#xD;
      emergency department. One way to solve this problem is to use telemedicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is the implementation of a telemedical geriatric co-evaluation&#xD;
      in the emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the study it is planned to carry out a geriatric co-evaluation of geriatric emergency&#xD;
      patients (age ≥ 70 years, &quot;Identification of Seniors at Risk&quot; [ISAR] -Score ≥ 2) with&#xD;
      operative or conservative illnesses via a telemedical visit in the acute setting of the&#xD;
      emergency department. There is a presentation of the patient by means of video transmission.&#xD;
      The geriatrician then has the opportunity to question the patient independently or to carry&#xD;
      out a physical assessment. Since there is no geriatrician at the Department of Geriatrics 24&#xD;
      hours a day, patients are included on weekdays between 8am and 5pm only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whenever possible, all patients in the emergency department at this time with an age ≥ 70&#xD;
      years and an ISAR score ≥ 2 will be enrolled at set times of the day. Due to the high number&#xD;
      of patients in the emergency room, however, it may not be possible at times to include all&#xD;
      patients. In order to ensure sufficient neutrality, in this constellation, the selection is&#xD;
      made from the patients currently in the emergency room by means of randomization. Should&#xD;
      there be age-related difficulties in communicating between patients and geriatrician during&#xD;
      the telemedical visit, the present scientific assistant or doctor from the emergency&#xD;
      department will assist to avoid an associated influence on the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale behind the telemedicine visit is that this additional early geriatric&#xD;
      co-assessment will result in improved geriatric follow-up beyond geriatric special care. In&#xD;
      this pilot study, which aims at an analysis of the actual state with identification of&#xD;
      potential problem areas, the focus is primarily on pharmacotherapeutic aspects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to compare the diagnostic and treatment recommendations initiated in the emergency&#xD;
      room by means of telemedical geriatric consultation with the standard treatment of the&#xD;
      treating internist, neurologist or surgical assistant doctors of the central emergency&#xD;
      department. The treatment plan defined in the telemedical visit is only a treatment&#xD;
      recommendation. Prior to the implementation of the recommendations, a check is carried out by&#xD;
      the responsible senior physician of the emergency department after completing the emergency&#xD;
      geriatric visit. Thus, there are no risks dependent on the procedure for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the high priority of the drug therapy in the emergency department, the primary&#xD;
      endpoint is a comparison of the drug recommendations. Initially, a quantitative evaluation&#xD;
      with determination of the number of different views per patient in the pharmacological&#xD;
      differential therapy was performed. Secondary endpoints are to evaluate the use of&#xD;
      medications that are considered inadequate for elderly patients. Since no special list of&#xD;
      inadequate drugs has been validated specifically for the emergency room, the treatment&#xD;
      recommendations are checked using a standard treatment list, the &quot;Fit for the aged&quot; (FORTA)&#xD;
      classification system.&#xD;
