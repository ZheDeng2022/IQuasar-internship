  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the use of metformin in the treatment of Fragile&#xD;
      X syndrome (FXS) patients. Metformin is an FDA approved compound with an established safety&#xD;
      profile and minimal side effects that specifically targets and normalizes multiple aspects of&#xD;
      the pathophysiology in FXS. This is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled 2-arm&#xD;
      parallel group design study of the drug metformin and placebo in FXS subjects with a primary&#xD;
      outcome measure of safety/tolerability and secondary outcome measures on cognition,&#xD;
      attention, anxiety, sleep, and physiologic and biochemical biomarkers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will be a randomized placebo controlled, double-blind, parallel group design study&#xD;
      of treatment with metformin on the primary outcome of safety/tolerance with secondary outcome&#xD;
      measurements of the effects on cognition (encompassing social and repetitive behavior),&#xD;
      attention, anxiety, and physiological and biochemical biomarkers of patients with FXS. FXS&#xD;
      represents a well-defined population of ASD in which to test a specific targeted treatment&#xD;
      looking at a well-defined set of cognitive and bioassay measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial length is designed to have a chance at seeing if the medication can improve cognitive&#xD;
      outcome measures. The study duration includes the screening period and a 24-week single-blind&#xD;
      drug/placebo phase.&#xD;
