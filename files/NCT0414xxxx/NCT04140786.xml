  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Herlitz junctional epidermolysis bullosa (H-JEB), an incurable and fatal inherited skin&#xD;
      disease, is caused by loss-of-function mutations in LAMA3, LAMB3 and LAMC2. These mutations&#xD;
      result in diminished laminin 332 and epidermal-dermal adherence. 85% of JEB patients have&#xD;
      nonsense mutations in LAMA3, LAMB3, or LAMC2, suggesting that H-JEB is a prime therapeutic&#xD;
      target for nonsense suppression therapy. The investigators recently demonstrated in three&#xD;
      patients that topical gentamicin created new and stable laminin 332 at the dermal-epidermal&#xD;
      junction (DEJ), and also improved wound closure and skin quality. Furthermore, these&#xD;
      preliminary studies showed that intravenous gentamicin also induced laminin 332 and&#xD;
      transiently improved patients' clinical outcomes. No untoward side effects occurred. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to optimize the intravenous gentamicin regimen including dosage and&#xD;
      infusion schedules to enhance the therapeutic outcome. The milestones will be an increase of&#xD;
      laminin 332 in the patients' DEJ, improvement in EB Disease Activity Scores, and no&#xD;
      gentamicin-associated side effects.&#xD;

      RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Herlitz junctional epidermolysis bullosa (H-JEB), an incurable and fatal inherited skin&#xD;
      disease, is caused by loss-of-function mutations in LAMA3, LAMB3 and LAMC2. These mutations&#xD;
      result in diminished laminin 332 and epidermal-dermal adherence. 85% of JEB patients have&#xD;
      nonsense mutations in LAMA3, LAMB3, or LAMC2, suggesting that H-JEB is a prime therapeutic&#xD;
      target for nonsense suppression therapy. The investigators recently demonstrated in three&#xD;
      patients that topical gentamicin created new and stable laminin 332 at the dermal-epidermal&#xD;
      junction (DEJ), and also improved wound closure and skin quality. Furthermore, these&#xD;
      preliminary studies showed that intravenous gentamicin also induced laminin 332 and&#xD;
      transiently improved patients' clinical outcomes. No untoward side effects occurred. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to optimize the intravenous gentamicin regimen including dosage and&#xD;
      infusion schedules to enhance the therapeutic outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two study designs on JEB patients with nonsense mutation(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Short Term Daily IV Gentamicin Study: Three patients of any age with JEB caused by&#xD;
      nonsense mutation(s) in the LAMA3 and LAMB3 genes will receive intravenous gentamicin (10&#xD;
      mgs/kg) daily for 24 days and then stop. Prior to treatment and at 1 month and 3 months post&#xD;
      treatment, selected skin test sites will have skin biopsies and the specimens evaluated for&#xD;
      the expression of laminin 332 at the dermal-epidermal junction by direct immunofluorescent&#xD;
      staining of the skin. Safety parameters such as physical exam, review of systems, laboratory&#xD;
      tests, audiometry, and renal function at the same time periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Long Term Biweekly IV Gentamicin Study: Three patients of any age with JEB caused by&#xD;
      nonsense mutation(s) in the LAMA3 and LAMB3 genes will receive intravenous gentamicin (10&#xD;
      mgs/kg) twice weekly for 3 months (24 total infusions) and then stop. Before and after&#xD;
      evaluations will be performed and will be the same as those in the short term intravenous&#xD;
      study outlined above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 adults/children for who have JEB due to nonsense mutations in the LAMA3 or LAMB3 gene for&#xD;
      each intervention arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY ENDPOINTS OR OUTCOMES Analysis of safety parameters, wound healing, and generation of&#xD;
      new laminin 332 at the dermal-epidermal junction of the skin by direct immunofluorescent&#xD;
      stain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW-UP Participants will be followed out to 90 days post treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICS Without treatment, these JEB patients have little or no laminin A3/laminin&#xD;
      B3/laminin 332 at their dermal-epidermal junction. The expression of any newly generated&#xD;
      laminin 332 will be measure against normal human skin (100%) by NIH Image J software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLANS FOR ANALYSIS Safety parameters are outlined above and will be examined at baseline and&#xD;
      after each patient visit. Efficacy parameters outlined above will be measured at baseline and&#xD;
      at post treatment days 30 and 90.&#xD;
