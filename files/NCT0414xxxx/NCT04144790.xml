  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the present study is to provide novel data to evaluate brain iron concentration&#xD;
      as a mediator of the association between iron supplementation treatment and improvement in&#xD;
      symptoms of ADHD and RLS in children, including PLMS. Twelve participants between the ages of&#xD;
      5 and 18 years will be recruited via Kennedy Krieger Institute's Sleep Disorders Clinic.&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be asked to complete, at baseline (pre-iron supplementation&#xD;
      treatment) and again at follow-up (post-treatment): 1) a 7 Tesla MRI scan, 2) five&#xD;
      consecutive nights of RestEaZe™ monitoring, 3) caregiver-reported (or patient-reported if&#xD;
      over the age of 10 years) Cambridge-Hopkins Restless Leg Syndrome questionnaire(CH-RLSq13),&#xD;
      and 4) caregiver-reported ADHD Rating Scale-5. The treatment interval will be 3 months.&#xD;

      The goal of the present study is to provide novel data to evaluate brain iron concentration&#xD;
      as a mediator of the association between iron supplementation treatment and improvement in&#xD;
      symptoms of ADHD and RLS in children, including PLMS. Aim 1 is to evaluate the impact of iron&#xD;
      supplementation treatment on peripheral iron concentrations and brain iron concentrations.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that iron supplementation treatment will result in increased&#xD;
      peripheral and brain iron concentrations. Aim 2 is to evaluate the impact of iron&#xD;
      supplementation treatment on symptoms of ADHD and RLS. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      iron supplementation treatment will result in decreased symptoms of ADHD and RLS. Aim 3 is to&#xD;
      investigate the relation between brain iron concentrations and symptoms of ADHD and RLS,&#xD;
      including PLMS. The investigators hypothesize that brain iron concentrations in the&#xD;
      substantia nigra and in the thalamus will be negatively related to symptoms at baseline. Aim&#xD;
      4 is to evaluate whether brain iron concentrations mediate the association between iron&#xD;
      supplementation treatment and symptoms of ADHD and RLS. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      increases in brain iron concentrations in the substantia nigra and in the thalamus will fully&#xD;
      explain any improvements in symptoms that occur with iron supplementation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve participants between the ages of 5 and 18 years will be recruited via Kennedy Krieger&#xD;
      Institute's Sleep Disorders Clinic. Recruitment will be accomplished by posting flyers with&#xD;
      study information at the clinic and by asking Sleep Disorders Clinic clinicians to discuss&#xD;
      the study with their patients who may be eligible and their caregivers. In order to be&#xD;
      included in the study, participants will need to have: 1) a clinical diagnosis of either RLS&#xD;
      or ADHD, 3) PLMS &gt; 3/hour, based on average of 5 nights of home recording with RestEaze leg&#xD;
      meters, and 4) fasting serum iron values with ferritin &lt; 50 mcg/L and transferrin saturation&#xD;
      &lt; 45%. Exclusionary criteria will be: 1) family is not proficient in English language, 2)&#xD;
      child is in foster care, 3) child has a chronic medical condition or genetic/metabolic&#xD;
      disorder that might impact iron metabolism, 4) child has another sleep disorder or&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric condition that might influence sleep, RLS, or ADHD symptoms, and 6) child&#xD;
      has been receiving iron supplementation or a medication that could disrupt sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An uncontrolled open label trial design is proposed for this pilot study, in order to&#xD;
      establish evidence to support a larger blinded, placebo-controlled trial application.&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be asked to complete, at baseline (pre-iron supplementation&#xD;
      treatment) and again at follow-up (post-treatment): 1) a 7 Tesla MRI scan, 2) five&#xD;
      consecutive nights of RestEaZe™ monitoring, 3) caregiver-reported (or patient-reported if&#xD;
      over the age of 10 years) Cambridge-Hopkins Restless Leg Syndrome questionnaire(CH-RLSq13),&#xD;
      and 4) caregiver-reported ADHD Rating Scale-5. The treatment interval will be 3 months, which&#xD;
      has been sufficient in previous studies to allow for treatment effects to be observed.&#xD;
      Investigators anticipate 20 to 30% attrition over the course of the 3 months of treatment,&#xD;
      leaving 8-10 participants to scan at follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>Although established guidelines do not currently exist for iron supplementation for children, studies have demonstrated effectiveness of a 3-month treatment regimen of 5mg/kg per day of orally-administered ferrous sulfate in reducing PLMS and subjective RLS symptoms and in increasing serum ferritin levels. Ferrous sulfate 80 mg/day resulted in improvement of ADHD symptoms in iron-deficient children.</description>
