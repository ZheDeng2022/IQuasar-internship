      This is a prospective, multi-center, multi-phase, evaluator-blinded study of subjects&#xD;
      undergoing a procedure to improve the appearance of lax tissue in the neck and submental&#xD;
      region. All study subjects will be treated with the Renuvion APR Device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I (n=17) of this study will be conducted primarily to provide safety data, however,&#xD;
      effectiveness data will also be collected at the above stated timepoints through 6 months&#xD;
      post-procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II (n=65) of this study is the expansion of the study to a pivotal study.&#xD;

    <description>The Renuvion APR Handpiece is a sterile, single use electrosurgical (monopolar) device intended to be used in conjunction with compatible generators for the percutaneous delivery of radiofrequency energy and/or helium plasma for cutting, coagulation and ablation of soft tissue. Radiofrequency energy is delivered to the handpiece by the generator and used to energize the electrode. When helium gas is passed over the energized electrode, a helium plasma is generated for soft tissue cutting, coagulation or ablation. The Renuvion APR Handpiece has a non-extendable electrode to generate helium plasma.</description>
