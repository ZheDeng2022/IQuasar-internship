  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a growing global health problem, strictly connected with&#xD;
      progressive ageing population and longer survival of patients living on renal replacement&#xD;
      therapy. The majority of ESRD patients is on hemodialysis (HD) treatment. A successful HD&#xD;
      procedure requires a functional vascular access (VA) to provide safe and long-lasting way to&#xD;
      connect patient circulation to the artificial kidney. To date, VA dysfunction is the major&#xD;
      cause of morbidity and hospitalisation in HD patients, and the major limitation of HD&#xD;
      treatment. The current recommendation for VA is the native artero-venous fistula (AVF),&#xD;
      surgically created in the forearm, but is still affected by high non-maturation and early&#xD;
      failure rates. The most common cause of AVF early-failure is vascular stenosis due to&#xD;
      neointimal hyperplasia (NH). Despite the exact mechanisms underlying stenosis development&#xD;
      remain tentative, there is general consensus that hemodynamic conditions play a key role in&#xD;
      the formation of NH. Previous computational fluid dynamics (CFD) investigations inside&#xD;
      patient-specific AVF models conducted by our group revealed transitional laminar-to-turbulent&#xD;
      flow in the juxta-anastomotic vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various vascular access devices have been designed to incorporate features to regularize the&#xD;
      hemodynamics and favour spiral flow development in the venous segment of the AVF. The VasQ&#xD;
      external support device (Laminate Medical Technologies, Israel) is a novel Nitinol implant,&#xD;
      externally surrounding and supporting the vein and &quot;hugging&quot; the artery near the junction&#xD;
      site, without being in contact with the blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VasQ attempts at constraining and shaping geometrical parameters of the AVF, as well as&#xD;
      reinforcing the vulnerable perianastomotic vein against high pressure, wall tension and flow&#xD;
      levels. A prospective single-centre study demonstrated the safety of the VasQ external&#xD;
      support device, but the effect of its use on hemodynamic conditions and the advantages in&#xD;
      terms of flow regularization in patient-specific AVFs still need to be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A detailed analysis of the local blood flow field in patient-specific AVFs can be obtained&#xD;
      coupling non contrast-enhanced MRI (NCE-MRI) and high-resolution CFD simulations, using a&#xD;
      NCE-MRI protocol recently optimized by our group. Our MRI sequence has the advantage of&#xD;
      providing high-quality images in a short acquisition time of 5-10 minutes compared to other&#xD;
      MRI protocols that require more than 45 minutes for a single acquisition. Combined with&#xD;
      high-resolution CFD, our MRI-to-CFD pipeline allowed us to characterize morphological and&#xD;
      hemodynamic changes in the AVF of one patient at two timepoints, immediately after AVF&#xD;
      surgery and at AVF maturation. Therefore, it seems to be a promising approach to perform&#xD;
      morphological and hemodynamic analysis also in AVF created using the VasQ device and can be&#xD;
      used to elucidate the effects of VasQ device on hemodynamic conditions, as compared to&#xD;
      hemodynamic conditions present in AVFs created using conventional surgery without the use of&#xD;
      any device.&#xD;
