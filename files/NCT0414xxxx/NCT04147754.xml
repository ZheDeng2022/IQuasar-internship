  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary thoracic surgery is often responsible for severe postoperative pain, which is&#xD;
      associated with an increase in postoperative morbidity and mortality. Moreover, postoperative&#xD;
      thoracic pain has a strong impact on patient rehabilitation and is associated with an&#xD;
      increase in hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various analgesic techniques allow effective management of pain in the context of thoracic&#xD;
      surgery. Regional anesthesia, particularly, allows a powerful analgesia, and limits the use&#xD;
      of opioids and their side effects. Among regional anesthesia techniques, thoracic epidural&#xD;
      analgesia has become the gold standard for post-thoracotomy analgesia. However, it induces a&#xD;
      sympathetic block that promotes in particular per and postoperative hypotension and acute&#xD;
      urinary retentions. Thus, new regional anesthesia techniques have been developed and assessed&#xD;
      in thoracic surgery in order to avoid side effects related to epidural analgesia,&#xD;
      particularly paravertebral block and erector spinae block, but also intrathecal analgesia.&#xD;
      Paravertebral block has shown analgesic efficacy after thoracic surgery, and its interest in&#xD;
      reducing the risk of hypotension, acute urinary retention, pruritus and postoperative nausea&#xD;
      and vomiting compared with the epidural analgesia. Erector spinae block, recently described&#xD;
      and evaluated in this context of thoracic surgery, seems to have the same interests and to be&#xD;
      easier to achieve than the paravertebral block, but has been little studied. Finally,&#xD;
      intrathecal morphine is frequently used because of an easy and rapid realization, and because&#xD;
      it allows an adequate analgesia and the reduction of the duration of stay in intensive care&#xD;
      compared to the epidural one. However, despite its frequent use, very few studies have&#xD;
      compared intrathecal anesthesia with the epidural and other peri-spinal blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These three types of analgesia, epidural analgesia, intrathecal morphine, and erector spinae&#xD;
      block are regional anesthesia methods regularly used for pulmonary surgery in the department&#xD;
      of the investigators. All of these techniques have shown their analgesic efficacy, but each&#xD;
      seems to have particular respective interests, in terms of achievement, management, or&#xD;
      perioperative rehabilitation. The objective of the investigators study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of each of its techniques to treat postoperative pain and improve the&#xD;
      rehabilitation of these patients.&#xD;
