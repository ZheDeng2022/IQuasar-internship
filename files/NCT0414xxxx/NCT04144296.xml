    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare capillary blood gas analysis compensated by v-TAC software&#xD;
      (aCBGE, aCBGF) to arterial blood gas analysis (ABG) in terms of pH, pCO2 and pO2 and the&#xD;
      clinical usefulness of this method compared to the gold standard of ABG.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In clinical practice blood gas analysis is an essential tool for monitoring respiratory&#xD;
      status. The gold-standard method is arterial blood gas analysis (ABG) of blood from the&#xD;
      patient's radial or femoral artery. An alternative to arterial sampling commonly used is&#xD;
      arterialized capillary blood gas analysis from the earlobe (CBGE). Though CBGE is less&#xD;
      invasive and can be performed by non-medical staff, it is less useful in the acute setting&#xD;
      because an adequate vasodilatation is needed which typically lasts for at least 10 minutes&#xD;
      and the quality of results tends to be operator dependable. Different trials have evaluated&#xD;
      the agreement between ABG and CBGE. Whereas a close agreement between ABG and CBGE has been&#xD;
      found for evaluating pH and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2), several trials&#xD;
      showed considerable variations for the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) and that CBGE tends&#xD;
      to underestimate PO2. Similar findings apply for capillary blood gas analysis from the&#xD;
      fingertip (CBGF) which is even less accurate compared to CBGE in estimating PO2. Recently a&#xD;
      method has been developed to calculate ABG values mathematically from peripheral venous&#xD;
      blood, supplemented with oxygen saturation (SpO2) measurement by pulse oximetry, by use of&#xD;
      venous-to-arterial conversion (v-TAC) software (OBI Medical, Denmark). The principle of the&#xD;
      method is a mathematical transformation of venous blood gas analysis (VBG) values to&#xD;
      arterialised values (aVBG) by simulating the transport of blood back through the tissue (6).&#xD;
      This approach leads to a clinically acceptable agreement between ABG and aVBG for pH and&#xD;
      PCO2. For PO2 the limits of agreement of aVBG are similar to those of PO2 from CBGE for&#xD;
      values below 75 mmHg and with mean bias close to zero. However, it has not been evaluated&#xD;
      previously whether v-TAC software can be used to calculate ABG values from CBGE (aCBGE) or&#xD;
      CBGF (aCBGF). As CBGE and CBGF values are much closer to ABG values, compared to VBG values,&#xD;
      the agreement between aCBGE/aCBGF and ABG in terms of pH, PCO2 and pO2 might be better&#xD;
      compared to CBG without mathematical arterialisation by v-TAC.&#xD;
