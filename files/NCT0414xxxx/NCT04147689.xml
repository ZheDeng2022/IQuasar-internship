  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DESIRIAL® PLUS is a CE-marketed hyaluronic acid (since 2011) whose registered indications are&#xD;
      moderate hypotrophy, severe hypotrophy or atrophy of the vulvar Labia Majora by subcutaneous&#xD;
      injections. The aim is to restore volume, rehydrate and add tone and tension to connective&#xD;
      tissue areas by filling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, 71 female subjects above or equal to 18 years old at inclusion, who have&#xD;
      moderate hypotrophy or severe hypotrophy or atrophy of the vulvar Labia Majora (according to&#xD;
      investigator's judgement), who have given her informed consent and meet all the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria, will be enrolled. Subjects will come to a total of 6 visits over a period of 12&#xD;
      months. An optional screening visit may be done before injection (additional visit).&#xD;
      Proportion of patients having an improved perception of aesthetics (GAIS score after mirror&#xD;
      self-examination) after baseline injection will be assessed. Global Aesthetic Improvement,&#xD;
      Sexual function, subject's satisfaction, subject's symptoms, pain at injection and safety&#xD;
      will be also assessed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      ESOLANE is a prospective multicenter post-marketing study of a class III medical device. This&#xD;
      uncontrolled open-label study investigates the efficacy and safety of DESIRIAL® PLUS in&#xD;
      volume restoration of Labia Majora. The study duration is 12 months with an optional&#xD;
      screening visit (V0) up to 14 days before injection, the baseline visit (injection of&#xD;
      DESIRIAL®PLUS, V1) and 5 follow-up visits after 4, 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks (V2 to V6). At 4&#xD;
      weeks (V2) an optional touch-up may be done (if needed). It is envisaged to enrol 71 female&#xD;
      patients with the wish for volume restoration in France to obtain at least 60 evaluable&#xD;
      patients, which will be monitored over 1 year after baseline injection of DESIRIAL® PLUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is defined as the proportion of patients having an improved perception&#xD;
      of aesthetics (GAIS score after mirror self-examination) at 12 weeks after baseline injection&#xD;
      of DESIRIAL® PLUS, which may be touched-up once after 4 weeks (V2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Global Aesthetic Improvement (evaluated by the patient and the doctor), Sexual function,&#xD;
      subject's satisfaction, subject's symptoms &amp; pain, will be measured at all time-point with a&#xD;
      Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS), Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), patient's&#xD;
      satisfaction questionnaire (PSQ) and a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) respectively. Safety will&#xD;
      be also assessed.&#xD;

    <description>DESIRIAL® PLUS is a cross-linked hyaluronic acid gel to restore volume by filling the labia majora, to rehydrate and to add tone and tension to the area of connective tissue.&#xD;
The baseline injection is performed at V1, with a maximum volume to be injected per labium of 2 ml. The exact volume will be determined by the physician in order to reach optimal volume correction.&#xD;
One optional touch-up injection of DESIRIAL® PLUS is allowed at V2 (4 weeks after Baseline), with a maximum volume to be injected per labium of 1 ml. No other touch-up injections are allowed until the end of the study.</description>
