      A Phase 1a, Double Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Single-Center, Single and Multiple Ascending&#xD;
      Dose Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of&#xD;
      BLD-0409 in Healthy Volunteers&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      (PD) of single ascending doses (SAD) and multiple ascending doses (MAD) of BLD-0409 in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers (HV) to facilitate the dose/dosing regimen selection for future clinical&#xD;
      studies with BLD-0409 in various chronic liver diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: SAD in HV with up to 6 cohorts (including a food effect cohort). For SAD cohorts and&#xD;
      planned dosing schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: MAD over 14 days with up to 6 cohorts. For MAD cohorts and planned dosing schedule.&#xD;

        Lifestyle Considerations Meals and Dietary Restrictions&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects will fast from all food and drink except water for â¥ 10 hours before morning&#xD;
             study drug administration on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Except during the periods of fasting, standard meals and snacks will be provided at&#xD;
             the discretion of the Investigator while subjects are confined in the study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. For food effect Cohort 1e:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. On Day 8, subjects will be provided a standard high calorie breakfast from 30&#xD;
                  minutes before dose administration (and to be consumed entirely within that 30&#xD;
                  minutes). The meal is to follow United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
                  guidance regarding caloric content and composition. The test meal should derive&#xD;
                  approximately 150, 250 and 500 600 calories from protein, carbohydrate, and fat,&#xD;
                  respectively. An example test meal would be two eggs fried in butter, two strips&#xD;
                  of bacon, and two slices of toast with butter, four ounces of hash brown potatoes&#xD;
                  and eight ounces of whole milk. Substitutions in this test meal can be made as&#xD;
                  long as the meal provided a similar amount of calories from protein, carbohydrate&#xD;
                  and fat and has comparable meal volume and viscosity. Vegetarians may be enrolled&#xD;
                  provided that there is a consultation with a dietician regarding comparable&#xD;
                  calories, volume and viscosity.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Water restrictions may be needed. No water is allowed 1 hour before and after&#xD;
                  dosing, after which time, water is allowed ad libitum.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects will refrain from consumption of Seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit&#xD;
             juice, from 48 hours before the start of study drug until after the final PK sample is&#xD;
             obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects will refrain from diets that could alter metabolism (i.e., high protein, Slim&#xD;
             FastÂ®, NutrisystemÂ®, etc.) within 7 days prior to dosing on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Caffeine, Alcohol, and Tobacco&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. During each dosing session, subjects will abstain from ingesting caffeine- or&#xD;
             xanthine-containing products (e.g., coffee, tea, cola drinks, and chocolate) for 48&#xD;
             hours before the start of dosing until after collection of the final pharmacokinetic&#xD;
             (PK) and/or pharmacodynamic sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
