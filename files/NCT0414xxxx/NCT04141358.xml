    <textblock>
      Haemodialysis is a renal replacement therapy that can be introduced to patients with&#xD;
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD) to help them maintain a good healthy life. The patient's blood&#xD;
      is pumped through a dialysis machine to remove excess fluid, salt and waste, then it is&#xD;
      pumped back into the patient's circulation system. In order to carry out haemodialysis,&#xD;
      vascular access (VA) is required to connect the patient to the dialysis machine. Patients&#xD;
      have only three options of vascular access: arteriovenous fistula (AVF), an anastomosis&#xD;
      between a native vein and an artery; arteriovenous graft (AVG), a connection between a&#xD;
      synthetic tube and native blood vessels; and (3) central line, a cuffed catheter placed in a&#xD;
      large neck vein. Arteriovenous fistulas are the preferred method for VA because of their&#xD;
      longevity and causing the least number of complications. Although there are a number of&#xD;
      factors that may increase the probability of AVF failure rate such as age and gender of the&#xD;
      patient, poor native vessel structure, medications and the level of surgical experience,&#xD;
      30-40% of new AVFs fail to mature for unknown reasons. For an AVF to become functionally&#xD;
      mature postoperative, remodelling and dilation of the native artery and vein are essential to&#xD;
      accommodate significantly increased blood flow. However, pre-existing diseases in patients&#xD;
      with ESRD such as arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction may impair AVF and preclude&#xD;
      dialysis. It has been asserted that the lack of AVF success is attributable to insufficient&#xD;
      arterial dilation because of poor arterial wall elasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to investigate the role of arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction in&#xD;
      predicting AVF outcome using novel non-invasive ultrasound applications: 2D shear wave&#xD;
      elastography and 2D strain speckle tracking will be employed to assess arterial stiffness,&#xD;
      while an intraoperative flow-mediated dilation (FMD) technique will be used to evaluate&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational prospective pilot study of patients with end-stage renal disease&#xD;
      (ESRD), who will be referred for AVF procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration: 21 Months The research team will collect data from the patients after they have&#xD;
      signed the informed consent form. Data collection will take place before, during and after&#xD;
      arteriovenous fistula (AVF) surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 0 week, the patient will be interviewed to obtain clinical information. Also, blood&#xD;
      pressure and body mass index will be checked and recorded. Next, pre-operative AVF assessment&#xD;
      ultrasound measurements will be performed to assess flow, pulsatility and vessel diameter.&#xD;
      Advanced ultrasound applications(2D strain speckle tracking and 2D Shear wave elastography)&#xD;
      will be applied to assess arterial stiffness as additional measurement tools. These are&#xD;
      quantitative measures of vessel stiffness. It takes less than five minutes to obtain these&#xD;
      measurements from the imaged vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During AVF surgery, the endothelial function will be assessed intraoperatively by testing the&#xD;
      ability of the endothelium to dilate, flow mediation dilation (FMD). Leftover vessel&#xD;
      specimens will be collected for histopathological analysis purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 6 week, post-AVF ultrasound assessment will be conducted to assess the maturation of AVF&#xD;
      by measuring ultrasound parameters of blood flow, pulsatility and vessel diameter. Arterial&#xD;
      stiffness parameters will be measured as well. Blood pressure and BMI will be assessed and&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study data will be entered into a study database which will consist of a password encrypted&#xD;
      stored on a password-protected computer in the vascular lab at Hammersmith Hospital. Only the&#xD;
      study researchers will know the study database password.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will be performed after the enrolment of 20, 40 and 75 patients.&#xD;
