  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes (GDM) impacts 1 in 10 pregnancies; hyperglycemia and&#xD;
      hypertriglyceridemia are common features of the condition. Women are recommended to do at&#xD;
      least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week during pregnancy and the&#xD;
      postpartum period. Exercise both during and out of pregnancy has been shown to be an&#xD;
      effective non-pharmacologic tool to reduce glucose and lipid profiles. The goals and purpose&#xD;
      of this pilot study is to 1) determine the influence of exercise and the timing of exercise&#xD;
      surrounding a meal on glucose and lipid metabolism in pregnant women with GDM and 2)&#xD;
      determine the feasibility of low-resistance and aerobic activity and measuring exercise&#xD;
      metrics during pregnancy. The overarching objective of this study is to determine the effects&#xD;
      of low-resistance and aerobic exercise on glucose and lipids following a meal in pregnant&#xD;
      women with GDM.&#xD;

      of low-resistance and aerobic exercise on glucose and lipids following a meal in pregnant&#xD;
      women with GDM. Women will perform either low-resistance or aerobic exercise. Blood will be&#xD;
      taken before and 2 hours after a fixed meal. For safety, women will have supervised exercise&#xD;
      and oxygen consumption will be measured throughout the activity.&#xD;
