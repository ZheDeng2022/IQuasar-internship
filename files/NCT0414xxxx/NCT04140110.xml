      ENCHANTED2 is an international, multicenter, prospective, randomised, open, blinded end-point&#xD;
      assessed (PROBE) trial, to assess different approaches to manage blood pressure (BP) in acute&#xD;
      ischemic stroke (AIS) patients who have undergone mechanical thrombectomy (MT). There are two&#xD;
      nested substudies evaluating different approaches to secondary prevention in this high-risk&#xD;
      stroke population.&#xD;

      Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of more intensive BP lowering target (&lt;120 mmHg)&#xD;
      compared to higher BP management target (140-180mmHg) on functional outcome in patients with&#xD;
      successful recanalization post-MT for AIS due to large vessel occlusion (LVO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age ≥18 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Diagnosis of AIS with LVO confirmed by brain imaging;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To receive MT &lt;24 hours after AIS onset according to local guidelines;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Successful recanalization (TICI score ≥2b) after MT;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Sustained systolic BP ≥140 mmHg (defined as 2 successive readings &lt;10 mins) within 3&#xD;
           hours after recanalization;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Provide written informed consent (or approved surrogate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Unlikely to potentially benefit from therapy (e.g. advanced dementia) or very high&#xD;
           likelihood of death within 24 hours post-MT, judged by responsible treating clinician;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Other medical illness that interferes with outcome assessments and follow-up (e.g. known&#xD;
           significant pre-stroke disability (mRS scores 3-5), advance cancer and renal failure);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Definite indication/contraindication to different intensities of BP lowering treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Specific contraindications to any of the BP agents to be used (eg, patients who are&#xD;
           hypersensitive (allergic) to any of the ingredients);&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients with aortic isthmus stenosis and arteriovenous shunt (exception: patients with&#xD;
           haemodynamically inactive dialysis shunt);&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Women who are lactating;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Currently participating in another trial which would interfere with outcome assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures Primary outcome: functional recovery, defined as a shift (improvement) in&#xD;
      scores on the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: any intracranial haemorrhage (ICH), symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage&#xD;
      (sICH), early neurological deterioration, imaging assessment (e.g. infarct size, edema&#xD;
      volume), death, disability, HRQoL, duration of hospitalization, residence; and health service&#xD;
      use for calculation of resources and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation and intervention: Randomisation is via a central internet-based system,&#xD;
      stratified by site, time from symptom onset to recanalization (&lt;6, ≥6 hours), baseline&#xD;
      neurological impairment on the National Institutes for Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS &lt;17 vs&#xD;
      ≥17), to ensure balance in key prognostic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensive BP lowering group: to commence intravenous BP lowering therapy immediately after&#xD;
      randomization, with systolic BP target (&lt;120 mmHg) achieved within 1 hour, and maintained for&#xD;
      at least 72 hours (or hospital discharge if earlier).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: to receive guideline-recommended BP control strategy to maintain BP level&#xD;
      140-180 mmHg after MT procedure, but BP lowering treatment given only for BP ≥150 mmHg to&#xD;
      achieve target ≥140 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudies: Patients enrolled in main study can also be randomised into 2 substudies&#xD;
      according to separate eligibility criteria. Both are pilot studies embedded in main trial to&#xD;
      recruit as many patients to inform sample size estimates for a further main study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy #1: Timing of anticoagulation Objective: To determine the effectiveness of early&#xD;
      initiation of anticoagulation (at Day 4±2 of stroke onset) compared with late initiation (at&#xD;
      Day 12±2) on a composite outcome of recurrent AIS, sICH, systemic embolism and/or death&#xD;
      within 90 days in patients with AF-related AIS due to LVO who receive MT. Randomisation&#xD;
      (allocation 1:1 ratio) via same system as main study and stratified by site and randomisation&#xD;
      of BP intervention. Randomised patients will be allocated to either early group of initiating&#xD;
      OAC therapy at Day 4±2 day of stroke onset, or late group of initiating OAC therapy at Day&#xD;
      12±2 of stroke onset. Primary outcome: composite of recurrent AIS, sICH, systemic embolism&#xD;
      and/or vascular death within 90 days after randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy #2: Duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine the effectiveness of short duration of DAPT (&lt;6 weeks) compared with&#xD;
      standard duration (3 months or more) on recurrence rate within 12 months in patients with AIS&#xD;
      due to large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) who are eligible for DAPT post-MT. Randomisation&#xD;
      (allocation 1:1 ratio) will be done via the same system as the main study and stratified by&#xD;
      site and randomisation of BP intervention. Randomised patients will be allocated to either&#xD;
      short duration group of receiving DAPT (aspirin 100 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg per day) for 6&#xD;
      weeks, or standard duration group receiving DAPT for 3 months. DAPT is started &lt;48 hours&#xD;
      post-randomization, and maintained changed to antiplatelet monotherapy (aspirin or&#xD;
      clopidogrel) thereafter. Primary outcome is new stroke event (AIS or ICH) over 12 months.&#xD;
