    <textblock>
      using Atezolizumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor, in combination with bevacizumab, platinum and&#xD;
      pemetrexed to treat patients with EGFR mutated, advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)&#xD;
      after failure of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with (i) stage IIIB~IV non-small cell lung cancer, (ii) tumor harbors&#xD;
      activating mutation at EGFR, (iii) radiological confirmation of progressive disease with one&#xD;
      or more lines of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors but have not yet been exposed to palliative&#xD;
      chemotherapy, will be eligible for screening procedure. The lung cancer stage will be&#xD;
      determined according to the 8th edition of the International Association for the Study of&#xD;
      Lung Cancer (IASLC) Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging system for lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to screening of baseline bone marrow function, organ functions, and CT assessment&#xD;
      of measurable target lesion(s), patients after TKI treatment failure must receive tumor EGFR&#xD;
      genotyping by testing tumor DNA in re-biopsied tumor samples. Testing report from local&#xD;
      laboratories will be accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment of patients into the study will depend on EGFR testing results in re-biopsied&#xD;
      tumor samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration induction phase, four cycles of atezolizumab 1200 mg will be administered over 60&#xD;
      min (1st cycle) and 30 min (2nd cycle onwards); bevacizumab 7.5mg/kg over 90 min in 1st&#xD;
      cycle, 60 min in 2nd cycle and 30 min in 3rd cycle onward; pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 over 10 min;&#xD;
      and cisplatin 75mg/m2 or carboplatin (CCr &lt; 60) area under curve 5 mg/mL per min over 15-60&#xD;
      min intravenously every 3 weeks in the order listed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the induction phase, patients will continue atezolizumab, bevacizumab and&#xD;
      pemetrexed as maintenance therapy. Patients will continue treatment with bevacizumab and&#xD;
      pemetrexed until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or death. Patients may continue&#xD;
      treatment with atezolizumab beyond radiographic progression by RECIST v1.1, provided they are&#xD;
      experiencing clinical benefit as assessed by investigator (i.e., in the absence of&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease progression as&#xD;
      determined by the investigator after an integrated assessment of radiographic data, biopsy&#xD;
      results [if available], and clinical status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atezolizumab and bevacizumab dose reduction will not be allowed. Modification of carboplatin&#xD;
      or cisplatin, and pemetrexed doses will be done according to the local guidelines of National&#xD;
      Taiwan University Hospital&#xD;
