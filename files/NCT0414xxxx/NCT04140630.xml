      Objective: To investigate in real-life conditions passive exposure to aerosols from the use&#xD;
      of e-cigarettes among people who cohabit with e-cigarette users. A secondary objective is to&#xD;
      investigate passive exposure to emissions from the use of conventional cigarettes and heated&#xD;
      tobacco products among people who cohabit with users of these tobacco products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is an observational study conducted in four types of households: a) Homes&#xD;
      with one exclusive e-cigarette user and at least one non-user (non-smoker), and no other&#xD;
      users of any type of tobacco products. In these homes, one non-user and one user will be&#xD;
      included in the study as participants (&quot;type A&quot; homes); b) Homes with one exclusive heated&#xD;
      tobacco product (HTP) user and at least one non-user (non-smoker), and no other users of any&#xD;
      type of tobacco products or e-cigarettes. In these homes, one non-user and one user will be&#xD;
      included in the study as participants (&quot;type B&quot; homes); c) Homes with one exclusive&#xD;
      manufactured cigarette smoker (not roll-your-own) and at least one non-smoker, and no other&#xD;
      users of any type of tobacco products or e-cigarettes. In these homes, one non-smoker and one&#xD;
      smoker will be included in the study as participants (&quot;type C&quot; homes); and d) Homes where no&#xD;
      one uses e-cigarettes or consumes any other type of tobacco products (smoke-free homes). In&#xD;
      these homes, one adult volunteer will be included in the study as a participant (&quot;type D&quot;&#xD;
      homes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 4 countries: Greece (Athens), Italy (Milan), Spain (Barcelona)&#xD;
      and the UK (Edinburgh). Overall, the sample in each participating country will consist of the&#xD;
      types of participants mentioned above, with a total of 250 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements: Passive exposure to e-cigarette aerosols will be assessed by measuring&#xD;
      particulate matter (PM2.5) and airborne nicotine in the main room of homes during 7 days.&#xD;
      Participants' saliva samples will be collected for nicotine and cotinine assessment. In&#xD;
      addition, participants will be asked to fill in a personal diary about the use of&#xD;
      e-cigarettes, second-hand exposure to e-cigarette aerosols (SHA) and exposure to second-hand&#xD;
      smoke (SHS) produced by the use of conventional cigarettes.&#xD;

      Aims: The main objective of this study is to investigate in real-life conditions passive&#xD;
      exposure to aerosols from the use of e-cigarettes among people who cohabit with e-cigarette&#xD;
      users. A secondary objective is to investigate passive exposure to emissions from the use of&#xD;
      conventional cigarettes and heated tobacco products among people who cohabit with users of&#xD;
      these tobacco products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study conducted in four types of households:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Homes with one exclusive e-cigarette user and at least one non-user (non-smoker), and no&#xD;
           other users of any type of tobacco products. In these homes, one non-user and one user&#xD;
           will be included in the study as participants (&quot;type A&quot; homes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Homes with one exclusive heated tobacco product (HTP) user and at least one non-user&#xD;
           (non-smoker), and no other users of any type of tobacco products or e-cigarettes. In&#xD;
           these homes, one non-user and one user will be included in the study as participants&#xD;
           (&quot;type B&quot; homes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Homes with one exclusive manufactured cigarette smoker (not roll-your-own) and at least&#xD;
           one non-smoker, and no other users of any type of tobacco products or e-cigarettes. In&#xD;
           these homes, one non-smoker and one smoker will be included in the study as participants&#xD;
           (&quot;type C&quot; homes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Homes where no one uses e-cigarettes or consumes any other type of tobacco products&#xD;
           (smoke-free homes). In these homes, one adult volunteer will be included in the study as&#xD;
           a participant (&quot;type D&quot; homes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 4 countries: Greece (Athens), Italy (Milan), Spain (Barcelona)&#xD;
      and the UK (Edinburgh).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Passive exposure to e-cigarette aerosols will be assessed by measuring particulate matter&#xD;
      (PM2.5) and airborne nicotine in the main room of homes during 7 days. Participants' saliva&#xD;
      samples will be collected for nicotine and cotinine assessment. In addition, participants&#xD;
      will be asked to fill in a personal diary about the use of e-cigarettes, second-hand exposure&#xD;
      to e-cigarette aerosols (SHA) and exposure to second-hand smoke (SHS) produced by the use of&#xD;
      conventional cigarettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fieldwork&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once in the participants' home:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. After checking the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the participants will be&#xD;
           re-informed (information was provided when contacting for the first time the&#xD;
           participants) about the study (information sheet for participants) and will be asked to&#xD;
           provide their informed written consent. They will be also informed about a reward for&#xD;
           their participation after finishing the study (gift card to be used in a local cultural&#xD;
           store with value of 15€).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measurement of nicotine using active sampling will be initiated, lasting 30 min and&#xD;
           record of smoking/use pattern if applicable using the home dossier.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The researcher will install the monitor with a filter for nicotine sampling that will be&#xD;
           left at homes of the participants during the week of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The researcher will administer to the participant the questionnaire about usual exposure&#xD;
           to SHS and SHA (for all participants) and about consumption practices and habits (for&#xD;
           users).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The participants will be instructed about the completion of the diary card that will be&#xD;
           used to collect daily information about exposure to SHS and SHA (for all participants)&#xD;
           and about patterns of smoking, e-cigarette or HTP use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The first saliva sample will be collected under the supervision of the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. AirVisual, an optical PM2.5 monitoring device, will be installed in the main room of the&#xD;
           home. The participants will be instructed about its functioning and contact details for&#xD;
           any questions will be provided in participant information leaflet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The container for urine sample to be collected at the second visit after one week of the&#xD;
           study with instructions on the procedures will be provided to the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. The participants will be informed that:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the researchers will be available for any queries during the study period and a&#xD;
                contact phone number will be provided;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  reminders to fill in the diary card will be sent via emails (SMS or the system&#xD;
                chosen by the participant) every day; and&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the researchers will make a follow-up telephone call during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. The researcher should inform about the day when the second visit should be done (after 7&#xD;
           days of the study) and confirm the time with the participants During the consequent 7&#xD;
           days&#xD;
&#xD;
      During 7 days of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  call the participant to check the progress and resolve any queries, at the day 3 or 4 of&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  send a text message (SMS or other system) daily to remind to fill in the diary card&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  send a text message in the morning of the day of the second visit to remind about urine&#xD;
           sample collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - fill in the diary card to record any exposure to SHA and/or SHS at home and other settings&#xD;
      (for all participants) and e-cigarette, HTP use or smoking pattern (for e-cigarette, HTP&#xD;
      users and smokers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second visit (7 days after first visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the participants' homes, the researchers will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  measure airborne nicotine with active sampling for 30 minutes (2nd measurement)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  review the diary cards with the participant(s) and collect them&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  collect the AirVisual device and passive nicotine sampler&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  collect a second saliva sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ask to the participant(s) for sample of e-liquid used (for e-cigarette users)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  collect the urine sample prepared by the participants (if applies)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  give the gift card to participants and ask them to sign the receipt form&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  acknowledge the participation and remind that the feedback with the results of the study&#xD;
           will be sent to them in approximately 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management: All data from questionnaires, environmental measurements and saliva analysis&#xD;
      will be managed by researchers from Tobacco Control Unit (UCT) of the Catalan Institute of&#xD;
      Oncology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected in paper and will be digitalised in a protected database. All the&#xD;
      samples (environmental, biological, and e-cigarette liquid) will have a unique code to be&#xD;
      linked with the already anonymized data from the questionnaires, and this data will be stored&#xD;
      in the same database. Only a selected number of pre-designated members of the research team&#xD;
      (who will sign a confidentiality document) will have access to the database and the freezer.&#xD;
      All data will be stored into a single database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selected personal data, including the names of respondents, will be collected separately to&#xD;
      enable quality assurance procedures and to allow participants' willing to withdraw from&#xD;
      participation in the study to have their records deleted from the database. This information&#xD;
      will remain dissociated from the specific information generated in the experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the quality assurance procedures, Dr Esteve Fernández will obtain an anonymised copy&#xD;
      of the database. The database will be held securely on a password protected file server at&#xD;
      ICO. Dr Fernández will designate a limited number of researchers from UCT team or the&#xD;
      consortium to access this database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to personal data and withdrawal from the study: It will be made clear in the&#xD;
      information (provided orally and in the information sheet) that the subjects are completely&#xD;
      free to withdraw their records from participation in the study, regardless having had a gift&#xD;
      compensation for their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consent given by participants in the project can be withdrawn at any time, without any&#xD;
      explanation or justification. In this case, all data pertaining to the subjects will be&#xD;
      destroyed, both in paper and digital supports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, participants will receive the results from the environmental and&#xD;
      biological measurements conducted as well as the overall results obtained for the entire&#xD;
      study subjects. Summary data related to the entire project will be publicly disseminated once&#xD;
      it has been processed and protected, without data that allow individual identification of&#xD;
      participants. These summary results will be accessed through the project website or through&#xD;
      publications related to this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human cells/tissues: Biological samples (saliva and urine) will be collected after obtaining&#xD;
      informed consent, in which it will be specified that these samples will be used only for the&#xD;
      study aims, this is, the measurement of nicotine, cotinine and other metabolites of nicotine,&#xD;
      metals and other markers of exposure to aerosols from e-cigarettes, but not for the use of&#xD;
      the cells or genetic material also contained in the saliva. The remaining saliva and urine&#xD;
      will be stored at the certified biobank (at ICO) and can be used for future determinations of&#xD;
      compounds from cigarettes and e-cigarettes related with the objectives of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Privacy and confidentiality: All personal information will be treated as confidential and&#xD;
      will be stored in agreement with the current laws. The study will be conducted in accordance&#xD;
      with the Good Clinical Practice Guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and the current&#xD;
      legal regulation about confidentiality of data in the European Union (Regulation EU 2016/679&#xD;
      of the European Parliament and of the Council).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Environmental protection and safety: This study will require some exposure from the&#xD;
      participants; however, this exposure will be the usual one and the participants will not be&#xD;
      forced to any additional exposure given the observational nature of the study conducted. They&#xD;
      will record the usual exposures without any intervention from the research team. Similarly,&#xD;
      the researchers can be also exposed to emissions from tobacco products, but the total time of&#xD;
      potential exposure is out of the range of potential health hazards produced by these&#xD;
      exposures. All the researchers have been informed and have signed a written consent about&#xD;
      their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidental findings: In case that while reviewing the results from the chemical analysis of&#xD;
      nicotine metabolites in saliva any unexpected abnormality is observed (what is called an&#xD;
      &quot;incidental finding&quot;), the investigators will let the participant know. Depending on the type&#xD;
      of incidental finding, the participant will be contacted by mail or by phone. The participant&#xD;
      does not have an option to decline information about an incidental finding. The costs for any&#xD;
      care that will be needed to diagnose or treat an incidental finding would not be paid for the&#xD;
      research study. These costs would be the responsibility of the participant.&#xD;
