      The primary objective is to assess the short and long term tolerability of ipilimumab in&#xD;
      combination with osimertinib. The secondary objective is to assess efficacy of osimertinib in&#xD;
      combination with ipilimumab. Ipilimumab will be given for a total of four doses and&#xD;
      osimertinib will be given until treatment discontinuation criteria is met. Ipilimumab at the&#xD;
      assigned dose level every 3 weeks for four doses in combination with once daily osimertinib.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a Phase 1b, open label study of osimertinib in combination with ipilimumab in eligible adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutated non-small cell lung cancer. The study will focus on the safety and long term tolerability of the combination.&#xD;
The study will begin with a safety lead-in evaluation consisting of a cohort of six patients. Once safety has been established, the trial will open enrollment to the expansion cohort. The expansion cohort will enroll an additional 14 patients at the same doses evaluated during the safety lead-in.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Patients entering trial should be on stable dose of osi for ≥4 weeks. Patients will self-administer osi by mouth regardless of food once daily. Doses should be taken at about the same time every day (±6hrs) and recorded on the patient dosing diary. Doses missed outside of the dosing window should not be made up but patients should be instructed to take their next dose at their regularly scheduled time. Ipi will be administered at the assigned dose level every 21 days (±3days) for a max of 4 doses. Ipi must be infused using a volumetric pump over 90min (±10min) through an IV line. Upon completion of the ipilimumab regimen, patients will continue osimertinib daily until disease progression, initiation of new anti-cancer therapy, or death by any cause.</description>
