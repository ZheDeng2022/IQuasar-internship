  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The thoracic outlet syndrome is a rare but debilitating pathology, responsible for upper limb&#xD;
      pain. Its frequency is probably underestimated because of diagnostic difficulties. This&#xD;
      syndrome encompasses several entities including compressions of neurological, venous or&#xD;
      arterial origin. In addition to pain, the majority of patients report fatigability and loss&#xD;
      of strength in the upper limbs. However, the quantification of this loss of strength and&#xD;
      fatigability has hardly been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the rehabilitation treatment is the first-line treatment of this pathology. It&#xD;
      most often includes a muscle building phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, we would like to evaluate the proximal and distal force of patients&#xD;
      presenting a thoracic outlet syndrome by comparing them to a population free from any&#xD;
      pathology in the upper limbs. This evaluation would involve an isokinetic strength analysis&#xD;
      of shoulder rotators at the proximal level, using an isokinetic dynamometer. At the distal&#xD;
      level, the evaluation would be done using force clamps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a second step, we will also be able to evaluate the effects of the reeducation on the&#xD;
      strength and the muscular fatigability of the patients presenting a thoracic outlet syndrome.&#xD;

        50 patients with an thoracic outlet syndrome will be needed, which corresponds to the&#xD;
        annual recruitment in this care within the department of the University Hospital of Nantes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be included during their usual management of rehabilitation at the center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        50 healthy subjects will be included, in order to have a patient for a healthy subject. We&#xD;
        will call on the staff and student volunteers of the rehabilitation center we will match on&#xD;
        age, sex and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For both groups, we will only use major topics that do not benefit from any legal&#xD;
        protection measures&#xD;
