      PARTICIPANT CENTRES AND RESEARCHERS: 20 National Public Health System hospitals. Cardiology&#xD;
      specialist physicians&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAIN GOAL: To estimate prevalence and, in medium term basis (12 months), incidence of&#xD;
      hyperkalaemia in heart failure (HF) outpatients with reduced ejection fraction (REF) and its&#xD;
      relationship with non-optimal HF therapy and clinical outcomes (mortality and hospital&#xD;
      admission).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC GOALS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. -Estimating Hyperkalaemia prevalence in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. -Assessing the role of hyperkalaemia with the use of non-optimal therapy doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. -Estimating 12 months hyperkalaemia incidence on these patients and describing the&#xD;
           severity of the episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. -Estimating incidence of HF hospital admission and/or death in these patients on a&#xD;
           medium term basis (12 months) and its association with existence of hyperkalaemia during&#xD;
           follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. -Assessing hyperkalaemia risk during follow-up in relation with the existence of&#xD;
           diabetes and/or renal failure (RF) at baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN National multicentric prospective observational study that includes 12 months&#xD;
      follow-up of consecutive cases of HF outpatients with REF. Inclusion baseline visit and&#xD;
      follow -up visit at 12 months will be scheduled for collecting clinical and blood sample data&#xD;
      of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed in ordinary conditions of clinical practice; no additional&#xD;
      procedures or interventions will be performed. Patients will be selected in cardiology&#xD;
      outpatient clinics of 20 Spanish centres, including the first 30 patients meeting inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria. All patients will undergo the common studies according to usual&#xD;
      clinical practice and at least both, potassium and renal creatinine clearance values will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To respond to the main objective, prevalence of hyperkalaemia at baseline will be determined&#xD;
      as well as the appearance of new hyperkalaemia cases in the follow up of patients that had&#xD;
      normal potassium levels at baseline visit; their relationship with outcomes of interest will&#xD;
      also be determined&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected number of patients recruited in 20 Spanish research centres is 600.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT SIMPLE SIZE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming a 10% risk of outcomes (mortality or HF hospital admission) among the exposed&#xD;
      (hyperkalaemia), 2.5% among the non-exposed and a 7:1 non-exposed/exposed ratio, 73 exposed&#xD;
      and 511 non-exposed patients should be included to have a 80% power to detect these&#xD;
      differences with a 95% confidence level. The recruitment goal is set at 600 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This sample size allows a precision of ±2,4%, assuming a prevalence of hyperkalaemia at&#xD;
      baseline of 10% and with a 95% confidence level. Furthermore, assuming 5% hyperkalaemia&#xD;
      cumulative incidence through follow-up among hyperkalaemia-free patients at baseline, the&#xD;
      proposed sample size, allows a precision of±1,8% with a 95% confidence level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SELECTION OF CENTRES The number of participant centres throughout Spain will be 20 and a&#xD;
      cardiologist will be the principal investigator at every centre. The centres have been&#xD;
      selected either among those with excellence-certified HF units, included in CiberCV&#xD;
      Consortium or with good performance in previous similar registries; this selection is not&#xD;
      random, but based on interest and high performance criteria in the field of HF&#xD;
&#xD;
      VARIABLES AND CRF:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome variables are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - Hyperkalaemia. Serum Potassium (K+) will be measured in baseline and follow-up visits,&#xD;
           but also if there is any intermediate hospital admission. All available potassium&#xD;
           measurements during follow-up will be reviewed and values of hyperkalaemia identified.&#xD;
           Hyperkalaemia will be considered with (K+) Values &gt; 5,4 mEq/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Proportion of patients using drugs with proven efficacy for HF with REF -but also&#xD;
           linked with hyperkalaemia- (ACEIs/ARB-II/ARNI and MRAs) and proportion of patients with&#xD;
           use of optimal doses (based on current ESC heart failure guidelines2) of the same drugs;&#xD;
           reason for not using them (or not receiving optimal doses) will be registered.&#xD;
           Proportion of patients in the following categories will also be computed:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  No ACEi/ARB/ARNI or at less than target dose and no MRA&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ACEi/ARB/ARNI at target dose and no MRA&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ACEi/ARB/ARNI at target dose and MRA at less than target dose&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ACEi/ARB/ARNI at target dose and MRA at target dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - Hospital admissions during follow-up and main cause for them. Outcomes considered will&#xD;
           include HF admissions caused by hyperkalaemia and related events. Outcome Serum (K+)&#xD;
           values will be also registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. - Mortality and cause. HF (and hyperkalaemia) hospital admissions and mortality will be&#xD;
           independently considered as outcomes; joint outcome incidence of both will be also&#xD;
           calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DEVELOPMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every participating centre will include from inclusion date the first 30 heart failure&#xD;
      outpatients who fulfil the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion ones. The excluded&#xD;
      patients will be also registered, pointing out the reason of exclusion. A follow-up and final&#xD;
      visit will be scheduled after 12 months for collecting all the variables the study requires.&#xD;
      Hospitalisation data since inclusion visit will be also collected, together with the&#xD;
      information of blood sample test performed in such period for detecting hyperkalaemia&#xD;
      episodes. Mortality data will include date and cause, where possible. If follow-up visit&#xD;
      cannot be conducted, the reason for it will be registered. The envisaged length of the study&#xD;
      is 24 months since approval date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutively, every researcher will handle and explain the information sheet to the patients&#xD;
      that might fulfil de inclusion criteria (and do not present any exclusion criteria) and will&#xD;
      ask them to sign the informed consent. Researchers must warrant the accuracy and completion&#xD;
      of the data collected for the study. Data registered at CRF should be consistent with source&#xD;
      documents used for their collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MANAGEMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected during initial and follow-up visits and they will be integrated into a&#xD;
      unique data base of the web platform. Researchers are responsible of the information included&#xD;
      in the database and will access by means of personal login and password. The online platform&#xD;
      will include ranges and rules to minimize errors in data registering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLAN FOR DATA ANALYSIS Hyperkalaemia prevalence at basal visit and the rate of patients who&#xD;
      do not receive and/or reach optimal doses of drugs of interest (ACIEs, ARB-II, MRAs) will be&#xD;
      estimated and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals computed. The reason for not&#xD;
      receiving and/or reaching optimal doses of drugs will be described, especially if it is due&#xD;
      to hyperkalaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those patients who do not present hyperkalaemia at baseline, 12 month hyperkalaemia&#xD;
      cumulative incidence (95% confidence interval) will be estimated; also it will be estimated&#xD;
      the proportion of patients who have to modify their therapy due to hyperkalaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of episodes of hyperkalaemia during follow-up in relation to the number of&#xD;
      patients will be estimated and their severity and the therapy changes that induced described.&#xD;
      Also 12 months cumulative incidence of clinical outcomes will be estimated: hospitalisation&#xD;
      due to HF or to, hyperkalaemia (and related events) and mortality, considered as individual&#xD;
      and composite outcomes. The association between hyperkalaemia and occurrence of outcomes will&#xD;
      be analyses and also adjusted using potential confounding factors by means of logistic&#xD;
      regression models&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quantitative variables will be generally described using either the mean and the standard&#xD;
      deviation or the median and interquartile range according them following or not a normal&#xD;
      distribution. When comparing groups, t-student test will be used for continuous variables and&#xD;
      chi-share test for qualitative ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both, intermediate and final analysis, are planned to be carried out after baseline-visit&#xD;
      closure and at the end of follow up (12 months).&#xD;
