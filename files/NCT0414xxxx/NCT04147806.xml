  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study evaluates clinical outcomes and treatment-related toxicity following&#xD;
      definitive ultra-high dose external beam radiotherapy delivered with two different regimens&#xD;
      in patients with intermediate-risk adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Modern computer-driven&#xD;
      technology enables the implementation of ultra-high hypofractionated Image-Guided&#xD;
      Radiotherapy (IGRT) safely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate cancer patients classified according to the current National Comprehensive Cancer&#xD;
      Network (NCCN) guidelines as intermediate risk (biopsy Gleason score of 7 and/or Prostate&#xD;
      Specific Antigen (PSA) level &gt;10 and ≤20 ng/mL and/or Stage T1, T2a, T2b or T2c) are eligible&#xD;
      for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo IGRT with volumetric intensity-modulated arc radiotherapy (VMAT) with&#xD;
      state-of-the-art treatment-planning and quality assurance procedures. Emphasis is placed on&#xD;
      normal tissue sparing and delivery accuracy via the use of devices that ensure stability and&#xD;
      beam location reproducibility. A rectal balloon with air filling will be used for prostate&#xD;
      target immobilization and anatomical reproducibility, while a urethral catheter loaded with&#xD;
      beacon transponders will be used to ensure set-up reproducibility and online target tracking.&#xD;
      Previously untreated patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer will be prospectively&#xD;
      randomized to receive either 45 Gy in five fractions of 9 Gy each vs. 24 Gy in a single-dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed at one month post-treatment and every 3 months for up to 12 months&#xD;
      (+/- 4 weeks) and every 6 months thereafter. Acute and chronic toxicity evaluations will&#xD;
      focus on urinary, rectal and sexual functions and will be assessed through validated&#xD;
      questionnaires. Serum PSA values will be regularly acquired during follow-up. A&#xD;
      multiparametric MRI will be performed at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months following&#xD;
      intervention. Additionally, a post-treatment diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) will be&#xD;
      performed within 15 minutes of the first treatment, to measure early physiologic changes,&#xD;
      such as perfusion and ischemia, that may correlate with clinically relevant end-points.&#xD;
      Post-treatment prostate needle biopsies will be obtained at 24 months to evaluate pathologic&#xD;
      response to therapy. The study will be continuously monitored for a minimum of 5 years. In&#xD;
      the event unexpected severe (grade ≥3) toxicities are observed in any one of the treatment&#xD;
      arms, the study will be terminated according to the stopping rule &gt;3/first 15 patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is open label feasibility study where patients enrolled in the study will undergo&#xD;
      image-guided, intensity-modulated radiotherapy using the same equipment, techniques, and&#xD;
      treatment-planning procedures as currently practiced at CCU. Eligible patients will receive&#xD;
      either 45 Gy in 5 sessions each of 9 Gy delivered in one week (arm A) or 24 Gy in 1 session&#xD;
      (arm B) to assess the dose limiting toxicities in the two groups. Patients will be randomized&#xD;
      to arm A or arm B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as any Grade 3 urinary or rectal toxicity, based on&#xD;
      NCI CTCAE v4.0, observed within 3 months of completion of protocol radiation. If, at any&#xD;
      point in the conduct of the trial, DLTs are observed in three patients in a study arm,&#xD;
      accrual to that arm will be terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three aspects of this study that will be different from the currently used standard&#xD;
      treatment for definitive external beam treatment of prostate cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The dose-fractionation scheme, as per the treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Acquisition of a set of prostate biopsies at 24 months post treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examination of imaging response based on multi-parametric MRI&#xD;
