    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Caliper measurements of the treatment areas were taken at baseline and at 12-weeks post treatment. After the treatment area was identified and marked, the thickness of the fat layer was measured using a caliper at the middle of the fat bulge. For each treatment area, three measurements were taken and recorded. The average of the three measurements was calculated. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
