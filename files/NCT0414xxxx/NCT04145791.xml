      The purpose of the proposed study is to investigate the effectiveness of cryotherapy as an&#xD;
      additional form of pain control in women undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy for benign&#xD;
      gynecologic conditions through a randomized trial. The following aims will be pursued:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim: To determine if cryotherapy patients will have lower pain scores on VAS compared&#xD;
      to standard pain management patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis: Patients receiving cryotherapy will have lower VAS scores compared to&#xD;
      patients receiving pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim 1: To determine if cryotherapy will reduce the number of morphine milligram&#xD;
      equivalent (MME) compared to patients with standard pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis 1: Patients receiving cryotherapy will have lower MME values compared to&#xD;
      patients with standard pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim 2: To determine if cryotherapy will result in earlier return to baseline&#xD;
      activity as measured by Quality of Recovery Questionnaire (QoR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis 2: Patients receiving cryotherapy will return to baseline activity level&#xD;
      sooner than those receiving standard pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim 3: To determine if cryotherapy will result in a faster time to discharge as&#xD;
      determined by duration between admission to postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and discharge&#xD;
      home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis 3: Patient receiving cryotherapy will be have a shorter stay in PACU.&#xD;

    <description>To determine if cryotherapy patients will have lower pain scores on a visual analog scale (VAS) compared to standard pain management patients at the time of same day discharge. VAS requires that patients mark their level pain along a straight 100mm line. There are no number markings on the scale. The beginning of the line is labeled on the left as &quot;no pain&quot; and the end of the line on the right is labeled as &quot;worst pain imaginable.&quot; Once marked by the patient, the distance from beginning of the line to the patient's hash mark is measured in millimeters and that value is recorded as the pain level. The minimum is 0 (no pain) and the maximum is 100 (worst pain imaginable).</description>
