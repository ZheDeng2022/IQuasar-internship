  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of task shifting from anesthesiologists&#xD;
      to special trained nurses performing femoral nerve block (FNB) in patients with hip fracture&#xD;
      in the emergency department (ED) at Vestfold Hospital Trust (VHT). A sample of nurses (n= 6)&#xD;
      will perform ultrasound guided FNB in hip fracture patients (n=25) admitted to the ED at VHT.&#xD;
      This cohort will be compared to another cohort of hip fracture patients (n=25). This cohort&#xD;
      will follow standard of care where the femoral nerve block is often performed by&#xD;
      anesthesiologists. The study is a prospective, controlled randomized trial.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ageing population admitted to the ED in developed countries is steadily increasing. Hip&#xD;
      fractures are common among the elderly population, and related to increased mortality.&#xD;
      Patient satisfaction with ED's has been an international challenge over several years. Acute&#xD;
      pain is one of the most common reasons for patients coming admitted to the ED. However,&#xD;
      undertreatment of pain is common, particularly in patients with hip fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain control can be difficult, and often requires intensive nursing and physician care, as&#xD;
      elderly patients may manifest cardiovascular and respiratory complications from opioid&#xD;
      administration. Optimizing acute pain management in patients with orthopedic trauma is&#xD;
      important and can translate into significant positive physiologic and financial outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Vestfold Hospital Trust, pain relief of the hip fracture patient in ED has traditionally&#xD;
      most often consisted of paracetamol and opiates. Additionally, the patients are offered FNB&#xD;
      by the anesthesiologist, but concurrent conflicts and other organizational circumstances has&#xD;
      have led to delayed block or no block for all or some patients. This often necessitate a&#xD;
      continuation of pain relief in form of intravenous opioids, with increased risk of opioid&#xD;
      side effects such as respiratory depression, delirium, constipation, urinary retention,&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting and subsequently increased morbidity and increased costs for the hospital&#xD;
      and the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that shifting this task to nurses working in the ED can secure&#xD;
      patient with hip fractures sufficiently and timely pain relief. By giving trained nurses this&#xD;
      new task of performing FNB the investigators can study how expert nurses qualifications' are&#xD;
      utilized to strengthen the quality of the ED. This study aims to implement and evaluate the&#xD;
      introduction of specially trained nurses performing ultrasound guided FNB in patients with&#xD;
      hip fractures in the ED. This implementation may be beneficial to patients in terms of prompt&#xD;
      analgesia, reduced opioid consumption, thereby reducing opioid adverse events, and it might&#xD;
      influence risk of complications and length of stay. The aim of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      cumulative Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score during rest and during passive movement (30&#xD;
      degree flexion in the hip) in patients with hip fracture during stay in the ED at 120 minutes&#xD;
      after admission, thereby comparing nurse-led FNB versus standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has a randomized controlled trial design. Patients are randomized (1:1) into two&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Trained nurses in ED provide ultrasound guided single-shot FNB shortly after (at arrival&#xD;
           ED) the patient is diagnosed with a hip fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Nurses do not provide ultrasound guided single-shot FNB and the patient follows the&#xD;
           FAST-TRACK-HIP FRACTURE course local guideline at our hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: A single shot FNB performed by nurses in the ED compared to todays practice will&#xD;
      result in lower cumulative NRS score first 120 minutes after admission to ED than current&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
