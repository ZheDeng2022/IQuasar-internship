  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glomerular hyperfiltration is a major risk factor for accelerated glomerular filtration rate&#xD;
      (GFR) decline and renal and cardiovascular events despite optimized conservative therapy with&#xD;
      blood pressure and blood glucose (in diabetics) lowering medications and inhibitors of the&#xD;
      Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) such as Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and/or&#xD;
      Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progressive GFR decline initiated and sustained by glomerular hyperfiltration in subjects&#xD;
      with diabetes, unhealthy obesity, hypertension and other risk factors, is paralleled by&#xD;
      progressive glomerulosclerosis and loss of functioning nephrons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inhibition of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) in the proximal tubular segments&#xD;
      of the nephrons appears to be an ideal, specific intervention to inhibit the&#xD;
      tubulo-glomerular feedback and ameliorate glomerular hyperfiltration in subjects with&#xD;
      absolute or relative hyperfiltration associated with unhealthy obesity or proteinuric chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease (CKD). Indeed, by reducing tubular sodium reabsorption, SGLT2 inhibitors may&#xD;
      enhance sodium chloride delivery to the macula densa, restore pre-glomerular resistances and&#xD;
      therefore limit glomerular hyperperfusion and consequent hyperfiltration. Moreover, because&#xD;
      of its natriuretic effects, SGLT2 inhibition therapy might reduce the sodium overload and&#xD;
      volume expansion which, along with secondary hypertension, may further contribute to kidney&#xD;
      hyperperfusion and glomerular hyperfiltration in obesity and CKD.&#xD;
