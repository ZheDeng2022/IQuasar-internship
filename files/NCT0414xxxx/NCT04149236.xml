  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Investigators will be giving a survey to ~100 people in a rural community in Guatemala to&#xD;
      discover beliefs and perspectives that the Participants have surrounding various aspects of&#xD;
      healthcare. The Investigators aim to do this in order to be able to better serve the&#xD;
      population in the community by discovering specific information about them from the&#xD;
      Participants and how the Participants about different health practices. The Investigators&#xD;
      will answer their research questions through the questionnaire that will allow participants&#xD;
      to explain their viewpoints about a variety of medical topics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The design of this cross-sectional study is centered around a structured questionnaire of a&#xD;
      mixed qualitative and quantitative nature that is composed primarily of yes/no or Likert&#xD;
      scale responses. All questions are written with the intent that they may be understood by&#xD;
      those participants without any formal education. The investigators will recruit participants&#xD;
      that are currently using the services of the Trifinio clinic in rural Guatemala as these are&#xD;
      likely to fit inclusion criteria and will be able to benefit from potential future services&#xD;
      that will be directed by the findings of this questionnaire. For all participants, Likert&#xD;
      scale questions will be used with a series of faces to help indicate meanings for the answers&#xD;
      and to decrease possibility of misinterpretation. Participants will be recruited through&#xD;
      non-probabilistic sampling and the use of snowball sampling. Screening of these participants&#xD;
      for exclusion criteria will be performed before questionnaires are distributed. The questions&#xD;
      of the questionnaire are designed to elicit information about certain beliefs or preferences&#xD;
      related to healthcare in a structured manner that allows us to compare answers and determine&#xD;
      trends, prevalence, and associations that are likely to exist among community members.&#xD;
      Participation will be completely voluntary and informed consent will be obtained from each&#xD;
      participant before they are given the questionnaire. For participants who are illiterate or&#xD;
      would prefer to have the informed consent and questionnaire read aloud to them, this will be&#xD;
      done by one of the CITI-trained investigators. Recorded data will only include questionnaire&#xD;
      responses and will not include any identifying information. We will be using randomized&#xD;
      numbers in order to refer to completed questionnaires, but these numbers will have no&#xD;
      identifying aspects and will be used for the sole purpose of keeping track of the gathered&#xD;
      data. The information gathered will be de-identified and stored and password-protected&#xD;
      through REDCap.&#xD;
