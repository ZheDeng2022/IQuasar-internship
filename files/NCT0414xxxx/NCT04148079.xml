  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to asses whether physyical therapy (e.g. electrotherapy in the form of low,&#xD;
      medium or high frequency currents, massage and kinetotherapy) for treatment of knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis can induce or aggravate certain cardiac diseases during or immediately after&#xD;
      therapy. The physyical treatment described is not a new method, is currently used and&#xD;
      recommended in all guidelines for non-pharmacological and non-surgical therapy of knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis. What is not clear is whether application of electrotherapy in the knee area&#xD;
      can alter the preexisting cardiac condition.&#xD;

      An analytical and transversal study was carried out between March 2013 and August 2017. The&#xD;
      study included a total of 46 patients previously diagnosed with degenerative knee OA. All the&#xD;
      patients included in the study were recruited during inpatient visit in the Clinical&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Hospital in Cluj-Napoca, Romania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient was clinically evaluated and was furthermore prescribed a PT program (ET,&#xD;
      massage and kinesiotherapy). They were monitored by 24 hour-Holter ECG in 2 separate days, at&#xD;
      the beginning of treatment, before applying the PT methods (day 1), and after completing a&#xD;
      10-day PT program (day 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PT modalities prescribed for each patient after clinical evaluation included different types&#xD;
      of ET, all currently used and included in the national and international treatment&#xD;
      guidelines, as in low frequency currents (galvanic or TENS), medium frequency currents&#xD;
      (interferential) and high frequency currents (short wave diathermy), all combined with an&#xD;
      individualized exercise program and massage therapy. The program was performed on a daily&#xD;
      basis, for 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the PT program was to decrease pain and increase range of motion in the affected&#xD;
      joints and did not lead to increases in cardiac frequencies. No hydrotherapy was applied,&#xD;
      given that that the Holter ECG was not waterproof. No technical incidents were reported&#xD;
      during the study. No alternate positioning of the patient wearing a Holter ECG for ET&#xD;
      procedures was necessary, as the region of interest was the knee. No change in current drug&#xD;
      therapy was allowed for the whole duration of the study.&#xD;
