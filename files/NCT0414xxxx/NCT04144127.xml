  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to directly test the implementation feasibility of a soccer-based lifestyle&#xD;
      change intervention vs a low-cost mobile-health (mHealth) enabled lifestyle intervention and&#xD;
      determine their effects on bone health, body composition, mental health, functional and&#xD;
      cardiometabolic status among prostate cancer survivors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer survivors are at an increased risk of bone loss due to previous cancer treatments and&#xD;
      are at increased risk of obesity and other cardiometabolic diseases. Therefore it is&#xD;
      important for cancer survivors to adhere to an active lifestyle and good nutrition. The study&#xD;
      proposes a single site, pilot, randomized clinical trial to examine the efficacy of a&#xD;
      lifestyle program that includes recreational soccer (RS) and nutrition education compared to&#xD;
      mobile health lifestyle program to improve bone density and bone turnover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It proposes that leveraging the growing enthusiasm around soccer in Atlanta and the U.S. may&#xD;
      lead to increased interest, participation, retention and engagement in lifestyle change&#xD;
      programming among prostate cancer (PCa) survivors. Therefore, this study seeks to directly&#xD;
      test the implementation feasibility of a lifestyle change intervention in combination with RS&#xD;
      and determine its effects in bone health, body composition, mental health, functional and&#xD;
      cardiometabolic status among PCa survivors. A comparison group will receive usual care plus a&#xD;
      low cost, mobile-health (mHealth) enabled lifestyle intervention, without supervised physical&#xD;
      activity (PA) programming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to recruit 40 men (50% African American or Latino) that have been in survivor&#xD;
      status for at least 6 months from several Winship Cancer Institute clinical sites. The trial&#xD;
      will exclude those with metastatic disease, already too active, and with any&#xD;
      contraindications to exercise. The participants will be randomized after eligibility&#xD;
      screening and will be scheduled for baseline assessments. The intervention group will be&#xD;
      offered twice/week 60-minute soccer conditioning sessions using an evidence-based Football&#xD;
      Fitness curriculum, delivered by trained soccer coaches. They will also receive lifestyle&#xD;
      education including nutrition and other American Heart Association (AHA) Life's Simple 7 core&#xD;
      messages after soccer sessions for 15 minutes. The comparison group will receive weekly&#xD;
      educational and motivational text messages, aimed at improving physical activity (PA) and&#xD;
      lifestyles. Both intervention and comparison groups will receive a wearable Garmin device to&#xD;
      objectively monitor PA volume (steps) and intensity (minutes of moderate and vigorous) PA, as&#xD;
      well as sedentary and sleep time. The study will assess pre and post differences in bone&#xD;
      mineral density (primary outcome), body composition (DXA), bone turnover biomarkers,&#xD;
      anthropometrics, diet, physical fitness, blood pressure and patient-reported outcomes&#xD;
      including PA and diet self-efficacy, quality of life and depression. The trial will also&#xD;
      compare the compliance with the federal recommendations of 150 weekly minutes of&#xD;
      moderate-to-vigorous PA between the recreational soccer-based intervention and the comparison&#xD;
      group, as a marker of program adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study assessments will be conducted at the Emory Clinical Research Center on the Clifton&#xD;
      Campus and the intervention group will have their soccer sessions on a soccer field in the&#xD;
      Atlanta area that is convenient for the participants. All participants will be given gift&#xD;
      cards for each assessment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate the RS program will be more efficacious in preventing bone loss&#xD;
      and increasing weight loss in PCa survivors. This study will engage men in a lifestyle&#xD;
      program that has the potential to sustain healthy behaviors beyond the term of the study.&#xD;

They will meet with the soccer coach after the soccer sessions to discuss the lifestyle education topics (Life's Simple 7 education topics). During the soccer sessions participants will be fitted with a wearable soccer-specific device to measure how much they move and their heart rate. All participants will receive a Garmin Vivofit wearable device to help monitor their PA goals and achievements.</description>
