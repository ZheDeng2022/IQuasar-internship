    <textblock>
      The Supporting Habit Formation to Attenuate Prefrailty in Elders (SHAPE) Pilot Study is a&#xD;
      randomized control study. The main objective of this pilot study is to determine the&#xD;
      feasibility of using Habit Formation (HF) treatment to increase Physical Activity (PA)&#xD;
      (reduction in daily in hours of sedentary time), and dietary among prefrail African&#xD;
      Americans. We hypothesize: (1)The SHAPE study will demonstrate good feasibility with a high&#xD;
      recruitment rate and successful administration all of the measures among the target&#xD;
      population; (2) Treatment group participants will demonstrate greater increases in primary&#xD;
      outcomes (physical activity level and dietary quality) and secondary outcomes (quality of&#xD;
      life, depressive symptoms, prefrailty reduction, lower extremity strength and balance,&#xD;
      physical activity level, waist circumference, and weight at intervention completion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frailty signifies a decline in physical, cognitive and/or psychosocial reserve that reduces&#xD;
      an older adult's ability to respond to or recover from stressors (e.g., acute illness) and&#xD;
      contributes to early morbidity and mortality. Nearly half of all older adults are prefrail,&#xD;
      and prefrailty status increases the risk of becoming frail. Frailty is more prevalent among&#xD;
      African Americans and occurs earlier in life when compared to European Americans. Older&#xD;
      African Americans in the US, face significant challenges in adhering to frailty reduction&#xD;
      treatment such as increasing physical activity (PA) and adopt a healthy diet. Those&#xD;
      challenges include poverty, accelerated aging, higher levels of activities of daily living&#xD;
      disability, and less access to safe opportunities for PA or healthy food. The situation is&#xD;
      even worse for urban-dwelling older African Americans, who often reside in neighborhoods&#xD;
      replete with physical and social stressors (e.g., derelict infrastructure or crime) that&#xD;
      intersect with the vulnerabilities of aging, to further complicate their efforts to engage in&#xD;
      frailty protective behaviors. Despite this, frailty interventions overwhelmingly exclude&#xD;
      African Americans, thereby limiting generalizability to this high-risk group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the rationale of this study is to test the feasibility of a novel habit formation&#xD;
      (HF) intervention to facilitate frailty protective behaviors in prefrail African Americans&#xD;
      ages 55 and older in a randomized control trial study. The HF intervention targets two main&#xD;
      health behaviors: decrease sedentary time (ST) and improve dietary quality. The intervention&#xD;
      consists of 12 treatment sessions over 12 weeks. In each session, an occupational therapist&#xD;
      will deliver educational content, and use HF techniques and behavioral skills to facilitate&#xD;
      frailty protective behaviors. Forty-eight prefrail African American adults will be randomized&#xD;
      to the treatment or control group. The baseline evaluation will be conducted before&#xD;
      randomization and the follow-up evaluation after the last treatment session. For the&#xD;
      treatment group participants, we will further evaluation occupational activity&#xD;
      performance/satisfaction and habit formation strength within treatment sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of this study is to determine the feasibility of HF intervention among prefrail&#xD;
      African American adults. The main hypothesis is: the SHAPE study will demonstrate good&#xD;
      feasibility with (1) high recruitment rate (recruit 48 participants over 6 months), (2)&#xD;
      treatment group participants will show preliminary efficacy in primary outcomes such as&#xD;
      reducing sedentary time (measured by the ActivPal device) and increasing dietary quality&#xD;
      score (measured by Healthy Eating Index [HEI]) at intervention completion compared to&#xD;
      controls. The secondary hypothesis is: treatment group participants will demonstrate&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy in secondary outcomes such as increased quality of life (measured by the&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Health Study frailty criteria), reduced depressive symptoms (Geriatric&#xD;
      Depression Short form), prefrailty reduction (The Fried's Frailty Criteria Index), increased&#xD;
      lower extremity strength and balance (Short Physical Performance Battery), increased physical&#xD;
      activity level (The Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors), reduced waist&#xD;
      circumference and weight at intervention completion compare to controls.&#xD;

    <description>The World Health Organization Quality of Life- BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) is a 26 item questionnaire, which measures the four broad domains of quality of life(QOL): physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale (low score of 1 to a high score of 5) to determine a raw item score. Subsequently, the mean score for each domain is calculated, resulting in a mean score per domain that is between 4 and 20. To compare the results with other studies, the mean scores per domain is then converted into transformed scores based on the WHOQOL-BREF scoring manual. The transformed scores per domain range from 0 to 100, where a higher score indicates better QOL.</description>

    <description>The COPM is self-perception of occupational performance in the areas of self-care, productivity and leisure. The COPM is administered using a semi-structured interview in which the client identifies significant issues in daily activities which are causing difficulty. The importance of each activity, as perceived by the client, is first rated on a 10-point scale ranging from 1 (not important at all) to 10 (extremely important). In the next step the client selects the five most important activities, which are then rated on a 10-point scale for performance, ranging from 1 (not at all able) to 10 (able to perform extremely well), and for satisfaction, ranging from 1 (not at all satisfied) to 10 (extremely satisfied). Increased performance/satisfaction score from follow-up to baseline represents improved performance/satisfaction.</description>

    <description>The modified self-reported habit index (SRHI) is a 4-item assessment that measures habit strength, frequency, relevance to self-identity, and automaticity. Items are self-rated with a seven-point Likert scale (1=strongly disagree, 7= strongly agree). The average score of the 4 items range from 1 to 7 indicates habit formation, where higher scores indicate stronger the habit is. During 9 treatment sessions (the 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 treatment sessions), 2-4 habits regarding physical activity and diet will be assessed individually with the modified SRHI. Post-test of each habit will be assessed again after 2 weeks. We calculated the average score of the index of each habit.</description>

        <title>The The World Health Organization Quality of Life- BREF</title>
        <description>The World Health Organization Quality of Life- BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) is a 26 item questionnaire, which measures the four broad domains of quality of life(QOL): physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale (low score of 1 to a high score of 5) to determine a raw item score. Subsequently, the mean score for each domain is calculated, resulting in a mean score per domain that is between 4 and 20. To compare the results with other studies, the mean scores per domain is then converted into transformed scores based on the WHOQOL-BREF scoring manual. The transformed scores per domain range from 0 to 100, where a higher score indicates better QOL.</description>

The transformed scores per domain range from 0 to 100, where a higher score indicates better QOL.</description>

        <title>The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (Treatment Group Only) (COPM) for Treatment Group Only</title>
        <description>The COPM is self-perception of occupational performance in the areas of self-care, productivity and leisure. The COPM is administered using a semi-structured interview in which the client identifies significant issues in daily activities which are causing difficulty. The importance of each activity, as perceived by the client, is first rated on a 10-point scale ranging from 1 (not important at all) to 10 (extremely important). In the next step the client selects the five most important activities, which are then rated on a 10-point scale for performance, ranging from 1 (not at all able) to 10 (able to perform extremely well), and for satisfaction, ranging from 1 (not at all satisfied) to 10 (extremely satisfied). Increased performance/satisfaction score from follow-up to baseline represents improved performance/satisfaction.</description>

        <title>The Modified Self-reported Habit Index (Treatment Group Only)</title>
        <description>The modified self-reported habit index (SRHI) is a 4-item assessment that measures habit strength, frequency, relevance to self-identity, and automaticity. Items are self-rated with a seven-point Likert scale (1=strongly disagree, 7= strongly agree). The average score of the 4 items range from 1 to 7 indicates habit formation, where higher scores indicate stronger the habit is. During 9 treatment sessions (the 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 treatment sessions), 2-4 habits regarding physical activity and diet will be assessed individually with the modified SRHI. Post-test of each habit will be assessed again after 2 weeks. We calculated the average score of the index of each habit.</description>
