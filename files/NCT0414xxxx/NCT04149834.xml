      The aim: Clinical and Radiographic Evaluation for intra-osseous defects in stage III&#xD;
      periodontitis using NIPSA versus M-MIST Steps in short Pre-surgical therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Before surgical intervention, each patient will be given careful instructions on proper&#xD;
      oral hygiene measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B (Control): Patients will receive Modified Minimally Invasive Surgical technique&#xD;
           (M-MIST) Group A (Test): Patients will receive Non-Incised Papilla Surgical Approach&#xD;
           (NIPSA) Postoperative medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of amoxicillin (500 mg tabs) T.I.D for 7 days and Metronidazole (500 mg&#xD;
           tabs) T.I.D for 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rinsing with Chlorhexidine 0.12% (B.I.D for 14 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ibuprofen 600 mg tabs once every 8h could be administrated in case of unbearable pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow up period: after 8 weeks/ after surgery by 1 week- 1 month- 3 months- 6 months- 1&#xD;
           year&#xD;

      P: Population: Stage III periodontitis presenting intraosseous defects I: Intervention:&#xD;
      Non-Incised Papilla Surgical Approach (NIPSA) C: Control: Modified Minimally Invasive&#xD;
      Surgical Technique (M-MIST) O: Outcome measurements T: 1- year S: Randomized clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operator will anesthetize the surgical sites with 4% ARTINIBSA containing Articaine&#xD;
      hydrochloride Epinephrine (adrenaline) 1: 100.000 injection for both groups. For patients&#xD;
      that recieved (NIPSA) as reported by (Moreno Rodríguez and Caffesse 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After locally anesthetizing the area an apical horizontal incision on the buccal mucosa,&#xD;
           as far as possible from the interdental papillae and marginal KT will be performed. Soft&#xD;
           tissue will be reflected apico-coronally by a full-thickness flap showing the&#xD;
           granulation tissue filling the bony defect after exposing the coronal limit of the&#xD;
           intra-bony component of the defect, while the marginal tissue will be kept unaltered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Horizontal mattress sutures with single interrupted sutures will be placed as the second&#xD;
           line of closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      while patients that received (M-MIST) reported by (Banthia et al. 2016a)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Access to the defect will be gained through the tiny buccal triangular ﬂap: from the&#xD;
           buccal 'window' the soft tissue ﬁlling the defect (i.e. the so-called granulation&#xD;
           tissue) will be sharply dissected from the papillary supra-crestal connective tissue and&#xD;
           from the bony walls with a micro-blade and will be removed with a mini-curette (The soft&#xD;
           tissue will be sharply dissected from the osseous defect)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No interdental and/or lingual intra-sulcular incisions will be performed. The&#xD;
           supra-crestal interdental tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical flaps will be sutured to the pre-surgical level with 5-0 vicryl suture&#xD;
           utilizing single interrupted suturing techniques that will achieve primary closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sutures will be removed 2 weeks post-surgically. Patients will be asked to discontinue&#xD;
           mechanical tooth-brushing technique in the surgical area for 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After this period, patients will be instructed to continue mechanical tooth brushing&#xD;
           again of the treated sites using a soft toothbrush.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recalled monthly for supportive periodontal therapy during the course of the&#xD;
      study. And then will be recalled every six months for supportive periodontal therapy after&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
