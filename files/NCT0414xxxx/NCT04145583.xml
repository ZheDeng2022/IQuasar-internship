  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, randomized, two-stage, two-way crossover study&#xD;
      evaluating the effect of voriconazole on the PK, PD, and safety of HSK3486 in healthy&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After the recruited healthy subjects passed the screening of inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, a seed number was set in the PLAN program of the SAS 9.4 software by the&#xD;
      statistician before the formal enrollment, and the subject screening numbers were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the two groups by using a 1:1 block randomization method. The enrolled subjects&#xD;
      were assigned a subject number according to the results of randomization and received stage I&#xD;
      dosing of HSK3486 injectable emulsion (sequence 1) or HSK3486 injectable emulsion +&#xD;
      voriconazole (sequence 2). After a 7-day (sequence 1) or 14-day washout period (sequence 2),&#xD;
      the stage II dosing of HSK3486 injectable emulsion + voriconazole (sequence 2) or HSK3486&#xD;
      injectable emulsion (sequence 1) was carried out in a crossover fashion.&#xD;
