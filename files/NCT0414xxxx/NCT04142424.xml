    <textblock>
      This Phase 1, first-in-human (FiH), single-ascending-dose (SAD) study, will assess the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability and characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD2693, following&#xD;
      subcutaneous (SC) SAD administration of AZD2693 in male and female subjects of&#xD;
      non-childbearing potential in overweight but otherwise healthy subjects, and healthy Chinese&#xD;
      and Japanese subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center study, and approximately 64 overweight/mildly obese but otherwise&#xD;
      healthy male and female subjects, and up to 16 healthy Japanese subjects and 8 healthy&#xD;
      Chinese (all of non-childbearing potential) will be enrolled into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study will consist of following planned cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible healthy subjects will be divided in 6 cohorts, each consisting of 8 subjects, within&#xD;
      each cohort, 6 subjects will receive AZD2693 at dose level 1 and 2 subjects will receive&#xD;
      placebo. Dosing for each ascending dose cohort will proceed with 2 subjects in a sentinel&#xD;
      cohort, such that 1 subject will be randomized to receive placebo and 1 subject will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive AZD2693.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible healthy Japanese and Chinese subjects will be divided as two cohorts of Japanese&#xD;
      subjects, and one cohort of Chinese subjects. Each cohort will consist of 8 subjects. Within&#xD;
      each cohort, 6 subjects will receive AZD2693 and 2 subjects will receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on emerging data, up to 2 additional cohorts may be added to test additional dose&#xD;
      levels based on Sponsor's decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full study will comprise of following periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening period of maximum 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A Dosing Session during which subjects will be resident at the Clinical Unit from the&#xD;
           day before investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration (Day -1) until at&#xD;
           least 3 days after IMP administration with discharge on Day 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A Follow-Up Period of 16 weeks that will consist of 9 Follow-Up Visits, for which the&#xD;
           subjects will return to the Clinical Unit at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 weeks&#xD;
           post dose.&#xD;
