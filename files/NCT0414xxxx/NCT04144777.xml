  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Solarplast is a unique mixture of antioxidant enzymes and single antioxidant molecules that&#xD;
      are capable of attack oxidants that cause damage to the cells in the human body and cause&#xD;
      premature aging. This mechanism may provide protection from stress, such as free radicals,&#xD;
      heat, infection, as well as reduce inflammation and participate in the repair mechanism of&#xD;
      the intestinal tract. Participants will consume Solarplast, or placebo, for 45 days with&#xD;
      blood draws at day-0 and -45 in order to assess antioxidant capacity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Solarplast is currently sold on the market, which is a unique mixture of antioxidant enzymes&#xD;
      and single antioxidant molecules that attack oxidants through chaperone activity. Chaperones,&#xD;
      are naturally occurring proteins that assist the non-covalent folding/unfolding and the&#xD;
      assembly/disassembly of other macromolecular structures and can provide stability and restore&#xD;
      function of many unfolded proteins. Chaperones may provide protection from stress, such as&#xD;
      free radicals, heat, infection, as well as reduce inflammation and participate in the repair&#xD;
      mechanism of the intestinal tract. Solarplast is derived from Spinach (Spinacia oleracea), a&#xD;
      leafy green vegetable of high nutritional value grown and consumed worldwide. Spinach is rich&#xD;
      in iron, vitamin A, riboflavin, and lutein, a carotenoid that acts as a natural antioxidant&#xD;
      protecting the body from toxins and free radicals. The potential mechanistic role of&#xD;
      Solarplast consists of serving an antioxidant role against peroxyl radicals, hydroxyl&#xD;
      radicals, peroxynitrite, super oxide anion, singlet oxygen, among others. Additionally,&#xD;
      Solarplast contains photosynthetic complexes with high concentrations of ATP, NADPH, ADP,&#xD;
      AMP, NADP, niacin, B12, adenine, and ribose. Therefore, this naturally occurring antioxidant&#xD;
      supplement may provide the components required to scavenge free radicals and mitigate&#xD;
      oxidative stress with no harmful side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the antioxidant and health effects of Solarplast in&#xD;
      40 healthy human subjects, 20 smokers, and 20 pre-diabetics; both male and female (n=80). An&#xD;
      equal number of males and females will be recruited for the project. Only participants&#xD;
      between the ages of 18 and 55 will be recruited for this research. Smokers and pre-diabetics&#xD;
      are known to have increased oxidative stress; therefore, these two populations are being&#xD;
      included in this research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single capsule of Solarplast containing 100 mg (1 x 10^6 light converting units (LCU)) is&#xD;
      to be consumed once a day per participant for a total of 45 days, following pre-screening and&#xD;
      enrollment (detailed below). Twenty healthy (of the 40 healthy) human subjects will be used&#xD;
      as control subjects and consume a placebo (maltodextrin - 100 mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A medical doctor will approve the enrollment (Dr. Karleena Tuggle) of all participants and&#xD;
      oversee this clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to visit the laboratory (KSU Human Performance Laboratory) on 2&#xD;
      separate occasions for blood draws by a CITI approved/IRB approved research team member&#xD;
      trained in phlebotomy under the supervision of Dr. VanDusseldorp.&#xD;
