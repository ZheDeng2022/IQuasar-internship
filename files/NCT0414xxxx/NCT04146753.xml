  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paediatric intensive care units support the complex medical needs of children with life&#xD;
      threatening conditions. There are 20000 admissions annually within the United Kingdom and 65%&#xD;
      require life support through a breathing machine. Chest physiotherapy is considered part of&#xD;
      routine care for these patients. There is a small amount of evidence providing support for&#xD;
      the effectiveness of chest physiotherapy however it has been associated with instability and&#xD;
      adverse events. At present the risks and benefits of chest physiotherapy in ventilated&#xD;
      children are unknown. It is important to identify which patients are likely to benefit most&#xD;
      and in which situations chest physiotherapy may present a significant risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To identify and understand the risk factors for instability and harmful events which may&#xD;
      occur due to chest physiotherapy in children on intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design/Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work Package 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 - An anonymous, electronic survey will be sent to all UK physiotherapists who work in&#xD;
      paediatric critical care. Information will be collected about physiotherapy practice,&#xD;
      referrals, and risk factors assessed and monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 - Interviews with 18-27 physiotherapists will take place. The findings from phase 1&#xD;
      will guide the questions. Phase 2 will provide a more in-depth understanding about&#xD;
      physiotherapy decision making and management of risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work Package 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      This part of the study will quantitatively assess the effects of chest physiotherapy and&#xD;
      identify risk factors for instability. Routinely collected data from the three intensive care&#xD;
      units at Great Ormond Street Hospital will be used. No contact with patients/families will be&#xD;
      required, and no change to care will occur. Data from approximately 1000 patients will be&#xD;
      collected over one year. Health related measures (e.g. oxygen levels) will be recorded before&#xD;
      and after chest physiotherapy.&#xD;

      Research Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is current chest physiotherapy practice within UK paediatric intensive care units?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How do physiotherapists make decisions regarding provision of chest physiotherapy in UK&#xD;
           paediatric intensive care units and what other factors influence this decision making?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What do physiotherapists perceive to be risk factors for physiological instability and&#xD;
           adverse events and how do they manage these?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What is the prevalence of physiological instability and adverse events associated with&#xD;
           chest physiotherapy in ventilated children?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. What are the risk factors/characteristics of children who display instability and/or&#xD;
           adverse events associated with chest physiotherapy?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. What is the long term impact on the child of instability and adverse events associated&#xD;
           with chest physiotherapy?&#xD;
&#xD;
      WORK PACKAGE 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 A descriptive, cross sectional study investigating current chest physiotherapy&#xD;
      practice in paediatric intensive care units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample The subject group is physiotherapists working within the 28 NHS PICUs in the UK. Using&#xD;
      information from a local benchmarking study which investigated physiotherapy staffing levels&#xD;
      on seven UK PICUs, a total of 33 physiotherapy staff was reported, providing an average of&#xD;
      four per site. Extrapolating this for the 28 national centres gives an approximate population&#xD;
      size of 112 physiotherapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method An electronic survey, created in Smart-survey will be used. The first page of the&#xD;
      questionnaire will include a covering statement and a link to the more comprehensive&#xD;
      participant information sheet. The survey includes dichotomous and multiple choice closed&#xD;
      questions, and open questions where more detail is required. It will be self-administered and&#xD;
      anonymous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key topics covered include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest physiotherapy techniques used&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest physiotherapy referral criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decision to treat/not treat processes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Risk factors monitored&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic information The survey will be open for eight weeks and a reminder email&#xD;
           will be sent after four weeks. Consent will be implied if the survey is completed and&#xD;
           returned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis The anonymous data will be imported into Excel and descriptive statistics will&#xD;
      be used including frequency distributions, statistics of central tendency, and dispersion.&#xD;
      Qualitative data from the open questions will be thematically analysed, as described by Braun&#xD;
      and Clarke (2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 A qualitative study to explore and understand the decision making processes that&#xD;
      guide delivery of chest physiotherapy, including the perceived risk factors for physiological&#xD;
      instability and adverse events, and risk management strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Nine paediatric critical care units have been pre-selected, these are representative&#xD;
      of all 28 UK NHS PICUs. Up to three physiotherapists will be purposively sampled from each&#xD;
      centre to ensure a heterogeneous sample in terms of agenda for change banding and years of&#xD;
      experience. This strategy will generate a sample size of 18-27 and ensure saturation of&#xD;
      themes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method Semi-structured interviews will be conducted. Eligible participants will be provided&#xD;
      with appropriate study information and all participants asked to give written consent prior&#xD;
      to taking part. The interviews will take place at a time and location convenient to the&#xD;
      participant, outside of their contracted working hours. The interviews will last between&#xD;
      30-60 minutes. Where possible the interviews will be face to face, however Skype/telephone&#xD;
      interviews will also be offered. A topic guide for the interviews will be developed using the&#xD;
      data from phase 1, existing literature, and advice from the steering group. The topic guide&#xD;
      will be piloted in the first three interviews. The pilot data will be included in the data&#xD;
      set unless significant revisions to the topic guide are required. The interviews will be&#xD;
      audio recorded, with permission, and transcribed verbatim. Field notes will be taken to&#xD;
      provide context and information on non-verbal cues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Thematic analysis will be used to analyse the interview transcripts, to&#xD;
      identify, organise and report themes within the data. The themes will be presented logically&#xD;
      and meaningfully, evidenced and illustrated with quotes as appropriate. A visual display of&#xD;
      the findings will also be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WORK PACKAGE 2 An observational (case-note review) study to assess the variability and&#xD;
      prevalence of physiological instability and adverse events associated with chest&#xD;
      physiotherapy, and identify risk factors that predict instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample The sampling frame will consist of patients on the three paediatric critical care&#xD;
      units at a tertiary children's hospital (neonatal, general paediatric, cardiac).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Recruitment Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be identified from&#xD;
      physiotherapy records on a weekly basis by the chief investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection This study will involve the collection of four categories of variables:&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcomes, risk factors/demographics, and general PICU outcomes. These&#xD;
      are routinely monitored and recorded for all patients on the PICUs. They are retrieved from&#xD;
      high resolution monitor data (T3) and electronic patient records (EPR). A workspace within&#xD;
      the digital platform Aridhia will be designed collaboratively with the GOSH Digital Research,&#xD;
      Informatics and Virtual Environments (DRIVE) team. This will provide a comprehensive and&#xD;
      secure database to collate, store and analyse the data. The DRIVE team will downloaded the&#xD;
      de-identified data into the workspace.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Planned Recruitment Rate The use of digital methods allows a larger sample&#xD;
      than in previous experimental and retrospective studies. Retrospective data will be collected&#xD;
      over a 12 month period. An audit of chest physiotherapy across the three PICUs was completed&#xD;
      over one week. Twenty two patients, accounting for 77 CPT events, were identified who would&#xD;
      meet the study inclusion criteria. Scaling this up, data collection over a 12 month period&#xD;
      would provide an approximate sample of 1144 patients and 4000 CPT treatments. Completing the&#xD;
      data collection over a full year will avoid the impact of seasonal bias on the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis The analysis will be completed using the R Project for Statistical Computing.&#xD;
      Multilevel analysis will be used to investigate change in the physiological variables and&#xD;
      allow risk modelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Synthesis The findings of both work packages will be synthesised to determine&#xD;
      similarities and disparities between the perceived risks of physiological instability and&#xD;
      adverse events associated with CPT and those demonstrated by the objective data. Side by side&#xD;
      comparison for merged data analysis will be used in a summary table and through visual data&#xD;
      representation. This will clarify the new knowledge created and areas for service&#xD;
      improvement.&#xD;
