    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors of the male genitourinary system.&#xD;
      In 2017, the American Oncology Society will report that 161,360 new prostate cancers were&#xD;
      estimated, accounting for 21% of male tumors, ranking first in male new tumors; 26,730 death,&#xD;
      cancer death. The rate is second only to bronchial lung cancer and colorectal cancer. In&#xD;
      China, although the incidence of prostate cancer is lower than the world epidemiological&#xD;
      level, the incidence of prostate cancer in China has shown an increasing trend in recent&#xD;
      years. The latest statistics from the National Cancer Center 2017, the incidence of male&#xD;
      prostate cancer is 2.4%, which is a male malignant tumor. Seventh place in the disease. The&#xD;
      taxane drug docetaxel showed good anti-tumor activity in castration resistant prostate cancer&#xD;
      (CRPC) patients, and paclitaxel combined with carboplatin also had a certain effect on CRPC.&#xD;
      However, in clinical practice, patients with prostate cancer are mostly old, often&#xD;
      accompanied by other underlying diseases, poor physical status, and poor tolerance in the use&#xD;
      of docetaxel and paclitaxel. Albumin-bound paclitaxel has more tumor-targeted enrichment than&#xD;
      traditional paclitaxel and is less toxic. Therefore, this study intends to explore the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of albumin-bound paclitaxel combined with carboplatin in the treatment of&#xD;
      CRPC, providing a reference for the treatment options of CRPC in clinical practice.&#xD;
