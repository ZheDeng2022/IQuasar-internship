      Effects of serotonin 2A/1A receptor stimulation by psilocybin on alcohol addicted patients: a&#xD;
      randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two billion people globally consume alcohol, leading in 2016 to 2.8 million deaths (5.2% of&#xD;
      all deaths) and 99.2 million Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost (4.2% of all DALYs).&#xD;
      Of all the diseases, conditions, and injuries attributable to alcohol use, alcohol use&#xD;
      disorders (AUDs) create the largest health burden globally. However, approved pharmacological&#xD;
      treatments for alcoholism are limited in their effectiveness. A recent proof of- concept&#xD;
      study testing psilocybin in ten alcohol dependent patients provides encouraging efficacy&#xD;
      results and safety data. The investigators, therefore, propose to test the efficacy of&#xD;
      psilocybin for treating alcohol use disorder and study its underlying neurobiological&#xD;
      mechanisms in a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind study. To evaluate effects of&#xD;
      psilocybin on alcohol use behaviour, clinical symptoms, neurocognitive and emotional measures&#xD;
      in patients with alcohol use disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present clinical trial aims at investigation the clinical and mechanistic effects of&#xD;
      Psilocybin in Alcohol Addicted Patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with alcohol use disorder who have undergone withdrawal treatment within the last 6&#xD;
      weeks will be investigated in a single-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel-group design clinical trial contrasting the acute and persisting effects of&#xD;
      psilocybin to those of placebo. Patients will be randomly assigned to psilocybin or placebo&#xD;
      group with a 1:1 allocation ratio. The study comprises a total of 6 visits during 6 weeks and&#xD;
      two follow-up online surveys (3 and 6 months after treatment). In addition, two follow-up&#xD;
      surveys that can be completed from home will guarantee monitoring of long-lasting changes in&#xD;
      symptomology and ensure all potential side-effects can be captured. On the treatment visit, a&#xD;
      single dose of psilocybin (25mg) or placebo will be administered. Patients will be monitored&#xD;
      until all effects have worn off.&#xD;
