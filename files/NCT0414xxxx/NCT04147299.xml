      The primary objective of this research protocol is to advance the understanding of&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary and right ventricular (RV) performance among individuals with cardiomyopathy&#xD;
      (heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF], heart failure with preserved ejection&#xD;
      fraction [HFpEF]), as well as athletes engaging in endurance/prolonged exercise, who are at a&#xD;
      high risk of an acquired cardiomyopathy during/following completion of an endurance event.&#xD;

      For completion of specific aims 1-2, the protocol will be identical. Specific aim 1 involves&#xD;
      analysis of patients with HFrEF as defined above; specific aim 2 involves analysis of&#xD;
      patients with HFpEF as defined above. The protocol for specific aim 3 (analysis of endurance&#xD;
      athletes) incorporates a different protocol than that described for specific aims 1-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For HFrEF and HFpEF patients (specific aims 1-2): There will be a single visit for testing.&#xD;
      This visit will involve a baseline assessment of hemodynamics using a Swan-Ganz catheter,&#xD;
      followed by invasive exercise testing with a high-fidelity conductance catheter, which&#xD;
      provides the real-time RV PV loops. The Swan-Ganz catheter is a 7-French flexible catheter&#xD;
      that is routinely used for hemodynamic assessment for clinical and research purposes (we are&#xD;
      currently using this catheter for COMIRB #16-1635, and COMIRB #17-1042). The purpose of this&#xD;
      catheter is to determine baseline hemodynamic parameters (in &quot;layman's terms&quot;, to describe&#xD;
      left and right-sided filling pressures, as well as pressures in the lungs), and to determine&#xD;
      resting cardiac output. The Swan-Ganz catheter will be inserted and removed after obtaining&#xD;
      these measurements - it is anticipated that this procedure will take 10-15 minutes. The&#xD;
      primary investigator for this study, Dr. Cornwell, routinely performs these procedures in&#xD;
      both clinical and research settings, and will use standard techniques for catheter insertion.&#xD;
      Ultrasound guidance will be used to identify the right internal jugular vein, where the&#xD;
      catheter is inserted, and fluoroscopy will be used to guide placement of the catheter for&#xD;
      hemodynamic monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the baseline hemodynamic assessment, the Swan-Ganz catheter will be&#xD;
      removed. Thereafter, the high-fidelity conductance catheter will be inserted into the RV&#xD;
      using standard techniques. This catheter is also a 7-French flexible catheter (currently&#xD;
      being used for COMIRB #17-1042) that has a pressure manometer on the tip, along with several&#xD;
      conductance electrodes that continuously measure volume in the ventricle - by continuously&#xD;
      recording changes in pressure and volume throughout the cardiac cycle, the catheter generates&#xD;
      the &quot;PV loop&quot;. These catheters provide information that is not available with standard&#xD;
      Swan-Ganz catheters (refer to outcome measures listed above). Following insertion of the&#xD;
      conductance catheter, an arterial line will be placed in either the left or right radial&#xD;
      artery, using sterile technique and with ultrasound-guidance. The purpose of this catheter is&#xD;
      two-fold: 1) to provide a gold-standard assessment of BP during exercise; and 2) to measure&#xD;
      arterial oxygen saturation to calculate a cardiac output from the Fick equation. Baseline&#xD;
      hemodynamic assessment will involve monitoring for approximately 5 minutes during spontaneous&#xD;
      breathing, followed by approximately 6 minutes of breathing at a controlled respiratory rate&#xD;
      (12 times per minute), which allows for determination of short-term blood pressure&#xD;
      variability after controlling for the effect of respiratory variation, followed by Valsalva&#xD;
      maneuver and vasomotor reactivity (inspiratory breath-hold for 30 seconds).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following insertion of the conductance catheter, arterial catheter and acquisition of&#xD;
      baseline data, the patient will be positioned on an upright cycle ergometer. In the event&#xD;
      that the patient is not able to perform upright exercise, a supine ergometer will be used.&#xD;
      The patient will then complete exercise at two submaximal workloads (below their ventilatory&#xD;
      threshold) that simulate real-world scenarios/normal activities of daily living, followed by&#xD;
      peak exercise. To obtain submaximal data, workload on the bicycle will begin at 0 Watts.&#xD;
      Every 1-2 minutes, workload will be steadily increased, generally in 12.5-25 Watt-increments,&#xD;
      until the patient indicates that the rate-of-perceived exertion (RPE) score is 7-9, on a 6-20&#xD;
      point scale.24 This workload will correspond to &quot;mild&quot; exercise, or steady-state 1. Workload&#xD;
      will be held at this level for approximately 4-5 minutes, during which time hemodynamic data&#xD;
      will be obtained. Thereafter, workload will again be increased in 12.5-25 Watt increments&#xD;
      until the participate indicates that the RPE score is 11-13.24 This workload will correspond&#xD;
      to a &quot;moderate&quot; exercise, or steady-state 2. Workload will be held at this level for&#xD;
      approximately 4-5 minutes, during which time hemodynamic data will be obtained. The patient&#xD;
      will then be allotted a 5-10 minute break. After the break, the patient will complete a&#xD;
      symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test, whereby workload will begin at 0 Watts, and&#xD;
      generally increase every 1-2 minutes in 12.5-25 Watt increments until exhaustion. Hemodynamic&#xD;
      data will be continuously recorded, and final data will be obtained at the peak workload&#xD;
      achieved. This protocol will allow for acquisition of data at five different positions: 1)&#xD;
      supine rest; 2) upright rest; 3) steady-state 1, or &quot;mild&quot; exercise; 4) steady-state 2, or&#xD;
      &quot;moderate&quot; exercise; and 5) peak exercise. Blood samples will be collected at each of these&#xD;
      stages: blood will be tested for arterial and venous oxygen saturation levels (to calculate a&#xD;
      Fick cardiac output), as well as a venous/capillary lactic acid level by finger stick. Lactic&#xD;
      acid levels will be used to assess the participant's work effort at each stage of exercise&#xD;
      (as a &quot;rule-of-thumb&quot;, submaximal levels of exercise have an associated lactic acid level of&#xD;
      below 4mmol/L. A complete blood count will be obtained in the supine resting position to&#xD;
      determine hemoglobin concentration, which will be used to calculate Fick cardiac output&#xD;
      during all stages of exercise. Following completion of the study, the patient will be&#xD;
      returned to a supine position and de-instrumented. This protocol is very similar to protocols&#xD;
      used as part of COMIRB #16-1635 and #17-1042; based on our experience with these protocols,&#xD;
      it is anticipated that this study will last approximately 4-5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Endurance Athletes (specific aim 3): There will be two visits for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1: Baseline Assessment: this visit will include informed consent, study&#xD;
           enrollment, history and physical, followed by a non-invasive cardiopulmonary exercise&#xD;
           test (CPET) with stress echocardiography. The CPET will be conducted in the following&#xD;
           manner: a resting echocardiogram will be performed to assess cardiac structure and&#xD;
           function and rule-out any structural disease. The athlete will then complete a&#xD;
           symptom-limited CPET, whereby workload on the ergometer will start at 0 Watts, and&#xD;
           increase by approximately 50-Watt increments every 1-2 minutes until exhaustion.&#xD;
           Immediately following completion of the test, echocardiography will be repeated to&#xD;
           assess wall motion and cardiac structure at peak exercise. During this test, heart rate&#xD;
           (HR) and rhythm, as well as blood pressure (BP) will be continuously monitored&#xD;
           non-invasively. In the event that any abnormalities are detected during this period of&#xD;
           time, the patient will be excluded from further testing. Results of the test will be&#xD;
           communicated with the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2: &quot;Race-Day&quot;. On this day of testing, participants will complete a non-contrast&#xD;
           cardiac MRI prior to and immediately following testing. Testing will include a&#xD;
           timed-trial for completion of a 180km cycling event (the distance of the bicycling&#xD;
           portion of an Ironman event)22.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Baseline cardiac MRI: to evaluate baseline cardiac structure and function. This&#xD;
                will be completed in the Brain Imaging Center at the Anschutz Medical Campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Testing: after completion of cardiac MRI, participants will be escorted to&#xD;
                laboratory for testing. Athletes will undergo insertion of a Swan-Ganz catheter&#xD;
                using standard techniques (as described above). Baseline hemodynamic assessment&#xD;
                will be obtained to determine left and right-sided filling pressures, as well as&#xD;
                cardiac output. Spontaneous and controlled breathing, as well as Valsalva maneuver&#xD;
                and vasomotor reactivity, will also be obtained. Following this assessment, the&#xD;
                Swan-Ganz catheter will be removed and a conductance catheter will be inserted in&#xD;
                order to obtain RV PV loops. Supine resting loops will be acquired. Thereafter, the&#xD;
                athlete will be positioned on an upright bicycle. The participant will then&#xD;
                complete a timed-trial (ie, we will record the time required to completion of the&#xD;
                event). The distance will be the same for all participants and will be 180km (the&#xD;
                distance of the cycling portion of an Ironman competition)22. Participants will be&#xD;
                instructed to complete the event at a pace that they are comfortable with and is&#xD;
                compatible with their typical racing pace. Breaks during cycling will be allotted&#xD;
                at the athlete's request. Food and drink/snacks will be allotted at the athlete's&#xD;
                request (the goal is to simulate a real-world race-day scenario). During the event,&#xD;
                HR and rhythm, as well as BP, will be continuously recorded. RV PV loops, as well&#xD;
                as gas-exchange metrics via indirect calorimetry, will be analyzed continuously and&#xD;
                recorded every 30 minutes during the event. Following completion of the event, the&#xD;
                athlete will be placed back in supine position, and post-event hemodynamic&#xD;
                assessment will be completed. This will include acquisition of resting RV PV loops&#xD;
                from the conductance catheter, followed by re-insertion of the Swan-Ganz catheter&#xD;
                for spontaneous and controlled breathing, as well as a Valsalva maneuver and&#xD;
                vasomotor reactivity. The participant will then be de-instrumented and the&#xD;
                test-phase completed. Based on our experience with performing similar assessments,&#xD;
                coupled with typical cycling times to complete 180km cycling events, it is&#xD;
                anticipated that this test will take ~6 hours to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Post-Test cardiac MRI: to evaluate cardiac structure and function following&#xD;
                completion of test.&#xD;
