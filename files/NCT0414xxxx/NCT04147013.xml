    <textblock>
      This is a proposed randomized prospective study to evaluate both the anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
      analgesic effects of a COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, in patients with aspirin-exacerbated&#xD;
      respiratory disease and Chronic rhinosinusitis following endoscopic sinus surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that supplementation with celecoxib can potentially improve&#xD;
      surgical outcomes and reduce the postoperative usage of opioid analgesics without an&#xD;
      increased risk of bleeding or asthma exacerbation&#xD;

      1. Background: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) affects up to 5% of Canadians and is associated&#xD;
           with significant morbidity. It is characterized by inflammation of the mucosa of the&#xD;
           nose and paranasal sinuses of at least 12 consecutive weeks' duration. Patients&#xD;
           suffering from CRS are bothered on a daily basis by nasal obstruction, nasal discharge,&#xD;
           facial pain, and an impaired sense of smell among other symptoms. Although not typically&#xD;
           a life-threatening condition, CRS can drastically reduce a patient's quality of life as&#xD;
           well as their workplace productivity. In fact, this has been demonstrated in the&#xD;
           literature, with one study estimating the annual productivity cost of refractory CRS at&#xD;
           about $10,000 per patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fortunately, effective management strategies are available. Mild to moderate disease can&#xD;
           often be managed safely with long term use of topical glucocorticoids and nasal saline&#xD;
           lavage. For more severe CRS unresponsive to appropriate medical therapy, oral&#xD;
           glucocorticoids can be effective in the short term, but surgical treatment can help&#xD;
           achieve long-term control of symptoms when initial medical therapy has failed. This is&#xD;
           typically done via endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS), and its goal is to re-establish&#xD;
           physiological patterns of ventilation and mucociliary clearance in patients with CRS, as&#xD;
           well as establish access for topical therapy delivery. ESS is considered the gold&#xD;
           standard of management for CRS and has proven to be highly effective in reducing the&#xD;
           burden of inflammatory tissue and minimizing patient morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Although developed as a minimally invasive technique to avoid the morbidity of open&#xD;
           sinus surgery, ESS still entails some degree of surgical trauma, postoperative pain, and&#xD;
           inflammation. Intraoperative local anesthetic infiltration is routinely performed but is&#xD;
           insufficient to control pain in the immediate postoperative period. Patients often&#xD;
           require some form of systemic analgesia and this usually consists of some combination of&#xD;
           acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, and&#xD;
           opioids. However, there is currently no consensus in the literature regarding the&#xD;
           optimal analgesic regimen after ESS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Interestingly, in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) a triad&#xD;
           of asthma, CRS, and aspirin (ASA/NSAID sensitivity), NSAIDs are classically associated&#xD;
           with worsening of CRS symptoms. However, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, a&#xD;
           selective type of NSAID, have recently been studied as post-ESS analgesics and suggested&#xD;
           as possible alternatives to opioids, which have many known potential adverse effects.&#xD;
           These agents have also been studied for their anti-inflammatory properties in patients&#xD;
           undergoing ESS and have been shown to decrease the levels of circulating prostaglandins&#xD;
           in this population. Thus, AERD patients are a particularly important population in which&#xD;
           to assess the effect of COX-2 inhibitors on post-operative pain and inflammation. This&#xD;
           randomized, prospective study will evaluate both the anti-inflammatory and analgesic&#xD;
           effects of a COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, in patients with AERD and CRS following&#xD;
           endoscopic sinus surgery. The investigators hypothesize that supplementation with&#xD;
           celecoxib can potentially improve surgical outcomes and reduce the postoperative usage&#xD;
           of opioid analgesics without an increased risk of bleeding or asthma exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The objectives of this study are: 1) to determine whether the addition of celecoxib to&#xD;
           the FESS post-operative analgesia regimen can alter subjective and objective recovery&#xD;
           from CRS signs and symptoms, and 2) to determine whether the addition of the COX-2&#xD;
           inhibitor, celecoxib, to the endoscopic sinus surgery post-operative analgesia regimen&#xD;
           can reduce the amount of opioid narcotic used by patients for breakthrough pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Trial Design: The study is a prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled study&#xD;
           and will be conducted at St. Joseph's Hospital in London, ON (CAN). There will be two&#xD;
           study arms with 1:1 allocation, one arm will receive the study treatment and the other&#xD;
           will receive a placebo;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Sample Size Calculation: The initial pre-study sample size was calculated with 80% power&#xD;
           at a significance level of 0.05. For the primary objective, previous studies have&#xD;
           established that a 40% difference on the Lund-Kennedy Endoscopic Score would be&#xD;
           clinically relevant. The statistical power was assumed to be 80%, and the needed&#xD;
           significance level (2-tailed alpha error) was assumed to be 5%. Based on the literature,&#xD;
           a mean difference of 3.4 and an SD of 2.6 for the Lund-Kennedy endoscopic reporting&#xD;
           system was used for calculation, giving a sample size of 22. For the secondary&#xD;
           objective, the sample size was calculated as follows. Assuming a difference of 2 of mean&#xD;
           pain score (with a standard deviation of 2) on the Numeric Rating scale as significant,&#xD;
           a sample size of 16 in each group is required. It has been reported elsewhere a total of&#xD;
           4.5 (+/-4.4) milligram morphine equivalent for patients undergoing a sinus surgery. To&#xD;
           reduce this requirement to zero a sample size of 12 in each group would be required. As&#xD;
           such, the aim is to enrol 44 patients to account for potential loss of follow-up and&#xD;
           ensure the study is appropriately powered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Interventions: Patients in the treatment arm of the study will receive celecoxib 200 mg&#xD;
           PO BID for 7 days and patients in the control arm will receive placebo PO BID for 7&#xD;
           days. Both medications are to be started on the evening of the day of surgery. Both&#xD;
           groups will also be given a prescription for tramadol, an opioid medication, to be used&#xD;
           as needed for breakthrough pain. Specifically, tramadol 50 mg PO Q6H PRN x 10 tablets&#xD;
           will be prescribed. Patients will also be permitted to take acetaminophen for&#xD;
           breakthrough pain as needed and will be encouraged to use acetaminophen prior to&#xD;
           narcotic usage. Finally, all patients will be prescribed a nasal saline rinse which is&#xD;
           to be started on postoperative day one.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Randomization: Randomization will be via sequential random number generation from 1 to&#xD;
           40. Medications will be prepared by the hospital pharmacy and will be randomized in&#xD;
           their preparation by the pharmacy. A master list will be kept in a sealed envelope by&#xD;
           the PI in order to break blinding if an emergency occurs. Both study team members and&#xD;
           patients will remain blinded to the group until after the study is completed.&#xD;
