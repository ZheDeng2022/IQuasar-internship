    <intervention_model_description>The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of standard-of-care adjuvant mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy alone or in combination with novel oncology therapies. The study will be conducted in subjects who have undergone radical surgical resection for Stage II or III MSS-CRC, are eligible for mFOLFOX6 adjuvant therapy, and are confirmed as ctDNA positive post-surgery.</intervention_model_description>
