  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic foot is defined by World Health Organization as a syndrome in which the presence of&#xD;
      neuropathy, ischemia and infection cause tissue damage or ulcers from minor trauma. This&#xD;
      condition can be controlled in its early stages with conservative treatment, which is&#xD;
      effective in preventing infections and amputations. However, even with the new knowledge&#xD;
      acquired and the development of new therapies, the specialist often faces wounds that do not&#xD;
      improve despite the proper treatment, so therapies have been sought to help the healing of&#xD;
      these Ulcers. Growing evidence suggests that healing of chronic diabetic foot ulcers depends&#xD;
      on growth factors and that the therapeutic use of these in wounds has the potential to&#xD;
      accelerate their healing in conjunction with wound care Conventional. This study evaluates&#xD;
      the effect of plasma rich in autologous growth factors on healing chronic ulcers of diabetic&#xD;
      origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized clinical trial that evaluates two study groups. Control group in which&#xD;
      advanced weekly healing will be performed while the post-advanced healing study group will be&#xD;
      performed the intradermal application of plasma rich in growth factors. These manoeuvres will&#xD;
      be performed once a week for four weeks and at the end of the study the results in both&#xD;
      groups will be checked. Both groups will also evaluate, frequency and intensity of pain,&#xD;
      quality of life, histological changes in ulcers and metabolic evaluation&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The diabetic foot is a devastating complication of diabetes mellitus that is accompanied by&#xD;
      chest-evolving ulcers, which often lead to amputation. Annually more than a million people&#xD;
      lose some limb stake because of this cause. Foot ulceration is the most common complication&#xD;
      of diabetic patients and is thought to affect up to 15% of them throughout their lives (8,&#xD;
      9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ulcers that do not progress over a period of approximately 4 weeks should be reassessed.&#xD;
      Several studies have also shown that chronic ulcers in general and diabetic foot ulcers in&#xD;
      particular have alterations in fibroblast proliferation, the balance between growth factors,&#xD;
      metalloproteinase (MMP) and remodeling extracellular matrix (2, 8, 9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in matrix metalloproteinase levels, as well as Regulated on Activation , Normal&#xD;
      T-cell Expressed and Secretated, interleukin and procalcitonin have been correlated with&#xD;
      wound healing (10). Metalloproteinase and its regulators, matrix metalloproteinase tissue&#xD;
      inhibitors (TIMPes) are necessary for a wound to be properly healed at an appropriate level,&#xD;
      at the right location and for a precise period of time. These aspects, it is presumed, are&#xD;
      not met in chronic wounds such as ulcers of diabetic origin (11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autologous growth factor-rich plasma (PRFC), applied at the wound site releases dozens of&#xD;
      growth factors, chemokines and cytokines that regulate angiogenesis, epithelialization and&#xD;
      regeneration (15, 16). They are secreted by the granules and has been found to contribute to&#xD;
      increase the speed of the natural healing process with a decrease in time (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet-rich plasma is defined as an autologous or allogeneic platelet derivative with a&#xD;
      concentration of platelets higher than the baseline. Autologous growth factor-rich plasma&#xD;
      (PRFC) is the fraction of plasma derived from autologous blood, which after being processed&#xD;
      by centrifugation, has a higher concentration of platelets and higher than baseline growth&#xD;
      factors (8). There are two obtaining techniques: closed and open. In the case of obtaining by&#xD;
      &quot;closed technique&quot;, the method used must follow the instructions described in the disposable&#xD;
      kits used in each commercial system. The &quot;open technique&quot; allows, on the other hand, from&#xD;
      lower blood volumes and simple equipment, to obtain a higher concentration of growth factors&#xD;
      (25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given its autologous nature, PRFC is a safe product, which by definition lacks the potential&#xD;
      risk of disease transmission involving the use of donor blood material. With regard to the&#xD;
      oncogenic potential of PRFC that some authors have suggested, there is no available evidence&#xD;
      to support it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key factors released include platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), beta transforming growth&#xD;
      factor (TGF-b), platelet factor 4 (PF4), interleukin 1 (IL-1), the angiogenic factor derived&#xD;
      from platelets (PDAF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      (EGF), platelet-derived endothelial growth factor (PDEGF), epithelial cell growth factor&#xD;
      (ECGF), insulin (IGF-1), osteocalcin, osteonectin, fibrinogen, fibronectin and thrombospondin&#xD;
      (TSP) (11,27). These proteins secreted by activated platelets influence many aspects of&#xD;
      healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRFC has been used in different areas of Regenerative Medicine to improve wound healing&#xD;
      processes with multiple clinical applications in different fields of medicine: General&#xD;
      Surgery, Traumatology and Sports Medicine, Dentistry and Surgery Plastic and Reconstructive&#xD;
      Surgery, Dermatology, Neurology and Neurosurgery (28, 8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation of new strategies in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers involving&#xD;
      growth factors and platelet-rich plasma (15,16,17,20,27,28) has a history of basing it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these solid biological bases, the treatment results of skin ulcers with&#xD;
      platelet-derived growth factors are varied and there are relatively few controlled studies.&#xD;
      There is confusion about the usefulness of platelet-rich plasma because the studies that have&#xD;
      evaluated them use a wide range of products (different concentrations of platelets and&#xD;
      leukocytes, different techniques and frequencies of application, different types of injuries&#xD;
      to be treated, very heterogeneous and different endpoints) that make it almost impossible to&#xD;
      compare data and draw conclusions (29, 30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are reviews that evaluate the results that have been had so far on the effects that&#xD;
      these biological supplements with platelets offer as adjuvants in wound healing and healing.&#xD;
      A meta-analysis published in 2016, which included 10 randomized clinical trials evaluating&#xD;
      the effect of PRFC on chronic wound healing. Three of these randomized clinical trials&#xD;
      involved ulcers of diabetic origin and three studies involved venous leg ulcers. The overall&#xD;
      analysis did not shed light on the effectiveness of PRFC, but the results indicated that&#xD;
      autologous PRFC can improve the healing of diabetic ulcers compared to standard care,&#xD;
      although the value of evidence is low (46).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is why we believe it is appropriate to carry out studies that allow to evaluate in a&#xD;
      clear way and with a simple but complete description the effect that the use of PRFC has on&#xD;
      the healing of chronic ulcers of diabetic origin of difficult management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research hypothesis. The 4-week intradermal application of Plasma rich in growth factors&#xD;
      (PRFC) reduces healing time of chronic ulcers of difficult-to-manage diabetic origin, the&#xD;
      size of the injury, induces changes at the level histological and contributes to reducing&#xD;
      pain and improving the patient's quality of life compared to the best treatment available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods. Randomized clinical trial conducted in patients with chronic ulcers&#xD;
      (more than 4 weeks of evolution) of diabetic origin that come to the Wound Clinic of the&#xD;
      Regional General Hospital of Le√≥n for evaluation and care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated in 20 patients per group (control group and study group), to&#xD;
      detect at least a 50% difference in the reduction in the dimensions of the chronic ulcer at&#xD;
      the end of the manoeuvre, with a statistical significance of 0.05% and a poten 80%. Patients&#xD;
      will be selected by non-probabilistic sampling for convenience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure. Patients will be incorporated into the study through the Wound Clinic and the&#xD;
      Hematology department of the Regional General Hospital of Le√≥n where they will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in it, after explanation of the procedure and those who accept, they will be&#xD;
      invited will request to sign informed consent. Patients who agree to participate in the study&#xD;
      will have metabolic and haematological evaluation by the Hematology service of the same&#xD;
      hospital. Laboratory studies (hematic biometrics, blood chemistry, HbA1C, lipid profile and&#xD;
      coagulation times) will be performed. Patients will be cited 1 time per week at the Wound&#xD;
      Clinic and advanced ulcer cure will be performed in both groups consisting of healing with&#xD;
      physiological and antiseptic solution, biofilm debridement, as well as devitalized tissue,&#xD;
      occluding with non-absorbent gauze, dried gauze and bandage in both groups. The study group&#xD;
      will also have the intradermal application of PRFC after healing. The study group will also&#xD;
      be taken as a biopsy by punch (5mm x 5mm, considering a small part) in the first week (before&#xD;
      the application of PRFC) and at the end of treatment (1 week after the last application of&#xD;
      prFC). In patients where a complete ulcer closure is achieved, no final biopsy taken to&#xD;
      prevent further ulceration from occurring. This in order to determine the effects of Plasma&#xD;
      rich in growth factors at the histological level on ulcers of diabetic origin. Such&#xD;
      procedures shall be carried out by the student. During each appointment, prior to the&#xD;
      completion of the treatment, the measurement of the ulcer in its major and smallest diameters&#xD;
      will be performed and the area will be calculated through computerized planimetry. This will&#xD;
      be done by the surgeon general and responsible for the Wound Clinic who will be blinded which&#xD;
      group each patient belongs to). Each patient will also be evaluated through the Visual Pain&#xD;
      Analog Scale (EVA) and the SF-12 Lifestyle Questionnaire, each week. Both scales with&#xD;
      validity in force (49, 50). During the duration of the study, weekly photographic monitoring&#xD;
      of ulcers will be carried out to assess their evolution and response to treatment in each&#xD;
      patient. Both the evaluations and the photographic follow-up will be carried out by the&#xD;
      student.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technical of centrifugation and obtaining PRFC. After 8 hours fasting, blood sampling (20 cc)&#xD;
      will be performed by ulnar artery puncture, which will be collected in sterile tubes with&#xD;
      sodium citrate at 3.8% as anticoagulant. A sample will be used to perform a&#xD;
      pre-centrifugation platelet count. The rest of the blood sample will be centrifuged at 3200&#xD;
      revolutions per minute (rpm) for 15 minutes at room temperature; separation by pipetting of&#xD;
      the obtained plasma (approximately 3-4 ml) with a variable platelet content, which will be&#xD;
      centrifuged again for 8 minutes at 1800 rpm, at room temperature. Subsequently by meticulous&#xD;
      pipetting, the fractions obtained from the plasma shall be separated from above, and&#xD;
      collected in sterile tubes separated in such a way that the last fraction obtained&#xD;
      (approximately 1-5 to 2 ml and located in the lower portion of the tube) corresponding to the&#xD;
      plasma rich in growth factors or PRFC (26). A 0.5 ml sample will be taken from this fraction&#xD;
      of PRFC to perform a platelet count and determine post-centrifugation platelet performance in&#xD;
      each patient and application. This value will be recorded to determine the increase in&#xD;
      platelet concentration in each patient. The remaining fraction (1.5 ml) will be applied&#xD;
      through intradermal injection immediately upon collection. This procedure will be performed&#xD;
      in the Laboratory of the General Hospital of Le√≥n by the same person trained and familiar&#xD;
      with the procedure throughout the study. Calcium citrate will not be added as a activator as&#xD;
      it is considered according to the literature that the activation of growth factors takes&#xD;
      place in soft tissues once PRFC comes into contact with collagen fibers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TECHNICAL APPLICATION OF PRFC Once the ulcer has been cured in the manner described above and&#xD;
      before the application of the gauze, the study group will be applied to 2 thirds of the PRFC&#xD;
      obtained through intradermal injection in tod or the perimeter of the ulcer with 3cc syringe&#xD;
      and hypodermic needle. The remaining third will be applied to the ulcer bed by drip&#xD;
      technique. Subsequently, non-absorbent gauze will be placed on it and finally covered with&#xD;
      dried gauze and bandage. These will be removed until the next PRFC application (1 week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis. Continuous variables will be reported as means +/- standard deviations&#xD;
      and categorical ones as frequencies and percentages. We will perform Student T for the&#xD;
      initial comparison of the study groups and X2 according to the type of variable. To test our&#xD;
      hypothesis we will perform ANOVA of repeated measurements and post hoc test of Tukey. A&#xD;
      Multiple Correlation analysis will determine the possible association of other factors that&#xD;
      influence the healing time of ulcers.&#xD;
