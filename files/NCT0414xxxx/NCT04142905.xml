      Intention to review patient letters from sleep clinic to see if their lung function fit in&#xD;
      with Dysynapsis in wheezing patients or if it is true asthma&#xD;

      There is no evidence that the World Wide prevalence of asthma is declining. There is some&#xD;
      evidence that this Western disease may give the appearance of declining prevalence due to&#xD;
      improved healthcare. However evidence from the Office of National Statistics suggests that&#xD;
      the mortality rate for asthma may be increasing year on since 2007 until 2017. The true&#xD;
      burden of asthma in the United Kingdom is difficult to ascertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity has effects on lung function which lead to low functional residual capacity and low&#xD;
      end reserve volume. This leads to rapid shallow breaths near to the airway closing pressure&#xD;
      and lung closing volume as illustrated in this review. This suggests that obesity itself may&#xD;
      be a source of breathlessness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High Body Mass Index (BMI) has been shown to be associated with asthma. It was also&#xD;
      associated with wheeze that is not asthma. This finding suggests that obesity in itself may&#xD;
      be linked to wheeze which is not asthma. It has been shown in children that sleep disordered&#xD;
      breathing is associated with asthma as well as wheeze. Obese children are known to display&#xD;
      dysanapsis (airway cross sectional area is small for the size of the lung) whether associated&#xD;
      with or without asthma, however if associated with asthma, the severity of asthma can be&#xD;
      worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM: To investigate if asthma is truly associated with Sleep disordered breathing in adult&#xD;
      subjects. To investigate if there is an association of wheeze with dysanapsis in patients&#xD;
      with sleep disordered breathing&#xD;
&#xD;
      NULL HYPOTHESIS: There is no difference between subjects who have sleep disordered breathing&#xD;
      with asthma and those subjects who have sleep disordered breathing without asthma, with&#xD;
      respect to lung function parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially the investigators' aim is to interrogate clinical records and look at lung function&#xD;
      testing in subjects with and without asthma who attend the sleep disordered breathing clinic.&#xD;
      The investigators intend to investigate 100 with asthma in the sleep clinic and 100 without&#xD;
      asthma in the sleep clinic. The Investigators will also look at eosinophil results of those&#xD;
      with asthma compared to those without asthma and any markers of atopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) to undertake&#xD;
      simple frequency analysis and cross tabs as well as odds ratio from binary logistic&#xD;
      regression.&#xD;
