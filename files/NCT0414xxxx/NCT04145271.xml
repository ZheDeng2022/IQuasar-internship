      It is unknown whether this evolved strategy (Pre-Hospital Zone I P-REBOA) is feasible and&#xD;
      with an acceptable safety profile. This study will address this question, therefore informing&#xD;
      the design of a prospective multicentre exploratory cohort study followed by a&#xD;
      pilot/feasibility multicenter RCT (IDEAL 2B). The IDEAL Framework is an internationally&#xD;
      recognised standard, that describes the stages through which interventional therapy&#xD;
      innovation normally passes, the characteristics of each stage and the study design types&#xD;
      recommended for each&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Haemorrhage (bleeding) is the most common cause of preventable death after injury and is&#xD;
      responsible for approximately one-third of trauma deaths (of which between 16-29% of such&#xD;
      deaths are thought to be preventable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA) is a minimally invasive&#xD;
      damage control procedure for life-threatening abdominal and/or pelvic haemorrhage. It&#xD;
      involves temporary occlusion of the aorta with an endovascular balloon, providing proximal&#xD;
      control to the site of vascular injury whilst supporting cerebral and myocardial perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emergency Department (ED) use of REBOA appears to be feasible and associated with improved&#xD;
      outcomes. However, bleeding trauma patients die quickly and it's evident that the peak death&#xD;
      rate from haemorrhage occurs within 30 minutes of injury. This is well before the majority of&#xD;
      patients can reach hospital, it's therefore likely this resuscitation strategy may have&#xD;
      greatest benefit for patients when used in the pre-hospital environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have demonstrated that Pre-Hospital Zone III REBOA (distal aortic occlusion) for&#xD;
      exsanguinating pelvic haemorrhage is a feasible resuscitation strategy that significantly&#xD;
      improves blood pressure and may reduce the risk of hypovolaemic cardiac arrest and early&#xD;
      death due to exsanguination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evolve this resuscitation strategy, it is important to establish whether it can be&#xD;
      delivered in patients with more proximal haemorrhage in the abdomen (Zone I REBOA). However,&#xD;
      this development may be associated with increased risk of harm due to the visceral ischaemia&#xD;
      that is created. The use of a technique called Partial REBOA (P-REBOA) may offer a solution&#xD;
      by mitigating the ischaemia/reperfusion injury created.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is unknown whether this evolved strategy (Zone I P-REBOA) is feasible in the pre-hospital&#xD;
      setting. This study therefore aims to establish via an Observational Cohort of eight adult&#xD;
      trauma patients whether Zone I P-REBOA can be achieved in pre-hospital resuscitation of adult&#xD;
      trauma patients with exsanguiunating sub-diaphragmatic haemorrhage at risk of imminent&#xD;
      hypovolaemic cardiac arrest or recent hypovolaemic cardiac arrest.&#xD;
