  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are interested in an additional hearing aid feature called non-linear&#xD;
      frequency compression (NLFC). This aims to improve audibility of high frequency sounds by&#xD;
      converting them into lower frequencies and has been shown to benefit those with&#xD;
      moderate-severe sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Cochlear dead regions (DRs) are areas of&#xD;
      the inner hearing organ (the cochlea) where there is little or no function and are commonly&#xD;
      found in regions responsible for detecting high pitched (frequency) sounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not all people with hearing loss have DRs. The investigators would like to determine whether&#xD;
      based on the presence or absence of DRs, patients with moderate-severe SNHL perform better or&#xD;
      prefer their hearing aids programmed conventionally, or with NLFC activated. To do this, two&#xD;
      participant groups will be created based on findings from the threshold equalising noise&#xD;
      (TEN) test which identifies cochlear DRs. Two participant groups will be created; one group&#xD;
      with DRs and one group without DRs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive two hearing aids and will wear these programmed conventionally&#xD;
      for ~six weeks and with NLFC activated for ~six weeks in a counterbalanced manner. Following&#xD;
      each condition, participants will complete a questionnaire and various speech tests will be&#xD;
      performed. This involves participants repeating sentences, words or speech sounds they hear&#xD;
      from a speaker in quiet and in the presence of background noise. Individuals' scores will be&#xD;
      calculated for each test and their performance when NLFC was activated and deactivated will&#xD;
      be compared. This will be analysed alongside the questionnaire data to compare the 'DR' and&#xD;
      'no DR' group in both conditions. Findings may help to determine whether NLFC should be&#xD;
      activated for all moderate-severe SNHL patients, or just those with DRs, helping clinicians&#xD;
      to optimise hearing aid settings for patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential participants will be recruited from the audiology database at Manchester Foundation&#xD;
      Trust. Those who meet the inclusion criteria will be sent a letter in the post accompanied by&#xD;
      a participation information sheet to raise their awareness of the project. This criterion&#xD;
      includes those aged 45 and over with a bilateral moderate to severe sensorineural hearing&#xD;
      loss who wear two hearing aids. They must report to wear these for &gt; 5 hours each day which,&#xD;
      will then be confirmed by their hearing aid data logging. English must be their first&#xD;
      language due to the test material that will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be provided with a participant information sheet, outlining what will happen in&#xD;
      each of the four sessions and a consent form. This participant information pack will inform&#xD;
      potential participants about how they may indicate their interest or contact the researchers&#xD;
      for more information about what the study entails. The investigators will try and recruit 30&#xD;
      participants in total to allow for attrition in the event of withdrawal or exclusion from the&#xD;
      study. The researchers hope to find 24 (12 in each group) eligible participants who will be&#xD;
      able to complete the study. The researchers anticipate recruitment will be done over one&#xD;
      month and data collection over four. It is possible that participants may be excluded from&#xD;
      the study once testing begins if asymmetrical DRs are found (present at frequencies &lt; 3kHz in&#xD;
      one ear only) or any otological symptoms arise that prevent participants from wearing their&#xD;
      aids for &gt;5 hours a day. The sample size was taken based on pragmatic ground and time&#xD;
      constraints as this is a MSc project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who provide written, informed consent will attend a reassessment appointment&#xD;
      (session one) a fitting appointment (session two) and a follow up appointment (session&#xD;
      three). These appointments are routinely offered to all patients who are beginning a new&#xD;
      hearing aid pathway. Additionally, the researchers are asking participants to attend one&#xD;
      further follow up appointment (session four). Each session will last between one and one and&#xD;
      a half hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session One- A reassessment is routinely offered to patients every three years and involves;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A brief medical history to identify potential ototoxic medication, any otological&#xD;
           symptoms and factors which may impact patient's ability to manage hearing aids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establishing the patient's hearing aid history to determine use and understand the&#xD;
           patient's lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Otoscopy (where the clinician will look in the ears) and tympanometry (where the&#xD;
           clinician will assess the ear drums).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A pure tone audiogram (PTA) to determine the patient's hearing thresholds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If required, impressions of the ears will be taken for new earmoulds to be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, a TEN test will be performed in session one to assess for DRs. The TEN test&#xD;
      procedure is similar to that of a standard PTA but involves ipsilateral masking. This&#xD;
      prevents signal tones from being detected at other regions of the cochlea that surround the&#xD;
      DR. By preventing off-frequency/place listening, a DR can be detected. Based on findings from&#xD;
      the TEN test, participants will be split into two groups; those with significant bilateral&#xD;
      cochlear DRs &lt; 3kHz (the DR group) and those without cochlear DRs or a DR &gt; 4kHz (the no DR&#xD;
      group). Those with unilateral DRs &lt; 3kHz will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session two- During session two, all participants will be familiarised with the test material&#xD;
      that will be used in sessions three and four. The adaptive Bamford Kowal Bench (BKB)&#xD;
      English-language sentences, the Arthur Boothroyd (AB) word list and auditory speech sounds&#xD;
      evaluation (ASSE) are all routine speech tests readily available within our audiology&#xD;
      department. These will be the speech tests used to measure performance with NLFC and with CP.&#xD;
      All testing will take place in a soundproof booth. None of these intensities should be too&#xD;
      loud for participants as they aim to replicate normal conversational levels. Following any&#xD;
      complains of loudness discomfort, the dB SPL will be reduced, and this will be recorded. The&#xD;
      questionnaire used will be The SSQ12, a validated shortened version of the speech, spatial&#xD;
      and qualities of hearing scale (SSQ) questionnaire that asks participants about their&#xD;
      listening experiences in various situations. The SSQ12 will be shown to participants in&#xD;
      session two, so they are aware of the situations they should be monitoring whilst wearing&#xD;
      their hearing aids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BKB sentences will be played in the presence of noise presented at 55 A- weighted decibels&#xD;
      (dBA) and the speech level adapts depending on whether the participant repeats the sentence&#xD;
      correctly, or not. If two or more key words are repeatedly correctly, the response is&#xD;
      considered correct. Following two correct responses, the speech intensity will be decreased.&#xD;
      Following one incorrect response, the intensity of the signal will be increased. Participants&#xD;
      will be given a score in dB which corresponds to the intensity level at which 71% of the&#xD;
      sentences are correctly identified. The speech signal will always be presented from the front&#xD;
      (0° azimuth). The noise signal will be presented from the front, from the left (-90°&#xD;
      azimuth), and from the right (90° azimuth). One sentence list will be administered for the&#xD;
      noise presented at 0°, +90° and -90° and an average overall score in dB will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AB word list will be performed in the absence of background noise. Words will be played&#xD;
      from a loudspeaker at 65 decibels sound pressure level (dB SPL). The test material consists&#xD;
      of ten words per list and each word is made of three phonemes. A point is awarded for each&#xD;
      correct phoneme (0,1,2,3) and the average score from three lists will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, participants will complete a phoneme discrimination task, ASSE at a level of&#xD;
      70dB SPL. They will be asked to discriminate between various phoneme pairs by a 'same/&#xD;
      different' procedure. Following three to eight presentations of a single speech sound,&#xD;
      another speech sound will be played e.g. V-Z. If participants respond correctly to two out of&#xD;
      three presentations, it can be concluded that the contrast between the background phoneme and&#xD;
      the odd speech sound is well discriminated and this will be marked as correct. Seven pairs&#xD;
      will be used, and participants will be given a percentage score based on how many they are&#xD;
      successfully able to discriminate between.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, during session two, participants will be fitted with bilateral Phonak Auto hearing&#xD;
      aids. These will be programmed to NAL-NL2 prescription targets following departmental&#xD;
      protocol and British Society of Audiology (BSA) recommended procedures, which includes making&#xD;
      real ear measurements (REMs). NLFC will be programmed into all participants hearing aids but&#xD;
      will be deactivated in half of the participants from each group in a randomised manner. This&#xD;
      will be generated for each group separately as there will be 12 participants in the 'DR&#xD;
      group' and 12 in the 'no DR group'. Using an Excel formula, participants in each group will&#xD;
      be placed in a random order in a list. The first six participants listed in each group will&#xD;
      experience NLFC first. The remaining six participants listed in each group will experience CP&#xD;
      first. Participants will be unaware of how their aids are programmed. NLFC in the 'no DR'&#xD;
      group will be validated according to BSA recommended procedures. NLFC in the 'DR group' will&#xD;
      be set based on where their dead region begins. This will be set at 0.75 times their&#xD;
      individual edge frequency (0.75Fe). Any fine tuning requested by participants of the hearing&#xD;
      aids will be permitted up to 7 days following fitting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session three- Around six weeks after the first fitting, session three will take place. This&#xD;
      will consist of testing participants with their hearing aids set to their first condition&#xD;
      using the adaptive BKB sentence test, AB word list and ASSE, as outlined above. Participants&#xD;
      will also complete the SSQ12 in an interview style format. Following this, the participant's&#xD;
      hearing aid settings will be swapped to the opposite condition i.e. if NLFC was activated in&#xD;
      session two, this will be disabled in session three and vice versa. Any fine tuning requested&#xD;
      by participants of the hearing aids will be permitted up to 7 days following fitting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session four- Around six weeks later, session four will take place. This will involve testing&#xD;
      participants with their hearing aids set to their second condition using the same test&#xD;
      material and completing the same questionnaire as in session three. Participants will then be&#xD;
      given a choice of which setting they would like permanently or can decide to go away with&#xD;
      both settings programmed into the hearing aids and decide at a later date.&#xD;
