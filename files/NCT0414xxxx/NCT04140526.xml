    <textblock>
      This is a First-in-Human Phase IA/IB open label dose escalation study of intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      administration of ONC-392, a humanized anti-CTLA4 IgG1 monoclonal antibody, as single agent&#xD;
      and in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with advanced or metastatic solid&#xD;
      tumors and non-small cell lung cancers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), also known as CD152 (cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation 152), is a cell surface protein receptor that interacts with B7-1 (CD80) and&#xD;
      B7-2 (CD86) to ensure proper function of regulatory T cells and protect host against&#xD;
      autoinflammatory diseases. Anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have demonstrated strong&#xD;
      and broad cancer immunotherapeutic effects (CITE) in a variety of preclinical models and are&#xD;
      used clinically both as monotherapy and as part of combination therapy with Nivolumab&#xD;
      (anti-PD-1). However, CTLA-4 monotherapy has more immunotherapy-related adverse effects&#xD;
      (irAEs) than anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. In addition, the rate of severe irAE (Grades 3 and 4)&#xD;
      reached 55% in melanoma patients receiving combination of Ipilimumab and Nivolumab. The&#xD;
      strong irAEs further limit the doses tolerated by cancer patients. Nevertheless, combination&#xD;
      with anti-PD-1 resulted in significantly improved response rates and patient survival in&#xD;
      multiple types of cancer. Furthermore, anti-CTLA-4 antibodies induce long-lasting immunity in&#xD;
      cancer patients. Therefore, CTLA-4 remains an important immunotherapy target, but major&#xD;
      challenges remain in improving both safety and efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 mAbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ONC-392 is a highly selective, humanized monoclonal IgG1-kappa isotype antibody against&#xD;
      CTLA-4. The parental clone was identified through in vivo screening in humanized CTLA-4 mouse&#xD;
      model for high anti-tumor efficacy and low autoimmune toxicity. We have recently demonstrated&#xD;
      that ONC-392 is dissociation from CTLA-4 under low pH to allow its escape from lysosomal&#xD;
      degradation and recycle to cell surface. We have provided several lines of evidence for the&#xD;
      notion that a pH-sensitive antibody ONC-392 is not only safer but also more effective in Treg&#xD;
      depletion and tumor rejection than the Ipilimumab, which is pH-insensitive. First, by&#xD;
      preserving CTLA-4 on the cell surface, Onc-392 leaves higher ligand density for better ADCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, Onc-392 is more efficient in Treg depletion in tumor microenvironment. Third, Onc-392&#xD;
      is significantly more potent in inducing rejection of large tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of three parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) The Part A study is a dose-finding rapid titration, Phase I trial of ONC-392 as a single&#xD;
      agent in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors with various histology. The aim of&#xD;
      this trial is to define the recommended Phase II dose for ONC-392 monotherapy (RP2D-M). (2)&#xD;
      The Part B study is a dose-finding phase in combination therapies. Part B1 is ONC-392 in&#xD;
      combination with a standard dose of 200 mg pembrolizumab in patients with advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic solid tumors. Part B2 is ONC-392 in combination with a standard dose of oral TKI&#xD;
      Osimertinib in patients with non small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (3) The Part C consists of 8 different expansion arms. Arms A, B, and C monotherapy expansion&#xD;
      cohorts can be initiated after the RP2D-M is determined. Arms D through H expansion cohorts&#xD;
      can be initiated after the RP2D-C is determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Arm A Pancreatic Cancer Cohort, ONC-392 monotherapy, will enroll advanced/metastatic&#xD;
           pancreatic cancer patients who have progressive disease after first and second lines of&#xD;
           systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Arm B TNBC Cohort, ONC-392 monotherapy, will enroll advanced/metastatic TNBC patients&#xD;
           who have progressive disease after prior systemic treatments, including checkpoint&#xD;
           inhibitor immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Arm C NSCLC Mono Cohort, ONC-392 monotherapy, will enroll advanced/metastatic NSCLC&#xD;
           patients with EGFR or ALK mutations who have progressive disease after prior systemic&#xD;
           treatments, including targeted therapy or checkpoint inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Arm D NSCLC IO Naïve Cohort, ONC-392/Pembrolizumab combination therapy, will enroll&#xD;
           advanced/metastatic NSCLC cancer patients who are treatment naïve, or anti PD (L)1&#xD;
           immunotherapy naïve and PD-L1-positive (PD L1 TPS ≥ 1%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Arm E NSCLC IO R/R Cohort, ONC-392/Pembrolizumab combination therapy, will enroll&#xD;
           advanced/metastatic NSCLC cancer patients who are R/R to prior anti-PD-(L)1&#xD;
           immunotherapy regardless of PD-L1 status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Arm F Mel IO Naïve Cohort, ONC-392/Pembrolizumab combination therapy, will enroll&#xD;
           advanced/metastatic Melanoma patients who are treatment naïve, or checkpoint inhibitor&#xD;
           immunotherapy naive. Prior systemic chemotherapy or targeted therapy are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Arm G Mel IO R/R Cohort, ONC-392/Pembrolizumab combination therapy, will enroll&#xD;
           advanced/metastatic melanoma patients who are R/R to anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy or other&#xD;
           forms of combination immunotherapy. Prior treatment with Ipilimumab is allowed. Patients&#xD;
           who have melanoma recurrence under adjuvant immunotherapy are considered to be&#xD;
           immunotherapy refractory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Arm H MCC IO R/R Cohort, ONC-392/Pembrolizumab combination therapy will enroll&#xD;
           advanced/metastatic MCC patients who are R/R to prior immunotherapy or experience cancer&#xD;
           recurrence within 1 year of IO adjuvant treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The Part A study will test ONC-392 intravenous (IV) infusion up to five predefined dose levels: 0.1 mg/kg (cohort 1), 0.3 mg/kg (cohort 2), 1 mg/kg (cohort 3), 3 mg/kg (cohort 4) and 10 mg/kg (cohort 5) of ONC-392 as monotherapy every 21 days (Q3W). The treatment will continue for up to 1 year, or discontinued upon disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity, or voluntary withdraw. The Part A study will determine the maximal tolerable dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose in monotherapy (RP2D-M).&#xD;
In Part C, Arms A, B, and C monotherapy expansion cohorts will further assess the safety and efficacy of ONC-392 in dose level of RP2D-M as monotherapy in pancreatic cancer, triple negative breast cancer and non small cell lung cancer with driver mutations.</description>

The Part B1 will start at one level below RP2D-M dose for ONC-392 and 200mg of pembrolizumab. When 2 DLTs occur before 6 patients are enrolled, the ONC-392 dose will be decreased to the next dose level until ≤ 1/6 patients treated at that dose develops a DLT. This dose level will be designated RP2D-C.&#xD;
