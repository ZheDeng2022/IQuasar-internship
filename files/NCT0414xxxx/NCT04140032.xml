  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity is a national epidemic that disproportionately burdens low income and&#xD;
      ethnic minority populations. By preschool, nearly one-third of low income children are&#xD;
      already overweight or obese, setting the stage for adverse health outcomes over their life&#xD;
      course. Evidence is mounting that individual-focused, single-component interventions fail to&#xD;
      produce long-term population-level changes in obesity-related outcomes. Evidence increasingly&#xD;
      supports creating entire environments (e.g., schools) in which the healthy choice is the&#xD;
      default option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a pragmatic cluster randomized trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a multilevel (organization, teacher, parent, child) intervention to support&#xD;
      healthy eating and physical activity in preschools. The study is being conducted in&#xD;
      partnership with Child Care Resource Center (CCRC), a non-profit organization dedicated to&#xD;
      ensuring that all children receive high quality preschool experiences. The investigators will&#xD;
      randomly assign 60 preschool sites (stratified by size), located in underserved areas of Los&#xD;
      Angeles, to the intervention or a usual practice control conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention on child BMI z-scores&#xD;
      (primary outcome) and parent-reported child nutrition and physical activity (secondary&#xD;
      outcomes). The investigators will systematically examine the implementation process to&#xD;
      understand factors that may facilitate or hinder intervention uptake and success. The&#xD;
      findings from this work will be critical for informing future dissemination efforts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study involves a 2-group design with stratified cluster randomization at the level of&#xD;
      the preschool. The investigators will recruit 60 preschools from LA County's most vulnerable&#xD;
      communities, stratified by size (large, small). The investigators will randomly select pairs&#xD;
      of schools from each stratum and randomly assign one member of each pair to the intervention&#xD;
      or control conditions. Given the 10-month instructional year (Sept. 1-June 30), preschools&#xD;
      will be recruited in three cohorts over three instructional years (~20 schools per cohort).&#xD;
      To control for time trends in outcomes, the randomization protocol will be implemented&#xD;
      independently within each cohort. Baseline data collection, conducted in the first six weeks&#xD;
      of the school year, will include surveys (site directors, teachers, parents), anthropometric&#xD;
      measures (children), preschool policy reviews and direct observation in preschools including&#xD;
      child-level eating behavior and physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multilevel intervention will be initiated immediately following baseline data collection&#xD;
      and will consist of 1) establishment of organizational policies to support healthy nutrition&#xD;
      and physical activity, 2) integration of nutrition and physical activity content into&#xD;
      curricula 3) supports for teachers and staff to model healthy behavior, and 4) engagement of&#xD;
      parents as partners in implementing healthy policies in preschool and at home. Implementation&#xD;
      measures will be collected throughout the project period. Follow-up data collection, in the&#xD;
      last four-six weeks of the school year, will mirror baseline data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Children at intervention schools will gain less weight relative to height gains compared&#xD;
           to children at control schools, resulting in lower mean BMI z-scores at follow-up&#xD;
           (effectiveness). Outcomes will be assessed in the overall sample and among the subset of&#xD;
           children who are overweight or obese at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intervention preschools will have greater implementation of healthy nutrition and&#xD;
           physical activity policies and practices at follow-up compared to control preschools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary effectiveness outcome will be child age-and sex-adjusted BMI z-score. The&#xD;
      investigators will obtain baseline data on 1,630 children, 815 per condition, 60 preschool&#xD;
      site directors and approximately 135 teachers. Estimating 80% child retention at follow-up,&#xD;
      the investigators anticipate having follow-up data on 1,304 children, 652 per study arm. Data&#xD;
      will also be collected from the parents of participating children at baseline and follow-up.&#xD;
