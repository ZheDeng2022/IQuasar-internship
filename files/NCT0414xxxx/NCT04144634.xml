  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On average, people become physically weaker during even a short stay in hospital. This study&#xD;
      is a feasibility/pilot study to see if additional physiotherapy exercises undertaken in&#xD;
      hospital is feasible and acceptable to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will compare two different types of physiotherapy exercise. Both exercise&#xD;
      programmes involve twice-daily physiotherapy provided by one of the hospital's physiotherapy&#xD;
      assistants, but only one of the two exercise programmes expected to provide benefit. This is&#xD;
      on top of the care that people would normally receive, and will last for the first 7 days of&#xD;
      their hospital admission (or until they are discharged if this is earlier).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to consent to the study during the first 36 hours of their hospital&#xD;
      admission. If patients provide consent, they will undergo a baseline assessment of their&#xD;
      functional ability (including testing of their muscle strength) before being randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of the two exercise programmes. The study aims to recruit 15 patients to each&#xD;
      group (30 in total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once randomised patients will be seen twice a day by a physiotherapy assistant who will&#xD;
      supervise the exercise programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day that participants are discharged (or day 7 of their admission if earlier) the&#xD;
      assessor will repeat measures of the participants functional ability. Following these&#xD;
      measures participants will be invited to be interviewed to discuss their experience of taking&#xD;
      part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately one month after discharge, a researcher will visit the participant to repeat&#xD;
      measures of their functional ability at their home.&#xD;
