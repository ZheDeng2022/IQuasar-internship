      Evaluation if a computer-based tutorial (&quot;MacInfo&quot; tool) improves the patients' knowledge&#xD;
      about intravitreal drug injections, associated risks, and the underlying diseases of&#xD;
      treatment-naive patients.&#xD;

      Informing the patient an obtaining informed consent is one of the major duties physicians&#xD;
      have to perform before beginning a medical treatment. However, patients often experience the&#xD;
      informed consent taking as not satisfying. In the past, several approaches were used to try&#xD;
      to improve the informed consent taking, such as printed information sheets and multimedia&#xD;
      tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A novel concept introduced several years ago is the utilization of a multimedia tool&#xD;
      including a so-called traffic light system. At our clinic, a computer-based tutorial for&#xD;
      informed consent of patients undergoing cataract surgery (&quot;CatInfo&quot; tool) was developed and&#xD;
      tested. The patients see and hear a presentation covering the topics of cataract disease, the&#xD;
      surgery, and associated risks and complications. After each chapter a graphic representation&#xD;
      of a traffic light is shown on the screen. At this page the patient has three choices: if the&#xD;
      patient understood everything and wish to continue, the green bar has to be clicked; if there&#xD;
      are further questions, the patient clicks the yellow bar; or if the patient wishes to repeat&#xD;
      the chapter due to any reason, the patient clicks the red bar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous studies, it was shown that patients who used the CatInfo tool had better&#xD;
      knowledge about cataract surgery compared to the ones that saw a placebo video. Furthermore,&#xD;
      the overall satisfaction of patients with the CatInfo tool was high (median 9.1 of 10&#xD;
      measured with a visual analogue scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since many cataract patients benefited from using the CatInfo tool, the idea arose to create&#xD;
      and test a similar multimedia information tool for patients receiving a drug injection into&#xD;
      the vitreous of the eye for treatment of retinal diseases (e.g. patients suffering from&#xD;
      neovascular age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema, or retinal venous&#xD;
      occlusive disease). Therefore, the &quot;MacInfo&quot; tool was developed as a multidisciplinary&#xD;
      project including patients, graphic designers, and ophthalmologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, it would be helpful for the physician to have a legal valid and written&#xD;
      documentation of the informed consent process, serving as proof that the patient was informed&#xD;
      correctly about all necessary topics concerning the medical treatment, expected benefits,&#xD;
      risks, complications, etc. A novel and technology-driven approach may be the use of Automated&#xD;
      Speech Recognition (ASR). ASR records the informed consent discussion, followed by an&#xD;
      algorithmic analysis of the conversation, and a subsequent translation of the interaction&#xD;
      into a legally valid document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate if the &quot;MacInfo&quot; tool improves the patients' knowledge&#xD;
      about intravitreal drug injections, associated risks and the underlying diseases of&#xD;
      treatment-naive patients and if ASR is a suitable technology for improving informed consent&#xD;
      process documentation in daily routine.&#xD;
