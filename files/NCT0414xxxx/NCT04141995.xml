      Purpose: To determine the feasibility and safety of combining digoxin as a modulator of the&#xD;
      hypoxia pathway in combination with FOLinic acid, 5-Fluorouracil, IRINotecan and OXaliplatin&#xD;
      (FOLFIRINOX) in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Methods: Patients with resectable pancreatic cancer will be treated with oxaliplatin 85 mg/m²&#xD;
      IV over 2 hours, irinotecan 150 mg/m² given concurrently with folinic acid 400 mg/m² IV over&#xD;
      90 min, followed by a 46-hour infusion of 5-fluorouracil 2400 mg/m². Slow oral digitalization&#xD;
      will be used starting with a daily dose of 0.125 (patients over age 65) or 0.25 mg (patients&#xD;
      65 or younger) PO daily. A steady-state will be achieved after five half-lives, which is&#xD;
      about 7 to 10 days in the average subject. The initial blood level will be obtained one week&#xD;
      after starting digoxin. Assuming the digoxin level is at steady-state and the renal function&#xD;
      is stable, there is a linear relationship between digoxin dose and serum concentration. The&#xD;
      target digoxin level is between 0.8 to 1.2 ng/mL. Patients will receive IV chemotherapy at 2&#xD;
      week intervals. Restaging imaging will be performed after 4 doses. If the patient has stable&#xD;
      or responsive disease, an additional 4 doses will be given followed by restaging imaging. The&#xD;
      patient will then undergo surgical exploration ~ 4 weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Endpoints: Primary Endpoints: clinical toxicity. Other endpoints: status of&#xD;
      pathologic margins, response rate, pathologic stage, progression-free survival, and overall&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlative Endpoints: Baseline exome sequencing of circulating cell free tumor DNA.&#xD;
      Measurement of quantity of circulating cell free tumor DNA at 4 week intervals while on&#xD;
      chemotherapy and prior to surgery; resume at 3 month intervals after surgery. Genomic DNA&#xD;
      will be collected at baseline for pharmacogenetic studies of polymorphisms that may be&#xD;
      pertinent for the drugs used in the study. Blood will be collected for analysis of possible&#xD;
      biomarkers of response to digoxin modulation.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pathologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Patients must have resectable&#xD;
             disease with no evidence of distant metastasis&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age: Patients must be 19 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. ECOG PS of 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who received chemotherapy for malignancies other than pancreatic cancer are&#xD;
             eligible, provided that chemotherapy was completed &gt; 5 years ago and there is no&#xD;
             evidence of the prior malignancy at the time of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. All patients must have radiographically assessable disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must have an initial ANC greater than or equal to 1000/μL and platelet count&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 100,000/μL&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient must have normal serum potassium, magnesium and corrected calcium level&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must have a serum creatinine less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients must have a total bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 mg/dL (unless the patient has Gilbert&#xD;
             disease with elevated non-conjugated (indirect) bilirubin; in such cases, the indirect&#xD;
             bilirubin should be &lt;= 1.0 mg/dL). If the patient has biliary obstruction, biliary&#xD;
             decompression will be required. Either endoscopic placement of biliary stent or&#xD;
             percutaneous transhepatic drainage are acceptable. Once biliary drainage has been&#xD;
             established, institution of FOLFOX therapy may proceed when the total bilirubin falls&#xD;
             to &lt;= 5.0 mg/dL. The addition of irinotecan will be delayed until the total bilirubin&#xD;
             is 1.5 mg/dL or lower.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. The patient must be aware of the neoplastic nature of his/her disease and willingly&#xD;
             provide written, informed consent after being informed of the procedure to be&#xD;
             followed, the experimental nature of the therapy, alternatives, potential benefits,&#xD;
             side-effects, risks, and discomforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. No prior chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who cannot undergo staging laparoscopy. For example, this may include&#xD;
             patients with a prior history of multiple abdominal operations in which laparoscopy&#xD;
             may not be technically feasible or might be potentially harmful.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with a contra-indication to receiving digoxin therapy, such as AV block, sick&#xD;
             sinus syndrome, bradycardia, and hypersensitivity to digoxin or digitalis&#xD;
             preparations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection requiring intravenous antibiotics, symptomatic congestive heart failure,&#xD;
             unstable angina pectoris, or serious, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, that might&#xD;
             jeopardize the ability of the patient to receive the therapy program outlined in this&#xD;
             protocol with reasonable safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pregnant and nursing women are excluded from this study because of the risk posed by&#xD;
             the chemotherapy agents. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a&#xD;
             negative urine pregnancy test before receiving the first dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with prior malignancy will be excluded except for adequately treated basal&#xD;
             cell or squamous cell skin cancer, adequately treated noninvasive carcinomas, or other&#xD;
             cancers from which the patient has been disease-free for at least 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with known HIV infection or active hepatitis B or C infection due to concern&#xD;
             for increased toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with an active autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus&#xD;
             erythematosus (SLE), ulcerative colitis, Crohn's Disease, multiple sclerosis (MS),&#xD;
             ankylosing spondylitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with a recognized acquired, hereditary, or congenital immunodeficiency&#xD;
             disease including cellular immunodeficienciess, hypogammaglobulinemia, or&#xD;
             dysgammaglobulinemia.&#xD;
