  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychosocial distress is common in patients with an oncologic diagnosis, with anxiety being&#xD;
      present in almost 20-30% of the patients.[1, 2, 10] Mindfulness exercises have shown to&#xD;
      reduce this distress.[4, 5]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the implementation of a 60-second mindfulness-based intervention has shown to have&#xD;
      momentary effects on pain, anxiety, depression and anger in orthopaedic upper extremity&#xD;
      patients.[9] However, its lasting effect after the single intervention was not evaluated.&#xD;
      Nonetheless, because the intervention is not time consuming and is easy to implement it may&#xD;
      benefit orthopaedic oncology patients in their pre-operative coping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation of a 60-second mindfulness-based intervention has shown to have momentary&#xD;
      effects on pain, anxiety, depression and anger in orthopaedic upper extremity participants.&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are studying a 60-second interactive personalized&#xD;
      acceptance-based mindfulness exercise&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a preoperative 60-second interactive&#xD;
      personalized acceptance-based mindfulness exercise (intervention) versus a brief educational&#xD;
      pamphlet (control) on anxiety in patients undergoing curative surgery for a musculoskeletal&#xD;
      malignancy.&#xD;
