    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the most effective strategy of reducing sedentary behavior to&#xD;
      improve health. Specifically, we aim to answer the following questions: (a) To determine if&#xD;
      there is a significant difference in acute post-prandial glucose response between continuous&#xD;
      sitting and two intermittent standing regimes (high frequency, low duration breaks (HFLD) and&#xD;
      low frequency, high duration breaks (LFHD)). We hypothesize that intermittent standing&#xD;
      (combined HFLD breaks and LFHD breaks regimes) will result in lower overall acute&#xD;
      post-prandial glucose compared to continuous sitting. (b) To determine if there is a&#xD;
      significant difference in acute post-prandial glucose response between two strategies to&#xD;
      reduce sitting with standing (HFLD standing breaks vs. LFHD standing breaks). We hypothesize&#xD;
      that the HFLD breaks condition will elicit lower acute post-prandial glucose level compared&#xD;
      to the LFHD breaks condition. All eligible participants will be consented and subjected to&#xD;
      all three study conditions: (i) Uninterrupted sitting, (ii) HFLD breaks, and (iii) LFHD&#xD;
      breaks. The order at which participants were subjected to these conditions will be randomly&#xD;
      determined and each condition were performed a week apart. Standardized meals (breakfast and&#xD;
      lunch) will be provided during each lab visit and participants will be then be asked to&#xD;
      perform their usual work activity using a sit-stand workstation in the lab. Depending on&#xD;
      their assigned condition, the participants will be prompted to stand or sit for a given&#xD;
      period of time. A continuous glucose monitor will be used to measure glucose response to the&#xD;
      intervention while an activPAL device will be used to make sure that participants are&#xD;
      compliant with the study protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most studies that explored the health benefits of interrupting sitting time focused on using&#xD;
      different modalities (i.e., comparing walking vs standing breaks). However, experimental&#xD;
      studies that directly compare patterns of interrupting sitting time through standing only are&#xD;
      needed to advance the field. This study aimed to (i) determine if there is a difference in&#xD;
      glucose response between continuous sitting (CS) and two intermittent standing regimes (high&#xD;
      frequency, low duration breaks (HFLD) and low frequency, high duration breaks (LFHD)) and&#xD;
      (ii) to determine if there is a difference in glucose response between the two strategies&#xD;
      (HFLD vs. LFHD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Study Participants and Recruitment The target participants were sedentary office employees&#xD;
      with impaired fasting glucose level. Participants were recruited through a study flyer via&#xD;
      various recruitment channels (i.e., ASU faculty website, social media, word of mouth). The&#xD;
      study flyer contains a link to a Qualtrics survey to pre-screen interested participants. All&#xD;
      eligible participants will be scheduled for a 30-minute screening visit to assess fasting&#xD;
      glucose level. A total of 12 sedentary and inactive employees (indicated by &gt;6 hrs of&#xD;
      workplace sedentary time assessed by the activPAL device during a one-week screening period)&#xD;
      will be enrolled to participate in a fully randomized crossover trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Study Design The study design is a crossover randomized trial with three conditions: (i)&#xD;
      uninterrupted sitting, (ii) high-frequency and low duration (HFLD) standing breaks, and (iii)&#xD;
      low-frequency and high duration (LFHD) standing breaks. In the interrupted sitting conditions&#xD;
      (i.e., HFLD and LFHD), total sitting and standing time were designed to be equal in both&#xD;
      groups. The only difference between the two conditions was on the pattern to accumulate&#xD;
      sitting time. A common threshold for prolonged sitting time in epidemiological studies of&#xD;
      sedentary behavior is 30 minutes of continuous sitting. In the HFLD condition, we will use&#xD;
      half of this threshold and ask participants to interrupt their sitting time every 15 minutes&#xD;
      using a 2.5-minute standing break. In contrast, participants will perform twice this&#xD;
      threshold in the LFHD standing breaks where they will complete a 10-minute standing break&#xD;
      every hour of sitting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All possible sequence of condition were determined and organized into blocks (a total of six&#xD;
      blocks). Each eligible participant will be randomly assigned to a block to determine the&#xD;
      sequence that they would perform the conditions. The randomization process will involve a&#xD;
      separate research staff preparing 40 sealed envelope that contains a block number randomly&#xD;
      determined using a computer-generated random sequence. These envelopes will be kept in a&#xD;
      secure cabinet by another research staff not directly involved in the project. Each&#xD;
      participant will be blinded to the condition that they are going to perform during the visit&#xD;
      until after their first standardized meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be invited to three 450-minute (7.5-hour) laboratory visits where they will&#xD;
      be provided with a private room, a sit-stand workstation, and a desktop computer. During each&#xD;
      laboratory visit, participants will perform their usual desk-based work activities. All&#xD;
      visits will be scheduled one week apart. Participants will be instructed to fast overnight,&#xD;
      and standardized breakfast and lunch meals will also be provided to control for any dietary&#xD;
      effects on glucose level. In addition, each participant will be instructed to avoid any&#xD;
      moderate-vigorous physical activities for at least two days and smoking cigarettes and&#xD;
      consuming alcoholic beverages at least three days prior to each visit. Upon arrival to the&#xD;
      lab for their first visit, participants will complete a dietary log of their last meal the&#xD;
      previous day. They will then be instructed to replicate this meal the night prior to each&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Outcome Measures Continuous Glucose Monitors. A day prior to the first visit, participants&#xD;
      will be fitted with a Freestyle Libre Pro (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL) continuous&#xD;
      glucose monitor by a trained researcher. The sensor will be attached to the back part of the&#xD;
      participant's non-dominant arm and programmed to measure interstitial glucose at 15-minute&#xD;
      intervals. The device is designed to be worn continuously for 14 days and is waterproof,&#xD;
      lightweight (roughly the size of a quarter) and minimally obtrusive. The sensors will be&#xD;
      attached using proper aseptic procedures and in accordance with the manufacturer's&#xD;
      instructions. Lastly, each participant will be given instructions on how to care for the&#xD;
      device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the last visit, data from each sensor will be acquired using the Libre Pro&#xD;
      reader and uploaded to an online patient repository (LibreView). Data will then be processed,&#xD;
      and 15-minute epoch data will be downloaded into a local secure drive for further processing.&#xD;
      Continuous glucose data corresponding to each visit date and time will be isolated using the&#xD;
      paper logs and inspected for completeness and quality of data. Files with less than 80% of&#xD;
      valid observation will be excluded from the succeeding analyses. Glucose incremental area&#xD;
      under the curve (iAUC) will be calculated using the trapezoidal method along with other&#xD;
      metrics for variability (i.e., MAGE: mean amplitude of glycemic excursions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      activPAL Device. Objective measures of sitting, standing and moving time will derived from&#xD;
      the activPAL micro accelerometer worn on the midline of the right thigh. Participants will&#xD;
      wear the device on two occasions: (i) for 7 consecutive days during the baseline period and&#xD;
      (ii) for 14 consecutive days during the study. The validity and reliability of the activPAL&#xD;
      in measuring sedentary and physical activity behaviors has been previously reported.&#xD;
      Collected data will be processed into events of sitting, standing, or moving (i.e., stepping)&#xD;
      using the activPAL software version 7.2.32 (PAL Technologies Ltd, Scotland, UK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Meals. Standardized meals (breakfast and lunch) will be provided in each lab visit&#xD;
      to control for any dietary influence. Each meal are designed to provide 33% of the&#xD;
      participant's total daily caloric needs following a typical American diet (50-60%&#xD;
      carbohydrates, 25-35% fat, and 10-20% protein). Basal metabolic rate will be calculated for&#xD;
      each particiapnt using Schofield's equation using a 1.5 activity factor. After calculating&#xD;
      the required caloric content of each meal, a meal with the closest caloric value will be&#xD;
      chosen from a list of pre-determined meal plan. A typical breakfast will be composed of a&#xD;
      croissant, ham, cheddar cheese, cereals with milk, fruit cup, and orange juice while lunch&#xD;
      items consisted of a ciabatta ham and cheese sandwich and orange juice. The same meal will be&#xD;
      provided during all follow-up visits.&#xD;
