  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to utilize the new indirect calorimetry Q-NRG device to the&#xD;
      measurement of energy expenditure (EE) throughout your intensive care unit (ICU) stay and&#xD;
      ultimately address fundamental questions about metabolism and energy requirements for&#xD;
      critically ill patients. The study will use a new, investigational calorimeter called the&#xD;
      Q-NRG (the study device, supplied by Cosmed, Italy). The word &quot;investigational&quot; means the&#xD;
      study drug or device or biologic is still being tested in research studies and is not&#xD;
      approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A calorimeter is a device that&#xD;
      connects to your breathing machine tubing for a short period (about 30 minutes) and helps to&#xD;
      determine what nutrition you may need in your current condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are FDA approved calorimeters that have been used as the current standard of care.&#xD;
      These devices and the new Q-NRG calorimeter measure oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide&#xD;
      production (the gas you breathe out when you exhale) and calculate energy expenditure.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, previously existing calorimeters are complicated to use, cumbersome and&#xD;
      require time for measurements. It is hoped the new calorimeter will be easier and more&#xD;
      practical to use and, through the measurements we take, we will have a better understanding&#xD;
      of a patient's caloric needs for healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle mass and quality play a role in determining EE and metabolic needs. Massive loss of&#xD;
      muscle mass and quality that occurs in critical illness significantly affects EE and&#xD;
      nutritional needs and should be accounted for in clinical nutrition delivery. Imaging&#xD;
      (standard of care abdominal CT and MSK ultrasound) will be used to assess muscle mass, and&#xD;
      muscle quality (amount of intramuscular adipose content; IMAT).&#xD;
