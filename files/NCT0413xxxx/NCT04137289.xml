  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase Ia - Explore safety and establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended dose&#xD;
      levels for phase Ib expansion phase of BI 905711 based on the frequency of patients&#xD;
      experiencing dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the MTD evaluation period. The MTD&#xD;
      evaluation period is defined as the first two treatment cycles (from first dose&#xD;
      administration until the day preceding the third dose administration or end of REP in case of&#xD;
      discontinuation before start of Cycle 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ia - Explore pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and efficacy to guide the determination&#xD;
      of a potentially effective dose range for phase Ib in the absence of MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ib - Evaluate efficacy and safety of BI 905711 at a potentially effective dose range&#xD;
      and determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D)&#xD;

                  according to local standards to confirm eligibility (e.g., echocardiogram,&#xD;
