  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-arm, randomized, double-blinded, multicenter phase III clinical study to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of HLX10 combined with chemotherapy versus placebo combined with&#xD;
      chemotherapy for neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment of gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to the following two arms at 1: 1 ratio:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A (HLX10 arm): HLX10 combined with chemotherapy will be adopted in the neoadjuvant&#xD;
           treatment phase, and HLX10 monotherapy will be administered in the adjuvant treatment&#xD;
           phase;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B (control arm): Placebo combined with chemotherapy will be given in the neoadjuvant&#xD;
           treatment phase, and chemotherapy alone will be administered during the adjuvant&#xD;
           treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy regimen SOX (oxaliplatin + tegafor gimeracil oteracil potassium (S-1)) will be&#xD;
      used in the neoadjuvant treatment phase in Arm A and B, and in the adjuvant treatment phase&#xD;
      in Arm B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization, subjects will receive a total of 3 cycles of neoadjuvant treatment with&#xD;
      the mentioned treatment regimen.Surgery will be performed within 3-6 weeks after the last&#xD;
      cycle of neoadjuvant treatment.All subjects who have completed the surgery will be unblinded&#xD;
      after surgery, and adjuvant treatment will be started 3 to 12 weeks after surgery. Subjects&#xD;
      randomized to Arm A (HLX10 arm) will continue to receive HLX10 monotherapy for up to 17&#xD;
      cycles (12 months).Subjects in Arm B after surgery (control arm) will continue to use&#xD;
      chemotherapy alone (oxaliplatin + S-1) for 5 cycles.&#xD;
