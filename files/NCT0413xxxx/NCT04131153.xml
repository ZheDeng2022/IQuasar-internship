    <textblock>
      Hepatic hemangioma is the most common benign tumor of the liver.For huge liver hemangioma,&#xD;
      however, it need to use the conventional radiofrequency ablation can increase one-time&#xD;
      ablation volume of radiofrequency electrode or enhance ablation power and extend the melting&#xD;
      time, not only bring patients suffering discomfort, but easy to damage the adjacent organs,&#xD;
      causing serious complications such as hemorrhage, perforation of gastrointestinal tract,acute&#xD;
      renal failure .Therefore, the investigators have developed a new, standardized radiofrequency&#xD;
      ablation for giant hepatic hemangioma to shorten the duration of treatment, reduce surgical&#xD;
      complications and improve the surgical success rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety, feasibility and efficacy of the new&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation (&quot; three-step &quot;radiofrequency ablation) in the treatment of giant&#xD;
      hepatic hemangioma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatic hemangioma is the most common benign tumor of the liver, with an incidence of 0.4-20%&#xD;
      in the general population.For small and asymptomatic patients with hepatic hemangioma,&#xD;
      regular reexamination is necessary without medical intervention.However, patients with giant&#xD;
      hepatic hemangioma(diameter ≥ 5cm) may have symptoms such as abdominal pain, indigestion,&#xD;
      jaundice, or rapid increase in lesion volume, or even spontaneous rupture and hemorrhage,&#xD;
      which require active treatment.Currently, surgical resection is the most effective method for&#xD;
      the treatment of hepatic hemangioma, but the incidence and mortality of related complications&#xD;
      have been reported as high as 27% and 3% respectively&#xD;
&#xD;
      .Other alternative therapies, such as transcatheter arterial embolization, radiotherapy and&#xD;
      steroid therapy, have also been reported for the treatment of hepatic hemangioma, but the&#xD;
      efficacy is not satisfactory .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation is a safe and minimally invasive&#xD;
      treatment with reliable efficacy. In recent years, this technique has been successfully&#xD;
      applied in the treatment of hepatic hemangioma with a diameter of &lt; 5cm.For huge liver&#xD;
      hemangioma, however, need to use the conventional radiofrequency ablation can increase&#xD;
      one-time ablation volume of radiofrequency electrode or enhance ablation power and extend the&#xD;
      melting time, not only bring patients suffering discomfort, but easy to damage the adjacent&#xD;
      organs, causing serious complications such as hemorrhage, perforation of gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tract, acute renal failure .Therefore, the investigators have developed a new,standardized&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation for giant hepatic hemangioma to shorten the duration of treatment,&#xD;
      reduce surgical complications and improve the surgical success rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety, feasibility and efficacy of the new&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation (&quot; three-step &quot;radiofrequency ablation) in the treatment of giant&#xD;
      hepatic hemangioma.&#xD;
