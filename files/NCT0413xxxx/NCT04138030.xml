      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy worldwide and the fourth leading&#xD;
      cause of cancer related death, with rates being highest in Western countries. Colonoscopy is&#xD;
      considered the golden standard in colorectal cancer screening and endoscopic resection of&#xD;
      precursor lesions (polyps) has been shown to reduce colorectal cancer death. Polyps extending&#xD;
      over 10mm, also referred to as lateral spreading lesions (LSL) if non-pedunculated, more&#xD;
      often demonstrate advanced histological features and are considered to be at greater risk for&#xD;
      malignant transition as compared to their smaller counterparts. Incomplete endoscopic&#xD;
      resection of advanced adenomas may lead to adenoma recurrence and contribute to the&#xD;
      development of so called 'interval cancers', which occur during the 6 - 36 month period&#xD;
      following complete colonoscopy. Interval cancers account for up to 6% of newly diagnosed CRC&#xD;
      cases, highlighting the importance of complete resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is a well-established inject and resect method for the&#xD;
      removal of LSLs using chromo-gelofusin based submucosal lift and subsequent cauterisation&#xD;
      assisted snare excision. Lesions up to 25mm in size may be removed enbloc, whereas larger&#xD;
      lesions are generally removed in a piecemeal fashion. Contrary to enbloc resection, piecemeal&#xD;
      EMR is historically associated with relatively high recurrence rates of 15-20%. A recent four&#xD;
      centre trial led by Westmead Hospital published in gastroenterology (impact factor 20.8) has&#xD;
      shown that application of snare-tip soft coag (STSC) to the EMR defect margins considerably&#xD;
      improves recurrence rates to around 7% in adenomatous LSL. Common complications of EMR such&#xD;
      as intra-procedural bleeding (IPB) or clinically significant post-procedural bleeding (CSPB),&#xD;
      deep mural injury (DMI) and post-polypectomy coagulation syndrome (PPCS) are largely related&#xD;
      to the use of cauterisation for tissue transection. Although complication rates have improved&#xD;
      and effects can often be managed endoscopically, further optimization of the EMR safety&#xD;
      profile is needed in the background of an aging target population with multiple&#xD;
      co-morbidities and widespread use of anticoagulants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cold snare polypectomy (CSP) has become the standard of care for removal of subcentimeter&#xD;
      polyps. CSP relies on the use of dedicated stiff thin wire snares that are able to swiftly&#xD;
      cut through mucosal tissue without the need for cauterisation, leaving intact the muscularis&#xD;
      mucosa and the deeper submucosal layers, virtually excluding the risk of perforation. The&#xD;
      absence of delayed cauterisation effect significantly reduces the risk of post-polypectomy&#xD;
      bleeding, even in patients on anticoagulant therapy. Complete resection rates of polyps&#xD;
      ranging from 6 to 10mm in size were found to be non-inferior in CSP as compared to&#xD;
      cauterisation based resection. Moreover, resecting a sufficient margin of normal mucosa&#xD;
      surrounding the polyp (i.e. &gt;1mm) yields an excellent 98% complete resection rate in polyps&#xD;
      &lt;10mm in size without increasing the risk of delayed bleeding. Meta-analysis demonstrated a&#xD;
      significantly shorter procedure time when applying the cold snare resection technique in&#xD;
      small polyps. Snare size limitations of dedicated cold snares however do not allow for&#xD;
      en-bloc resection of polyps &gt;10mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, cold snare piecemeal EMR was shown to be safe and effective for the removal of&#xD;
      large sessile serrated polyps (SSP). Combined evidence from a limited number of small single&#xD;
      centre mostly retrospective studies investigating cold snare piecemeal polypectomy in&#xD;
      adenomas over 10mm demonstrated recurrence rates of around 11% whilst maintaining an&#xD;
      excellent safety profile with minimal complication rates. However, recurrence rates rise to&#xD;
      22% in the subgroup of polyps over 20mm. Thus far cold snare piecemeal polypectomy of&#xD;
      lateral-spreading adenomas has not yet been compared to conventional EMR in prospective&#xD;
      randomized fashion.&#xD;
