    <textblock>
      Homeless youth have a much higher rate of substance use than non-homeless peers with evidence&#xD;
      suggesting that homeless youth have the highest rates of opioid use among youth subgroups in&#xD;
      the country (Brands et al., 2005); heroin using homeless youth also appear to have the&#xD;
      highest rates of IV drug use and HIV (Rhoades et al., 2014). Given the high rates of opioid&#xD;
      use, exposure to violence, mental and physical health challenges, and high rates of mortality&#xD;
      in homeless youth, it is surprising that no study to date utilizes a randomized controlled&#xD;
      design to test prevention of opioid and other drug use among this vulnerable population.&#xD;
      Resolution of youth homelessness through housing and prevention services, often referred to&#xD;
      as &quot;Housing First&quot;, as proposed in the current study, has great potential to reduce the&#xD;
      likelihood for the development of an opioid use disorder as well as other problem behaviors&#xD;
      associated with living on the streets. However, only 20-30% of homeless youth samples report&#xD;
      ever having stayed at a crisis shelter, 9% report having ever accessed mental health&#xD;
      services, and 15% report ever having received substance use treatment (Ray, 2006) indicating&#xD;
      a need to reach and engage youth in services that are feasible and acceptable. This study&#xD;
      will provide essential information for researchers and providers on the efficacy of housing +&#xD;
      opioid and related risk prevention services in an RCT on opioid use, how moderators affect&#xD;
      the response, and mechanisms underlying change.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this application is to evaluate a comprehensive intervention for the&#xD;
      prevention of opioid use disorder and for increasing other resilient outcomes in this special&#xD;
      population of high-risk young adults. Phase I of the study includes a nonrandomized pilot&#xD;
      study with a sample of 21 youth to assess initial efficacy, feasibility of recruitment and&#xD;
      acceptability of the housing + opioid and related risk prevention services. Upon meeting&#xD;
      transition milestones, 240 youth will be randomized into housing + opioid and related risk&#xD;
      prevention services versus opioid and related risk prevention services alone for Phase II. In&#xD;
      this study, we seek to determine if adding housing to opioid and related risk prevention&#xD;
      services yields a significant benefit above and beyond the benefit yielded by opioid and&#xD;
      related risk prevention services alone. Phase II follow-up will be conducted at 3, 6, 9 and&#xD;
      12-months post-baseline to assess stability of effects. Sample inclusion criteria,&#xD;
      recruitment and screening will be identical for both phases, as described below. The unique&#xD;
      components of Phase I and Phase II are then described separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Inclusion Criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. We will include youth between the ages of 18 to 24 years. Our experience is that&#xD;
           landlords will not accept leases signed by youth ages 16-17 years. &quot;Homeless youth&quot;&#xD;
           commonly refers to those up to the age of 24 years (Robertson &amp; Toro, 1999; USICH,&#xD;
           2010), thus, this age range generally reflects the age range of the homeless youth&#xD;
           population served by providers across the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Youth meets the criteria for homelessness as defined by the federal McKinney-Vento Act&#xD;
           (2002) as &quot;lacking a fixed, regular, stable, and adequate nighttime residence&quot; and&#xD;
           includes &quot;living in a publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide&#xD;
           temporary living accommodations, or a public or private place not designed for, or&#xD;
           ordinarily used as, regular sleeping accommodations for human beings.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Youth fails to meet DSM 5 criteria for Opioid Use Disorder as assessed by the SCID&#xD;
           (First et al., 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Those who receive a score over 10 on the Scale for Suicide Ideation - Worst Point&#xD;
           (SSI-W) (Beck, Brown, &amp; Steer, 1997), indicating moderate suicide risk, or report a&#xD;
           past-year suicide attempt will be eligible for 10 sessions of Cognitive Therapy for&#xD;
           Suicide Prevention (CTSP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant recruitment and sample availability. Columbus is ranked the 16th largest city in&#xD;
      the U.S. Many consider Columbus a &quot;typical&quot; American city because of the mix of races, range&#xD;
      of incomes, urban, suburban, and nearby rural areas. Columbus has one drop-in center for&#xD;
      homeless youth between the ages of 14-24 years (founded by MPI Slesnick). Last year (2018)&#xD;
      approximately 1200 unduplicated homeless youth between the ages of 14-24 years were served at&#xD;
      the drop-in center, with 70-95% of homeless youth reporting problem substance use, similar to&#xD;
      national samples (e.g., Baer et al., 2003). The single adult shelters have a total of 457&#xD;
      beds for single men and 97 for single women on any given night. Service-connected youth will&#xD;
      be recruited from the drop-in and adult shelters, non-service connected youth will be&#xD;
      recruited through outreach to local soup kitchens, sandwich lines, the streets, parks and&#xD;
      library. Given the high rates of homeless youth in Columbus, we do not anticipate any&#xD;
      recruitment problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and intake. Project staff will maintain offices within the drop-in center. Youth&#xD;
      who are engaged on the streets will be transported to the drop-in center. An RA will engage&#xD;
      and screen youth to determine basic eligibility for the study. After the brief screening and&#xD;
      stated interest in the project, written consent will be obtained and the Structured Clinical&#xD;
      Interview for DSM-5 Disorders (SCID) (First, Williams, Karg, &amp; Spitzer, 2015) section on&#xD;
      Opioid Use Disorder, will be administered to determine formal eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community Engagement. Too often, interventions do not reach those for whom the interventions&#xD;
      were developed (Spoth &amp; Greenberg, 2005). Implementation science promotes the integration of&#xD;
      research in to practice and policy, with implementation science studies often focused on&#xD;
      investigating the bottlenecks that impede the uptake and adoption of interventions. Several&#xD;
      calls have sought to transform translational science so that research supported interventions&#xD;
      can quickly reach the targeted populations in need (Fogarty International Center, 2013), with&#xD;
      the Institute of Medicine (IOM) noting that &quot;there is no time to lose&quot; (IOM, 1999). The IOM&#xD;
      has emphasized a greater focus on engaging community stakeholders from the earliest phases of&#xD;
      research, as such continuous involvement improves dissemination and uptake (Spoth &amp;&#xD;
      Greenberg, 2005). Indeed, multiple guidelines and lessons learned from dissemination of&#xD;
      evidence-based interventions have been published (e.g., Collins &amp; Sapiano, 2016). Standards&#xD;
      for dissemination include that the program has the ability to go to scale, has training and&#xD;
      technical support available, and a statement of the causal mechanisms relating the&#xD;
      intervention to the outcome (Flay et al., 2005). This study will provide a solid base for the&#xD;
      next step in translating research to practice and policy. At the end of the study, the&#xD;
      materials and knowledge will be in place to conduct an effectiveness or broad-based&#xD;
      dissemination effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Community Advisory Group, including homeless providers, homeless youth, landlords,&#xD;
      substance use treatment experts and policy makers will meet throughout the project period,&#xD;
      shaping study procedures, and easing transition of intervention to practice by the end of the&#xD;
      study. Furthermore, Nationwide Children's Hospital (NCH) has led several large housing&#xD;
      initiatives in the city, and MPI Kelleher's primary appointment is with NCH, where he works&#xD;
      with the City, United Way and housing developers. Engagement will continue beyond the study&#xD;
      period between researchers and community partners in order to support implementation of the&#xD;
      prevention intervention. Also, at the end of the study period, a conference will be held at&#xD;
      The Ohio State University to engage executive directors and their staff from drop-in centers&#xD;
      from around the country, as well as other homeless youth researchers and providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I (UG3) Using the same recruitment strategy, eligibility criteria and assessment&#xD;
      package (including stress biomarkers) as Phase II, a non-randomized pilot of the housing +&#xD;
      opioid and related risk prevention services intervention (N = 21) will be completed in year&#xD;
      1. The sample size of 21 reflects three months of recruitment of seven youth/month. All youth&#xD;
      will receive the 6-month housing + opioid and related prevention services intervention. Youth&#xD;
      will be assessed at baseline, 3 and 6-months using the proposed assessment battery, and&#xD;
      qualitative interviews. The primary purpose of this phase is to document feasibility of&#xD;
      recruitment, acceptability of the intervention, and initial pre-post change on targeted&#xD;
      outcome measures. However, other activities, including creating a base of landlords to&#xD;
      provide rentals to youth and initiating the Community Advisory Group, will also be a focus.&#xD;
      As the housing + prevention services and assessment battery are identical in Phase 1 and&#xD;
      Phase II, they are described in detail following the description of Phase II. Those aspects&#xD;
      unique to Phase I are discussed immediately below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: Assessment of acceptability, feasibility and initial efficacy of the intervention.&#xD;
      Several studies assess intervention acceptability, feasibility and initial efficacy using&#xD;
      similar procedures to those described below (von Haastregt et al., 2007; Zlotnick et al.,&#xD;
      2003). Acceptability of the intervention will be assessed by the retention of youths in the&#xD;
      intervention, the total number of advocacy sessions attended, length of time remaining in&#xD;
      project supported housing, and by the percentage of eligible youth who agree to participate&#xD;
      in the study. In addition, the extent to which landlords consent to continuing participation&#xD;
      in the second phase of the trial is essential. Assessment of feasibility includes&#xD;
      documentation of 1) whether participants can be recruited, engaged, and maintained in the&#xD;
      housing + opioid and related risk prevention services as proposed, data which can be obtained&#xD;
      from RA screening forms and advocate records (meetings attended, maintenance of housing), and&#xD;
      2) whether the timeline proposed for housing youths (anticipated to average 4 weeks, and time&#xD;
      to housing will be tracked) and other intervention procedures can be maintained as proposed.&#xD;
      In order to estimate initial efficacy, we will assess youth at baseline, 3 and 6-months to&#xD;
      determine change in identified targeted outcomes (e.g. opioid and other substance use,&#xD;
      homelessness and related problems). In addition to the quantitative analysis, qualitative&#xD;
      interviews with each youth will provide a fuller understanding of the youths' response to the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: Quantitative Analysis. Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to test the efficacy of&#xD;
      the intervention (time effects). Three testing occasions (e.g., baseline, 3, and 6 months)&#xD;
      will be the within-subject dependent variables. The primary outcome is opioid use, and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes are listed below under &quot;dependent variables.&quot; It is predicted that there&#xD;
      will be a main effect of time; youth will show reductions in opioid use, and improved&#xD;
      functioning in other domains at post-intervention (6-months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: Qualitative Analysis. In order to increase our understanding of youths' response to&#xD;
      the intervention such as experiences associated with differing levels of housing success and&#xD;
      satisfaction with services, each youth at 6 months post-baseline will be interviewed&#xD;
      regarding their experiences in the study. Supplementing the quantitative findings, interviews&#xD;
      can provide better understanding of factors that promote engagement and success among youth&#xD;
      as well as factors that prevented youth from successfully maintaining their housing.&#xD;
      Additionally, qualitative data can help explain any unexpected findings, and provide a&#xD;
      greater richness when reporting and interpreting the quantitative outcomes. Dr. Brittany&#xD;
      Brakenhoff conducted a mixed methods study (funded by NIDA, R36DA041530) in which youth were&#xD;
      interviewed regarding their perceptions of barriers to safe sex. She is an expert in&#xD;
      qualitative methods and will lead the qualitative data collection. The qualitative portion&#xD;
      will follow a phenomenological approach, which provides a framework for collecting and&#xD;
      analyzing qualitative data as a way to better understand how youth experienced the&#xD;
      intervention providing insight into youths' perceptions of whether they benefited from the&#xD;
      intervention in a way that was meaningful to them (Creswell, 2012). Youth will be asked about&#xD;
      their overall experience in the research study as well as their perception of how the&#xD;
      intervention impacted their life. Youth will be asked to discuss aspects of the intervention&#xD;
      they benefited from, aspects they did not find helpful, and how to make the intervention more&#xD;
      helpful. All interviews will be independently coded by three members of the research team and&#xD;
      discrepancies in coding will be discussed until an agreement is reached. NVivo 11 (QSR&#xD;
      international) will be used to assist with coding. Member checking will provide additional&#xD;
      verification of the results, a subsample of 5 youth who participated in the non-randomized&#xD;
      pilot will be asked to review and provide feedback on the initial qualitative findings. While&#xD;
      quantitative data can show whether participants changed their behavior, qualitative data can&#xD;
      determine if those changes actually resulted in perceived meaningful improvements in the&#xD;
      participants' lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II (UH3) In Phase II, 240 homeless youths between the ages of 18 to 24 years recruited&#xD;
      from the streets and drop-in center will be randomly assigned to 1) 6-months of housing +&#xD;
      opioid and related risk prevention services (n = 120), or to 2) opioid and related risk&#xD;
      prevention services alone (n = 120). In addition, sll youth will be screened using the Scale&#xD;
      for Suicide Ideation - Worst Point (SSI-W). Those who receive a score over 10, indicating&#xD;
      moderate suicide risk, or report a past-year suicide attempt will be eligible for 10 sessions&#xD;
      of Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP). We expect that approximately N =100 youth&#xD;
      will meet the criteria for receiving CTSP, and that these youth should be nearly equally&#xD;
      distributed in the housing + risk prevention services condition (N = 50) and risk prevention&#xD;
      services alone (N = 50). We considered a design that included an assessment only condition,&#xD;
      but given the level of risk and need of this population, we rejected this option. Using an&#xD;
      intent to treat design, follow-up assessments will be completed at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months&#xD;
      post-baseline. Standard methods of cost analysis will be used to estimate the cost of each&#xD;
      intervention condition. We have consistently obtained adequate follow-up rates with homeless&#xD;
      samples in our prior research (between 83-100% follow-up rates at 9 months for homeless&#xD;
      mothers, and 75% at 12 months for non-housed homeless youth samples). In our efforts to&#xD;
      maintain acceptable follow-up rates, we will obtain extensive locator information at the&#xD;
      baseline assessment in which participants designate hang-out spots and agencies they frequent&#xD;
      in Columbus, as well as collaterals. Collaterals may include friends, family members,&#xD;
      probation/parole officers or social workers who would likely know where the participant would&#xD;
      be if project staff lost touch with them. At each follow-up appointment, the research&#xD;
      assistant (RA) will update locator information. We have also found that homeless youth who&#xD;
      feel connected to our program and its advocates/RAs stay in contact. Upon completion of the&#xD;
      baseline assessment interview, youths will be randomly assigned to the intervention&#xD;
      conditions using a computerized urn randomization program. Four advocates will provide&#xD;
      services so that advocate effects can be examined (Baldwin et al., 2011), and each advocate&#xD;
      will provide all opioid and related risk prevention services to the youth on their caseload.&#xD;
      Advocates will be crossed by condition to &quot;equate&quot; conditions on advocate characteristics.&#xD;
      This approach is preferred over nesting as advocates in both conditions are trained in the&#xD;
      same procedures which include SBOA, MI, and HIV risk and suicide prevention (CTSP). Nesting&#xD;
      would likely be considered the better choice if treatment philosophies differed among the&#xD;
      intervention conditions. RA's will be blind to condition at all assessment timepoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Intervention: Housing + Prevention Services versus Prevention Services alone Housing&#xD;
      + Opioid and Related Risk Prevention Services integrates independent housing, Strengths-Based&#xD;
      Outreach and Advocacy (SBOA), HIV prevention and MI (Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2012) and Cognitive&#xD;
      Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP). In the housing + opioid and related risk prevention&#xD;
      services condition, youth will be housed in an apartment of their choosing and receive six&#xD;
      months of utility and rental assistance of up to $600 per month. The independent housing is&#xD;
      not contingent on the youth's substance use or attendance in prevention services. SBOA, MI,&#xD;
      HIV risk and suicide prevention occur simultaneously in this approach. Addressing basic needs&#xD;
      but not opioid and other drug use, through MI and service linkage, may lead to difficulty in&#xD;
      maintaining basic needs and vice versa. During the intervention, advocates assist youth in&#xD;
      accessing community supports so that if more assistance is needed at the end of the&#xD;
      intervention period, youth will have been linked to those additional supports. Findings from&#xD;
      the pilot study with non-service connected youth indicated that up to 26 advocacy sessions&#xD;
      should be offered. Each component of the intervention is described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strengths-Based Outreach and Advocacy (SBOA). Those individuals experiencing homelessness&#xD;
      with access to a social service worker, or who utilize community services, are more likely to&#xD;
      exit homelessness (Dworsky &amp; Piliavin, 2000; Raleigh-DuRoff, 2004; Zlotnick et al., 2003). In&#xD;
      general, the range and severity of adverse outcomes increases over time; the longer a young&#xD;
      person experiences homelessness, the more likely they are to experience opioid and other&#xD;
      substance use, victimization and mortality, and the harder it becomes to exit street life&#xD;
      (Ferguson et al., 2011; Milburn et al., 2006; Scutella et al., 2013), highlighting the&#xD;
      importance of engaging disconnected youth to services. SBOA focuses on identifying and&#xD;
      engaging youth from the streets and drop-ins/shelters etc. and assisting these youth to meet&#xD;
      their basic needs (i.e., referrals to food pantries), obtain government entitlements (i.e.,&#xD;
      SSDI/SSI, cash assistance, food stamps), and connect to other needed supports (education, job&#xD;
      training). The advocates provide referrals and/or transport youth to appointments as needed.&#xD;
      The initial meeting provides an opportunity to gather information. The advocate will review&#xD;
      each of six general areas with the youth to gather a history and picture of the current&#xD;
      situation: (1) housing needs; (2) health care; (3) food; (4) legal issues, (5) employment and&#xD;
      (6) education. The advocate will assist youth assigned to the opioid and related risk&#xD;
      prevention services only comparison condition to obtain housing within the community, as is&#xD;
      usually provided with SBOA, but unlike the youth in the housing intervention, they are not&#xD;
      provided housing by the project. Once this review is complete, an initial intervention plan&#xD;
      is developed with specific goals and objectives. Advocates are available 24 hours for crises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV prevention. Some have argued that HIV prevention should be offered to all individuals&#xD;
      seeking therapy for drug problems (Roehrich et al., 1994). Every youth will receive the&#xD;
      2-session intervention which uses cognitive-behavioral techniques with a focus on skills&#xD;
      building/behaviors (role plays with condom application, cleaning needles,&#xD;
      communication/negotiation and problem solving), used in prior projects with homeless youth&#xD;
      with success reducing risk behaviors (e.g., Carmona et al., 2014; Slesnick &amp; Kang, 2008).&#xD;
      Successful practice of skills is expected to increase confidence and self-efficacy which is&#xD;
      expected to increase the youth's use of skills including condom use and negotiation in other&#xD;
      micro-system interactions. The first session is devoted to AIDS education, assessment of&#xD;
      risk, risk reduction and skills practice. Session 2 focuses on sexual assertiveness and&#xD;
      practicing negotiation. Role plays are incorporated to allow the youth to practice social&#xD;
      competency skills relevant to their life situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motivational Interviewing (MI). Typically offered as a brief intervention of 1-2 sessions,&#xD;
      Motivational Interviewing (MI, Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2012) has a strong record of efficacy in&#xD;
      the prevention and treatment of alcohol and other drug use disorders (Copeland et al., 2015;&#xD;
      Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2012). MI assumes that the responsibility and capability for change lie&#xD;
      within the client and needs to be evoked (rather than created or installed). Baer, Peterson&#xD;
      and Wells (2004) provide some rationale for utilizing brief feedback and motivational&#xD;
      intervention with street living youth - the intervention is less costly and demands much less&#xD;
      of a hard-to-reach population than more intensive interventions. Utilizing a sample of&#xD;
      runaway adolescents recruited from a runaway shelter, Slesnick et al. (2013) found that&#xD;
      substance use reductions were significant for those assigned to MI even to two years&#xD;
      post-treatment. The advocate will administer MI. Four principles guide the practice of MI:&#xD;
      express accurate empathy, develop discrepancy, roll with resistance and support&#xD;
      self-efficacy. The Project Match manual was adapted for homeless/runaway youth in prior&#xD;
      trials in consultation with William R. Miller and Bo Miller (NIAAA grant no. R01AA12173 and&#xD;
      NIDA grant R29DA11590). Adaptation of the manual included attention to the unique life&#xD;
      situation of homeless youth in understanding motivations and challenges to recovery while&#xD;
      homeless. Session 1 begins with a period of open-ended MI, to establish therapeutic rapport&#xD;
      and elicit client change talk. In session 2 the advocate continues to focus on enhancing&#xD;
      intrinsic motivation for change, developing discrepancy, transitioning as appropriate into&#xD;
      the negotiation of a change plan and evoking commitment to the plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP). The Cognitive Therapy Intervention for&#xD;
      Suicide Attempters, developed by Aaron Beck, Gregory Brown and Amy Wenzel (Wenzel, Brown, &amp;&#xD;
      Beck, 2009) has shown promising results for both adults (Brown et al., 2005) and youth (Brent&#xD;
      et al., 1993; Stanley et al., 2009). This approach is innovative in that suicidal behavior is&#xD;
      the primary target for treatment, rather than being secondary to an underlying psychological&#xD;
      disorder, which has been the standard in the field (Wenzel et al., 2009). As a short term&#xD;
      treatment (10 sessions), the intervention is particularly feasible for youth who have high&#xD;
      rates of treatment refusal and drop-out. CTSP is based upon the theoretical assumption that&#xD;
      the manner by which people think and interpret their life events determines their emotional&#xD;
      and behavioral responses to those events. Hence, maladaptive cognitions associated with&#xD;
      suicidal ideation are the primary focus of the treatment. Given that the intervention&#xD;
      protocol was developed based on empirical studies designed to identify cognitive processes&#xD;
      relevant to suicidal acts, targeted vulnerability factors include hopelessness, social&#xD;
      isolation, poor problem solving, and impaired impulse control. The treatment is designed as a&#xD;
      10 session protocol including weekly or bi-weekly meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A crisis plan is developed in the first session and is expanded as therapy progresses. It&#xD;
      includes emergency contact numbers as well as positive coping behaviors, such as walking or&#xD;
      taking a hot bath that the client can perform alone. Consistent with the Interpersonal Theory&#xD;
      of Suicide (Joiner, 2002) and Rudd's theory (2004, 2006), the experience of prior suicidal&#xD;
      behaviors is considered associated with increased risk for future suicide attempts.&#xD;
      Therefore, assessment of recent suicidal thoughts and behaviors is conducted every session.&#xD;
      Clients in need of additional mental health treatment or services are referred to those&#xD;
      respective agencies. The treatment process is highly structured and consists of three phases.&#xD;
      During the initial phase of treatment (sessions 1-4) clients are educated about the cognitive&#xD;
      model and a cognitive case-conceptualization is developed to guide the intervention based on&#xD;
      client's individual risk-factors and experiences. Specifically, automatic thoughts, core&#xD;
      beliefs, and key life events associated with suicidal behaviors and thoughts are identified.&#xD;
      The middle phase of treatment (sessions 4-7) focuses on both cognitive restructuring and&#xD;
      behavior change through a variety of cognitive techniques designed to address&#xD;
      suicide-specific risk factors. For example, therapists teach clients positive behaviors, such&#xD;
      as distraction, relaxation, and intense physical sensations. These techniques can be used to&#xD;
      cope with a suicidal crisis and may mitigate the effect of the acquired ability to enact&#xD;
      lethal injury. Another form of coping is through a personal support system. Thus, therapists&#xD;
      help clients develop/strengthen their social network, which may include other homeless youth,&#xD;
      intimate partners, pro-social adults and drop-in center staff. Therapists can also work with&#xD;
      the client to create a hope kit, which includes reasons to live such as memories, letters,&#xD;
      pictures or other reminders of positive relationships with others. Although relationships&#xD;
      with parents are problematic, some youth maintain positive relationships with extended family&#xD;
      members or siblings, mentors or friends. Creating a hope kit and accessing support systems&#xD;
      can create a sense of connection and belongingness. The objective of the later sessions&#xD;
      (8-10) is to prevent relapses through practicing the newly-acquired skills through a guided&#xD;
      imagery process. Youth may receive up to 9 maintenance sessions within 6 months&#xD;
      post-baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Housing. Those randomized to receive housing + opioid and related risk prevention services&#xD;
      will receive each prevention component above, plus 6-months of housing. The Housing First&#xD;
      Model was developed by Pathways to Housing to provide immediate access to independent&#xD;
      apartments and supportive services for the most vulnerable homeless people with severe mental&#xD;
      illness and substance use disorders, without any prerequisites for sobriety or participation&#xD;
      in psychiatric treatment (Tsemberis et al., 2004; Tsemberis &amp; Asmussen, 1999). It is based on&#xD;
      the beliefs that housing is a fundamental human right, recovery from mental illness is&#xD;
      possible, and that consumers can make competent choices (Tsemberis et al., 2004). The central&#xD;
      tenet of Housing First is that consumers have choice/control over &quot;where they live, how they&#xD;
      live, who they allow to live with them, who enters the home, to abstain from substance use or&#xD;
      not, to comply with treatment demands or not, and the support that they receive&quot; (Greenwood&#xD;
      et al., 2005, p. 225). These Housing First principles underlie various housing approaches&#xD;
      (HUD, 2014). The advocate will work with the youth to identify appropriate housing among the&#xD;
      available choices, and will initiate the procedure for payment from Nationwide Children's&#xD;
      Hospital directly to the landlord once housing is identified. The project will cover damage&#xD;
      deposit, application fees (including FABCO report, credit report), and will automatically pay&#xD;
      the landlords the rental checks at the beginning of each month. As in the prior Stage 1 and 2&#xD;
      studies, Nationwide Children's Hospital will not sign leases on behalf of the youth, and so&#xD;
      the youth will sign the lease. The amount budgeted in this application for rent includes that&#xD;
      needed for both rent and utilities. Considerations. While we may not be able to prevent&#xD;
      contamination of sharing housing across groups, we propose some strategies to reduce its&#xD;
      impact should it occur. At each follow-up, youth will be asked to note if they know other&#xD;
      youth in the research project, and to identify those youths' names. We can then link&#xD;
      intervention condition with the youth to provide some estimate of contamination. We will&#xD;
      fully describe any probable contamination from both a research and clinical perspective.&#xD;
