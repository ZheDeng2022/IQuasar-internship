  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study looks at the safety and tolerability of the new medicine NNC0268-0965 (referred to&#xD;
      as insulin 965), its concentration in the blood and its effect on the blood sugar for the&#xD;
      treatment of diabetes. The study will test how insulin 965 is tolerated by the body, how it&#xD;
      is taken up in the blood, how long it stays there and how the blood sugar is lowered.&#xD;
      Participants will either get the new insulin 965 or the already marketed insulin glargine&#xD;
      U100 (LantusÂ®) - which treatment is decided by chance. Participants will get six injections&#xD;
      (one per day) of either insulin 965 or insulin glargine U100 under the skin of the left&#xD;
      thigh. The study will last for about 5 weeks. Participants will have 6 clinic visits with the&#xD;
      study doctor. Participants can only be in the study if the study doctor thinks that there are&#xD;
      no risks for their health. Women can only take part in the study if they can't have children.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female, aged 18-64 years (both inclusive) at the time of signing informed&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 180 days or more prior to the day of&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subject or female subject of non-child bearing potential. Non-child bearing&#xD;
             potential being surgically sterilised (i.e. documented hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
             salpingectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or being postmenopausal (as defined as no&#xD;
             menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause) prior to the day of&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current total daily insulin treatment between 0.25 (I)U/kg/day and 1.2 (I)U/kg/day&#xD;
             (both inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HbA1c equal to or below 9.5%&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Male of reproductive age who, or whose partner(s), is not using adequate contraceptive&#xD;
             methods (adequate contraceptive measures as required by local regulation or practice).&#xD;

             intercourse and that the partner practices adequate contraception (risk of pregnancy&#xD;
             must be lower than 1%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g. exenatide, liraglutide, semaglutide) within 3&#xD;
             months prior to screening.&#xD;
