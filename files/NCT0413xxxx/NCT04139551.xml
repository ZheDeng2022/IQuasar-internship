    <textblock>
      The OxQUIP (Oxford QUantification In Parkinsonism) study is recruiting patients with&#xD;
      Parkinson's Disease and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy. Currently available treatments for&#xD;
      these diseases are symptomatic only, and do not have any preventive or disease-slowing&#xD;
      effect. As new drugs are developed, there is a need to be able to evaluate them quickly, so&#xD;
      that precious time and resources can be devoted to those showing most promise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study follows participants intensively over an initially 3 year period, with the aim of&#xD;
      identifying measures that can detect disease progression over much shorter time periods than&#xD;
      is possible at present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study participants are asked to perform simple tasks while the investigators&#xD;
      measure movements of the eyes, hands and body. The investigators also do some tasks on a&#xD;
      tablet computer that measure cognitive performance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease that affects one in every&#xD;
      hundred people over the age of 55. It is estimated that there are seven to ten million people&#xD;
      with PD worldwide. It is disabling, incurable and gradually progressive. Progressive&#xD;
      Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is a related condition that presents initially with very similar&#xD;
      features to PD. Eventually other features appear that are not part of idiopathic PD, such as&#xD;
      paralysis of voluntary upgaze. Currently available treatments for both PD and PSP are&#xD;
      symptomatic only, and while they may be effective for a number of years, they do not have any&#xD;
      preventive or disease-slowing effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the problems with these conditions is that presently, there is a lack of completely&#xD;
      reliable means of measuring their severity. The investigators use &quot;clinical rating scales&quot;&#xD;
      which are points-based systems in which a doctor or nurse has to score how badly the person&#xD;
      with PD or PSP is affected by various aspects of their condition. This is a subjective&#xD;
      process, in other words it depends on the impression of the person making the assessment, and&#xD;
      two doctors may sometimes disagree about the score. The scale is also sometimes difficult to&#xD;
      interpret, for example the difference between scores of 20 and 30 may not be the same size as&#xD;
      the difference between scores of 30 and 40. In contrast, most medical conditions nowadays can&#xD;
      be very accurately and reliably measured using special equipment, for example the level of a&#xD;
      patient's blood pressure, or the difficulty of breathing in asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for accurate measures is particularly great when conducting trials of new drugs.&#xD;
      Accurate evaluation of whether they work or not depends on precise measures of disease&#xD;
      symptoms for each patient both before and after treatment. Drug trials may take years, and an&#xD;
      accurate early measure of effect would allow interim results to guide decisions at which&#xD;
      point resources can be focussed on those drugs that look most promising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to develop and validate sensitive tests to measure the symptoms of&#xD;
      PD and PSP.&#xD;
