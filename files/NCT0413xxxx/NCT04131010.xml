      Investigation of the efficacy and safety of digital catheter-based pancreatoscopy (DCP) for&#xD;
      the Treatment of symptomatic Stones of the pancreatic duct in selected patients with chronic&#xD;
      calcifying pancreatitis (CCP)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background Endoscopic treatment of patients with chronic calcifying pancreatitis (CCP) is&#xD;
      still challenging and controversially discussed. The goal is symptom control and relief of&#xD;
      pain, which can be achieved by draining an obstructed main pancreatic duct (MPD) and/or&#xD;
      removal of ductal stones. The 2012 European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE)-&#xD;
      Guidelines recommends ESWL as a first step for patients with uncomplicated painful chronic&#xD;
      pancreatitis and radiopaque stones ≥5mm obstructing the MPD. However, limitations of ESWL&#xD;
      (extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy ) include its limited availability, a likely need for&#xD;
      multiple sessions and often repeated ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography)&#xD;
      sessions for removal of stone fragments or treatment of associated strictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pancreatoscopically guided management of pancreatic stones offers a potential alternative to&#xD;
      ESWL. However, the numbers of studies and enrolled patients are still low. In 2015 single&#xD;
      operator video cholangioscopy (SpyGlassDS, Boston Scientific) was introduced. Available data&#xD;
      on its use for pancreatoscopy is limited. The technique provides digital imaging with a&#xD;
      higher resolution and improved maneuverability compared to the legacy fiberoptic system. In&#xD;
      addition, the working channel was enlarged to a diameter of 1.3 mm. Although SOVP have shown&#xD;
      promise in CCP, studies to date generally have been limited by: retrospective design,&#xD;
      relatively small and mixed patient populations, short follow-up periods, different clinical&#xD;
      and technical endpoints, and, often, a single-center design. Therefore, the investigators&#xD;
      designed a prospective multicenter cohort study to evaluate long-term clinical efficacy,&#xD;
      technical success and safety of SOVP.&#xD;
