  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most important causes of blindness&#xD;
      worldwide, especially in developed countries. In diabetic patients, periodic examination of&#xD;
      the back of the eye using a nonmydriatic camera has been widely demonstrated to be an&#xD;
      effective system to control and prevent the onset of DR. Convolutional neural networks have&#xD;
      been used to detect DR, achieving very high sensitivities and specificities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis It is possible to develop algorithms based on artificial intelligence that can&#xD;
      demonstrate equal or superior performance and that constitute an alternative to the current&#xD;
      screening of RD and other ophthalmic pathologies in diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Development of an artificial intelligence system for the detection of signs of retinal&#xD;
           pathology and other ophthalmic pathologies in diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scientific validation of the system to be used as a screening system in primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will consist of carrying out two studies simultaneously:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Development of an algorithm with artificial intelligence to detect signs of DR, other&#xD;
           pathologies of the central retina and glaucoma in patients with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Carrying out a prospective study that will make it possible to compare the diagnostic&#xD;
           capacity of the algorithms with that of the family medicine specialists who read the&#xD;
           background images. The reference will be double-blind reading by ophthalmologists who&#xD;
           specialize in retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cession of the images began at the end of 2018. The development of the AI algorithm is&#xD;
      calculated to last about 3 to 4 months. Inclusion of patients in the cohort will start in&#xD;
      early 2019 and is expected to last 3 to 4 months. Preliminary results are expected to be&#xD;
      published by the end of 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will allow the development of an algorithm based on AI that can demonstrate an&#xD;
      equal or superior performance, and that constitutes a complement or an alternative, to the&#xD;
      current screening of DR in diabetic patients&#xD;

      Study Design This project will follow a methodology consisting of 2 concomitant studies: In&#xD;
      the first study, we will develop an AI algorithm to detect the signs of DR in patients with&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part of the project will consist of the elaboration of a prospective study that&#xD;
      will allow comparing the diagnostic capacity of the algorithm with that of the family&#xD;
      medicine physicians and with retina specialists. The reference will be a blinded double&#xD;
      reading conducted by the retina specialists (with a blinded third reading in case of&#xD;
      disagreement in the previous 2 readings). In this way, the results obtained, both by the AI&#xD;
      algorithm and by family medicine specialists, will be compared using the gold standard&#xD;
      (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve, etc). The inclusion of nurses who&#xD;
      received training in fundus readings will be considered to compare their diagnostic capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population, Site Participation, and Recruitment Images for the development of the&#xD;
      algorithm will be ceded by the CHS and will include images from the whole Catalan population.&#xD;
      The prospective study will take place in the primary care centers managed by the Catalan&#xD;
      Health Institute in Central Catalonia, which includes the counties of Bages, Osona, Berguedà,&#xD;
      and Anoia. The reference population will be the population assigned to these primary care&#xD;
      centers. This population included about 512,000 people in 2017, with an estimated prevalence&#xD;
      of diabetes of 7.1%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study period will include 2010-2017 for the development of the algorithm with AI. The&#xD;
      prospective study will begin once the algorithm is developed and will run until the number of&#xD;
      readings needed is obtained (about 3-4 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduct of the Study For the development of the AI algorithm, all fundus images labeled as DR&#xD;
      of patients from primary care centers in Catalonia between 2010 and 2017 will be included.&#xD;
      For the prospective study, all the images of patients who underwent an eye fundus examination&#xD;
      will be included from the study start period until the adequate number of patients is&#xD;
      reached. A high percentage of fundus images must have sufficient quality; that is, a&#xD;
      40-degree vision of the central retina where at least a three-fourth part of the optic nerve,&#xD;
      a well-focused macula, and well-defined veins and arteries of the upper and lower arcs can be&#xD;
      seen. Eye fundus images that do not have adequate technical quality (dark) or that cannot be&#xD;
      evaluated due to the opacity of the media (eg, for cataracts) will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection For the development of the AI algorithm, it is necessary to have the&#xD;
      anonymized images with the corresponding label that classifies each image (in one of the&#xD;
      classes with which the algorithm is to be trained). The personnel responsible for information&#xD;
      technology (IT) of the CHS will evaluate the best strategy for the anonymization and&#xD;
      extraction of the images from the computer systems of the CHS, as well as the identification&#xD;
      of each image with a unique identifier. On the other hand, a tabulated file type CSV or TXT&#xD;
      will be required to relate each image identifier with the corresponding classification. The&#xD;
      person responsible for IT of the CHS, together with the technical manager of OPTretina, will&#xD;
      agree on the best way to transfer these 2 sources of information, in a secure way, from the&#xD;
      CHS servers to the OPTretina servers (SSH File Transfer Protocol, external hard disk)&#xD;
      depending on the volume of data to be transferred and the internal policy of the CHS.&#xD;
      OPTretina is experienced in developing AI models for automatic fundus image classification&#xD;
      and is a Spanish Agency of Medicines and Health Products-certified medical device&#xD;
      manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the prospective study, anonymized weekly fundus data readings collected by family&#xD;
      medicine physician readers of fundus images in Central Catalonia will be collected. The&#xD;
      images will be transferred to the OPTretina servers to be first analyzed by the diagnostic&#xD;
      algorithm and then by the retina specialists who will make the definitive diagnosis. The&#xD;
      person responsible for IT of the CHS, together with the technical manager of OPTretina, will&#xD;
      agree on the best way to transfer these data in a secure manner.&#xD;
