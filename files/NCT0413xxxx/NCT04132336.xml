  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers in this study wanted to find out the optimal dose of Caffeine in the&#xD;
      combination tablet of Naproxen Sodium and Caffeine that works in patients experiencing&#xD;
      moderate to severe pain after having wisdom teeth removed. In the US, Naproxen has been&#xD;
      marketed since 1976, and Naproxen Sodium has been approved for over-the-counter (OTC) use&#xD;
      since 1994 for the temporary relief of minor aches and pains. Caffeine, which is generally&#xD;
      consumed as coffee, tea or cocoa, has been shown to enhance the effectiveness of various pain&#xD;
      relievers, and therefore is accepted as an additive to painkillers like aspirin and&#xD;
      acetaminophen. Patients participating in this study underwent a surgery to remove 3 or 4&#xD;
      wisdom teeth. If the pain severity after the surgery met the study requirement, patients&#xD;
      would receive oral tablet(s) of Naproxen Sodium and Caffeine, or Naproxen Sodium, or&#xD;
      Caffeine, or placebo (drug with no active ingredient). Patients could also receive additional&#xD;
      pain medication when needed. Researchers would also learn if the patients have any medical&#xD;
      problems during the study.&#xD;

    <measure>Sum of Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) Over 8 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity is measured using Numerical Rating Scale (from 0 to 10: 0 = no pain, 10 = worst possible pain). For each post dose time point, pain intensity difference (PID) is derived by subtracting the pain intensity at the post dose time point from the baseline intensity score (baseline score - post-baseline score). A positive difference is indicative of improvement. Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (SPIDs) was calculated by multiplying the PID score at each post-dose time point by the duration (in hours) since the preceding time point and then summing these values over the specific time period. SPID over 8 hours ranges from -80 to 80. A higher value indicates a better pain reduction.</description>

    <measure>Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR) Over 8 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>Pain relief is measured using Categorical Pain Relief Rating Scale (0 = No relief, 1 = a little relief, 2 = some relief, 3 = a lot of relief, 4 = complete relief). Total Pain Relief is calculated as the area under the curve of pain relief score over time for the given time period by multiplying the pain relief score at each time point by the duration (in hours) since the preceding time point and then summing these values over the specific time period. TOTPAR over 8 hours ranges from 0 to 32, a higher value indicates more pain relief.</description>

    <description>Pain intensity is measured using Numerical Rating Scale (from 0 to 10: 0 = no pain, 10 = worst possible pain). Participants circle a number (from 0 to 10) on the Numerical Rating Scale to indicate the severity the pain they are experiencing at baseline and at each post dose time point. For each post dose time point, pain intensity difference (PID) is derived by subtracting the pain intensity at the post dose time point from the baseline intensity score (baseline score - post-baseline score).</description>

        <title>Sum of Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) Over 8 Hours</title>
        <description>Pain intensity is measured using Numerical Rating Scale (from 0 to 10: 0 = no pain, 10 = worst possible pain). For each post dose time point, pain intensity difference (PID) is derived by subtracting the pain intensity at the post dose time point from the baseline intensity score (baseline score - post-baseline score). A positive difference is indicative of improvement. Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (SPIDs) was calculated by multiplying the PID score at each post-dose time point by the duration (in hours) since the preceding time point and then summing these values over the specific time period. SPID over 8 hours ranges from -80 to 80. A higher value indicates a better pain reduction.</description>

          <title>Sum of Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) Over 8 Hours</title>
          <description>Pain intensity is measured using Numerical Rating Scale (from 0 to 10: 0 = no pain, 10 = worst possible pain). For each post dose time point, pain intensity difference (PID) is derived by subtracting the pain intensity at the post dose time point from the baseline intensity score (baseline score - post-baseline score). A positive difference is indicative of improvement. Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (SPIDs) was calculated by multiplying the PID score at each post-dose time point by the duration (in hours) since the preceding time point and then summing these values over the specific time period. SPID over 8 hours ranges from -80 to 80. A higher value indicates a better pain reduction.</description>

          <title>Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR) From 0 to 2, 4 and 12 Hours Post-dose</title>
          <description>Pain relief is measured using Categorical Pain Relief Rating Scale (0 = No relief, 1 = a little relief, 2 = some relief, 3 = a lot of relief, 4 = complete relief). Total Pain Relief is calculated as the area under the curve of pain relief score over time for the given time period by multiplying the pain relief score at each time point by the duration (in hours) since the preceding time point and then summing these values over the specific time period. TOTPAR 0-2 ranges from 0 to 8, TOTPAR 0-4 ranges from 0 to 16, and TOTPAR 0-12 ranges from 0 to 48. A higher value indicates more pain relief</description>

        <description>Pain intensity is measured using Numerical Rating Scale (from 0 to 10: 0 = no pain, 10 = worst possible pain). For each post dose time point, pain intensity difference (PID) is derived by subtracting the pain intensity at the post dose time point from the baseline intensity score (baseline score - post-baseline score). A positive difference is indicative of improvement</description>

        <title>Peak Pain Intensity Difference (PID)</title>
        <description>Pain intensity is measured using Numerical Rating Scale (from 0 to 10: 0 = no pain, 10 = worst possible pain). Participants circle a number (from 0 to 10) on the Numerical Rating Scale to indicate the severity the pain they are experiencing at baseline and at each post dose time point. For each post dose time point, pain intensity difference (PID) is derived by subtracting the pain intensity at the post dose time point from the baseline intensity score (baseline score - post-baseline score).</description>

        <title>Peak Pain Relief Score</title>
        <description>Pain relief is measured using Categorical Pain Relief Rating Scale (0 = No relief, 1 = a little relief, 2 = some relief, 3 = a lot of relief, 4 = complete relief). At each post-dose time point, participants check the appropriate box (from 0 to 4) on the Categorical Pain Relief Rating Scale to indicate the relief from starting pain at the post dose time points.</description>

          <title>Peak Pain Relief Score</title>
          <description>Pain relief is measured using Categorical Pain Relief Rating Scale (0 = No relief, 1 = a little relief, 2 = some relief, 3 = a lot of relief, 4 = complete relief). At each post-dose time point, participants check the appropriate box (from 0 to 4) on the Categorical Pain Relief Rating Scale to indicate the relief from starting pain at the post dose time points.</description>
