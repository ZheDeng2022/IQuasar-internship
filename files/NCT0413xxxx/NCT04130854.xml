      A phase II randomized trial 3:2 with short course radiotherapy followed by mFOLFOX&#xD;
      chemotherapy prior to trans abdominal resection with or without an antiCD40 agonist antibody&#xD;
      (APX005M). There will be continuous safety assessment for at least 6 patients. Planned&#xD;
      accrual of 58 patients. An interim analysis after 30 patients have completed treatment and&#xD;
      there will be early stopping criteria for futility or efficacy. Short course radiotherapy&#xD;
      will consist of 5Gy x 5 to the pelvis and patients on APX005M arm will receive one infusion&#xD;
      during radiotherapy course, have a two week break, then start FOLFOX with APX005M in&#xD;
      conjunction with five out of six cycles of chemotherapy. Patients will be restaged and then&#xD;
      undergo definitive surgery.&#xD;
