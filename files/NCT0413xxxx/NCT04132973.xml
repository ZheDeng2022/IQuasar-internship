  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to explore whether an online compassion-based guided self-help intervention is&#xD;
      perceived as acceptable to people with heterogeneous skin conditions, in terms of retention&#xD;
      rates and explicit feedback. The study also aims to investigate the feasibility of providing&#xD;
      online compassion-based self-help and email guidance. Changes in depression, self-compassion&#xD;
      and skin-related distress will be assessed to give an estimate of likely effect sizes for&#xD;
      future research&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate an online compassion-based self-help intervention with email&#xD;
      guidance with people with skin conditions who are experiencing depressive symptoms. As the&#xD;
      study aims to investigate a novel intervention, the study will be an acceptability and&#xD;
      feasibility study that uses a pre-post design. Participants with skin conditions will be&#xD;
      recruited from the general population using online methods (social media and advertisements&#xD;
      on skin condition charities/organisations websites). Participants will complete baseline&#xD;
      measures using Qualtrics and then be able to commence a six-week online intervention,&#xD;
      consisting of a dedicated website containing six self-help sessions to work through. Regular&#xD;
      guidance will be provided by the researcher via email. The self-help exercises in the current&#xD;
      study will consist of a number of exercises derived from Compassion Focused Therapy&#xD;
      (CFT)/Compassionate Mind Training, such as using soothing rhythm breathing, compassionate&#xD;
      imagery and compassionate writing. Explicit feedback will be sought from participants at the&#xD;
      end of each session, and at the end of the intervention overall. Engagement with the website&#xD;
      will be monitored via user logins and this will be used to calculate the retention rate for&#xD;
      the intervention. Post-intervention measures will be collected one week after the end of the&#xD;
      intervention. All participants will be provided with signposting information relating to&#xD;
      mental health and skin conditions, and advised to see their GP if they require any further&#xD;
      support with their physical or mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The guided self-help intervention will consist of six online sessions of&#xD;
      self-help information for participants to work through, plus activities to carry out&#xD;
      in-between sessions. The intervention will consist of psycho-education material,&#xD;
      self-monitoring, and compassion-inducing exercises from CFT. The self-help exercises in the&#xD;
      intervention will be evidence-based as being effective for depression: the compassion-focused&#xD;
      imagery exercises and the letter-writing exercise will be based on those used in published&#xD;
      studies. Other exercises, such as thought monitoring and relapse prevention planning, are&#xD;
      commonly used in cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and, as CFT is an adapted form of CBT,&#xD;
      will be included in the current self-help intervention. The session content and homework&#xD;
      exercises will build on previous sessions and homework, so there will be a clear sense of&#xD;
      progression through the intervention. In addition, imagery and written homework exercises&#xD;
      will be alternated, to provide variety and keep participants engaged in the intervention.&#xD;
      Examples relating to skin conditions will be given throughout the self-help materials. Expert&#xD;
      feedback regarding the content of the website has been sourced through personal contacts and&#xD;
      social media. Feedback has already been gathered from three people with skin conditions.&#xD;
      Changes to the website deemed necessary based on their feedback have been made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis strategy Text responses from participants' feedback on the intervention overall&#xD;
      will be analysed using content analysis to identify helpful aspects of the intervention and&#xD;
      areas for improvement. Quantitative data (outcome measures and acceptability ratings) will be&#xD;
      screened for outliers and missing values, and descriptive statistics will be conducted for&#xD;
      all variables. The data will be tested for the assumption of normality. Paired t-tests will&#xD;
      be used to test for differences in participants' psychological outcome measures before and&#xD;
      after the intervention. This information will also be used to calculate effect sizes (dz) for&#xD;
      changes in scores on each outcome measure. Intention-to-treat and completer analyses will be&#xD;
      carried out.&#xD;
