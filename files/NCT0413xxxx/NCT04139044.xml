      The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of a 4-week, unilateral balance exercise&#xD;
      training program on bilateral balance and explosive power in athletes with chronic ankle&#xD;
      instability. The participants were randomly divided into Stable Ankle Training Group (SG)&#xD;
      (n=9), Unstable Ankle Training Group (UG) (n=9) and control group (CG) (n=10). The balance&#xD;
      exercise training program was administered for only the stable ankle of athletes in SG and&#xD;
      only the unstable ankle of athletes in UG, twice a week and for a 4-week duration.&#xD;

      The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of a 4-week, unilateral balance exercise&#xD;
      training program on bilateral balance and explosive power in athletes with chronic ankle&#xD;
      instability (CAI). The study included 28 volunteer athletes with a history of CAI who&#xD;
      registered as a team player at Yeditepe University Culture and Sports Directorate February&#xD;
      2019 - June 2019. The severity of functional ankle instability of all the athletes was&#xD;
      assessed by the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT). Functional limitations of the&#xD;
      athletes with CAI were evaluated by Foot and Ankle Ability Measure Activity of Daily Living&#xD;
      Subscale (FAAM-ADL) and Sports Subscale (FAAM-S). Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) was&#xD;
      used to determine the static balance performance of athletes. Dynamic balance was evaluated&#xD;
      by the Y Balance Test (YBT). Sport performance including vertical jumping and hopping was&#xD;
      assessed with Single-Legged Countermovement Jump (CMJ) Test, Figure-of-Eight Hop Test, and&#xD;
      Side Hop Test. The athletes were randomly divided into Rehabilitation for the Stable Ankle&#xD;
      Group (SG) (n=9), Rehabilitation for the Unstable Ankle Group (UG) (n=9) and Control Group&#xD;
      (CG) (n=10). Athletes in SG and UG were included balance exercise training program. The&#xD;
      balance exercise training program was administered for only the stable ankle of athletes in&#xD;
      SG and only the unstable ankle of athletes in UG, twice a week and for a 4-week duration.&#xD;
