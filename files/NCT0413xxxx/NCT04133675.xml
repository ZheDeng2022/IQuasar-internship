  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a condition that affects both men and women. SUI is the&#xD;
      involuntary leakage of urine caused by an increase in intra-abdominal pressure from&#xD;
      activities such as exercise, coughing, laughing, or sneezing. It can significantly affect&#xD;
      quality of life as patients avoid activities or behaviors that cause leakage. This clinical&#xD;
      trial will compare the efficacy of the Emsella chair to sham and determine if electromagnetic&#xD;
      technology is effective in the treatment of SUI.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, sham-controlled, observational study of subjects undergoing&#xD;
      electromagnetic perineal stimulation for the treatment of SUI. Eligible subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive active treatment or sham in a 1:1 ratio. Eight treatments (2 treatments&#xD;
      each week) for 4 weeks will be completed with the Emsella chair to the pelvic floor muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electromagnetic stimulation of the pelvic floor is a FDA approved therapy whereby a coil&#xD;
      generates pulsed electromagnetic fields that penetrate deep into the pelvic floor muscles&#xD;
      inducing stimulation and providing rehabilitation of weak pelvic muscles.The Emsella Chair is&#xD;
      a novel high-intensity focused electromagnetic (HIFEM) technology for the treatment of SUI,&#xD;
      in addition to other pelvic floor related disorders. HIFEM technology induces deep pelvic&#xD;
      floor muscle contractions designed to deliver the equivalent of 11,200 Kegel exercises over&#xD;
      28 minutes.This technology is typically not covered by insurance, is minimally invasive, and&#xD;
      safe, but has limited data available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no data available from sham controlled studies evaluating efficacy of&#xD;
      this technology. The purpose of this study is to compare the Emsella Chair to sham and to&#xD;
      determine whether electromagnetic technology is effective in the treatment of SUI.&#xD;

Randomization envelopes will be provided by the study's biostatistician and will be securely stored in a locked cabinet. The study coordinator(s) will solely be responsible for opening the randomization envelopes and delivering the study treatments, according to group assignment. Ultimately, they will be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of the randomization envelopes. After randomization, the study coordinator(s) will complete the Subject Enrollment and Randomization Log. The log may be stored in a locked cabinet with the randomization envelopes.

    <description>Active treatment subjects will be asked to sit on the center of the Emsella chair. The height of the chair will be adjusted until the participant's feet are on the floor. The Emsella chair will be turned on and the setting gradually increased to the subject's sensory threshold; the maximum sensation the subject can tolerate. The setting will then be decreased slightly and stay unchanged for the remainder of the treatment time. The treatment threshold should be increased with every treatment until the subject reaches 100%.</description>

    <description>The Emsella Chair is a novel high-intensity focused electromagnetic (HIFEM) technology for the treatment of SUI, in addition to other pelvic floor related disorders. HIFEM technology induces deep pelvic floor muscle contractions designed to deliver the equivalent of 11,200 Kegel exercises over 28 minutes. The treatment paradigm consists of 3 different phases. The phases consist of an intense stimulation of the pelvic floor muscles (PFM), which consists of stimlulation and relaxation. The repetition of the phases and focused electromagnetic energy delivery leads to pelvic floor stimulation, adaptation, and remodelation.</description>
