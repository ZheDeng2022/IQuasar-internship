  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using gene therapy to express active telomerase (hTERT) in humans has the potential to treat&#xD;
      many of the age related diseases, including Aging itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will entail treating subjects with hTERT delivered via transduction using AAV. The&#xD;
      goal is to extend the telomeres to prevent, delay, or even reverse Aging.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects willing to participate who meet with the inclusion - exclusion criteria, will be&#xD;
      treated with a single dose of LGT delivered intravascularly (IV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline will be performed within 8 weeks of beginning the treatment regimen. The treatment&#xD;
      regimen will begin with IV delivery of AAV-hTERT, defined as &quot;Day 0.&quot; Safety and efficacy&#xD;
      analyses will be conducted at Weeks 1, 4, 13, 26, 39, and 52 post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: Safety and Tolerability&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Investigate the safety and tolerability of AAV-hTERT by intravenous (IV) administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: Provisional Efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine changes from baseline in hTERT expression, telomerase activity, and&#xD;
           telomere length in cells after treatment with AAV-hTERT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine changes from baseline in health and aging-related biomarkers after&#xD;
           treatment with AAV-hTERT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine changes from baseline in the immune system after treatment with AAV-hTERT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine changes from baseline in physical function measures after treatment with&#xD;
           AAV-hTERT&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must meet the following inclusion criteria at the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age of 45 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects, or their authorized representatives, must be adequately informed and&#xD;
             understand the nature and risks of the study and must be able to provide a signature&#xD;
             and date in the Informed Consent Form (ICF).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Women must undergo a negative serum pregnancy test at the screening assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects, or their representatives, must be able to communicate effectively with the&#xD;
             study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects, or their authorized representatives, must certify that they are able and&#xD;
             willing to follow all protocol requirements and study restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects are not eligible for the study if they meet any of the following criteria at the&#xD;
        screening visit, unless otherwise specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects who have a history of allergy, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to any&#xD;
