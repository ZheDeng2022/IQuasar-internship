  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a data collection study to compare diagnostic methods of a prototype of a home&#xD;
      monitoring device against laboratory testing in the hospital.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The device/monitoring system being developed measures the haemoglobin and haematocrit levels&#xD;
      in blood from a single drop of blood. By measuring these blood parameters, participants are&#xD;
      able to monitor their haemoglobin level at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of the device will take place in the participant's home to simulate what the&#xD;
      investigators believe will be the ideal location for people who would prefer to self-manage&#xD;
      their condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a data collection study to evaluate the performance of the prototype.&#xD;
