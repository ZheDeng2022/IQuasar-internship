    <textblock>
      Diabetic neuropathic pain is a common clinical manifestation of diabetic neuropathy, which&#xD;
      seriously affects the quality of life of patients. The clinical treatment is limited and the&#xD;
      curative effect is not good. In the previous animal studies, investigators found that the&#xD;
      change of pain threshold in diabetic rats showed a staged change, and was significantly&#xD;
      related to the change of brain microglia activity. It was confirmed that liraglutide could&#xD;
      regulate the activation of microglia in vitro. Then investigators found that it could&#xD;
      intervene diabetic neuropathic pain through the intervention of liraglutide in diabetic rats.&#xD;
      In the early stage of clinical observation, the investigators also preliminarily observed&#xD;
      that liraglutide can intervene diabetic neuropathic pain. At present, liraglutide is a&#xD;
      commonly used hypoglycemic drug in clinic. Therefore, on the basis of previous studies, this&#xD;
      study intends to select diabetic neuropathic pain patients whose blood sugar is not up to the&#xD;
      standard, and give Mecobalamin to treat diabetic neuropathy. In addition, on the basis of the&#xD;
      original hypoglycemic treatment, participants are randomly divided into one group to give&#xD;
      liraglutide, one group to increase or adjust insulin, with similar blood glucose level. The&#xD;
      improvement of diabetic neuropathic pain was observed. The aim of this study was to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of liraglutide in improving diabetic neuropathic pain.&#xD;

      1. Diabetic neuropathic pain seriously affects the quality of life, clinical problems are&#xD;
      difficult, and new treatment methods are urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic neuropathy is one of the most common complications of diabetes mellitus. The study&#xD;
      of investigators shows that the prevalence rate of diabetic neuropathy diagnosed in downtown&#xD;
      Shanghai is as high as 61.8%. The most common type of diabetic peripheral neuropathy is&#xD;
      distal symmetric polyneuropathy, which is the main cause of diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP).&#xD;
      Diabetic neuropathic pain can affect about one fifth of diabetic patients, which can lead to&#xD;
      the decrease of daily activities, even the loss of work, severe depression, and quality of&#xD;
      life. The pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathic pain is complex and not yet fully clear, so&#xD;
      there is a lack of available and effective treatment. At present, the first-line clinical&#xD;
      treatment drugs include pregabalin, duloxetine, amitriptyline, gabapentin and venlafaxine,&#xD;
      etc., and these drugs sometimes relieve the symptoms of diabetic neuropathic pain not&#xD;
      obvious, and have more side effects, which has become a difficult problem in clinical&#xD;
      treatment. Therefore, it is urgent to explore effective drugs for diabetic neuropathic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. The clinical observation and animal study of the investigators show that the GLP-1&#xD;
      receptor agonist (liraglutide) can improve diabetic neuropathic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diabetic neuropathic pain is related to brain microglia. In the animal model of diabetes&#xD;
           mellitus, investigators found the phenomenon of abnormal activation of microglia.&#xD;
           Previous studies showed that the abnormal activation of microglia at the level of spinal&#xD;
           cord was closely related to diabetic neuropathic pain, and microglia at the level of&#xD;
           spinal cord played an important role in the transmission of pain. As the center of pain&#xD;
           loop, the activity of microglia in cerebral cortex and thalamus is less related to&#xD;
           diabetic neuropathic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Therefore, investigators used STZ induced diabetic neuropathy model of SD rats. Before&#xD;
           STZ injection (0 week), at the 2nd, 4th, 6th and 12th week after STZ induced&#xD;
           hyperglycemia. The investigators monitored the changes of body weight, blood glucose&#xD;
           level and pain threshold of mechanical pain and thermal pain in rats. The investigators&#xD;
           used [18F] dpa714 specific marker transfer protein TSPO to carry out PET / CT scan of&#xD;
           brain to reflect microglia in each brain area. After PET / CT scan, EMG was used to&#xD;
           evaluate the degree of peripheral nerve injury. The results showed that after STZ&#xD;
           injection, compared with the control group, the blood glucose of STZ group increased&#xD;
           gradually, and with the increase of blood glucose, the nerve conduction velocity of&#xD;
           diabetic rats decreased gradually. Mechanical pain decreased significantly in 4-6 weeks,&#xD;
           thermal pain threshold decreased significantly in 4 weeks, and mechanical pain and&#xD;
           thermal pain sensitivity disappeared in 12 weeks. The results of PET / CT showed that in&#xD;
           cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus and pituitary, dpa714 standard uptake value&#xD;
           was significantly higher than other time points in the fourth week, and significantly&#xD;
           higher than that in the control group. The correlation analysis indicated that the pain&#xD;
           threshold of thermal pain was significantly related to the activity of microglia in&#xD;
           thalamus and hypothalamus. Previous studies have shown that hyperglycemia can induce&#xD;
           neuropathic pain. Thermal hyperalgesia occurs 4 weeks after hyperglycemia, while&#xD;
           mechanical hyperalgesia occurs 4-6 weeks. PET / CT study showed that the activity of&#xD;
           microglia in the brain of diabetic rats increased in the fourth week, and the activity&#xD;
           of microglia was significantly related to the occurrence of heat pain. It has not been&#xD;
           reported that the relationship between the activity of microglia and diabetic&#xD;
           neuropathic pain was directly observed by PET / CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Liraglutide can regulate the activation of microglia Glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1)&#xD;
           acts by binding to GLP-1 receptor, which is a G protein coupled receptor. A large number&#xD;
           of studies have shown that GLP-1 receptor agonists can improve the activation of&#xD;
           macrophages, microglia as macrophages in the brain, and GLP-1 receptor agonists can&#xD;
           improve the activation of macrophages. However, few studies have shown that in vitro&#xD;
           cultured astrocytes and microglia, GLP-1 analogues can change the morphology of glial&#xD;
           cells, reduce IL-1 β and increase cAMP level at mRNA level.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Therefore, liraglutide, the GLP-1 agonist, was selected as the intervention drug . BV2&#xD;
           microglia cell line was used as the following treatment methods: liraglutide was co&#xD;
           cultured with LPS or high glucose, and liraglutide was added after LPS and high glucose&#xD;
           induced activation. After treatment, the levels of IL-6 and TNF - α in the supernatant&#xD;
           of the cells were observed. The results showed that liraglutide was added in advance&#xD;
           before induction and activation. Or the level of IL-6 and TNF - α released by BV2 could&#xD;
           be significantly reduced by using liraglutide. Therefore, liraglutide can regulate LPS&#xD;
           and high glucose induced microglia activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Animal experiments show that liraglutide can improve diabetic neuropathic pain. On the&#xD;
           basis of previous work, the investigators further studied the effect of liraglutide on&#xD;
           diabetic neuropathic pain at the animal level. SD rats were divided into three groups:&#xD;
           normal blood glucose group, normal saline control group and 200ug / kg / dliraglutide&#xD;
           injection group. The latencies and thresholds of thermal and mechanical pain were&#xD;
           monitored weekly. It was observed that for diabetic neuropathic pain rats, the&#xD;
           peripheral injection of GLP-1 receptor agonist (liraglutide 200ug / kg / D)&#xD;
           significantly increased the thermal pain threshold at 4 weeks, the mechanical pain&#xD;
           threshold at 8 weeks, and the pain sensitivity disappeared at 12 weeks in both the&#xD;
           normal saline control group and the liraglutide injection group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Observation of clinical cases In clinical work, the investigators observed some obese&#xD;
           patients with neuropathic pain in type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the process of using&#xD;
           GLP-1 receptor agonist to control blood glucose, the symptoms of pain were also&#xD;
           significantly improved. In addition, a clinical study showed that the use of sitagliptin&#xD;
           (DPP-IV inhibitor, which can inhibit the degradation of GLP-1 in vivo) can also improve&#xD;
           diabetic neuropathic pain. However, these observations and studies have significant&#xD;
           limitations, not excluding the effect of blood glucose lowering itself in the population&#xD;
           level, nor exploring the mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. The clinical study of liraglutide in improving diabetic neuropathic pain has better&#xD;
      clinical value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators found that liraglutide can improve the activation of microglia, and it can&#xD;
      significantly alleviate diabetic neuropathic pain at the animal level and clinical cases. The&#xD;
      systematic study of liraglutide used to improve neuropathic pain in diabetic patients has not&#xD;
      been reported, and this subject has better clinical value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, considering the hypoglycemic effect of liraglutide on the basis of previous&#xD;
      studies, the investigators plan to select diabetic neuropathic pain patients whose blood&#xD;
      sugar is not up to standard in this study, and give Mecobalamin (one of the commonly used&#xD;
      drugs recommended in the guidelines for prevention and treatment of diabetes mellitus to&#xD;
      treat neuropathy). At the same time, on the basis of the original hypoglycemic treatment,&#xD;
      participants were randomly divided into one group to be given liraglutide and the other group&#xD;
      to be increased/adjusted insulin. After 3 months, the improvement of diabetic neuropathic&#xD;
      pain in the two groups under the condition of similar blood glucose level were observed. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of liraglutide in improving&#xD;
      diabetic neuropathic pain.&#xD;
