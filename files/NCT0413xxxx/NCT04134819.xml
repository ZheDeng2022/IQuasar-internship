    <textblock>
      General adult healthy pregnant females in total 400, as well as their infants will be&#xD;
      recruited. It is expected 67% will be vaginally delivered and 33% will be C Section&#xD;
      deliveries. It is expected that of these groups that 40% of these women will be treated with&#xD;
      antibiotics during their pregnancy. All C Section women (including emergency C Section) will&#xD;
      be treated with IV Cefazolin at the time of incision, in theatre, to prevent internal wound&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective The effect of maternal antibiotic administration during pregnancy upon the&#xD;
      development of the intestinal microbiota until the age of two years; of C-section delivered&#xD;
      infants compared to C-section delivered infants born to non-antibiotic treated pregnant&#xD;
      women. To develop a cohort of vaginally delivered infants to isolate the 'missing microbes'&#xD;
      (intestinal) in the groups above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of maternal antibiotics on the developing infant by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometric assessment: Body weight and Body length&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bayley scale of infant development test at age 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ancillary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To isolate and characterise bacterial strains from fresh healthy infant faeces that are&#xD;
           altered in the stools from C-section delivered and antibiotic treated infants and&#xD;
           compared to vaginally delivered infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effect of maternal antibiotic treatment on the human milk microbiome during&#xD;
           lactation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stress hormone levels of mothers and infants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mental health questionnaire of mothers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Food frequency questionnaire of mothers Exploratory&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify bacterial strains that can be further developed into probiotic products to&#xD;
           help replenish depleted microbiota in the infant gut, born by C Section and or treated&#xD;
           with antibiotics&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intestinal microbiota in early life plays a major role in infant health and development,&#xD;
      impacting on maturation of the immune system, protection against pathogens, and influencing&#xD;
      the long-term metabolic welfare of the host. The acquisition of microbial strains from mother&#xD;
      to infant may occur through multiple different pathways, including the birth canal (and the&#xD;
      proximity of the birth canal to the anus), contact between mothers and infant during parental&#xD;
      care and through breast milk. From birth through to the initial stages of weaning, microbial&#xD;
      composition has a significant impact on the infant gut. Recent advances in&#xD;
      culture-independent sequencing technologies has allowed for the identification of key&#xD;
      microbial species involved in the initial colonization process, including those facultative&#xD;
      anaerobes such as Streptococcus, Staphylococcus and Enterobacter spp (Hill et al., 2017).&#xD;
      Thus, the microbiome of vaginally born, exclusively breast fed infants at term, with no&#xD;
      previous exposure to antibiotics either directly or indirectly from the mother, could be&#xD;
      considered the &quot;gold standard&quot;. Breast milk, a natural prebiotic source provides the optimal&#xD;
      active ingredients for the growth of beneficial microbial species. A disturbance in the&#xD;
      balance of microbial inhabitants can affect human host biology in many ways. Immune,&#xD;
      endocrine, cognitive, as well as metabolic functions can be influenced by the microbial&#xD;
      communities present; subsequently implicating future health outcomes such as insulin&#xD;
      resistance, allergic diseases, depression and perhaps even autism. Beneficial microbial&#xD;
      species and its associated bioactive compounds, which may restore overall gut health are thus&#xD;
      of interest for infant nutrition, which when administered, may help treat or prevent a&#xD;
      microbial disturbance in the gastrointestinal environment and have long term health benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gut microbiota appears to influence the development of emotional behaviour, stress- and&#xD;
      pain-modulation systems, and brain neurotransmitter systems. Additionally, microbiota&#xD;
      perturbations by probiotics and antibiotics exert modulatory effects on some of these&#xD;
      measures have been seen in adult animal models. Current evidence suggests that multiple&#xD;
      mechanisms, including endocrine and neurocrine pathways, may be involved in gut&#xD;
      microbiota-to-brain signalling and that the brain can in turn alter microbial composition and&#xD;
      behaviour via the autonomic nervous system. Therefore, another aspect of the work will&#xD;
      involve studies addressing microbe to brain signalling to identify and develop commensal&#xD;
      probiotic consortium (mixed strains and possibly mixed strains/ingredient mixes) products&#xD;
      underpinned by the necessary science suitable for development of probiotics targeted at the&#xD;
      microbiota-gut-brain axis, a bidirectional communication between the gastrointestinal system&#xD;
      and the brain, which regulates brain function and plays a crucial role in mood control (Dinan&#xD;
      et al., 2013). It is well established that probiotic intervention, at least in mice, can&#xD;
      improve mood and reduce anxiety in various models of stress (Bravo et al., 2011; Desbonnet et&#xD;
      al., 2008; Desbonnet et al., 2010). Despite confounding evidence, the mood enhancing impact&#xD;
      of probiotic intervention observed in murine studies are not always translated in humans&#xD;
      (Kelly et al., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Babies born by C-section get the greatest benefit from breastfeeding, and often these mothers&#xD;
      are taking antibiotics for 1-2 weeks post-delivery Antibiotics are administered at time of&#xD;
      incision (for both elective and emergency sections) to prevent internal wound infection.&#xD;
      While human milk itself could be a source of bacteria for the developing infant, thereby&#xD;
      influencing microbial intestinal colonization following birth, many questions remain about&#xD;
      the impact of nutrition during pregnancy and lactation, source of the 'milk microbiome' and&#xD;
      its impact on the establishment of the infant gut microbiota. A limited number of studies&#xD;
      have examined the microbial communities present within breast milk and tracked alterations in&#xD;
      microbial diversity throughout the lactation period. However, in a recent study, the&#xD;
      investigator's group reported the presence of a core breast milk microbiome using Illumina&#xD;
      MiSeq sequencing to detect 12 dominant genera in lactating mothers (n=10), constituting 81%&#xD;
      of the taxa present over the first 6 weeks of life (Murphy et al., 2017). A number of&#xD;
      frequently shared taxa, including Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus and&#xD;
      Enterococcus were common in both breast milk and infant faeces during the first 3 months of&#xD;
      life, and culture-dependent analysis identified identical strains of Bifidobacterium breve&#xD;
      and Lactobacillus plantarum present in both breast milk and infant faeces, confirming the&#xD;
      concept of maternal-infant transmission (Murphy et al., 2017). Similar findings have been&#xD;
      reported using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and/or multi-locus sequence typing&#xD;
      (MLST) to identify identical genomic patterns of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus present in&#xD;
      breast milk and corresponding infant faeces (Solís et al., 2010) (Martin et al., 2006)&#xD;
      (Martín et al.) (Makino et al., 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotic treatment throughout pregnancy accounts for 80% of prescribed medications during&#xD;
      pregnancy (Kuperman and Koren, 2016). The Mayo Clinic describes amoxicillin, ampicillin,&#xD;
      clindamycin, erythromycin, penicillin and nitrofurantoin as being generally considered safe&#xD;
      during pregnancy. Tetracyclines can damage a woman's liver during pregnancy, and trimethoprim&#xD;
      + sulfamethoxazole (commonly used together to treat UTIs) may be linked with an increased&#xD;
      risk of birth defects. Considering that it is now accepted that optimal establishment of the&#xD;
      gut microbiota is highly desirable for normal human development, the risk is that antibiotic&#xD;
      usage during pregnancy may have undesirable effects on the maternal vaginal and milk&#xD;
      microbiome, with knock-on negative impact on the early infant microbiome. It is estimated&#xD;
      that one in five pregnant women in Europe is prescribed at least one course of antibiotics&#xD;
      during pregnancy; in the United States, this rate is double (Roberts et al., 2012). In the&#xD;
      case of proven maternal infection, narrow spectrum antibiotics should be preferred due to&#xD;
      their less extensive effects on the microbiome, taking into account the association of&#xD;
      prenatal antibiotics with increased risk of childhood atopic disease, epilepsy, and obesity&#xD;
      (Kuperman and Koren, 2016).&#xD;
