    <textblock>
      This research study is studying an immunotherapy drug (pembrolizumab or KEYTRUDA) as a&#xD;
      possible treatment for pediatric hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatocellular neoplasm not&#xD;
      otherwise specified (HCN NOS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Patients who fulfill eligibility criteria will be entered into the trial to receive&#xD;
      pembrolizumab or KEYTRUDA&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied. In the case of this&#xD;
      trial, the investigators are studying whether pembrolizumab can treat pediatric&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved pembrolizumab for your&#xD;
      specific disease but it has been approved for other uses in adults. Checkpoint inhibitors are&#xD;
      in early-phase study in pediatric patients across diagnoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators plan to investigate whether pediatric patients with&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma experience stable disease or response to pembrolizumab. In addition,&#xD;
      the investigators would like to explore different biological factors of the tumor and immune&#xD;
      system that might help us predict whether pediatric patients with HCC may benefit from&#xD;
      treatment with pembrolizumab.&#xD;

             this sample, in addition to a diagnostic sample should be submitted. If no&#xD;
             re-operation was performed, archived tissue from diagnosis or the most recent&#xD;
             procedure should be submitted (see section 9 for further details regarding tissue&#xD;
             specifications).&#xD;
&#xD;
