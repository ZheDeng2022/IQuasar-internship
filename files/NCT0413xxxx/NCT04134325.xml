    <textblock>
      LCCC1852-ATL is a prospective pilot study designed to determine if chimeric antigen receptor&#xD;
      T (CAR-T) cells result in immunomodulation which can be subsequently exploited by programmed&#xD;
      cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibodies to achieve clinical responses in subjects with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory (r/r) classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators will enroll 10 subjects with relapsed/refractory cHL who have&#xD;
      previously been treated with anti-PD-1 therapy, have received a CD30 CAR-T cell therapy and&#xD;
      have evidence of progression. Subjects will be offered anti-PD-1 therapy (nivolumab or&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, at the discretion of treating oncologist), as per standard of care in r/r HL.&#xD;
      Peripheral blood samples will be collected from subjects after consent has been obtained at&#xD;
      the time of progression following CD30 CAR-T cell therapy as well as at Day 21 and Day 42 of&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 therapy. Investigators will also have access to peripheral blood samples prior to&#xD;
      CD30 CAR-T cell therapy, acquired during a prior clinical study. Peripheral blood samples&#xD;
      will be immunophenotyped by mass cytometry and T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing will be&#xD;
      pursued to establish expansion of clinically relevant T-cell clones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to estimate the objective response rate (ORR) of&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 therapy after progression on CD30 CAR-T cell therapy in r/r cHL. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives will be to measure the change in T-cell receptor clonality during treatment with&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 therapy after progression after CD30 CAR-T therapy, the change in peripheral blood&#xD;
      immunophenotype during treatment with anti-PD-1 therapy after progression on CD30 CAR-T cell&#xD;
      therapy and progression free survival (PFS) of anti-PD-1 therapy after progression on CD30&#xD;
      CAR-T cell therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data from subjects treated with anti-PD-1 therapy after progression following&#xD;
      CD30 CAR-T cell therapy has suggested surprisingly robust clinical responses to anti-PD-1&#xD;
      therapy. Therefore, this pilot study is an important advancement in our understanding of both&#xD;
      immunomodulation after CD30 CAR-T cell therapy as well as clinical response to anti-PD-1&#xD;
      therapy. This study will serve as a baseline for clinical response and immunomodulation for&#xD;
      future clinical trials evaluating the combination of anti-PD-1 therapy and CD30 CAR-T cell&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
