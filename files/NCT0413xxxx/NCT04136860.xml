  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are complex and rare cerebral vascular dysplasia. The main&#xD;
      purpose of treatment is to avoid the neurological impairment caused by hemorrhagic stroke.&#xD;
      The Spetzler-Martin (SM) grading system is widely used to estimate the risk of postoperative&#xD;
      complication based on maximum AVM nidus diameter, pattern of venous drainage, and eloquence&#xD;
      of location. Generally, grade I and II are amenable to surgical resection alone. Grade III is&#xD;
      typically treated via a multimodal approach, including microsurgical resection, embolization,&#xD;
      and radiosurgery (SRS). Grade IV and V are generally observed unless ruptured. However, some&#xD;
      previous studies indicated that despite the high rate of poor outcomes for high-level&#xD;
      unruptured AVMs, the mortality for high-level unruptured AVMs are likely lower than untreated&#xD;
      patients. With the development of new embolic materials and new intervention strategies,&#xD;
      patients with high-level AVMs may have more opportunities to underwent more aggressive&#xD;
      interventions. The OHAVM study aims to clarify the clinical outcomes for patients with SM&#xD;
      grade IV and V AVMs after different management strategies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Follow-up: In our neurosurgical center, follow-up was conducted for all patients at the first&#xD;
      3-6 months and annually after discharge by clinical visit and telephone interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study overview: The population in the OHAVM study will be divided into two parts. Clinical&#xD;
      and imaging data of high-level AVM patients from 2012/04 to 2019/09 were retrospectively&#xD;
      collected. And the high-level AVM patients from 2019/09 to 2019/12 were prospectively&#xD;
      collected. The intervention strategies in our institution for high-level AVMs are of four&#xD;
      categories: microsurgical resection, embolization, embolization+radiosurgery, and&#xD;
      single-stage hybrid surgery (embolization-resection). Each participants will be followed at&#xD;
      least for 5 year since enrollment. Finally, we will clarify the clinical outcomes and&#xD;
      prognostic predictors for patients with SM grade IV and V AVMs after different management&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: About 1000 patients will be enrolled in this study, and half of them were&#xD;
      unruptured. The population distribution of different management strategies is expected as&#xD;
      follows: conservative:100 cases, microsurgical resection: 300 cases, embolization:250 cases,&#xD;
      embolization+radiosurgery: 250 cases, single-stage hybrid surgery: 100 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study endpoints: The neurological function prognosis, occlusion rate and complications were&#xD;
      evaluated at 2 weeks, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years after the treatment and the last follow-up,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;

    <description>Embolization or radiosurgery was recommended as a priority for lesions located in deep functional locations such as brainstem and basal ganglia. Radiosurgery management was recommended for the residual lesions about 3 months after the embolization if necessary.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Single-stage hybrid surgery</arm_group_label>
    <description>Hybrid surgery is a new surgical strategy defined as single-stage combined microsurgical resection and embolization in which embolization is performed firstly on the deep feeding artery, aneurysm, AVF, and meningeal arteries involved in blood supply of the nidus, and then, the microsurgical resection was performed immediately. Intraoperative angiography was performed repeatedly before the skull was closed, confirming complete occlusion of the malformation.</description>
