      Effects of different exercise strategies on stroke patients remain unclear. Randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial with concealed allocation has been performed from August 1, 2016 to June 30,&#xD;
      2018. We traced back 23 stroke patients, recruited during the above period, aged about 55&#xD;
      years with stroke duration &gt; 24 months . Intervention: 13 of them underwent 36 times of&#xD;
      moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) at 60% of peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) for&#xD;
      30 mins, and 10 had high-intensity interval training (HIIT) at alternative 80% and 40%&#xD;
      VO2peak with the same training times and duration. Outcome measures: VO2peak, cardiac output&#xD;
      (CO), bilateral frontal cortex blood volume (∆[THb]), oxyhemoglobin (∆[O2Hb]) and&#xD;
      deoxyhemoglobin (∆[HHb]), ventilation efficiency, serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor&#xD;
      (BDNF) levels, cognitive and life quality questionnaire, percentage of neuroblastic cell&#xD;
      bearing neurites (% neurites), and cell fluorescent staining were examined before and after&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;

      Design The Institutional Review Board of a tertiary care hospital approved the study (IRB No.&#xD;
      201600576A3). A randomized controlled trial was performed in stroke patients with different&#xD;
      exercise regimens and was blind to the assessors. The study was conducted from August 2016 to&#xD;
      June 2018. Participants were randomly allocated to the MICT or HIIT groups using a&#xD;
      computer-generated, concealed allocation schedule. All included stroke patients received&#xD;
      traditional rehabilitation programs, including balance, range of motion, or therapeutic&#xD;
      exercise, and additional in-hospital supervised 30 min of MICT or HIIT for 36 times. Data&#xD;
      were collected by a blinded assessor prior to randomization after completing the exercise&#xD;
      trainings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Stroke patients, diagnosed by the neurologist, were surveyed. The inclusion&#xD;
      criteria were listed as follows: (I) ≥ 20 years old; (II) stroke events with stable clinical&#xD;
      status ≥ 3 months; (III) mini-mental state examination (MMSE)&gt; 24; (IV) no acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome. Those who had unstable angina, systolic blood pressure&gt; 200 mmHg or diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure&gt; 110 mm Hg, symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, severe aortic stenosis (peak&#xD;
      systolic pressure gradient&gt; 50 mmHg, or an aortic valve opening area&lt; 0.75 cm2), inflammatory&#xD;
      disease within recent 3 months, uncontrolled cardiac dysrhythmias, uncompensated HF, third&#xD;
      degree atrioventricular block, pericarditis or myocarditis within recent 3 months, embolic&#xD;
      disease within recent 3 months, ST segment displacement≥ 2 mm at rest, and uncontrolled&#xD;
      diabetes (blood glucose≥ 300 mg/dL or ≥ 250 mg/dL with ketone bodies) were not candidates of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke patients had absolute contraindications for cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) and&#xD;
      aerobic activities, suggested by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), were also&#xD;
      excluded in the study. Afterwards, eligible participants were randomly assigned to the MICT&#xD;
      and HIIT groups. Baseline demographic characteristics were also recorded. All subjects&#xD;
      provided informed consent after the experimental procedures were explained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) Participants underwent an incremental exercise test on a&#xD;
      bicycle ergometer (Ergoselect 150P, ergoline GmbH, Bitz, Germany) and the examination was&#xD;
      performed at a work-rate of 10 W/min with continuous monitoring heart rate, brachial blood&#xD;
      pressure, and arterial oxygen saturation, until the stop conditions described previously.&#xD;
      Oxygen consumption (VO2) was measured by a cardiopulmonary measurement device (MasterScreen&#xD;
      CPX, CareFusion Corp., Hoechberg, Germany). The VO2peak, minute ventilation (VE), and carbon&#xD;
      dioxide production (VCO2) were defined as the guideline for exercise testing suggested by the&#xD;
      ACSM. VE and VCO2 responses, acquired from the initiation of exercise to the peak values,&#xD;
      were used to calculate the VE-VCO2 slope using the least-square linear regression. The O2&#xD;
      uptake efﬁciency slope (OUES), an estimation of the O2 consumption efficiency during&#xD;
      exercise, was derived from the slope of a natural logarithm plot of VE vs. VO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac hemodynamic measurements Noninvasive continuous cardiac output monitoring system&#xD;
      (NICOM, Cheetah Medical, Wilmington, Delaware) was used to evaluate cardiac hemodynamic&#xD;
      response to exercise, which analyzes the phase shift (ΔΦ) created by alternating electrical&#xD;
      current across the chest of the subject as described in our previous study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral hemodynamic measurements Two pairs of near infra-red spectroscopy (NIRS) probes&#xD;
      (Oxymon, Artinis, The Netherland) were attached to bilateral frontal areas of each included&#xD;
      subject during CPET. The Beer-Lambert law was applied to measure light absorption across each&#xD;
      pair of NIRS detectors reflecting changes of oxyhemoglobin ([O2Hb]) and deoxyhemoglobin&#xD;
      ([HHb]) in the frontal cortex during exercise. Total Hb amount ([THb]) was calculated as the&#xD;
      sum of [O2Hb] and [HHb], and was used as an index of change in blood volume in the frontal&#xD;
      cortex. Differences of the tissue oxygenation (Δ[O2Hb] and Δ[HHb]) and regional blood flow&#xD;
      (Δ[THb]) between involved and uninvolved frontal cortices (involved-uninvolved) were used to&#xD;
      estimate effects of different exercise regimens on brain tissue oxygenation and regional&#xD;
      blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health-related QoL QoL was measured by the Short Form-36 Health Survey questionnaire (SF-36),&#xD;
      and mini-mental status examination (MMSE) was used to assess QoL and cognitive functions of&#xD;
      the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise training protocols The included subjects underwent 36 times of supervised&#xD;
      hospital-based training (2-3 session/week) on a bicycle ergometer (Ergoselect 150P, Germany)&#xD;
      as our previous protocol.15 The training comprised a warm-up at 30% of VO2peak for 3 min,&#xD;
      followed by a MICT (60% of VO2peak) or HIIT (five 3-min intervals at 80% of VO2peak and each&#xD;
      interval separated by 3-min exercise at 40% of VO2peak) for 30 min, and then a cool-down at&#xD;
      30% of VO2peak for 3 min. The training was terminated when the subject had symptoms/signs&#xD;
      suggested by the ACSM guideline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum preparation An amount of 20 ml fresh blood was collected from all our subjects before&#xD;
      and after exercise training. Samples were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 5 min at room&#xD;
      temperature, and the upper serum was preserved for cell culture and measurement of serum BDNF&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of serum BDNF BDNF levels were assessed before and after aerobic exercise&#xD;
      trainings. Prepared serum of 100 µL was added in each well coated with the human BDNF capture&#xD;
      antibody in a solid-phase sandwich, two-site enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA) kit (BioVision&#xD;
      Inc., Milpitas, CA). The BDNF level was then determined by the microplate reader (SpectraMax&#xD;
      M3, Molecular Devices LLC, San Jose, CA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell culture and neurite growth assay Rat neuroblastic cells (PC-12 cell line) were grown in&#xD;
      Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 7.5% patient serum (before and&#xD;
      after exercise training), 7.5% horse serum (HS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/L&#xD;
      streptomycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 100000 cells were plated overnight on 35-mm dishes coated with poly- DL-lysine.&#xD;
      After serum starvation in DMEM containing 2% HS for 12-18 h, cells were treated with 50 ng/ml&#xD;
      NGF for the indicated time. Morphological changes were observed using the Leica TCS SP8&#xD;
      confocal microscopy 7 days after cultured with patient sera before and after exercise&#xD;
      training. Percentage of cells with neurites of at least one cell body diameter in length was&#xD;
      determined in five independent fields of every plate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluorescent stains Cells (100000) were inoculated in each well of the eight-chamber slide&#xD;
      (Millicell EZ slide, Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA) and were incubated at the pre- and&#xD;
      post-MICT or HIIT sera for 12h. Vivid staining of Mitotracker (Invitrogen corp., Carlsbad,&#xD;
      CA) was used to observe mitochondria in neuroblastic cells treated with sera from the above&#xD;
      different status. The cells were stained with primary rabbit monoclonal anti-⍺-tubulin&#xD;
      antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Boston, MA). Fluorescein&#xD;
      isothiocyanate-conjugated AffiniPure Goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch&#xD;
      Laboratories, West Grove, PA) was used as the secondary antibody. Nuclei were counterstained&#xD;
      with mounting medium (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) containing&#xD;
      40,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The stained cells were examined with a confocal microscopic&#xD;
      examination (Leica TCS SP8, Leica Microsystems Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Chi-square test was conducted to compare differences of non-parametric&#xD;
      parameters between the two groups. Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess differences of age,&#xD;
      stroke duration, body mass index (BMI), changes of exercise capacity, changes of brain&#xD;
      oxygenation as well as regional blood volume, changes of BDNF levels, and changes of cell&#xD;
      behaviors between the two groups. Differences of within group changes in numerical data was&#xD;
      assessed by Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-rank test. Relationships between changes of measured&#xD;
      clinical parameters after the exercise training and clinical information were analyzed by&#xD;
      Pearson correlation. A p value &lt; 0.05 was considered as statistical significance.&#xD;
