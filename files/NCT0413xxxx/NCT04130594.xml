  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was identified in 2012 during the&#xD;
      first Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak. MERS-CoV causes an acute&#xD;
      lower-respiratory infection in humans, with a fatality rate of ~34.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of adenoviral-based vaccine&#xD;
      against MERS - BVRS-GamVac.&#xD;

      Two-stage, open-dose, prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in&#xD;
      parallel groups The study will include volunteers of both sexes, aged 18-55 years inclusive.&#xD;
      The study will involve 162 (will receive the study drug or placebo) healthy volunteers, of&#xD;
      which the first stage, it is planned to vaccinate 40 person with the studied drug (at the&#xD;
      same time, the participation of 8 spares *), at the second phase - 122 people, of whom 88&#xD;
      will receive the study drug, and 34 will make up the control group of observation - they will&#xD;
      be given a placebo drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Volunteers are replaced by spares before the introduction of the drug, if the volunteer&#xD;
      took the drug, then its replacement is not performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any volunteer who received a dose of the test drug will be considered as included in the&#xD;
      study, the data available on it will be used in assessing the safety and tolerability of the&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;
