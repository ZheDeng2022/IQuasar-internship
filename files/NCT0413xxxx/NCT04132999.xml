  <brief_summary>

      Determine the efficacy of family-informed intervention (INT) vs standard clinical care over a&#xD;
      period of twelve months in children with obstructive sleep apnea and Down Syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evaluate the effect of PAP adherence on quality of life, neurobehavioral, and healthcare&#xD;
      utilization in children with DS and OSAS. It is being hypothesized that, irrespective of&#xD;
      study arm, increased PAP adherence will be associated with better quality of life,&#xD;
      neurobehavioral, and healthcare utilization outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the effect of PAP adherence in children with DS and OSAS on patient-centered&#xD;
      outcomes and family-relevant outcomes identified during the R61 phase of this research. It is&#xD;
      being hypothesized that irrespective of study arm, increased PAP adherence will be associated&#xD;
      with better patient-centered outcomes, and family-relevant outcomes identified during the&#xD;
      first year of this research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the efficacy of INT vs. CON in promoting PAP adherence. It is being hypothesized&#xD;
      that that children receiving INT will show significantly increased objectively-measured PAP&#xD;
      adherence at 6 months compared with those receiving CON (Aim 4A). As a secondary aim (4B), it&#xD;
      will be evaluated whether the improved adherence is maintained over 12 months. It is being&#xD;
      hypothesized that participants initially randomized to the INT arm will have better adherence&#xD;
      at 12 months compared to those in the CON arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use mixed methods during the randomized controlled trial to identify family perceptions, such&#xD;
      as empowerment and self-efficacy, regarding PAP use in youth with OSAS and DS. It is being&#xD;
      hypothesized that INT-PAP will be associated with more positive perceptions compared to CON.&#xD;
