  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators aimed to have pregnant women use a hand-held device to track&#xD;
      increases in daily caloric needs during pregnancy. Weight gain was assessed over time with&#xD;
      the goal of reducing excessive gestational weight gain relative to a group of pregnant women&#xD;
      who received standard prenatal care.&#xD;

      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators pursued the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the impact of a mobile, real-time metabolism tracking device on gestational&#xD;
           weight gain (GWG) (i.e. total weight gain and rate of weight gain) in pregnant women.&#xD;
           The investigators postulated that the metabolism tracking (Breezing) group would have a&#xD;
           higher proportion of women who gain the appropriate amount of weight per IOM&#xD;
           recommendations. Further, the investigators expected the women in the Breezing group to&#xD;
           gain a mean weight within +/- 3 lbs of their recommended GWG range per IOM guidelines,&#xD;
           compared to standard care-receiving controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess changes in resting energy expenditure during pregnancy in relation to&#xD;
           self-reported dietary intake (at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks). The&#xD;
           investigators hypothesized that energy requirements would change across the second&#xD;
           trimester and that self-reported caloric intakes would correlate with resting energy&#xD;
           expenditure (REE)-corrected values (from Breezing) for women in the Breezing group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Evaluate the associations among objective and self-reported sleep parameters (actigraphic&#xD;
      total sleep time, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, and mid-sleep point; sleep&#xD;
      diary total sleep time, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, and mid-sleep point;&#xD;
      insomnia symptoms; and sleep disordered breathing risk) and GWG within the Breezing and&#xD;
      control groups.&#xD;
