  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to compare the effectiveness of maintenance therapy initiation with&#xD;
      the combination treatment Tiotropium and Olodaterol (Olo+Tio) compared with LABA/ICS&#xD;
      combination in COPD as the time to the first COPD exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to compare patients treated with Tio+Olo and patients treated with&#xD;
      LABA/ ICS combination.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. At least one prescription for Tio+Olo combined inhaler or a LABA/ICS combined inhaler&#xD;
             between 1 January 2013 and 31 March 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. The first dispensing of either Tio+Olo or LABA/ICS combined inhaler will be&#xD;
                  defined as the index date.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. For the main analyses, only fixed dose combination (FDC) inhalers will be&#xD;
                  included. Sensitivity analyses will also accept free combinations of LABA/ICS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. At least one diagnosis of COPD at any time prior to the index date.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. At least one year of continuous medical and pharmacy health plan eligibility prior to&#xD;
             the index date will be required to allow a baseline period for the covariates and&#xD;
             identification of new use of the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. To increase the likelihood of a true diagnosis of COPD, we will exclude:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. All patients less than 40 years of age on the index date, and&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. All patients with a diagnosis of asthma in the year prior to the index date&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. To limit the population to those without severe lung compromise outside of COPD, we&#xD;
             will exclude individuals with lung cancer, interstitial lung disease, or lung&#xD;
             transplant identified at any time prior to the index date&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. To restrict the cohort to new users of Tio+Olo or LABA/ICS, we will exclude any&#xD;
             individual with use of either Tio+Olo, LABA/ICS, or LABA/LAMA/ICS combination therapy&#xD;
             in free or fixed form for at least one year prior to the index date.&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>In this cohort study, administrative data from the HealthCore Integrated Research Database (US, HIRD, Jan 2013 - March 2019) were used to identify and compare new users of Tio+Olo (Tiotropium and Olodaterol) with new users of LABA/ICS (Long-acting Beta2-Agonists/Inhaled Corticosteroids) combination therapy with respect to safety and effectiveness.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Only subjects that met all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria were included. two cohorts (Initiators of Tiotropium + Olodaterol and patients receiving Long-acting beta agonist / inhaled corticosteroid) were established.

        <description>Incidence rate of any element of a composite outcome including exacerbation, hospitalization for pneumonia, or escalation (original case definition) to triple therapy.&#xD;
Exacerbation was defined as follows: Severe exacerbation: Hospitalization with a principal discharge diagnosis of COPD. Moderate exacerbation: An emergency department (ED) visit with a discharge diagnosis of COPD, or, an antibiotic for a respiratory condition dispensed the same day as an oral corticosteroid.&#xD;
Pneumonia was defined using ICD-9-CM diagnoses and ICD-10 diagnosis codes. Escalation was defined as the addition of Inhaled Corticosteroids to Tiotropium and Olodaterol or a Long-acting Muscarinic Antagonists to long-acting beta agonist / inhaled corticosteroid therapy.</description>
