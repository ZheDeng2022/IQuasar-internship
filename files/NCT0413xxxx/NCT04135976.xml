  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary care physiotherapy units of the Spanish health service in Castille and Leon&#xD;
      (SACYL) are responsible for providing physiotherapy treatments to the general population.&#xD;
      Being part of the primary health care system, the actions of these units are aimed at the&#xD;
      treatment of common conditions that do not involve severity, frequently musculoskeletal&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The work of physiotherapists is closely related to the functionality of patients and, in this&#xD;
      sense, the World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed the International Classification of&#xD;
      Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) as a conceptual framework to characterize the&#xD;
      functional status of individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of ICF in the clinical setting is not sufficiently widespread due to the the&#xD;
      difficulties that the use of such an exhaustive classification implies in practice. In an&#xD;
      attempt to address this problem, the WHO has encouraged the development of reduced versions&#xD;
      aimed at responding to specific conditions or care contexts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The idea behind the development of core sets is that it is possible to select a number of&#xD;
      categories so as to capture the essence of a given clinical process, allowing an agile use of&#xD;
      the ICF. However, in order to put these core sets into practice, it is necessary to check&#xD;
      that the selected categories are valid from the perspective of the participants in the&#xD;
      clinical processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research project is to determine whether the musculoskeletal core sets of&#xD;
      the ICF are applicable in SACYL primary care physiotherapy units. This implies knowing if the&#xD;
      categories already selected in these sets are representative of the health aspects considered&#xD;
      as most relevant in the clinical context of physiotherapy in primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this, four studies will be conducted to capture the perspective of patients,&#xD;
      physiotherapists, researchers and clinical practice. This information will be translated into&#xD;
      the language of the ICF to obtain comparable categories with those present in the core sets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this way, this research project will make possible to validate or adapt the core sets of&#xD;
      the ICF for musculoskeletal conditions, in a specific clinical context of physiotherapy in&#xD;
      primary care.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary studies will attempt to capture the perspectives of all agents involved in the&#xD;
      SACYL primary care physiotherapy clinical processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The perspective of the patients will be collected by means of a qualitative study through&#xD;
      focal groups of people who have been attended in physiotherapy units in primary care. Each&#xD;
      focus group will be made up of five patients who will be provided with information about the&#xD;
      ICF and will be encouraged to express themselves on the aspects that they consider most&#xD;
      relevant when they are attended in primary care physiotherapy units. The duration of these&#xD;
      focus groups will be 30 minutes and as many groups as necessary will be conducted to reach&#xD;
      100% saturation. The information obtained will be translated into second level categories of&#xD;
      the ICF, so that it can be compared with those present in the already existing core sets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The perspective of the physiotherapists will be gathered through a Delphi study.&#xD;
      Physiotherapists with experience in the care context under study will be selected and the&#xD;
      information will be collected through online surveys. Three rounds will be carried out,&#xD;
      translating the information obtained into second level categories of the ICF, and providing&#xD;
      feedback in each round to the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research perspective will be studied through a systematic review of the scientific&#xD;
      literature. To this end, the main databases will be scrutinized and studies that investigate&#xD;
      musculoskeletal conditions will be selected in a context compatible with that of&#xD;
      physiotherapy in primary care. The data will be obtained through the outcome measures used in&#xD;
      these studies, including those with an agreement level equal to or greater than 5%. This&#xD;
      information will be translated into second level categories of the ICF, allowing us to know&#xD;
      which of them are more relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical point of view will be captured in a transversal study in which a sample of&#xD;
      patients receiving physiotherapy services in primary care will be taken. These patients must&#xD;
      make an assessment of the categories present in the ICF checklist. This list will be&#xD;
      complemented with the categories of the core sets for musculoskeletal conditions and with&#xD;
      those detected in the previous studies. The participants will assign a qualifier to each&#xD;
      category, depending on the importance they attach to it. In this study, patients will also be&#xD;
      assessed using a generic test that measures the degree of functionality. Aspects such as the&#xD;
      presence of cognitive deficit, depression and quality of life will also be considered. The&#xD;
      measurement instruments will be selected from the results obtained in the bibliographic&#xD;
      review described above. The number of patients required is estimated at 50 individuals&#xD;
      belonging to different basic health areas. The data obtained will be analysed and translated&#xD;
      into the language of the ICF (second level categories).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The categories derived from the set of previous studies will be compared with those present&#xD;
      in the core sets of the ICF for musculoskeletal conditions. Three types of results are&#xD;
      expected to be obtained: categories coincident in both groups of data, categories detected in&#xD;
      the studies carried out but absent in the core sets; and categories not detected but present&#xD;
      in the core sets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this way, it will be possible to determine the best way to establish the use of the ICF in&#xD;
      the primary care physiotherapy units of SACYL.&#xD;
