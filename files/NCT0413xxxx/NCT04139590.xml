  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large number of patients experience significant pain after surgery, and more patients&#xD;
      report pain after discharge from hospital than before. This issue has been observed in&#xD;
      patients who receive peripheral nerve blocks, the effects of which often wear off after&#xD;
      discharge. There are numerous barriers to the effective control of pain away from the direct&#xD;
      supervision of medical professionals, and personalized management strategies are necessary in&#xD;
      order to overcome these barriers. The first step of adequate pain management is accurate pain&#xD;
      assessment. Therefore, this study aims to validate a smartphone-based pain assessment tool&#xD;
      that patients can access at home.&#xD;

      1. Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The purpose of this study is to establish whether the Panda versions of the 100mm VAS&#xD;
           (Visual Analogue Scale) and NRS-11 (Numeric Rating Scale) agree adequately with and can&#xD;
           therefore be used in lieu of already validated paper versions of these scales for the&#xD;
           evaluation of post-operative pain in adults. The Panda versions of the pain assessment&#xD;
           scales have been condensed in size onto an iPod Touch screen but otherwise appear the&#xD;
           same as traditional paper versions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           There are no significant differences in the failure rates in obtaining pain scores and&#xD;
           the pain scores obtained using Panda versions of the 100mm VAS and NRS-11 compared to&#xD;
           the traditional paper versions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The management of acute post-operative pain has a profound impact on a patient's short-&#xD;
           and long-term wellbeing. Studies have shown that up to 70-80% of patients experience&#xD;
           pain after surgery, with the majority reporting moderate, severe or extreme pain at some&#xD;
           point. Ineffective pain management can increase the risk of venous thromboembolism,&#xD;
           ischemic heart disease, pneumonia, poor wound healing , insomnia, anxiety and chronic&#xD;
           post surgical pain (CPSP). The management of postoperative pain after patients leave&#xD;
           hospital is especially inadequate, with more patients reporting pain after discharge&#xD;
           than before. Although peripheral nerve blocks (PNB) have demonstrated benefit in&#xD;
           reducing immediate/in-hospital postoperative pain compared to general anesthesia (GA),&#xD;
           this benefit is not sustained after patients are discharged. In fact, more patients who&#xD;
           received PNB report their pain as &quot;severe&quot;, &quot;excruciating&quot; or &quot;extreme&quot; and seek medical&#xD;
           attention after leaving hospital, than those who were under GA. The nociceptive barrage&#xD;
           after the signal blockade by regional anesthesia wears off can theoretically lead to&#xD;
           hyperalgesia, and the substantial increase in acute pain over a period of hours can be&#xD;
           highly traumatic for patients. In order to minimize this effect, patients are often&#xD;
           advised to begin the titration of their oral analgesics prior to the resolution of their&#xD;
           nerve blocks, often when they do not feel much pain yet. Potential barriers encountered&#xD;
           during this process can include the lack of incentive to begin analgesics in the&#xD;
           presence of residual nociceptive blockade, the difficulty of titrating medications away&#xD;
           from the direct supervision of medical professionals, and the fear of medication&#xD;
           overdose. Therefore, detailed, easily comprehensible and patient specific pain&#xD;
           management instructions need to be provided as a part of the discharge plan in order to&#xD;
           facilitate patient compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The first step involves developing a practical tool that allows for the accurate and&#xD;
           reliable assessment and recording of pain severity that patients can use from home. Pain&#xD;
           is defined as &quot;an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or&#xD;
           potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage&quot;. It is a highly&#xD;
           individual experience. Therefore, self-report is considered the gold standard for pain&#xD;
           assessment, with the Verbal Rating Scale (VRS), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Numeric&#xD;
           Rating Scale (NRS) being the three most validated self-report scales in adults. The&#xD;
           VAS-100mm is a 100mm line with the anchoring words &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot;&#xD;
           at the bottom and top, respectively. The NRS-11 is a line marked with numbers from 0 to&#xD;
           10 at even intervals, with the anchoring words &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot; at&#xD;
           0 and 10, respectively. Digital versions of pain scales that can be downloaded onto a&#xD;
           smartphone have been found to be comparable to traditional paper versions in terms of&#xD;
           their ability to measure pain. In addition to being portable and accessible, the&#xD;
           digitization of pain assessments have the potential to reduce human errors that could&#xD;
           occur during scoring and data recording. Furthermore, there is growing evidence that&#xD;
           smartphone applications (apps) have the potential to improve compliance with disease and&#xD;
           medication management by motivating patients to be involved in their own care. These&#xD;
           properties make them promising tools for the management of postsurgical pain at home.&#xD;
           The smartphone application &quot;Panda&quot; (Pain Assessment using a Novel Digital Application)&#xD;
           developed by the British Columbia Children's Hospital (BCCH) Pediatric Anesthesia&#xD;
           Research Team (PART), includes digital versions of the Faces Pain Scale - Revised&#xD;
           (FPS-R) and Color Analog Scale (CAS), and has been validated in the pediatric&#xD;
           population. Because the 100mm VAS and the 11-point NRS have been studied specifically in&#xD;
           adults as tools for the evaluation of postoperative pain, the app will be modified to&#xD;
           include these two scales to better suit this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Panda will be compared against the traditional versions for both the NRS-11 and 100mm&#xD;
           VAS to analyse the following endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Agreement between the two measures - the Panda score and the &quot;traditional&quot; score.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Practicality: difference in failure rates in obtaining pain scores from Panda&#xD;
                compared with the &quot;traditional&quot; methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Research design:&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is an observational, randomized, cross-over controlled, open trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Practicality: Chi-squared tests will be used to assess the difference in failure&#xD;
                rates in obtaining pain scores from Panda compared with the &quot;traditional&quot; methods&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Agreement: an interval approach described by Bland &amp; Altman will be used to&#xD;
                calculate the agreement between the the Panda scores and the 'traditional' scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: There will be 2 study groups- the 100mm VAS and NRS-11 groups. Each group will&#xD;
      contain 2 subgroups - ages &gt;18 to &lt; 60 years and ≥60 to ≤ 75 years. The required sample of 32&#xD;
      patients per subgroup has been calculated on the basis of Liao's proposed sample size&#xD;
      calculation for an agreement study based on the Bland-Altman interval method, setting the&#xD;
      discordance rate (α) = 0.05 and the tolerance probability (β) = 80%. 160 patients will be&#xD;
      recruited to allow for any unplanned gaps in data collection, patients withdrawing from the&#xD;
      study and other exclusions&#xD;
