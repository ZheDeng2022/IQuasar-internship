  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections is known to be a high-risk factor to induce&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal cancers. To date, EBV-related head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is&#xD;
      still a major concern in east Asia, especially in China. Concurrent therapies for HNSCC have&#xD;
      limited response rate and high chance of relapse. However, EBV-induced cancers provided an&#xD;
      ideal target for T cell-based immunotherapy due to the non-self origins. Engineered T cells&#xD;
      bearing a TCR (TCR-T) that can specifically recognize the presented EBV antigen become a&#xD;
      viable approach to treat this type of cancer. Though engineered T therapies have been&#xD;
      well-recognized in hematological cancers, solid cancer treatment has been a major hurdle due&#xD;
      to the immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment. One key mechanism of tumor-elicited&#xD;
      suppression is the PDL1-PD1 interaction which induces T cell exhaustion. Therefore, TCR-T&#xD;
      cells armed with a PD1 antagonist could further enhance the efficacy of TCR-T in solid&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;
