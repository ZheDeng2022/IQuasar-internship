      Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for about 20% of clinical breast cancer.&#xD;
      Clinical characteristics include early onset, high malignancy and heterogeneity. There is no&#xD;
      effective drug target for TNBC, resulting in poor outcomes, high relapse rate and distant&#xD;
      metastasis. So, further research on TNBC pathological features is particularly important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared with the solvent-based paclitaxel, albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-P) demonstrates a&#xD;
      stronger therapeutic effect. With albumin nanoparticles as a carrier, nab-P increases the&#xD;
      concentration of extra-tumor drugs by passing through the albumin receptor (Gp60)&#xD;
      transmembrane pathway and the secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) approach&#xD;
      that binds to the extracellular matrix of the tumor. Numerous clinical trials have found that&#xD;
      nab-P is superior to the solvent-based paclitaxel in the treatment of breast cancer,&#xD;
      especially in breast cancer with poor prognosis. However, the current efficacy of nab-P in&#xD;
      the treatment of TNBC has not been fully verified. The mechanism underlying the killing&#xD;
      effect of nab-P on TNBC breast cancer cells remains unclear yet. This trial will compare the&#xD;
      therapeutic effect of nab-P with solvent-based paclitaxel in TNBC patients, and seek for&#xD;
      important scientific clues, scientific evidence, and clinical data for nab-P in the treatment&#xD;
      of TNBC.&#xD;

      Breast cancer has been one of the most common malignant tumors with highest morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality that threatens women's health worldwide. Among US women, there were 250,000 new&#xD;
      invasive breast cancers and 40,000 breast cancer deaths in 2017. In the US, 12.4% women&#xD;
      develop breast cancer in their lifetime, and the incidence of breast cancer in women over 50&#xD;
      years of age has increased significantly. Although the development of molecular typing and&#xD;
      comprehensive treatments have significantly improved the prognosis of breast cancer patients,&#xD;
      the recurrence and metastasis of breast cancer is still the main cause of death in breast&#xD;
      cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TNBC accounts for about 20% of clinical breast cancer. Clinical characteristics include early&#xD;
      onset, high malignancy and heterogeneity. There is no effective drug target for TNBC,&#xD;
      resulting in poor outcomes, high relapse rate and distant metastasis. So, further research on&#xD;
      TNBC pathological features is particularly important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paclitaxel is a natural secondary metabolite isolated and purified from the bark of Taxus&#xD;
      chinensis. It has been clinically proven to have a good anti-tumor effect. However,&#xD;
      polyoxyethylene castor oil/ethanol is often used as a solvent for paclitaxel in clinical&#xD;
      practice, and this solvent-based paclitaxel is prone to causing severe allergic reactions,&#xD;
      even aggravating myelosuppression and neurotoxicity. In addition, the solvent-based&#xD;
      paclitaxel can also influence the efficacy of other drugs by inhibiting albumin-mediated drug&#xD;
      delivery. nab-P is a novel paclitaxel that can compensate for the adverse effects of&#xD;
      solvent-based paclitaxel and have good efficacy and safety. Compared with the solvent-based&#xD;
      paclitaxel, nab-P demonstrates a stronger therapeutic effect. With albumin nanoparticles as a&#xD;
      carrier, nab-P increases the concentration of extra-tumor drugs by passing through the&#xD;
      albumin receptor (Gp60) transmembrane pathway and the secreted protein acidic and rich in&#xD;
      cysteine (SPARC) approach that binds to the extracellular matrix of the tumor. Numerous&#xD;
      clinical trials have found that nab-P is superior to the solvent-based paclitaxel in the&#xD;
      treatment of breast cancer, especially in breast cancer with poor prognosis. However, the&#xD;
      current efficacy of nab-P in the treatment of TNBC has not been fully verified. The mechanism&#xD;
      underlying the killing effect of nab-P on TNBC breast cancer cells remains unclear yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will compare the therapeutic effect of nab-P with solvent-based paclitaxel in TNBC&#xD;
      patients, and seek for important scientific clues, scientific evidence, and clinical data for&#xD;
      nab-P in the treatment of TNBC.&#xD;
