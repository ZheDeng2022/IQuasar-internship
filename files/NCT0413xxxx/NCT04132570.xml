    <measure>Mean Change from Baseline in 24-hour Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 10 days (24 hours each day)</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change from baseline in 24-hour reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) calculated as the sum of the participant-assessed 24-hour reflective severity ratings for three individual nasal symptom scores (nasal obstruction, secretion/runny nose, itching/sneezing) averaged over the first 10-day treatment period. Baseline value will be a single 24-hour rTNSS recorded on the no-treatment evening following the baseline visit. The individual nasal symptom scores will be recorded at home by participants in their diary on a four point scale (from 0=none to 3=severe). The sum of the individual scores will form the 24-hour rTNSS.</description>

    <measure>Subject Global Impression of Change (SGIC) at the Final Efficacy Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 10 (+/-3)</time_frame>
    <description>Participant will rate Global Impression of Change at Final Efficacy Assessment on a 5-point scale from 0 (symptoms were aggravated) to 4 (total control over symptoms). An increase in score indicates the improvement in condition.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change from Baseline in Individual Nasal Symptoms Scores (NSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 10 days (24 hours each day)</time_frame>
    <description>Mean Change from Baseline in individual NSS for nasal obstruction, secretion/runny nose, and itching/sneezing averaged over the first 10-day treatment period will be reported using 4-point scale from 0=None, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, or 3=Severe.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change from Baseline in 24-hour Reflective Individual non-Nasal Symptoms Score (Cough and Post-Nasal Drip)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 10 days (24 hours each day)</time_frame>
    <description>Mean Change from Baseline in 24-hour reflective Individual non-Nasal Symptoms Score for cough and post-nasal drip averaged over the first 10-day treatment period, using a scale of 0=None, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, or 3=Severe condition.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) as a Measure of Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 10 +/- 3 days or up to 30 days after the last day of the study treatment period (Day 10)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product.</description>
