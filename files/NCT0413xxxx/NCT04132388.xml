  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic relapsing condition with significant psychosocial&#xD;
      impact and morbidity, but that doesn't mean that patients will necessarily be adherent to&#xD;
      recommended treatments. Patients, especially those on chronic medication therapy, inevitably&#xD;
      miss doses. They use too little or too much therapy. They may take medications too soon or&#xD;
      too far apart. While adherence to injection treatments tend to be better than adherence to&#xD;
      topical or oral treatment, adherence to injections may still be poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional methods for measuring medical adherence-including questionnaires, surveys, and&#xD;
      diaries- tend to be unreliable overestimate adherence. Chemical markers are problematic&#xD;
      because of the tendency for patients to use their medication right before visits, so called&#xD;
      &quot;white coat compliance.&quot; Our research team has pioneered the use of electronic monitoring&#xD;
      devices which measure and record the date and time of medication events to assess adherence&#xD;
      in dermatology. The study team have demonstrated the feasibility of using such monitors to&#xD;
      measure adherence to adalimumab in patients with psoriasis. Although only a small study, it&#xD;
      documented a broad range of how patients use adalimumab and found that adherence was poor in&#xD;
      about half of the patients. While the impact of psoriasis on patients' lives is large,&#xD;
      adherence is still poor. How adherent patients with hidradenitis are to weekly adalimumab&#xD;
      treatment is not yet well characterized.&#xD;

      This is a prospective single-center open-label randomized 6 month study. There will not be a&#xD;
      washout period. Treatment will be for 26 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have baseline disease severity assessments. Subjects will be instructed to take&#xD;
      adalimumab according to the labelled dosing regimen. Subjects will be randomized to either&#xD;
      standard-of-care or to an electronic reporting intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reporting intervention consists of reporting the experience with the treatment (whether&#xD;
      the treatment was taken, the efficacy of the treatment, and any issues that have come up) at&#xD;
      weekly intervals for 6 weeks, then every 4 weeks thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return for evaluation at 12 &amp; 26 weeks (or end of study). At each visit the&#xD;
      subject will be scored for disease severity and adverse events. The assessor of these&#xD;
      measures will be blinded to treatment group assignment. At the baseline and at the end of&#xD;
      therapy visit (26 weeks), all subjects will complete a HS self-assessment questionnaire,&#xD;
      treatment satisfaction questionnaire and physician trust survey. Pregnancy tests will be&#xD;
      completed on females of childbearing potential at the baseline visit.&#xD;
