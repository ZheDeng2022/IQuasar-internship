  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study will assess real-world clinical outcomes and adverse events from treatment&#xD;
      with endocrine therapy combined with CDKi in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative&#xD;
      advanced breast cancer.&#xD;

      Patients This will be a retrospective analysis of patients with histologically confirmed&#xD;
      HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced (recurrent or metastatic) breast cancer. The&#xD;
      investigators will use data from patients treated at Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group&#xD;
      (HeCOG)-affiliated departments of oncology. Eligible patients will be of 18 years or older,&#xD;
      women of any menopausal status with HR-positive/HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who have&#xD;
      received treatment with CDKi in combination with endocrine therapy for their advanced breast&#xD;
      cancer. Treatment combinations of CDKi with any endocrine therapy will be accepted. Patients&#xD;
      will be included in the analysis if they heve received at least two months of treatment with&#xD;
      a CDKi. Patient clinical data will be obtained from their medical records. Toxicity data will&#xD;
      be recorded from the clinicians' documentations during scheduled patient clinical visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The primary endpoint of the study will be progression-free survival&#xD;
      (PFS), defined as the time from treatment initiation to either the first documented disease&#xD;
      progression or death from any cause. Secondary endpoint will be overall survival (OS),&#xD;
      defined as the time from treatment initiation to patient death or last contact. Patients&#xD;
      alive will be censored at the date of last contact. Adverse events will be graded based on&#xD;
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 4.0). Survival curves will be&#xD;
      estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared across groups with the log-rank test.&#xD;
      The associations between the clinicopathological factors to be examined and the mortality&#xD;
      rate will be evaluated with hazard ratios estimated with Cox proportional hazards model. The&#xD;
      statistical analyses will be completed using the SAS software (SAS for Windows, version 9.3,&#xD;
      SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).&#xD;
