      Many patients with stroke have a severe motor deficit in the upper limb impacting their&#xD;
      independence. Electroencephalogram (EEG) Neurofeedback is a re-education technique that&#xD;
      improves cerebral plasticity and motor gain in these people during the chronic phase of&#xD;
      stroke. The visual feedback usually used tends to diminish the subject's attentional&#xD;
      resources, while the proprioceptive feedbacks appear to be more effective on cortical&#xD;
      excitability. Vibration feedback inducing movement illusion has been shown to be effective in&#xD;
      healthy subjects, but has not been tested in people with stroke.&#xD;

    <description>The objective is to evaluate if certain virtual visual conditions can increase the illusion of movement induced by the tendon vibration of the upper limb.&#xD;
Thirty healthy volunteers and 20 post-stroke subjects will test 3 different situations of vibration applications, with no EEG Neurofeedback session. It will be applied to the subject (healthy and post-stroke) according to a randomized order a vibrator for a few minutes on his non-dominant (or deficit) hand hidden from view, with a screen representing a static virtual hand, then a vibrator on his hand hidden with a screen representing an animated virtual hand, then a vibrator on his hand hidden with a screen representing an empty background.</description>

    <description>The post-stroke subject is evaluated on clinical tests (FMA, ARAT, MAL, NHPT, Finger Tapping test) during the first visit. Then, he performs 12 sessions of NFB (on his deficit member) lasting 45 minutes, spread over 6 weeks, depending on the feedback modality that has been drawn randomly (visual or visuo-vibratory). A second visit after the first NFB session and a third visit after the last NFB session evaluates the motor skills of the trained upper limb (FMA, ARAT, MAL, NHPT, Finger Tapping test) and a satisfaction questionnaire is given to the subject for evaluate tolerance and satisfaction with the feedback modality assigned. Evaluation of changes of EEG sensorimotor rhythms at the end of the program.</description>
