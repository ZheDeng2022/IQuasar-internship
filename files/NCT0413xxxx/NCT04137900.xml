      The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of TAB004 as monotherapy and&#xD;
      in combination with toripalimab in subjects with selected advanced solid malignancies,&#xD;
      including lymphoma, and to evaluate the recommended Phase 2 dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to: 1) describe the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of TAB004&#xD;
      monotherapy and in combination with toripalimab and to describe the PK profile of toripalimab&#xD;
      when administered with TAB004, 2) evaluate antitumor activity of TAB004 monotherapy and in&#xD;
      combination with toripalimab; and 3) determine the immunogenicity of TAB004 monotherapy and&#xD;
      in combination with toripalimab and to determine the immunogenicity of toripalimab when&#xD;
      administered with TAB004.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exploratory objectives are to: 1) evaluate pharmacodynamic effects of TAB004 on its&#xD;
      target receptor BTLA, as well as effects on the immune system; 2) evaluate biomarkers that&#xD;
      may correlate with activity of TAB004 as monotherapy and in combination with toripalimab; 3)&#xD;
      evaluate the utility of BTLA ligand, herpesvirus-entry mediator (HVEM), and additional&#xD;
      exploratory biomarkers that could aid in selection of appropriate subjects for TAB004&#xD;
      monotherapy and in combination with toripalimab.&#xD;

      OVERVIEW: This is a Phase 1, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation study of TAB004, a&#xD;
      recombinant humanized IgG4Îº monoclonal antibody specific to BTLA when administered alone and&#xD;
      in combination with toripalimab, a human IgG4k monocloncal antibody that specifically binds&#xD;
      to the programmed death 1 (PD-1). It is estimated that up to 499 subjects with selected&#xD;
      advanced solid malignancies (i.e.; non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC], melanoma, renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (RCC), urothelial carcinoma (UC), or other tumors), including lymphoma will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced unresectable or&#xD;
      metastatic solid tumor, including lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has 4 parts; Part A dose-escalation, Part B cohort expansion, Part C&#xD;
      dose-escalation and Part D cohort expansion. In Part A, up to 24 subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
      who must have received, or be ineligible for, or intolerant of, all available approved or&#xD;
      standard therapies know to confer clinical benefit including immunotherapy, or for whom no&#xD;
      standard therapy exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part B, C and D, subjects must have received at least one line of therapy for advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic disease, but are not required to have received all standard therapies known to&#xD;
      confer clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A is the monotherapy dose-escalation portion of the study. Four TAB004 dose levels are&#xD;
      planned and include: 0.3, 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg. Part A will be the traditional 3 + 3 design with&#xD;
      3 to 6 subjects per dose level (cohort) and will receive their assigned dose every 21 days in&#xD;
      the absence of a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) that would prevent further dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B is the monotherapy cohort expansion portion of the study and will consist of up to 50&#xD;
      subjects in each advanced solid tumor indication (up to 200 subjects) that may include but&#xD;
      not be limited to lymphoma, melanoma, NSCLC, or other tumors with agreement of the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part C is the combination therapy dose-escalation portion of the study. Four dose levels are&#xD;
      planned as follows: Cohort 1 - TAB004 20 mg and toripalimab 240mg; Cohort 2 - TAB004 70 mg&#xD;
      and toripalimab 240 mg; Cohort 3 -TAB004 200 mg and toripalimab 240 mg; Cohort 4- TAB004 500&#xD;
      mg and toripalimab 240 mg. Part C will be the traditional 3 + 3 design with 3 to 6 subjects&#xD;
      per dose level (cohort) and will receive their assigned doses every 21 days in the absence of&#xD;
      a DLT that would prevent further dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part D is the combination therapy cohort expansion portion of the study. Up to 50 subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled in each advanced solid tumor indication (melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, UC, lymphoma)&#xD;
      (up to 250 subjects). Doses of TAB004 and toripalimab will be determined based upon safety&#xD;
      and efficacy data from Part C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor response will be evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
      (RECIST v1.1), the immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST), or&#xD;
      the New Response Evaluation Criteria in Lymphoma (RECIL) 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of confirmed disease progression and intolerable toxicities, subjects will be&#xD;
      allowed to continue TAB004 (Part A and B) or TAB004 and toripalimab (Part C and D)&#xD;
      administration every 21 days for up to 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION TAB004 doses are 0.3, 1, 3, 10 mg/kg, 20mg, 70mg, 200mg and 500mg.&#xD;
      Toripalimab dose is 240mg. TAB004 alone or TAB004 plus toripalimab will be administered as a&#xD;
      60-minute i.v. infusion for the first dose and may be decreased at the investigators&#xD;
      discretion to 30 minutes in subsequent infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY EVALUATIONS Assessment of safety will be determined by vital sign measurements,&#xD;
      clinical laboratory tests, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status&#xD;
      evaluations, diagnostic imaging, physical examinations, electrocardiograms, and the incidence&#xD;
      and severity of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will also include evaluations of immune safety and immunogenicity. Blockade of BTLA&#xD;
      pathway and PD-1 pathway by monoclonal antibodies has been demonstrated in several syngeneic&#xD;
      mouse models to enhance specific T cell responses and inhibit tumor growth. In studies of&#xD;
      BTLA deficient mice, diseases such as asthma, autoimmune involvement of the central nervous&#xD;
      system, and systemic lupus erythematosus were exacerbated. Particular attention will be given&#xD;
      to symptoms related to those diseases. The occurrence of adverse events that may follow&#xD;
      enhanced T-cell activation such as pneumonitis, colitis, nephritis, severe skin reactions,&#xD;
      endocrinopathies, or other immune-related adverse events (irAEs) will be evaluated for&#xD;
      subjects receiving TAB004 alone or in combination with toripalimab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An irAE is a clinically significant adverse event of any organ that is associated with drug&#xD;
      exposure, of unknown etiology, and is consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EFFICACY EVALUATIONS will include best overall response, objective response rate, duration of&#xD;
      response or duration of stable disease, progression free survival and overall response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHARMACOKINETIC EVALUATIONS Pharmacokinetic parameters include AUC0-inf, AUC0-last, AUC0-21d,&#xD;
      Cmax, Cmin trough, Tmax, t1/2, CL, accumulation and Vss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL METHODS Part A and Part C are based on the 3+3 design for dose escalation and&#xD;
      safety evaluation requirements. In Part B and Part D, sample size is estimated using Simon's&#xD;
      two-phase design minimax method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All PK/Pharmacodynamic, immunogenicity, and safety data will be summarized and presented by&#xD;
      cohort as well as overall for the study, using descriptive statistics (number of subjects,&#xD;
      mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) for continuous variables and using&#xD;
      frequencies and percentages for discrete variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ORR and the associated 2-sided 95% exact confidence limits will be calculated. The proportion&#xD;
      of subjects who have experienced best response as CR, PR, SD, or progressive disease (PD)&#xD;
      will be provided by cohorts in Part B and Part D.&#xD;

             continue using such precautions for 90 days after the final dose of TAB004 or&#xD;
             toripalimab; cessation of birth control after this point should be discussed with a&#xD;
             responsible physician. Periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal&#xD;
