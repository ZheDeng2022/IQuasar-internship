  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how changing conditions of speech-language treatment&#xD;
      (namely, amount of repetition and distribution of practice schedule) affects the language&#xD;
      outcome of participants with aphasia following a stroke. Using a computer based speech and&#xD;
      language therapy program, participants will practice conversational scripts that are either&#xD;
      short or long. Participants will practice for either 2 weeks (5 days a week) or for 5 weeks&#xD;
      (2 days a week).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Determining the optimal intensity of treatment is essential to the design and implementation&#xD;
      of any treatment program for aphasia. Yet, treatment intensity is a complex construct and&#xD;
      information on the variables modulating it remain ambiguous and limited. Studies reported in&#xD;
      the neuroscience and clinical literature support the need for intensive treatment to induce&#xD;
      long-term neuroplastic changes while the cognitive psychology literature suggests that&#xD;
      learning is best maintained with distributed schedules. A few studies have looked at dose&#xD;
      parameters for single word naming tasks, but there is limited evidence regarding dose&#xD;
      parameters for treatments that focus on training the production of larger units, such as&#xD;
      sentences or even connected discourse. One approach that is frequently used clinically and&#xD;
      has evidence for its efficacy is script training. Little is currently known regarding the&#xD;
      optimum dose of script training (i.e., the number of repetitions over time of each sentence&#xD;
      within the script) that is required to promote the best outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigates the effects of modulating stimulus variables, specifically stimulus&#xD;
      practice distribution and stimulus repetition. We use a baseline script treatment that has&#xD;
      experimental support regarding its efficacy, and that allows the manipulation of these&#xD;
      variables. To ensure independence and fidelity, treatment is provided in a controlled&#xD;
      computer environment (desktop and tablet). To avoid clinician-related variables such as&#xD;
      expertise and personality factors that may influence treatment, sentences are modeled during&#xD;
      treatment by an anthropomorphic agent with high visual speech intelligibility and affective&#xD;
      expressions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regard to &quot;best outcomes&quot;, generalization is the ultimate goal of any treatment&#xD;
      approach. Therefore, the primary outcome is a generalization measure of conversation.&#xD;
      Secondary measures address short-term acquisition, longer-term maintenance, and stimulus and&#xD;
      response generalization for assessing gain over baseline, differential effects, and&#xD;
      interactions. A mobile-connected wireless wearable laryngeal sensor allows tracking of talk&#xD;
      time at home and in the community as a measure of treatment effectiveness and transfer. For&#xD;
      privacy, it does not record audio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results and computational models of learning (generalization, short-term acquisition, and&#xD;
      longer-term maintenance) will contribute new evidence to fill critical gaps in current&#xD;
      scientific understanding regarding the effectiveness and clinical application of aphasia&#xD;
      treatment approaches. More generally, findings will help to inform clinical practice and&#xD;
      treatment of neurologic communication disorders; the virtual clinician guided intervention&#xD;
      that the proposal develops has the potential to reduce costly clinician-client time otherwise&#xD;
      required for long-term rehabilitation.&#xD;
