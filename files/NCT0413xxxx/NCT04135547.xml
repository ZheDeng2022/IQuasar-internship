    <textblock>
      Overall survival of patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (*OHCA*) is less than 10%&#xD;
      worldwide and in Taiwan. Interventions provided by the emergency medical system (*EMS*)&#xD;
      before arrival at the hospital are of paramount importance to patient outcomes after OHCA.&#xD;
      Among those interventions, the pros-and-cons of different vascular accesses, including&#xD;
      intraosseous (*IO*) access or intravenous (*IV*) access, remained the issue of most under&#xD;
      debate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine the comparative effectiveness of IO access vs IV&#xD;
      access in patients with OHCA by a randomized controlled trial (*RCT*) in Taipei EMS. To name&#xD;
      in short, the investigators called it a &quot;*VICTOR* trial&quot; standing for &quot;Venous Injection&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Overall survival of patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (*OHCA*) is less than 10%&#xD;
      worldwide and in Taiwan. Interventions provided by the emergency medical system (*EMS*)&#xD;
      before hospital care is of paramount importance to patient outcomes after OHCA. Among those&#xD;
      interventions, the pros and cons of different vascular accesses, including intraosseous&#xD;
      (*IO*) access or intravenous (*IV*) access, recently became the focus under debate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theoretically, IO access provides a rapidly established way to administrate medication and&#xD;
      fluid to patients (Reference 1) and has been adopted in many acute care societies and&#xD;
      organizations including current resuscitation guidelines (Reference 2). However, some of the&#xD;
      recent publications questioned the outcomes of OHCA patients receiving the IO route comparing&#xD;
      to the IV route (References 3-5). Studies showed non-different or negative outcomes of&#xD;
      patients receiving the IO route has been severely biased through the inherent inadequacy of&#xD;
      retrospective design (References 3-5). The three major problems of those studies were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. . Time to vascular access cannot be adjusted. In many EMS, IO access was allowed only&#xD;
           after one or two failed attempts of IV route. This led to a significant selection bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. . The location of vascular access was not accurately reported. As we know, medications&#xD;
           through upper limbs arrive at the heart sooner than the lower limbs. Many paramedics&#xD;
           tend to insert the IO needle in tibia but to inset IV catheters in the forearm vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. . Post-hoc analysis with old data over 5 to 10 years. Two of the three studies were the&#xD;
           post-hoc analysis from the data of previous studies which was conducted from 2007 to&#xD;
           2010 when cardiopulmonary resuscitation quality and teamwork (i.e. important confounding&#xD;
           factors to OHCA survival) were not that emphasized and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the investigators designed the study to determine the comparative effectiveness of IO&#xD;
      access vs IV access in patients with OHCA by a randomized controlled trial (*RCT*) in Taipei&#xD;
      EMS. In this 2-year research plan, we will conduct a prehospital RCT to address the following&#xD;
      question: In adult patients with non-traumatic cause of OHCA resuscitated by emergency&#xD;
      medical technician paramedic in the prehospital setting, will receiving IO access cause a&#xD;
      better chance of survival to discharge, sustained recovery of spontaneous circulation, and&#xD;
      other survival outcomes like neurologically favorable status, comparing to those who&#xD;
      receiving IV access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To name in short, the investigators called it a &quot;*VICTOR* trial&quot; standing for &quot;Venous&#xD;
      Injection Compared To intraOsseous injection during Resuscitation of patients with&#xD;
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest&quot;.&#xD;
