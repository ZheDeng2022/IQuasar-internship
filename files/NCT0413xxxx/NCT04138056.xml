  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, ability of GSK Biologicals'&#xD;
      investigational RSV maternal vaccine (RSVPreF3) to generate an immune response and the degree&#xD;
      to which the vaccine can cause side effects, when administered alone and in combination with&#xD;
      Boostrix vaccine in healthy non-pregnant women 18-45 years of age. Two dose levels of&#xD;
      RSVPreF3 and 2 Boostrix [Diphtheria, Tetanus and acellular Pertussis (dTpa) vaccine]&#xD;
      formulations (US and ex-US) will be evaluated. A 2nd dose of RSVPreF3 will be administered in&#xD;
      an extension of the study to assess the durability of the immune response after the first&#xD;
      dose vaccination, and to assess the safety and immunogenicity following a second dose&#xD;
      vaccination of the RSVPreF3 maternal vaccine.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Data will be collected in an observer-blind manner. In an observer-blind study, the subject and the site and sponsor personnel involved in the clinical evaluation of the subjects are blinded while other study personnel may be aware of the treatment assignment. By observer-blind, it is meant that during the course of the study, the vaccine(s) recipient and those responsible for the evaluation of any study endpoint (e.g. safety, reactogenicity) will all be unaware of which vaccines were administered.</masking_description>
