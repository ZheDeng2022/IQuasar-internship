      This study will test the effects of an intervention to reduce substance use and related harms&#xD;
      among people leaving rural jails or otherwise involved in the criminal justice system. This&#xD;
      study will compare people in a health linkage intervention with people who will get overdose&#xD;
      (OD) education. Everyone will take part in the baseline and follow-up surveys and receive OD&#xD;
      education. Participants will be assigned to one of the two groups by chance based on when&#xD;
      they are enrolled to the study and if their county is randomly assigned to an intervention or&#xD;
      a comparison condition. By doing this study, the investigators hope to learn if providing&#xD;
      linkage to health services along with HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and overdose education to&#xD;
      people leaving rural jails or otherwise involved in the criminal justice system will reduce&#xD;
      substance use and related harms.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of an&#xD;
      evidence-based community response project using a case crossover community randomized trial.&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators will test the effect of an intervention to reduce substance&#xD;
      use and related harms among people re- entering the community from rural jails or otherwise&#xD;
      recently involved in the criminal justice system (out on bond, under warrant for arrest,&#xD;
      arrested, on pre-trial supervision, probation or parole, court-involved, or under home&#xD;
      incarceration with digital monitoring). This study will compare people in a health navigation&#xD;
      intervention with a comparison group of people who will get overdose education. Everyone will&#xD;
      take part in follow-up surveys for up to 6 months after release. The intervention is a health&#xD;
      navigation intervention designed to reduce substance use disorder (SUD) and increase&#xD;
      engagement in the SUD care cascade; reduce vulnerability to HIV, sexually transmitted&#xD;
      infections (STIs), and HCV and increase engagement in the HIV, STI, and HCV care cascades;&#xD;
      and reduce vulnerability to overdose deaths among adults who use drugs and are leaving local&#xD;
      jails or otherwise involved in the criminal justice system. The intervention is based on&#xD;
      enhancements to START, a CDC-recognized, evidence-based, individual-level intervention&#xD;
      designed to reduce HIV/STI/HCV risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      START core components: (1) Hold pre- and post-release program sessions with clients&#xD;
      transitioning back to the community from a correctional setting; (2) Use a client-focused&#xD;
      incremental risk reduction approach; (3) Use assessment &amp; documentation tools to provide&#xD;
      structure; (4) Hire program staff that are familiar with HIV/STIs/HCV prevention and with the&#xD;
      specific needs of people being released; (5) Staff /client relationships must be maintained&#xD;
      post-release; (6) Conduct enrollment and schedule two pre-release program sessions within 60&#xD;
      days of a client's release that: a. give HIV/STI/HCV information; b. review client's&#xD;
      HIV/STI/HCV risk; c. identify transitional needs; d. develop a personalized risk reduction&#xD;
      and transitional plan; e. make facilitated referrals; 7) Schedule four post-release sessions&#xD;
      to review and update the risk reduction/ transitional plan(s) and provide facilitated&#xD;
      referrals; (8) Provide condoms at each post-release session; (9) Actively maintain contact&#xD;
      with clients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will modify START a priori as follows: 1) Though originally designed for&#xD;
      young men, START has been successfully applied to women leaving correctional settings. The&#xD;
      investigators will implement START with all genders; 2) START originally targeted&#xD;
      incarcerated people preparing to leave correction facilities. The investigators will continue&#xD;
      to target individuals who are incarcerated but also expand the target population to people&#xD;
      who are involved in other parts of the criminal justice system (e.g., those out on bond,&#xD;
      under warrant for arrest, arrested, court-involved; those on probation, parole or pre-trial&#xD;
      supervision; and individuals under home incarceration with digital monitoring [an ankle&#xD;
      monitoring program]). Individuals who are not incarcerated will be recruited in the&#xD;
      communities. 3) All intervention sessions will be conducted in the community setting&#xD;
      (post-release for those recruited in jails). 4) START's post-release sessions primarily&#xD;
      occurred in homes and community venues, such as restaurants. Staff who will deliver START&#xD;
      will be stationed primarily within the local department of health (DOH); 5) To enhance&#xD;
      START's impact on drug use and HIV/HCV-related harms (e.g., drug injection frequency), the&#xD;
      investigators will integrate the NIDA Standard HIV intervention into START, including rapid&#xD;
      HIV and HCV antibody testing and counseling. In addition, START interventionists will&#xD;
      distribute harm reduction supplies at the first intervention session with people who inject&#xD;
      drugs (PWID). The NIDA Standard has been demonstrated to reduce drug use frequency, high-risk&#xD;
      injection practices, and sexual risk; 6) START was not designed to reduce overdoses. The&#xD;
      investigators will integrate an interactive training with animated scenarios and narration on&#xD;
      preventing, recognizing, and responding effectively to an opioid OD. Participants in the&#xD;
      intervention group will receive naloxone (not all participants will get naloxone), at their&#xD;
      first intervention session. Interventionists will encompass OD in risk reduction motivational&#xD;
      interviewing. 7) To accommodate participants who are not able to visit the study office&#xD;
      in-person, data collection and intervention sessions will be conducted remotely via phone or&#xD;
      videoconferencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CARE2HOPE covers the following counties: Rowan, Bath, Morgan, Menifee, Elliott, Lee, Owsley,&#xD;
      Wolfe, Perry, Letcher, Leslie, Knott. Research staff will recruit participants from a) jails,&#xD;
      b) Probation, Parole and Pre-Trial Services c) digital jails (i.e. home incarceration with&#xD;
      digital monitoring programs); d) peer referral; e) existing participants in CARE2HOPE and&#xD;
      other University of Kentucky studies, including PROUD-R2 (Peer-Based Retention of People Who&#xD;
      Use Drugs in Rural Research) and SNAP (Social Networks among Appalachian People), who have&#xD;
      consented to be contacted to learn about future studies; f) harm reduction and social service&#xD;
      programs serving people who use drugs; and g) community-based organizations serving the 12&#xD;
      CARE2HOPE counties. Recruitment in jails will involve jails either located in CARE2HOPE&#xD;
      counties or counties that have contracts with them to incarcerate their residents. The&#xD;
      intervention sessions and data collection will be delivered by research staff called &quot;Rural&#xD;
      Health Navigators&quot; or &quot;REHNs&quot;. Participants are assigned to one of the two groups by chance&#xD;
      based on when they are enrolled to the study and when their county is randomly chosen to&#xD;
      start the project. Counties were originally randomized using a stepped wedge design. The&#xD;
      counties were then randomized in November 2020, accounting for a new study design. The&#xD;
      investigators randomized 12 study counties to two groups. In Months 1-6 six counties randomly&#xD;
      assigned to Group 1 will recruit participants to the intervention, while in the remaining six&#xD;
      counties (Group 2) the participants will be enrolled into a control condition. In Months&#xD;
      7-12, Group 1 counties will shift to the control group, and Group 2 counties will receive the&#xD;
      intervention. In Months 13-18 the investigators will conduct follow-up assessments in all&#xD;
      counties. The investigators anticipate an average enrollment of 40 participants per county&#xD;
      per arm, with a total final sample size for the trial of 960 (n=480intervention,&#xD;
      n=480comparison) . After a county has met its target enrollment in both conditions, the&#xD;
      intervention and comparison activities will no longer be offered in that county.&#xD;

Participants will complete surveys at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The baseline will be conducted in jail for incarcerated participants preparing for re-entry, or in a community setting for those recruited in the community. The 3 and 6-month surveys will be conducted in a community setting.</description>

    <description>The investigators will initiate the comparison group in Group 2 counties six months before the intervention begins. Research staff will conduct an overdose intervention with the comparison cohort. This will occur pre-release if individual is recruited in jail. The comparison group participants will watch a video on preventing, recognizing, and responding effectively to an opioid OD, accompanied by information about Kentucky's Good Samaritan Law and Naloxone Access Law. Research staff will answer questions after the video. Individuals will receive a Community Resource Guide at this visit.&#xD;
As in the intervention group, the comparison group participants will complete surveys at the baseline (in jail if recruited in jail, in a community setting if recruited in the community), and at 3 months and 6 months after the baseline. Surveys will be identical to those delivered to the intervention cohort.</description>

    <ipd_description>Data from the University of Kentucky are required to be submitted to the University of Washington as part of the NIH-funded Rural Opioid Initiative (ROI) data harmonization project. The University of Washington Data Harmonization Coordinating Center will be harmonizing data across 8 ROI studies in order to create new, harmonized datasets to be used for analyses across the consortium. The University of Washington and other ROI grantees will perform data analyses on these data for peer-reviewed publication. The harmonized datasets will be provided to other ROI grantees as required for analysis and will be considered under the umbrella of mandated DCC activities. No third parties outside of the ROI will be given access to this harmonized data. Harmonized datasets will be built to specific project concept proposals, and all project proposals must be reviewed and approved by the ROI consortium's Publications Working Group before distribution of the customized dataset.</ipd_description>
