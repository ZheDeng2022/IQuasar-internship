      A Phase 1, Multi-center, Open-label, Dose Escalation Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability,&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics, and Clinical Activity of Orally Administered LP-108 in Subjects with&#xD;
      Relapsed or Refractory Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS), Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia&#xD;

    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives are to assess the safety and tolerability profile, determine the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of LP-108&#xD;
      administered daily as a single agent dosed orally in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      MDS/CMML/AML; to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of LP-108 in adult subjects&#xD;
      with relapsed/refractory MDS/CMML/AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to evaluate preliminary efficacy regarding the effect of LP-108&#xD;
      (monotherapy or combination therapy) on ORR for AML, MDS, CMML, PFS, DOR, and OS&#xD;
