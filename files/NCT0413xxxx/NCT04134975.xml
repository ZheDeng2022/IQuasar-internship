  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators team propose to evaluate the impact of the use of intraoperative scanning&#xD;
      coupled with Stryker navigation, compared to the conventional fluoroscopy technique, on the&#xD;
      accuracy of pedicle screws, in instrumented spinal surgery, by a randomised prospective&#xD;
      study, in terms of pedicular screw accuracy. We will also evaluate the radiation exposure of&#xD;
      the neurosurgical team and the patient in these two techniques.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of pedicle screws in spinal surgery has seen a major advance in recent decades,&#xD;
      allowing for greater biomechanical stability and higher fusion rates. In order to avoid any&#xD;
      malposition that could cause neurological, vascular and visceral injuries and compromise this&#xD;
      mechanical stability, imaging-guided surgical techniques have been developed. These are aimed&#xD;
      at improving the positioning accuracy of pedicle screws to reduce these risks and improve&#xD;
      mechanical stability and intervertebral fusion. Fluoroscopic examinations had long been the&#xD;
      mainstay of intraoperative control imaging until the development of computer-assisted&#xD;
      techniques. However, despite intraoperative examination, pedicle screw misalignment remains&#xD;
      very common and even experienced surgeons can deviate screws in 5 to 20% of cases when using&#xD;
      a standard fluoroscopic examination image. Thus, navigation techniques coupled with an&#xD;
      intraoperative scanner, involving the acquisition of 2D images of the surgical field, have&#xD;
      been developed. These techniques allow the neurosurgeon to navigate the spine and thus allow&#xD;
      an improvement in the positioning accuracy of the pedicle screws. The correlate is an&#xD;
      improvement of the safety of the procedure (reduction of complications) but also an&#xD;
      optimisation of the biomechanical efficiency of the osteosynthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With respect to the radiation emitted during navigated spinal surgery coupled with an&#xD;
      intraoperative scan, some comparative studies have shown that the radiation rates received by&#xD;
      the neurosurgical team and the patient were lower than the radiation rates received in&#xD;
      conventional surgery. To date, few studies combining the analysis of the pedicular screw&#xD;
      accuracy rate and the radiation rate transmitted to the neurosurgical team and patients have&#xD;
      been published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the team propose to evaluate the impact of the use of intraoperative scanning&#xD;
      (BODYTom, Samsung) coupled with Stryker navigation, compared to the conventional fluoroscopy&#xD;
      technique, on the accuracy of pedicle screws, in instrumented spinal surgery, by a randomised&#xD;
      prospective study, in terms of pedicular screw accuracy. The investigator team will also&#xD;
      evaluate the radiation exposure of the neurosurgical team and the patient in these two&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
