        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be at least 18-years-old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have pathology-proven metastatic urothelial carcinoma, with tissue&#xD;
             sampling of at least the primary tumor. Tissue sampling of each presumed metastatic&#xD;
             site is not necessary, provided that the patient already has a confirmed diagnosis of&#xD;
             urothelial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be on immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy with radiographic scans to&#xD;
             verify oligo-progression of at least one and â‰¤ 6 sites of disease per RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any of the currently FDA-approved PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are allowed. These&#xD;
                  include pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least 1 metastatic lesion must show stable disease, partial response or&#xD;
                  complete response per RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to understand and willing to sign written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have acceptable tolerability of ongoing therapy as decided by the&#xD;
             treating medical oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a desire to continue ongoing therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following completion of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female of child-bearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation,&#xD;
             having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the&#xD;
             following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or has not been&#xD;
                  naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses&#xD;
                  at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in&#xD;
                  this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to receive further immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anticipated survival of fewer than 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Daily steroid requirement of &gt; 10 mg prednisone or prednisone-equivalent. Steroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal insufficiency is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital&#xD;
             abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants.&#xD;
