  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This systematic review and meta-analysis is aimed to assess the effect of commonly consumed&#xD;
      viscous fibers on blood lipids including LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and ApoB.&#xD;

      Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central databases were searched through May 13,&#xD;
      2019. Three independent reviews extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials that assessed the effect of barley b-glucan, oat b-glucan, konjac&#xD;
      glucomannan (KJM), psyllium, guar gum, and pectin, with a study duration of ≥ 3 weeks, in&#xD;
      adults with or without hypercholesterolemia were included. Data were pooled using the generic&#xD;
      inverse variance method with random effects models and expressed as mean differences with 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals. Heterogeneity was assessed by the Cochran Q statistic and quantified by&#xD;
      I2 statistic. Overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of&#xD;
      Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be a randomized controlled clinical trial with either a parallel or cross-over&#xD;
             design&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have a treatment period of at least 3 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypercholesterolemic or normocholesterolemic adults, overweight and obese individuals&#xD;
             or individuals with diabetes were all acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sources from β-glucan oats, β-glucan barley, konjac, psyllium, guar gum, and pectin&#xD;
             were accepted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The amount of soluble fiber must be reported or measured or must be computable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be appropriately controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must measure one of LDL-C, non-HDL-C or ApoB. These lipid measures can be either&#xD;
             primary or secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Enough information must be provided to calculate the magnitude of effect, i.e. end of&#xD;
             treatment measures and/or change from baseline measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the study was insufficiently controlled, i.e. the control was another soluble fiber&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the soluble fiber was a combination supplement or in whole food sources where the&#xD;
             amount of soluble fiber could not be isolated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the outcome measures did not include LDL-C, non-HDL-C or ApoB&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the treatment period was less than 3 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the study was from a non-adult population&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the study provided insufficient information to calculate a magnitude of effect&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Secondary information such as reviews, editorials, commentaries, were excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the dose was less than 0.4g/day&#xD;
