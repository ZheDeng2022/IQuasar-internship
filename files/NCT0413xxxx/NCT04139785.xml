  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a common condition and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Preventing&#xD;
      or delaying the onset of depression is an important way to reduce the burden of depression.&#xD;
      Some research suggests online methods may be effective in preventing depression, but to date,&#xD;
      few studies have looked at the application of these methods in the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess the effects of an online self-help intervention (Moodbuster) on&#xD;
      preventing depression in a primary care population, who are experiencing mild-moderate&#xD;
      symptoms of depression, but do not meet the threshold for diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised control design with a six-month and nine-month follow up will be used to compare&#xD;
      Moodbuster to a wait-listed control group. Then, a qualitative process evaluation will be&#xD;
      used to understand the barriers and facilitators of implementing the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants in Greater Manchester (individuals with mild to moderate symptoms of&#xD;
      depression, who do not have a diagnosis of major depressive disorder and have access to the&#xD;
      internet) will take part in a 6-week online self-help programme, accompanied by three&#xD;
      telephone calls with a trained researcher to support them in their use of the programme.&#xD;
      Researchers will follow-up with participants six and nine months after starting the programme&#xD;
      to measure depression, anxiety, quality of life, and use of services. The process evaluation&#xD;
      will involve qualitative interviews with participants and focus groups with practitioners who&#xD;
      referred individuals to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the effects of Moodbuster on preventing depression and barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators of implementing such an intervention in a UK primary care population. It is&#xD;
      hypothesised that the intervention group will display reduced depression symptoms and&#xD;
      incidence, reduced service use, and improved quality of life, and the intervention will be&#xD;
      acceptable to a UK primary care population.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a common, often recurring, condition and the leading cause of disability&#xD;
      worldwide. In the UK, the one-week prevalence of depression is estimated at 3.3%, and by&#xD;
      2026, the cost of depression to the UK economy is estimated to reach Â£12.15 billion in lost&#xD;
      earnings and service use costs. There are two main strategies to reduce the burden of&#xD;
      depression, treatment and prevention. Treatment for depression is, even with full coverage of&#xD;
      services to all those who need it, not enough.to avert the total burden of disease. Indeed,&#xD;
      whist treatment is crucial, even if all people with depression received evidence-based&#xD;
      treatment, it is likely that only 35% of the burden (years lived with disabilities) would be&#xD;
      averted. Prevention strategies are an integral part of reducing the burden of depression&#xD;
      through fully preventing, or otherwise delaying, its onset. One way to improve the reach of&#xD;
      prevention interventions and to deliver such approaches at scale is to offer interventions&#xD;
      via digital technologies such as websites, computer programmes, or apps. This allows for a&#xD;
      larger reach and it may help reach communities which are currently under-served by&#xD;
      traditional mental health services. Whilst digital tools have been shown to be effective and&#xD;
      acceptable in primary care for the treatment of depression, less research has been conducted&#xD;
      on its effectiveness or barriers and facilitators to implementation for prevention. A 2017&#xD;
      meta-analysis identified ten trials on the effectiveness of digital interventions for the&#xD;
      prevention of anxiety and depression. The review found promising evidence for the use of&#xD;
      digital interventions for prevention, finding a small but positive effect on depression&#xD;
      symptoms in the short-term (0.25, [0.09-0.41], p = 0.003). However, the majority of these&#xD;
      studies were conducted outside of the UK, in Germany, Australia, USA, Japan, Norway, and the&#xD;
      Netherlands. The trials also represented a mix of universal interventions, and&#xD;
      indicated/selective efforts targeted to university students, older adults, and young adults.&#xD;
      Of the two studies identified that were conducted in the UK, both had a short-term follow up,&#xD;
      one of 6 weeks, and the other 12 weeks and did not include diagnostic outcome assessments.&#xD;
      This suggests there is still more to learn about the application of digital technologies in&#xD;
      the UK for the prevention of depression, and the medium to longer term effects of such&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Can an online self-help tool reduce depression symptoms and help support the prevention&#xD;
           of depression?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What are the effects of Moodbuster on the development of depression, anxiety symptoms,&#xD;
           quality of life, and service use, and are there any negative unintended effects?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What are the barriers and facilitators to implementing an online tool for prevention in&#xD;
           primary care and community settings?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesised that the intervention group will display reduced depression symptoms and&#xD;
      incidence, reduced service use, and improved quality of life, and the intervention will be&#xD;
      acceptable to a UK primary care population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited via three routes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Direct referral from GPs in participating practices, who feel the study would be&#xD;
           appropriate for their patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Through a software tool (FARSITE) that allows for the secure searching of GP records for&#xD;
           potential study participants at participating GP practices&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Self-referral by individuals in response to recruitment campaign launched both in-print&#xD;
           and online by the Mental Health Foundation (MHF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final sample of participants accepted for the trial will be randomly allocated to either&#xD;
      the intervention arm or the Treatment as Usual (TAU) arm by an independent statistician based&#xD;
      at the University of Manchester.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those assigned to the intervention will take part in a six-week online self-help programme&#xD;
      called Moodbuster. Use of the programme will be supported by three telephone calls from a&#xD;
      trained researcher at baseline, three weeks, and six weeks. The calls will serve to support&#xD;
      participants with their use of Moodbuster and resolve any technical issues. Treatment as&#xD;
      usual during the study period will involve participants carrying on as they ordinarily would&#xD;
      and seeking support as and when they feel it is needed using the (clinical) resources and&#xD;
      services available in their area. Those assigned to the TAU arm will receive the stand-alone&#xD;
      online intervention for free after the nine-month study period and will have access for an&#xD;
      additional 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data will be collected via online questionnaires, and an interview. Participants in&#xD;
      the intervention arm will be asked to complete a second set of online questionnaires upon&#xD;
      completing the six-week self-help programme. This will involve the same set of online&#xD;
      questionnaires completed at baseline with additional items related to acceptability of the&#xD;
      self-help programme. Participants in both groups will be contacted again at six months and&#xD;
      nine months for follow-up data collection, which will involve the same set of online&#xD;
      questionnaires that were completed at baseline. At nine months, participants will also be&#xD;
      asked to participate in a second diagnostic telephone interview with trained researchers.&#xD;
      Sub-groups of participants taking part in the intervention arm of the study will be selected&#xD;
      for inclusion in the qualitative process evaluation. The aim is to recruit 20-25 participants&#xD;
      for interview. In depth semi-structured interviews will be conducted with participants one&#xD;
      month after the end of the intervention. Participants will be asked questions related to&#xD;
      barriers and facilitators encountered in the use of Moodbuster, the perceived impact of&#xD;
      Moodbuster on their daily lives, and their motivations for taking part in the study.&#xD;
      Interviews will last approximately 30 minutes and will be conducted by study team researchers&#xD;
      over the phone. Additional focus groups will be conducted with primary care professionals&#xD;
      involved in the recruitment and referral to the intervention. Purposive sampling will be used&#xD;
      to select staff to reflect different areas of expertise. Focus groups will be conducted one&#xD;
      month after the end of the intervention and will explore professionals' perspectives on the&#xD;
      implementation of the intervention. This will include the perceived impact of the tool and&#xD;
      barriers and facilitators to use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      For our design, which assesses baseline and two follow-up measurements, we anticipate an&#xD;
      effect size of 0.30 at nine-month. This estimate is based on prior meta-analyses on&#xD;
      depression prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An effect size of 0.30 indicates a sample size of N = 116 per arm, or N = 232 for the full&#xD;
      trial. Accounting for 20% drop-out, we would require a sample size of N = 290 participants.&#xD;
      This is based on the assumption that the correlation between baseline and follow-up is 0.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-Sample Size: Process evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the qualitative component, we will aim to recruit up to 25 participants for interviews,&#xD;
      and a further 15 professionals for focus groups. This number ensures sufficient data to&#xD;
      answer the research questions and is achievable within the timescales of the project. It is&#xD;
      consistent with previous research applying thematic analysis to interview data in mental&#xD;
      health. The exact number of participants recruited will depend on the richness of the&#xD;
      interview data and whether new themes continue to emerge. Recruitment and data collection&#xD;
      will continue until collection of new data does not shed any further light on the issue under&#xD;
      investigation and saturation has been reached.&#xD;
