    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate how much of the essential amino acid lysine school-aged children are&#xD;
      using for protein synthesis when consuming different cereal grains. Six healthy children&#xD;
      between 6-10y will be recruited. They will be given cooked white rice, corn, oats, black&#xD;
      beans, and milk. Using a minimally invasive technique, the amount of lysine that is available&#xD;
      from cereal grain products will be determined. With the results from this research project&#xD;
      accurate diet recommendations will be developed for children consuming cereal-based diets.&#xD;

      Purpose The purpose of this research project is to implement the minimally invasive Indicator&#xD;
      Amino Acid Oxidation (IAAO) method in healthy school-aged children to measure the metabolic&#xD;
      availability of the essential amino acid lysine obtained from commonly consumed cereal grains&#xD;
      and their breakfast counterparts. Additionally, the difference in metabolic availability&#xD;
      through complementation of breakfast cereals with milk will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The use of the IAAO method will yield a higher lysine metabolic availability for&#xD;
      those cereal grains that have the least amount of fibre in the food matrix. Combining the&#xD;
      consumption of cereals with milk will increase the metabolic availability of lysine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification Cereal grains and their derived products are the most commonly consumed food&#xD;
      group around the world. From traditional foods such as steamed rice, corn tortillas, and&#xD;
      wheat bread to relatively modern products like ready-to-eat breakfast cereals. Up to 80% of&#xD;
      the energy intake in developing countries comes from this food group. Given that they are&#xD;
      considered as a low protein quality food source, a considerable amount of the world's&#xD;
      population could potentially be at risk of lysine deficiency. Especially, children living in&#xD;
      underdeveloped countries where complementation with other food sources, such as legumes,&#xD;
      dairy, or other animal products, is not an available option. Since lysine is the limiting&#xD;
      amino acid in cereals, this study is of great importance not only for its nutritional value,&#xD;
      but also for its social and economic impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current lysine recommendations for school-aged children are based on factorial calculations&#xD;
      performed on results of adult male studies. To develop the Lysine EAR (Estimated Average&#xD;
      Requirement) for growing children, these studies use adult lysine maintenance requirements&#xD;
      multiplied by estimated rates of protein deposition and the efficiency of this deposition.&#xD;
      Additionally, these studies do not measure lysine's bioavailability, which will vary&#xD;
      depending on the food sources and the processing techniques used to preserve them. With these&#xD;
      limitations in mind, the IAAO method has the capacity to accurately measure amino acid&#xD;
      metabolic availability in different populations groups, such as healthy and malnourished&#xD;
      children. Metabolic availability refers to the amount of absorbed amino acids that are used&#xD;
      for protein synthesis. It takes into account all amino acid losses from digestion,&#xD;
      absorption, metabolic utilization, and endogenous losses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, this method was used to determine lysine metabolic availability of rice in&#xD;
      healthy adults. This is the only study of this nature done for any human food source.&#xD;
      Currently, there is no information available regarding lysine's metabolic availability from&#xD;
      corn, wheat, milk and any breakfast cereal. Previously the IAAO method has successfully been&#xD;
      implemented in healthy Canadian and Indian children to measure lysine requirements.&#xD;
      Additionally, lysine requirement studies has been preformed in moderately undernourished&#xD;
      Indian children with parasitic intestinal infections. The study conclusions were that,&#xD;
      undernourished children require around 20% more lysine than their healthy counterparts. In&#xD;
      these cases it is not only important to know the lysine content of a food source, but also&#xD;
      it's metabolic availability, to develop accurate interventions that will have a better chance&#xD;
      to meet children's daily requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that childhood is a critical period for optimal growth and development, a comprehensive&#xD;
      study of lysine's metabolic availability in commonly consumed cereal grains is needed to&#xD;
      develop adequate interventions and recommendations, targeted to prevent stunting and other&#xD;
      signs of malnourishment in at risk populations around the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective The general objective of this research project is to assess the degree in which&#xD;
      cereal food sources can meet lysine amino acid requirements in healthy school-aged children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objective us to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Determine the metabolic availability of lysine from rice, corn, oats, black beans and milk&#xD;
      using the IAAO method in healthy school-aged children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design This is a repeated measures study design involving 1 pre-study visit and 8&#xD;
      study visits approximately one week apart from each other.&#xD;
