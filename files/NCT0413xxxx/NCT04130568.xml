      Learning organizations need a diagnostic tool that allows them to assess how well their team,&#xD;
      department or the entire institution is performing, that allow them identify areas of&#xD;
      improvement. In turn, having that tool in your own language (in this case French) and adapted&#xD;
      to your own context, gives reliability and ease of application. Health organizations are&#xD;
      starting to use more and more tools like this that allow them to improve their learning&#xD;
      capabilities and therefore their performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim : described the translation of Garvin's et al. Learning Organization Survey into French&#xD;
      to evaluate french speaking health organizations.&#xD;

      The translation and adaptation of the survey was carried out following the steps that are&#xD;
      recommended internationally for translation, back-translation, evaluation of translations by&#xD;
      a commission of judges, cultural adequacy by commission of experts and, finally, a pilot test&#xD;
      of the pre-final version.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Translation and Back-translation The first step in the process was the translation of the&#xD;
      English LO survey by Garvin et al. (En1) based on the modified Brislin reverse translation&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the translation, it was necessary to adapt some terms to maintain the same meaning as&#xD;
      the original.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the back-translation of the survey, no items were found that needed alteration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The translated and back translated versions of the survey we ll be presented to a commission&#xD;
      of 10 multidisciplinary staff from the INO. As a final part of this process, the content&#xD;
      validity of the questions will be verified for each item of the survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the necessary adjustments comparing the original survey (En1) with the back translated&#xD;
      version (En2) and the french draft (Fr1); the french final version (FFr) of the survey will&#xD;
      be generated and assessed in terms of conceptual equivalence, clarity and language and&#xD;
      forwarded to the general coordinator of the project who will indicate adjustments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adaptation The FFr of the survey will be presented to a commission of experts in a workshop&#xD;
      for cultural adequacy. On the day of the meeting, All multidisciplinary groups together will&#xD;
      finish discussing and validating the pre-final french survey by mutual agreement (PFV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot test The objective of the pilot study will be to establish whether the questionnaire&#xD;
      can be satisfactorily understood and completed by people from the target population, composed&#xD;
      of doctors, nurses, administrators, professors. The possibility of adjustments will be&#xD;
      considered in case the participants had difficulty understanding or responding to some item&#xD;
      of the instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection The survey will be conducted anonymously and voluntarily; It will be&#xD;
      distributed to a random sample of INO staff members, from doctors, administrators, residents,&#xD;
      professors, nurses, technicians, secretaries. And then collected by members of the research&#xD;
      team during August 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive variables of the population were added such as: age, sex, status, years of&#xD;
      experience, years worked in the INO and service they serve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected will be analysed using both ExcelÂ® and IBM SPSS Statistics V22.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be presented with mean and standard deviations(SD). Categorical&#xD;
      variables will presented with percentage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normality test of the variables will be calculated using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of&#xD;
      normality. Cronbach's alpha coefficients will be used to assess reliability and internal&#xD;
      consistency for each dimension, each block and the entire survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANOVA test will be used to compare descriptive statistics of different groups of profession&#xD;
      and the different Blocks and Dimensions of the survey.&#xD;
