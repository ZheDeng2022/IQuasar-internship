    <textblock>
      This study investigates the role of the preoperative computed tomography (CT) and magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) before cochlear implants and their role in selecting suitable&#xD;
      patients for surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cochlear implant is the treatment of choice for deep sensorineural hearing loss, notably in&#xD;
      those patients for whom conventional amplification devices do not provide significant&#xD;
      clinical improvement. Imaging plays an important role in the workup of cochlear implant&#xD;
      candidates not only to identify inner ear congenital and acquired abnormalities or cochlear&#xD;
      nerve anomalies but also to detect temporal bone abnormalities that may be encountered during&#xD;
      surgery and may alter surgical approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some variations are potential surgical hazards that may lead to problems during the surgery&#xD;
      and may alert the surgeon regarding potential surgical dangers and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiologist and surgeon must be familiar with these imaging findings. Both computed&#xD;
      tomography and magnetic resonance imaging should be used as they delineate, in different&#xD;
      manners, cochlear and middle ear anatomy as well as other anatomical variants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mastoid pneumatization is important for planning the surgery. It is classified into&#xD;
      pneumatic, diploic, sclerotic, and mixed. Effusion of the middle ear cleft should also be&#xD;
      reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Korner's septum divides the mastoid process into a superficial squamous portion and a deep&#xD;
      petrous portion. It may mislead the surgeon to the mastoid antrum during surgery. Mastoid&#xD;
      emissary veins participate in extracranial venous drainage of the posterior fossa dural&#xD;
      sinuses. Most of them disappear, however, some persist and enlarge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low lying dura represents difficulty to access the aditus, lateral semicircular canal, and&#xD;
      posterior tympanotomy. It is often associated with sclerotic mastoid. Posterior tympanotomy&#xD;
      is a well known otologic procedure that allows surgeons to access the middle ear cavity. The&#xD;
      surgeon opens a window in the posterior wall of the middle ear in the angle between the&#xD;
      chorda tympani and the mastoid part of the facial nerve. Laterally or anteriorly positioned&#xD;
      mastoid part of the facial nerve may hinder the access to the facial recess or may even force&#xD;
      the surgeon to change his approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sigmoid sinus passes along the posteromedial border of the mastoid air cells. An&#xD;
      anteriorly located sinus produces a deep bulge in the mastoid and may reach the posterior&#xD;
      wall of the external auditory canal being separated from it only by a thin bony plate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Jugular bulb variations are common, the roof of a normal jugular bulb lies either at or&#xD;
      slightly below the level of the external auditory canal floor and is separated from the&#xD;
      middle ear cavity by the thin bony sigmoid plate. The average width of the jugular bulb is 1&#xD;
      cm. A jugular bulb larger than 1 cm is called a giant or mega jugular bulb. A jugular bulb&#xD;
      that extends over the basal turn of the cochlea or abuts the round window is called a high&#xD;
      riding jugular bulb. Dehiscence of the sigmoid plate with upward protrusion of the bulb into&#xD;
      the posterior hypotympanum is called a dehiscent jugular bulb, which may obliterate a round&#xD;
      window niche.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aberrant internal carotid artery is an enlarged inferior tympanic artery that occurs as a&#xD;
      result of agenesis or underdevelopment of the cervical segment of the internal carotid&#xD;
      artery. It runs along the medial aspect of the middle ear coursing anteriorly across the&#xD;
      cochlear promontory to join the horizontal carotid canal through a dehiscence in the carotid&#xD;
      plate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cochlear duct patency and axis, patency of the round window niche and the patent even caliber&#xD;
      of the cochlea must be adequately evaluated by both computed tomography and magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging. Otospongiotic foci compromise the insertion of the cochlear implant&#xD;
      electrode if they occlude the round window niche or cochlear duct. Labyrinthitis ossificans&#xD;
      may partially or completely obliterate cochlear lumen. Fibrosis may precede ossification and&#xD;
      areas of fibrosis and ossification may coexist. Cochlear ossification with luminal&#xD;
      obstruction is not a contraindication for implantation, however, it is important to be&#xD;
      identified preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vestibular aqueduct (VA) is considered dilated if its width is greater than the width of the&#xD;
      posterior SCC or if its midpoint width is greater than 1.5 mm. Computed tomography shows&#xD;
      dilatation of the VA only whereas magnetic resonance imaging shows the dilatation of the VA&#xD;
      and of the endolymphatic sac.&#xD;
