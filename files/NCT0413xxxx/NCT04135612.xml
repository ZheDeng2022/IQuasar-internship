    <textblock>
      We will aim to study the impact of introducing a smartphone-based daily feedback and&#xD;
      communication platform between postpartum women delivering at our institute and a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary breastfeeding-support team (obstetricians, neonatologists, midwives,&#xD;
      lactation consultants, nurses, and psychologist) on breastfeeding rates.&#xD;

      Our study will aim to introduce a smartphone-based daily feedback and communication platform&#xD;
      between postpartum women delivering at our institute and a multidisciplinary&#xD;
      breastfeeding-support team. This team will include: an obstetrician specialized in&#xD;
      maternal-fetal medicine, a general obstetrician, two certified midwives, two certified&#xD;
      lactation-consultants, a neonatologist, and a psychologist. Our vision and hypothesis for the&#xD;
      current study- is that an intimate personalized daily communication and feedback platform&#xD;
      between each woman and the support team will improve the rates of initiation of lactation and&#xD;
      of full/partial lactation at various time points postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Geographic area - A university affiliated hospital in southern Tel-Aviv that serves a&#xD;
      population of over 500,000 people. Our annual delivery volume is 5000 deliveries with a 22%&#xD;
      CS rate. The population is heterogeneous and consists of a high rate of women with&#xD;
      intermediate-low income as well as a population of refugees from Africa (mostly Eritrea),&#xD;
      both populations still have a very high rate of smartphone owners based on our previous&#xD;
      experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods- Prospective, single-center randomized controlled trial. Eligibility will be limited&#xD;
      to women expressing wish to breastfeed, with singleton gestations, delivering &gt; 37 weeks with&#xD;
      no other maternal/neonatal significant morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and group assignment -Women meeting inclusion criteria who own a smartphone will&#xD;
      be approached for recruitment on postpartum day 1. After obtaining a written informed&#xD;
      consent, patients will be randomly assigned either to the intervention group (smartphone&#xD;
      group) or to the control group in a 1:1 ratio. A blocked randomization scheme will be created&#xD;
      using a computer-generated list of random numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The routine prenatal care provided by our institute includes lactation consulting during the&#xD;
      48-72 hour postpartum hospitalization. Patients allocated to the control group will receive&#xD;
      the aforementioned care. Patients assigned to the smartphone group will receive our standard&#xD;
      care, and in addition will have an application installed to their smartphones. This&#xD;
      application will be in Hebrew language, simple to use, and specifically designed to the needs&#xD;
      of the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive a demonstration regarding the use of the application from one of&#xD;
      our research coordinators, in addition to a detailed information brochure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the patient will receive via email an individualized feedback from our team regarding her&#xD;
      lactation. This feedback could include: reassurance and positive feedback and lactation tips&#xD;
      in attempt to optimize specific obstacles. In addition, patients will be encouraged to use&#xD;
      the platform to ask questions and receive immediate answers regarding any aspect lactation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome- Lactation at 3 months postpartum Secondary outcomes Full/partial lactation&#xD;
      at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months and a variety of outcomes regarding&#xD;
      neonatal health, maternal health, emotional status and satisfaction.&#xD;

    <description>application installed to their smartphones. This application will be in Hebrew language, simple to use, and specifically designed to the needs of the current study.&#xD;
Each patient will document each evening her lactation performance during the day, and the App will generate a daily report transmitted by email every evening to our computerized research database. Every evening the patient will receive via email an individualized feedback from our team regarding her lactation. This feedback could include: reassurance and positive feedback and lactation tips in attempt to optimize specific obstacles. In addition, patients will be encouraged to use the platform to ask questions and receive immediate answers regarding any aspect lactation. As per the study protocol, medical treatment will only be initiated in a formal clinic appointment and not via the application.</description>
