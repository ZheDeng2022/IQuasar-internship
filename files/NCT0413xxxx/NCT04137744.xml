      study patients; axillary node negative breast cancer female, 74 patients randomly allocated&#xD;
      in two groups each 37 patients , group I , where axillary reverse mapping(ARM) +ve nodes were&#xD;
      preserved and axillary lymph node dissection completed.and group II where axillary reverse&#xD;
      mapping +ve nodes were taken with axillary lymph node dissection(ALND) primary outcome is&#xD;
      histopathological examination of a ARM +ve lymph nodes and volume measurements of the&#xD;
      ipsilateral arm for development of lymphedema at 6 ,12 , and 24 months&#xD;

      This study is comparative clinical trial carried out in the period between February 2015 and&#xD;
      August 2019 on 74 female patients with early breast cancer. All patients were informed and&#xD;
      signed a written consent. The study was approved from institutional review board (IRB) and&#xD;
      ethical committee of our university.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection Patients included in the study are female patients above 18 years old,&#xD;
      known breast cancer with clinically negative nodal metastasis who were admitted for&#xD;
      completion ALND, after positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients excluded from the study are those who had received chemotherapy for breast cancer,&#xD;
      recurrent cases after conservative breast surgery, bilateral disease and pregnant cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly divided into two equal groups each 37 patients, group A; (ARM&#xD;
      preserving ALND), where arm lymphatics and lymph nodes were identified and preserved,&#xD;
      subsequently ALND was completed, group B; where arm lymphatics and lymph nodes were&#xD;
      identified, marked and removed with ALND.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technical procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Axillary reverse mapping (ARM) procedure; one to two ml of methylene blue dye was&#xD;
      subcutaneously injected in the upper medial arm in the groove between biceps muscle and&#xD;
      triceps muscle then subsequently the area of injection was massaged for 5 minutes. During&#xD;
      axillary dissection the (ARM) positive lymphatics and lymph nodes were identified and&#xD;
      carefully dissected as the lymphatic vessels are very delicate, in group A the (ARM) positive&#xD;
      lymphatics and lymph nodes were preserved and axillary clearance was completed, in group B&#xD;
      (ARM) positive lymphatics and lymph nodes were identified, dissected, marked and taken out&#xD;
      with ALND. The procedures were carried out with oncological surgeons familial with ALND. The&#xD;
      limits of axillary dissection was axillary vein from above, lateral border subscapularis&#xD;
      muscle laterally and medial border of pectoralis minor medially, long thoracic and lateral&#xD;
      thoracic nerves were preserved intercostobrachial nerve wasn't preserved in all cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preoperative data including demographic criteria, histopathological findings of breast&#xD;
           biopsy and SLNB, preoperative measurement of arm volume by water displacement,&#xD;
           circumferential measurement of the arm at the metacarpopharyngeal level, wrist level, 10&#xD;
           cm and 15 cm distal and proximal to the lateral epicondyle respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  State of ARM positive or negative&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow up was carried out on outpatient clinic basis, monthly in the first 6 months then&#xD;
           every 3 months for 2 years for data collection and later dates for regular follow up.&#xD;
           Data was recorded including ARM histopathology (considered as the primary outcome),&#xD;
           development of lymphedema defined as increase in arm volume by 10 % of the original&#xD;
           size, tingling, numbness, paraesthesia and restricted shoulder movement were considered&#xD;
           secondary outcome. Shoulder movement restriction was calculated by decrease of abduction&#xD;
           by 10 degrees in comparison to the contralateral arm, development of local axillary&#xD;
           recurrences, arm volume was measured at 6,12 and 24 months by water displacement method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected data was properly analyzed using the proper statistical methods in SPSS 21&#xD;
      package.&#xD;
