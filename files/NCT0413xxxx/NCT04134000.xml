  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) are usually managed by&#xD;
      transurethral resection of their bladder tumor (TURBT) alone plus additional intravesical&#xD;
      therapy to deliver high local concentrations of a therapeutic agent within the bladder,&#xD;
      potentially destroying viable tumor cells that remain following TURBT. Although the exact&#xD;
      mechanism of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) antitumor action is unknown, its intravesical&#xD;
      instillation triggers a variety of local immune responses, which appear to correlate with&#xD;
      antitumor activity. BCG induction plus maintenance is the current, guideline-recommended&#xD;
      standard of care for high-risk NMIBC. Both recent evidence and guidelines suggest that&#xD;
      full-dose BCG maintenance after the first BCG dose of induction course as used in the SWOG&#xD;
      8507 and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 30911 and 30962&#xD;
      trials, is the most appropriate maintenance schedule. High-risk NMIBC patients following&#xD;
      adequate treatment have a recurrence rate at 1 and 2 years of 25 and 30% respectively after&#xD;
      treatment with the current standard (BCG), which is clearly unsatisfactory. Programmed death&#xD;
      ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a surface glycoprotein that functions as an inhibitor of T-cells and&#xD;
      plays a crucial role in suppression of cellular immune response. It is implicated in tumor&#xD;
      immune escape by inducing apoptosis of activated antigen-specific CD8 T-cells, impairing&#xD;
      cytokine production and diminishing the toxicity of activated T-cells. PD-L1 expression by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry using the Ventana SP142 assay on tumor-infiltrating immune cell (IC)&#xD;
      status defined by the percentage of PD-L1 positive ICs: IC0 (&lt;1%); IC1 (≥1% but&lt;5%); and&#xD;
      IC2/3 (≥5%PD-L1) has been demonstrated to be higher (IC2/3) in resection and TURBT specimens&#xD;
      versus biopsies from primary lesions or metastatic sites. In patients with metastatic bladder&#xD;
      cancer, treatment with the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab (1200 mg, every 3 weeks) resulted in&#xD;
      objective response rates of 26% in the IC2/3 group, 18% in the IC1/2/3 group and 15% in all&#xD;
      patients. The median overall survival was 11.4 months in the IC2/3 group, 8.8 months in the&#xD;
      IC1/2/3, and 7.9 months in all patients. Grade 3-4 related treatment-related adverse events&#xD;
      occurred in 16% and grade 3-4 immune-mediated adverse events occurred in 5% of treated&#xD;
      patients. In murine models with invasive bladder cancer, anti-PD-1 plus CpG has shown to&#xD;
      increase survival in mice, with anti-PD-1 plus CpG being superior to either agent alone.&#xD;
      Taken together, these results confirmed the clinical activity of atezolizumab in metastatic&#xD;
      bladder cancer, which could be beneficial in patients with NMIBC in combination with standard&#xD;
      approaches such as BCG.&#xD;
