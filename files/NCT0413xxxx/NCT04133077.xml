  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient derived xenografts (PDX) from mammary tumors are usually made from metastatic tumors.&#xD;
      Indeed, PDX from primitive mammary tumors or after neoadjuvant treatment are still rare.&#xD;
      However, the realization of such PDX (from primitive mammary tumors or after neoadjuvant&#xD;
      treatment) would make it possible to have a better knowledge of the tumor heterogeneity to&#xD;
      the therapeutic response, to explore the models of tumor evolution during metastatic&#xD;
      progression and also observe the mechanisms of tumor resistance in the case of non-metastatic&#xD;
      tumors. It therefore seems necessary to develop PDX from primitive tumors in order to observe&#xD;
      firstly the success rate of PDX; on the other hand, the drift of the initial heterogeneity,&#xD;
      measured by comparison of the histomolecular profile of the tumors with that of the PDXs. It&#xD;
      aims to develop xenografts from tumor samples from surgical specimens of patients with triple&#xD;
      negative or luminal B breast cancer.&#xD;
