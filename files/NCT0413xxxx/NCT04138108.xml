      The objective of this study was to determine the effect of psychoeducation on the stress&#xD;
      levels of parents of children with Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). This&#xD;
      was a randomised controlled study and applied the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials&#xD;
      (CONSORT) statement. A total of 172 parents (experimental group: 86, control group: 86)&#xD;
      participated in the study, which was planned as an experimental (randomized controlled, with&#xD;
      pre-test-post-test control group, follow-up) study. Both the mothers and fathers were&#xD;
      included in the psychoeducation program for parents which was delivered in two sessions per&#xD;
      week. The study was evaluated before the first session, after the second session and at the&#xD;
      6th month. Data were collected using the Personal Information Form and Caregiver Stress Scale&#xD;
      (CSS). Mean, standard deviation, number and percentage, minimum, maximum, homogeneity tests&#xD;
      and the chi-square test were used for data analysis.&#xD;

      Psychoeducation given to the parents of the children with ADHD reduce parental stress, but&#xD;
      these reduces are not proven for parents of the children with ADHD. The objective of this&#xD;
      study was to determine the effect of psychoeducation on the stress levels of parents of&#xD;
      children with Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). This was a randomised&#xD;
      controlled study and applied the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)&#xD;
      statement. A total of 172 parents (experimental group: 86, control group: 86) participated in&#xD;
      the study, which was planned as an experimental (randomized controlled, with&#xD;
      pre-test-post-test control group, follow-up) study. Both the mothers and fathers were&#xD;
      included in the psychoeducation program for parents which was delivered in two sessions per&#xD;
      week. The study was evaluated before the first session, after the second session and at the&#xD;
      6th month. Data were collected using the Personal Information Form and Caregiver Stress Scale&#xD;
      (CSS). Mean, standard deviation, number and percentage, minimum, maximum, homogeneity tests&#xD;
      and the chi-square test were used for data analysis. The mean scores obtained from the scales&#xD;
      before and after the training were compared with the paired-t test and student t test between&#xD;
      the groups. There was no significant difference between the mean pre-test scores of the&#xD;
      parents in the experimental and control groups on the whole CSS (p&lt;0.005). Significant&#xD;
      differences were found between the scores before and after the psychoeducation, and their&#xD;
      six-month follow-up scores (p&lt;0.001). There were significant differences between the pre- and&#xD;
      post-test scores, pre-test scores and six-month follow-up scores, and post-test scores and&#xD;
      six-month follow-up scores of the parents in the experimental group according to the in-group&#xD;
      comparisons (p&gt;0.05). It was determined that psychoeducation given to parents of children&#xD;
      with ADHD reduced parental stress.&#xD;

    <description>The parents of each child were educated as couples and each training session lasted 45-60 minutes for each family. Approximately the first five minutes of the training were used for warm-up, 25 minutes were used for basic ADHD knowledge and the last 15 minutes were catechetic and conducted interactively. The psychoeducation included discussion about the causes, symptoms and signs of ADHD, the course and characteristics of the disease according to age, the treatment process, the drugs used in the treatment and their side effects, correct and incorrect information about drugs, the other symptoms which can coexist with ADHD and their treatment, and what the parents can do about these issues.</description>
