  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this research study is to determine if the use of a nutritional&#xD;
      supplement and exercise improve or worsen cachexia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigator would like to better understand how cachexia may improve or&#xD;
      worsen, and how exercise and nutritional supplements may impact this process. The&#xD;
      investigator would like to see whether a nutritional supplement (Remune) with or without a&#xD;
      walking and progressive resistance exercise program (EXCAP©®, Exercise for Cancer Patients)&#xD;
      can improve symptoms in patients with lung or gastrointestinal cancers with weight loss and&#xD;
      cachexia. The investigator would also like to find out if this nutritional supplement and&#xD;
      exercise intervention improves physical performance, day-to-day function, quality of life,&#xD;
      and how the supplement and/or exercise may affect different markers in the blood over time.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of subjects that improve physical function- Walking</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>6 minute walk test distance; Participants are given a short warm up and cool down walking protocol in the test walking area in the University. During the 6-minute walk, participants will be asked to wear a sensor that will measure movement ability. The sensor is secured by an ergonomic belt around the participant's waist and allows for free body movement and comfort. Participants walk for a total of 6 minutes and cover as much distance as they can during this time. Upon completion of the test, the total distance walked is used to measure physical performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of subjects that improve physical function- Power</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Power will be assessed by the Stair Climb Performance Test (SCPT) which is performed by having subjects safely ascend a flight of stairs (approximately 10 stairs total) as quick and as safely as possible with supervision. The subject can use the handrail as a safety precaution if deemed necessary by the patient, physician, coordinator, or exercise physiologist. Power is calculated by force (calculated by body mass and acceleration due to gravity) multiplied by the velocity (distance/time).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of subjects that improve physical function- Muscle Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Muscular strength will be assessed objectively using The Handgrip Dynamometer Test. The Handgrip Dynamometer Test is a grip strength test used to assess the maximal voluntary contraction generated by the arm muscles. The test is administered with the patient standing with the elbow joint angle held constant at 180 degrees and the medial distal humeral epicondyle held 2 inches from the torso. Trials will be performed in an alternating bilateral sequence, for a total of six attempts (three with each arm). The best score of the three hand-grip trials will be used for right and left limbs to calculate static strength.</description>
