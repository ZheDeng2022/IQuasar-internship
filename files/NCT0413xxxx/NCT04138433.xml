  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most of us take being able to communicate for granted. Anomia (word finding problems) after&#xD;
      stroke can cause profound frustration and anxiety for patients and families. Some people&#xD;
      recover; many don't. ~ 250,000 people in the UK have chronic speech and language problems&#xD;
      post-stroke. This project will investigate how treatment for these people might be improved.&#xD;
      The brain's speech areas can be stimulated using transcranial direct current stimulation&#xD;
      (tDCS). The kit is simple; a battery powering electrodes placed on the scalp. Healthy people&#xD;
      who had tDCS while naming pictures could find words quicker and their speech areas responded&#xD;
      more efficiently. How it affects aphasic stroke patients' brain function is unknown.&#xD;

      All suitable participants will be living in the community and may have already consented to&#xD;
      previous research projects and their details identified via the UCLH Aphasia Clinic run by&#xD;
      the CI, which will act as an NHS PIC, or via the stroke volunteer database at the Wellcome&#xD;
      Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, run by Professor Cathy Price (Research approved by the&#xD;
      National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery and the Institute of Neurology joint ethics&#xD;
      committee, study number: NO32.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial approach to potential participants for this project will be made by The Chief&#xD;
      Investigator Dr Jenny Crinion. If the participant agrees a member of the team will discuss&#xD;
      with them the details of the project. Patient groups may be approached directly by the CI and&#xD;
      RAs via stroke clubs etc. All participants will be formally consented at UCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy subjects will be recruited by the CI and RAs via the volunteer database at the WTCN&#xD;
      or ICN, and by asking relatives/carers of the patients if they wish to be involved (more&#xD;
      likely to be matched for age and other factors). Potential participants in research databases&#xD;
      have already consented to be approached for further research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Activation and modulation of residual inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in aphasia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: to examine connectivity within regions of the brain associated with spoken word&#xD;
      retrieval (a &quot;domain-specific&quot; process) and more general cognitive control (&quot;domain-general&quot;&#xD;
      processing) in aphasic stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: following aphasic stroke a functionally selective network core for spoken word&#xD;
      naming (i.e. domain specific for language) lies within (i) Broca's area, in patients with&#xD;
      brain lesions sparing Broca's area (ii) right inferior frontal gyrus, in patients with damage&#xD;
      to Broca's area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design and predictions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a chronic speech and language impairment (aphasia) following stroke will be&#xD;
      divided into those with lesions affecting Broca's area, and those whose lesions lie&#xD;
      elsewhere. They will receive brain stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation&#xD;
      (tDCS, which involves placing battery-operated electrodes on the participant's scalp), or&#xD;
      sham stimulation, while completing an object naming task (to test domain-specific processing)&#xD;
      and a non-linguistic task which measures performance related to domain-general cognitive&#xD;
      processing. Both tasks will have &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;easy&quot; levels which are matched for difficulty&#xD;
      across tasks. In the naming task, difficulty will be manipulated by providing different types&#xD;
      of cues to assist with object naming. Extensive piloting of the stimuli and procedure in both&#xD;
      healthy participants and aphasic stroke patients will ensure that the tests are suitable for&#xD;
      the proposed research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete the experiment in an MRI scanner in order to measure brain&#xD;
      activity in the domain-specific and domain-general neural networks during the linguistic and&#xD;
      non-linguistic tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      List of all data to be collected&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Personal demographic data including: sex, age, contact details etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical data including: aphasic syndrome subtype, time since onset of symptoms, past&#xD;
           medical history, current medications, contra-indications to MRI/fMRI/tDCS, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Language assessment scores (CAT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Naming scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. fMRI responses when speaking and at rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. High-resolution structural MRI scans to define area and volume of infarct&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Side-effects from stimulation/sham (Adverse Event data).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Consent forms. The non-functional imaging data will be recorded on a Case Report Form&#xD;
           (CRF) kept by the CI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection/Storage&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any data initially collected on paper will be transferred to electronic format. The paper&#xD;
      data (including a copy of the consent form) is stored in a locked cabinet at the ICN which&#xD;
      only the CI and named collaborators will have access to. The electronic data is password&#xD;
      protected and pseudoanonymized. The CI will be the custodian of the data after the trial is&#xD;
      completed. Data will be kept for 10 years after the completion of the study, in line with UCL&#xD;
      policy. The functional/structural imaging data (5, 6) will be stored indefinitely at the&#xD;
      WTCN, this will be password protected. These are extremely rich data sets and may be used in&#xD;
      future analyses/metanalyses. Only members of the research team will have access to the data.&#xD;
      The CI will act as custodian of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and Auditing&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Chief Investigator will ensure there are adequate quality and number of monitoring&#xD;
      activities conducted by the study team. This will include adherence to the protocol,&#xD;
      procedures for consenting and ensure adequate data quality. The Chief Investigator will&#xD;
      inform the sponsor should he/she have concerns which have arisen from monitoring activities,&#xD;
      and/or if there are problems with oversight/monitoring procedures. An independent data&#xD;
      monitoring committee (DMC) will be set up to deal with patient safety issues related to this&#xD;
      project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data to be monitored by the DMC will include: language outcome scores (CAT) and Adverse&#xD;
      Event Recording Forms. All adverse events will be recorded by the CI and passed on to the DMC&#xD;
      and will follow the UCL protocol for reporting of adverse events in a single centre trial.&#xD;
      The main function of the committee will be to determine if there is an excess of seizures&#xD;
      (adverse events) in either patient group. There are no plans to stop the project early unless&#xD;
      this is due to an excess of adverse events.&#xD;
