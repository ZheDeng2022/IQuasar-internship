    <textblock>
      Rationale and relevance for patients and the scientific community. In low risk early stage&#xD;
      patients ≥70 years, exclusive Partial Breast Irradiation (PBI) as radiation therapy (RT)&#xD;
      approach might be superior in terms of Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), when compared&#xD;
      to exclusive endocrine therapy (ET) following breast-conserving surgery (BCS). Assuming an&#xD;
      equal rate of disease control, unnecessary long-term toxicity of ET may be avoided.&#xD;

      Study Background. BCS has been established as the preferred treatment option for early stage&#xD;
      breast cancer (BC) or for initially inoperable tumors that respond sufficiently to&#xD;
      preoperative therapy. BCS plus RT obtains at least the same results in terms of survival,&#xD;
      without the huge impact on the patient's body image and HRQoL as that seen after mastectomy.&#xD;
      For decades, standard whole breast irradiation (WBI) consisted of 45-50 Gy delivered at&#xD;
      1.8-2.0 Gy/fraction over 4.5-5 weeks with or without a boost dose to the surgical bed. Large&#xD;
      phase 3 trials evaluating different hypofractionation schedules proved that overall treatment&#xD;
      time could be reduced without compromising local control and safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PBI has been introduced as an alternative treatment method for selected patients with early&#xD;
      stage BC. Potential advantages of accelerated PBI include shorter treatment time, equivalent&#xD;
      disease control, improved safety profile, and cost reduction as compared to standard WBI. The&#xD;
      role of PBI has been investigated in large-scale prospective phase 3 clinical trials (i.e.,&#xD;
      NSABP-B29/RTOG 0413, IRMA, RAPID, IMPORT-LOW, GEC-ESTRO trials).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5-year results of the IMPORT-LOW trial showed non-inferiority of PBI when compared to WBI in&#xD;
      women with low risk early BC, with a 5-year local recurrence (LR) rate of 0.5%. Ongoing&#xD;
      research explores other modalities of RT that will minimize toxicities without reducing&#xD;
      effectiveness. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has the theoretical advantage of a&#xD;
      further increase in dose conformity compared with three-dimensional techniques, with&#xD;
      increased normal tissue sparing. To date, only the Florence IMRT-APBI phase 3 trial reported&#xD;
      the outcomes of exclusive IMRT accelerated PBI compared to WBI, demonstrating no significant&#xD;
      difference between the two groups in terms of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences (IBTR).&#xD;
      The PBI group presented significantly better results considering acute (p=0.0001), late&#xD;
      (p=0.004), and cosmetic outcome (p=0.045). The subgroup analysis evaluating patients aged 70&#xD;
      years or older, showed a 5-year IBTR rate of 1.9% for both groups, and significantly better&#xD;
      results in terms of acute skin toxicity, in favor of the PBI arm. Therefore, a significant&#xD;
      impact on patients' compliance to RT could translate into a consistent improvement of overall&#xD;
      HRQoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart exposure to ionizing radiation during RT for BC increases subsequent rates of ischemic&#xD;
      heart disease (IHD). The increase is proportional to the mean dose to the heart. Women with&#xD;
      pre-existing cardiac risk factors have greater absolute increases in risk from RT. An age &gt;70&#xD;
      years seems to be one of the most significant factor for IHD occurrence. PBI represents one&#xD;
      of several effective strategies to reduce cardiac radiation dose when compared to WBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative RT in the elderly is a matter of constant debate. RT was shown to benefit these&#xD;
      patients with regards to local control; however, the absolute benefit is small (for low risk&#xD;
      subtypes). Moreover, considering the poor compliance of elderly patients to conventional RT&#xD;
      treatment time (3-6 weeks), conventional RT is often omitted in cases of low-risk BC, at the&#xD;
      expense of reducing the local control rate by less than 4%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an unplanned subgroup analysis of the PRIME-II trial by estrogen receptor (ER) score, LR&#xD;
      at 5 years for women in the rich ER subgroup was lower than in the whole population; for&#xD;
      patients assigned no RT, 3% had a LR compared with 1% of women allocated WBI (5-year IBTR was&#xD;
      3.3%, and 1.2%, respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The British Association of Surgical Oncology (BASO)-II trial confirmed that patients treated&#xD;
      with either exclusive adjuvant RT or ET with tamoxifen had an equivalent LR rate per year of&#xD;
      0.8%. These data suggested that RT or ET alone resulted in excellent disease control in older&#xD;
      women with early BC, and that the combination of treatments may have less benefit than&#xD;
      expected. A direct comparison between PBI or ET omission as adjuvant treatment is lacking in&#xD;
      the existing literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conversely, the toxicity profile of ET is well known, and could significantly impact long&#xD;
      term HRQoL of these potentially frail patients. Elderly patients with early BC are a unique&#xD;
      population with regards to good prognosis and potential comorbidities, thus minimizing&#xD;
      treatment to maintain HRQoL without compromising survival is extremely important. In the&#xD;
      decision-making process for adjuvant therapy, estimates of the patient's risk of benefit&#xD;
      and/or harm with treatment should be performed together with an assessment of baseline&#xD;
      comorbidities, life expectancy and care preferences. Many large phase III studies reported on&#xD;
      the detrimental effects of postmenopausal ET on bone density and fractures incidence,&#xD;
      thromboembolic complications, sexual, and cognitive functionality. Moreover, patient's&#xD;
      compliance and oral treatment adherence may be a concern, and some patients would like to&#xD;
      avoid the toxicities associated with ET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering that the potential benefit of PBI alone could be better than that of the RT-only&#xD;
      effect reported in the above WBI-using trials, it may be possible to avoid the long term&#xD;
      toxicity of ET and favorably impact HRQoL in selected patients, such as elderly patients with&#xD;
      a good prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, all previously published de-escalation studies were designed and performed in&#xD;
      order to evaluate RT omission, regardless of efficacy and compliance of ET. When expecting a&#xD;
      comparable efficacy among tested treatment modalities, HRQoL might be the factor with the&#xD;
      most influence on the treatment decision-making process and should therefore be the primary&#xD;
      endpoint.&#xD;

    <description>EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) C30.The QLQ-C30 is a cancer HRQoL questionnaire using PROMs for individual patient management. It includes five function domains (physical, emotional, social, role, cognitive), eight symptoms (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, insomnia, dyspnea, and appetite loss), as well as global health/quality-of-life and financial impact. Subjects respond on a four-point scale from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very much&quot; for most items. Raw scores are linearly converted to a 0-100 scale with higher scores reflecting higher levels of function and higher levels of symptom burden.</description>
