  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single dose study was designed in accordance with EMA (the European Medicines Agency)&#xD;
      regulatory guidelines, with the aim of characterizing the bioavailability of olmesartan&#xD;
      medoxomil/ hydrochlorothiazide in the two formulations (Olmesartan Medoxomil/&#xD;
      Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), 40 mg/ 25 mg film-coated tablets (Manufacturer: Pharmtechnology&#xD;
      LLC, Republic of Belarus) and Olmetec PlusÂ® (Olmesartan Medoxomil/ Hydrochlorothiazide), 40&#xD;
      mg/25 mg film-coated tablets, (Manufacturer: Daiichi Sankyo Europe GmbH, Germany)) in healthy&#xD;
      subjects. As this is a bioequivalence trial where each subject received each study treatment&#xD;
      in a crossover fashion, a control group was not included. Within the clinical portion of the&#xD;
      study each subject received a single oral dose of the test and the reference formulation in&#xD;
      compliance with the generated randomization code. The primary study endpoints were the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters Cmax and AUC0-t of olmesartan and hydrochlorothiazide.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, single dose, laboratory-blinded, 2-period, 2-sequence,&#xD;
      crossover study design, in which 32 healthy adult subjects received one of the study&#xD;
      treatments during each study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine the bioequivalence of two different formulations&#xD;
      of olmesartan medoxomil/ HCTZ after a single oral dose administration under fasting&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intra-subject variation following a single dose of olmesartan/ HCTZ appears to be around&#xD;
      25% for Cmax and around 18% for AUC0-T for olmesartan and around 18% for Cmax and around 13%&#xD;
      for AUC0-T for HCTZ. Statistically, given that the expected Test to Reference ratio of&#xD;
      geometric LSmeans should fall within 95 and 105%, it is estimated that the lowest number of&#xD;
      subjects to meet the 80 to 125% bioequivalence range for each analyte with a statistical a&#xD;
      priori power of at least 80% is about 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the inclusion of 32 subjects should be sufficient to account for the possibility&#xD;
      of drop-outs, variations around the estimated intra-subject CV and to conclude in favor of&#xD;
      the hypothesis of bioequivalence with sufficient statistical power. A Caucasian population&#xD;
      will be enrolled to minimize variability and optimize detection of differences between the&#xD;
      Test and Reference formulations without regard to race.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject eligibility for this study will be determined at the screening visit and eligible&#xD;
      subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit at least 10 hours prior to drug&#xD;
      administration for each study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standbys should be recruited and available to replace any subject who withdraws prior to the&#xD;
      first drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On-study drop-outs will not be replaced. Altasciences will generate the randomization code&#xD;
      with a computer program according to the study design, the number of subjects and the&#xD;
      sequence of treatment administration. The random allocation of each sequence of treatment&#xD;
      administration to each subject will be done in such a way that the study is balanced. Once&#xD;
      generated, the randomization code will be final and will not be modified. Eligible subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized to one of two treatment sequences. There will be two sequences in the&#xD;
      study: AB and BA, where A = the test product, B = the reference product (see detailed&#xD;
      description of A and B items in Section &quot;Arms and Interventions&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each study period, subjects will receive a single 40 mg/25 mg oral dose of olmesartan&#xD;
      medoxomil/HCTZ, under fasting conditions and undergo a 48-hour PK sample collection. Study&#xD;
      participants will be aware they will receive different formulations of the same drug, without&#xD;
      being informed which product (Test or Reference) is being administered. The date and time of&#xD;
      each dose will be recorded. For each subject, all scheduled postdose activities and&#xD;
      assessments will be performed relative to the time of study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will fast overnight (no food or drink except water), for a minimum of 10 hours prior&#xD;
      to dosing. Fasting will continue for at least 4 hours following drug administration, after&#xD;
      which a standardized lunch will be served. A supper and a light snack will be served at&#xD;
      appropriate times thereafter, but not before 9 hours after dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Water will be provided as needed until 1 hour predose. Water will be allowed beginning 1 hour&#xD;
      after the administration of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 42 blood samples will be collected (1 tube of 3 mL for olmesartan and 1 tube of 3&#xD;
      mL for HCTZ at each time point) in each study period for PK assessments. The first blood&#xD;
      sample will be collected prior to drug administration while the others will be collected up&#xD;
      to 48 hours after drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that olmesartan medoxomil is rapidly and completely converted to the pharmacologically&#xD;
      active metabolite, olmesartan, and that no intact olmesartan medoxomil or intact side chain&#xD;
      medoxomil moiety have been detected in plasma1,2, olmesartan medoxomil cannot be reliably&#xD;
      measured. Therefore, the analytes to be measured in the study will be olmesartan and&#xD;
      hydrochlorothiazide. Olmesatran and HCTZ plasma concentrations will be measured according to&#xD;
      validated bioanalytical methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are to be discharged from the clinic after the 24-hour postdose PK sample&#xD;
      collection, and following medical approval. However, they may be advised to stay at the&#xD;
      clinical site for safety reasons, if judged necessary by the physician in charge. Subjects&#xD;
      will return to the clinic for blood collections at 48 hours postdose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected terminal half-life values observed after a single oral 40 mg/25 mg dose of&#xD;
      olmesartan medoxomil/HCTZ film-coated tablet under fasting conditions are 8.6 hours for&#xD;
      olmesartan and 10.3 hours for HCTZ. To avoid any carry-over effect, a wash-out of 7 calendar&#xD;
      days is planned between drug administrations, corresponding to more than 16 times the&#xD;
      expected half-life of the moieties to be measured. The decision of which subjects will be&#xD;
      included in the PK analysis is to be documented by the pharmacokineticist (or delegate) and&#xD;
      approved by the sponsor before the start of the sample analysis by the bioanalytical&#xD;
      facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who are expected to provide evaluable PK data for both the Test and Reference&#xD;
      products (based on viable PK samples) will be included in the pharmacokinetic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concentration data of the remaining subjects will be presented separately. Subjects who do&#xD;
      not complete the sampling schedule of one or more study periods may be included in the PK and&#xD;
      statistical analysis and bioequivalence determination for only the PK parameters that are&#xD;
      judged not to be affected by the missing sample(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of Tmax will be based on a non-parametric approach. Statistical analysis&#xD;
      of all other PK parameters will be based on an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) model. Two-sided&#xD;
      90% confidence interval of the ratio of geometric Least-Square means (LSmeans) obtained from&#xD;
      the ln transformed PK parameters will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical inference of olmesartan and HCTZ will be based on a bioequivalence approach using&#xD;
      the following standards: the ratio of geometric LSmeans with corresponding 90% confidence&#xD;
      interval calculated from the exponential of the difference between the Test and the Reference&#xD;
      for the ln-transformed parameters Cmax and AUC0-T should all be within the 80.00 to 125.00%&#xD;
      bioequivalence range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety population will include all subjects who received at least one dose of one of the&#xD;
      IPs. Safety assessments will include vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and AE&#xD;
      monitoring. Additional safety measurements may be performed at the discretion of the&#xD;
      investigator for reasons related to subject safety. The physician in charge will be present&#xD;
      at the clinical site for at least the first 4 hours following each drug administration and&#xD;
      will remain available at all times throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total study duration: up to 38 days (including screening).&#xD;
