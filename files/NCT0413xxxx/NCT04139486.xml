      In the VECTOR trial, the aim is to analyze, in case of SVS+ occlusions, a first line Embotrap&#xD;
      II added to CA combined strategy compare to CA alone strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many practitioners are convinced that a first line strategy with CA alone is easy, safe,&#xD;
      rapid and efficient. Maybe, after two, three, four ... passes and with the secondary help of&#xD;
      a combined strategy, a high rate of eTICI 2b/3 could be reached with a CA first line&#xD;
      strategy. But this could go with a higher number of passes, a waste of time and a suboptimal&#xD;
      angiographic results (eTICI 2b) due to distal emboli, especially in case of friable, non-well&#xD;
      organized, red blood cell rich (RBC) i.e. SVS + thrombi (25-28). This could, be related to&#xD;
      worst clinical outcome at 3 months. VECTOR asks a relevant question: Do the invetigators have&#xD;
      to add the use of an Embotrap II or III to the CA, from the first passes, in case of SVS+&#xD;
      clots?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sudden occlusion of an intracranial artery by a thrombus represents the initial and pivotal&#xD;
      event of large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The primary goal of AIS&#xD;
      treatment is to re-open this artery with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator&#xD;
      infusion (IV t-PA) and/or endovascular therapy (EVT). Thrombus characterization could be&#xD;
      useful to predict AIS etiology, IV t-PA response and to adapt the device or technique for&#xD;
      EVT. Especially, approaching the red blood cell (RBC) content of the thrombus would be&#xD;
      helpful to plan a treatment strategy or identify specific EVT approaches in order to maximize&#xD;
      the rate of early successful reperfusion .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The susceptibility vessel sign (SVS) on T2*-MRI sequence is defined as a hypo-intense signal&#xD;
      exceeding the diameter of the contralateral artery located at the site of the thrombus.&#xD;
      Several studies have demonstrated SVS to be a negative predictor of early reperfusion after&#xD;
      IV t-PA and an incentive to EVT . Two studies identified a correlation between the SVS and&#xD;
      the thrombus composition (specifically the RBC composition). In the ASTER trial, the presence&#xD;
      of SVS impacted the success rate of the EVT strategy. In the SVS (+) sub-population of this&#xD;
      study, compared to contact aspiration (CA), patients treated with stent retrievers achieved&#xD;
      higher rates of complete reperfusion within fewer passes, which translated into a better&#xD;
      functional outcome. In the absence of SVS, no differences were observed between the two&#xD;
      techniques. Furthermore; based on the ASTER and THRACE trial populations treated with stent&#xD;
      retriever as a first line strategy, a higher rate of favorable clinical outcome at 3 months&#xD;
      in SVS (+) patients was recently found . Hence, that differences in terms of reperfusion&#xD;
      results are thought to be related to different clot compositions between SVS + and SVS -&#xD;
      occlusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the VECTOR trial, the aim is to analyze, in case of SVS+ occlusions, a first line Embotrap&#xD;
      II added to CA combined strategy compare to CA alone strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many practitioners are convinced that a first line strategy with CA alone is easy, safe,&#xD;
      rapid and efficient. Maybe, after two, three, four passes and with the secondary help of a&#xD;
      combined strategy, a high rate of eTICI 2b/3 could be reached with a CA first line strategy.&#xD;
      But this could go with a higher number of passes, a waste of time and a suboptimal&#xD;
      angiographic results (eTICI 2b) due to distal emboli, especially in case of friable, non-well&#xD;
      organized, red blood cell rich (RBC) i.e. SVS + thrombi. This could, be related to worst&#xD;
      clinical outcome at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VECTOR asks a relevant question: Do the investigators have to add the use of an Embotrap II&#xD;
      or III to the CA, from the first passes, in case of SVS+ clots? The hypothesis in the VECTOR&#xD;
      trial is that the Embotrap II or III, thanks to its dedicated design will help to the&#xD;
      stabilization of friable clots and allow better retrieving of SVS + thrombi in a lower number&#xD;
      of passes.&#xD;

    <description>Preliminary data suggested in case of SVS+ occlusions a superiority of the first line SR strategy in terms of eTICI2c/3 after 3 passes compared to first line CA alone.The first pass (FPE) is an ambitious technical endpoint defined as a successful reperfusion obtained after the first pass that has been recently associated with an increased probability of favorable clinical outcome, a reduced mortality rate and procedural adverse events.However, this constitutes a &quot;very technical&quot; endpoint and the external validity in daily practice would be reduced compared to the three passes cut-off.Even if a FPE eTICI 2b, 2c or 3 has shown better clinical outcome compared to a final eTICI 2b, 2c or 3,there is no study that has proved the better clinical outcome when compared FPE eTICI 2b,2c or 3 to three passes eTICI 2b,2c or 3.Last, there was no preliminary data that suggests in case of SVS+ occlusions, a superiority of the first pass SR strategy in terms eTICI2c/3 compared to first pass CA alone.</description>
