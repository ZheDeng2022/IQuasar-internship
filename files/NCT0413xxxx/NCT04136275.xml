    <textblock>
      This research study is studying Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-37 T Cells (CAR-37 T Cells)&#xD;
      for treating people with relapsed or refractory CD37+ hematologic malignancies and to&#xD;
      understand the side effects when treated with CAR-37 T Cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-37 T Cells (CAR-37 T Cells) is an investigational treatment&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part, non randomized, open label, single site Phase 1 study. Participants who&#xD;
      fulfill eligibility criteria will be entered into the trial Chimeric Antigen Receptor&#xD;
      (CAR)-37 T Cells (CAR-37 T Cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part A (Dose Escalation): The investigators are looking the highest dose of the study&#xD;
           intervention that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects&#xD;
           in participants that have relapsed or refractory CD37+ hematologic malignancies, not&#xD;
           everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the study&#xD;
           intervention. The dose given will depend on the number of participants who have been&#xD;
           enrolled prior and how well the dose was tolerated&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part B (Expansion Cohort): Part B: Expansion Cohort: Participants will be treated at the&#xD;
           respective dose (at or below the Maximum Tolerated Dose), as determined during Part A&#xD;
           (Dose Escalation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A total of 18 participants will be enrolled to this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational&#xD;
      intervention to use for further studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being studied The U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) has not approved CAR-37 T Cells as a treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first time that CAR-37 T Cells will be given to humans&#xD;
