      Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the safety and immunogenicity&#xD;
      of the recombinant live attenuated tetravalent dengue virus vaccine admixture TV005 in the&#xD;
      elderly in Taiwan&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Taiwan, people who aged 50 to 70 years accounted for over 40% among those who infected by&#xD;
      dengue virus every year. Therefore, to understanding the immunogenicity and safety of TV005&#xD;
      vaccine among people aged 50 to 70 years is important for whether TV005 can be introduced&#xD;
      into Taiwan as a major intervention to control dengue. This trial is a phase II,&#xD;
      double-blind, multicenter, and placebo-controlled one. The investigators plan to enroll 252&#xD;
      subjects whose age are 50 to 70 years at four study sites. One single-dose TV005 vaccine or&#xD;
      placebo will be given subcutaneously. After vaccination, detailed data of the subjective&#xD;
      symptoms, physical examination, laboratory examination, and titer of neutralization antibody&#xD;
      from all subjects will be recorded. After completion of the present trial, the investigators&#xD;
      can clarify the immunogenicity and safety of TV005 among people aged 50 to 70 years.&#xD;
