  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first line therapy for an initial episode of CDI (Clostridium difficile infection) is&#xD;
      10-14 days of oral vancomycin which is now recommended over metronidazole in the 2018&#xD;
      guidelines from the Association of Medical Microbiologists and Infectious Diseases of Canada&#xD;
      (AMMI). Although response rates for the treatment of a first episode of CDI now approach 90%,&#xD;
      approximately 25% of patients who have a complete response will develop recurrence (rCDI)&#xD;
      within 8 weeks. Doctors' ability to predict recurrence is evolving, but remains very limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that by extending initial vancomycin therapy with a 2-week&#xD;
      tapering regimen this will reduce the risk of rCDI. Starting at the end of the initial 14&#xD;
      days of therapy, participants will be randomized to receive an additional 14-days of placebo&#xD;
      or vancomycin taper (125 mg orally twice daily x 7 days followed by 125 mg orally once daily&#xD;
      x 7 days). This taper was chosen as it represents two steps of a commonly used 4-week&#xD;
      vancomycin taper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' proposal to evaluate the extension of initial treatment from 14 to 28 days&#xD;
      with a tapering dose of vancomycin represents a practical clinical trial that capitalizes on&#xD;
      oral vancomycin's safety profile, worldwide availability, and relatively low cost.&#xD;

      STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-centre study involving institutions in British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec.&#xD;
      The study population will be drawn from patients cared for as inpatients or outpatients at&#xD;
      the participating hospitals. Such patients will have a test positive for Clostridium&#xD;
      difficile and will be receiving treatment. The trial will involve only adult patients 18&#xD;
      years of age and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The microbiology laboratory will notify the study team about a positive CDI test via&#xD;
      telephone, email, or fax. The nature of recruitment will then depend on the inpatient status&#xD;
      of the patient at the time of the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inpatients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-existing approval for approaching patients for this study will be obtained from the&#xD;
      relevant department heads. The study team will speak with a member of the inpatient treating&#xD;
      team (resident physician or faculty physician as appropriate) to determine if the patient is&#xD;
      appropriate for recruitment. If this seems to be the case, the patient's file will be rapidly&#xD;
      screened to determine eligibility and if the patient is eligible they will be approached for&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physician who ordered the C. difficile test will be contracted to determine if the&#xD;
      patient is appropriate for recruitment. At the invitation of this physician, the&#xD;
      investigators will then contact the patient via telephone to evaluate suitability for&#xD;
      inclusion and arrange an intake visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who have enrolled in the study, randomization will occur centrally at McGill via&#xD;
      an existing internet application (such as https://cloudtrials.mchi.mcgill.ca/) and will be&#xD;
      performed by permuted block with randomized block sizes. This randomization will be&#xD;
      stratified for first episode or first recurrence at study entry to ensure these factors are&#xD;
      properly balanced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL SCHEDULE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 1: Patient diagnosed with C. difficile -&gt; Determine eligibility and obtain&#xD;
           permission for approach&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 7-10 (Patient's C. difficile has improved and meets eligibility): Consent obtained;&#xD;
           randomization; distribution of study drug for day 14 start -&gt; Collection of&#xD;
           demographics, storage of stool.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 14-28 -&gt; Receipt of study therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 28: In person visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 56: In person visit -&gt; Primary outcome determined, quality of life questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 90: Study ends for the patient -&gt; Secondary outcomes can be determined&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  weekly until Day 56: Brief questionnaire -&gt; By email/text/phone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  biweekly after Day 56: Brief questionnaire -&gt; By email/text/phone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ad hoc: If patient has symptoms of recurrence of C. difficile -&gt; Review by ID physician&#xD;
           in clinic if possible, otherwise usual doctors or emergency room&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be able to come be assessed for potential relapse by infectious diseases&#xD;
      physicians at each site (who may or may not be a part of the study) or could see their usual&#xD;
      doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE AND STATISTICAL METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated number of CDI cases available has been based on fiscal year 2016 data: total of&#xD;
      1770 per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of recurrence is estimated at 25%. The investigators aim to demonstrate that an&#xD;
      initial tapering regimen is associated with an absolute decrease in the risk of relapse of at&#xD;
      least 10% (number needed to treat of 10) which would be similar to than the effect seen&#xD;
      within 40 days in the fidaxomicin trial. This estimate accounts for our longer period of&#xD;
      follow up and will allow some flexibility in the actual recurrence rate found in our control&#xD;
      arm. With 80% power and a type 1 error of 5%, this would require 276 patients to complete&#xD;
      follow up in each arm (total 552).&#xD;

A double blind and placebo will be used because the knowledge of being on active drug might influence patient reporting on gastrointestinal symptoms or physician interpretation of such symptoms leading to asymmetrical workup of CDI recurrence and hence bias in the results.&#xD;
To avoid other sources of bias post-randomization, patients, research personnel, investigators, endpoint adjudicators, and study analysis will all remain blinded to the intervention status until completion of the analysis and reporting of results.

    <measure>CDI recurrence</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 56 days of initial diagnosis</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be contacted via text message, email, or phone call weekly until day 56 to determine if they have had a recurrence. After day 56 this will be bi-weekly until day 90.&#xD;
Recurrence will be assessed by clinical record review (chart, laboratory, pharmacy records) and direct patient interview. Blinded case summaries will be reviewed in duplicate with disagreement resolved by consensus.&#xD;
CDI recurrence will be defined by three or more diarrheal stools/24-hour period coupled with a positive PCR for toxin gene or and/or detection of toxin by EIA or CCA and administration of treatment. However, to avoid missing severe recurrences: for cases of ileus, toxic megacolon, or pseudomembranous colitis on colonoscopy the test result will be used in the absence of three or more stools.</description>

    <description>If a patient misses their day 28 or day 56 in-person follow up, we will initially review their hospital file to see if they have died. If this does not show death, we will contact the patient (or their proxy) by telephone to determine why they missed the follow up and reschedule it as required. If we cannot reach the patient or their proxy, and the patient has not been replying to the email/text/phone surveys we will search the obituaries.&#xD;
After day 56 we will use the survey responses as proof of life. If there is no response to the day 90 survey by day 95, we will first check the hospital file to see if they have died. Then, if vital status is not clear, we will search the obituaries. Then if vital status is still not clear, we will attempt to reach the patient by telephone. If we cannot reach the patient, we will record that patient as lost to follow up but include a sensitivity analysis including these patients as having died.</description>

    <description>Economic analysis will be carried out from the perspective of the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) following established guidelines and will be generalized to the rest of Canada.&#xD;
We will estimate the average cost per patient of using the interventions under study routinely in patients with C. difficile diarrhea. We will also gather information on the cost of health services use (hospitalizations and other interventions such as colectomy) following this intervention to determine the budget impact compared with routine practice. If the intervention proves efficacious, we will carry out a cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness analysis to determine the incremental cost per case of C. difficile diarrhea avoided. The base case will be the placebo group, to which the treatment will be compared. Further, we will carry out a cost utility analysis to report the incremental cost per unit increase in quality of life as measured by the Cdiff32 score.</description>
