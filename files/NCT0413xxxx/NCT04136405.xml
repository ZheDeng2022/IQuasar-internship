      This study investigates hepatitis C virus (HCV) outbreak in South West general population in&#xD;
      Burkina Faso with three specific objectives: estimate HCV prevalence in South West Region&#xD;
      general population in 2019; identify factors associated with recent HCV infection (in&#xD;
      subjects younger than 20 years); and evaluate the pilot treatment strategy implemented by the&#xD;
      national program for diagnosed cases during investigation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A previous ANRS (French National Agency for Research on AIDS and Viral Hepatitis)12270 study&#xD;
      supported by Burkina Faso's Minister of Health, used blood samples from the 2010 Demographic&#xD;
      and Health Survey (DHS) to document the country's national and regional prevalences and&#xD;
      highlighted a localized HCV epidemic in the Southwest Region with a prevalence of 13.2% which&#xD;
      was 4 times higher than the national prevalence. This high prevalence of HCV was found in&#xD;
      both adults and youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the particular epidemiological situation of the South-West region and the limits of the&#xD;
      2010 DHS, we aimed to carry out a thorough investigation of this HCV epidemic in the&#xD;
      South-West region of Burkina Faso in order to control it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mixed methodology (quantitative and qualitative) will be used including: (i) a&#xD;
      cross-sectional survey to estimate the prevalence of HCV infection in the South-West&#xD;
      population in Burkina Faso; (ii) a case-control study among individuals less than 20 years of&#xD;
      age to identify factors associated with current HCV transmission; (iii) a qualitative survey&#xD;
      to provide additional information explaining the high prevalence of HCV infection (historical&#xD;
      events, for example); (iv) a cohort study to evaluate a pilot treatment management strategy&#xD;
      to be implemented by the national program in the South West Region&#xD;
