      Bifico (also known as &quot;bifidobacterium trifidum live powder&quot;) is a probiotic preparation that&#xD;
      has been marketed and widely used in China. The number of live bacteria of lactobacillus&#xD;
      acidophilus and bifidobacterium per gram should not be less than 1.0×107CFU. At present, it&#xD;
      is mainly used for diarrhea and abdominal distension caused by intestinal flora imbalance. It&#xD;
      can also be used for treating mild to moderate acute diarrhea and chronic diarrhea.&#xD;
      Lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacteria have been fully proved in basic studies to&#xD;
      improve gut microbiological environment and inhibit colorectal cancer. A recent paper&#xD;
      published by Nature Biomedical Engineering reported that chemotherapy can effectively enhance&#xD;
      the efficacy of colon cancer by regulating intestinal flora. Based on the above evidence, we&#xD;
      propose that the current standard chemotherapy plus targeted therapy regimen combined with&#xD;
      Bifico can exert a more powerful synergistic anticancer effect. To sum up, this study put&#xD;
      forward innovative joint regulating intestinal flora environment with standard chemotherapy&#xD;
      and target therapy of new concept and mode, to assess Bifico combined with standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy plus targeted therapy compared to standard chemotherapy plus targeted therapy&#xD;
      for efficacy and safety of metastatic colorectal cancer, combined with the intestinal flora,&#xD;
      probiotics patient blood DNA analysis, etc. New technology, explore flora index correlation&#xD;
      with the prognosis of patients' immune system function, and its potential as a predictive&#xD;
      marker. It is worth noting that this study will closely combine the current most advanced&#xD;
      intestinal flora 16S microbial polymorphism detection and single-cell sequencing technology,&#xD;
      so as to truly achieve accurate and individualized treatment, evaluation and prognosis&#xD;
      prediction.&#xD;

      Patients were randomized to either standard therapy (i.e., chemotherapy + targeted therapy)&#xD;
      or standard therapy combined with Bifico. We will provide patients with first-line,&#xD;
      second-line and third-line treatment with full intervention, including maintenance treatment.&#xD;
      The standard treatment regimen, first-line (FOLFOX regimen + cetuximab) : oxaliplatin 85mg/m2&#xD;
      intravenous infusion 2 hours day1 + calcium leucofolate (LV) 400mg/m2 intravenous infusion 2&#xD;
      hours day1 + 5-fluorouracil (5-fu) 400mg/m2 intravenous infusion day 1, and then 1200mg/&#xD;
      (m2·day) ×2 days continuous intravenous infusion + cetuximab 500mg/m2 intravenous infusion&#xD;
      over 2 hours day 1, repeat every 2 weeks. First-line treatment 4 to 6 months after the&#xD;
      effective disease control or stable but still no radical surgery opportunity, can enter&#xD;
      maintenance treatment: 5 - FU + LV (dose with a line), repeat every 2 weeks, or capecitabine&#xD;
      oral 2 1250 mg/m2 / day day 1-14 + beacizumab 7.5 mg/kg intravenous day 1, repeat every 3&#xD;
      weeks, or stop the systemic treatment, until a progression, and immediately to the next line&#xD;
      treatment; Second-line (FOLFIRI regimen + bevacizumab) : irinotegam 180 mg/m2 iv infusion&#xD;
      over 30-90min day 1 + LV 400mg/m2 iv infusion 2 hours day 1 + 5-fu400 mg/m2 iv infusion day&#xD;
      1, then 1200mg/ (m2·day) ×2 days continuous intravenous infusion + bevacizumab 5mg/kg&#xD;
      introvenious infusion day 1, repeat every 2 weeks. Third line: fuquinib 160mg oral 1/ day day&#xD;
      1-21, repeat every 28 days, or regofenil 5mg oral 1/ day day 1-21, repeat every 28 days.&#xD;
      Bifico 2g oral 3/ day, take the medicine daily.&#xD;
