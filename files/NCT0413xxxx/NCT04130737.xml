             schedule over 36 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient is a suitable candidate for angiography and endovascular intervention and, if&#xD;
             required, is eligible for standard surgical repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) of the lower extremities&#xD;
             requiring intervention to relieve de novo obstruction or occlusion or restenosis of&#xD;
             the native femoropopliteal artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient has PAD classified as Rutherford classification 2, 3 or 4.&#xD;

             0.90 (or ≤ 0.75 after exercise of the target limb). Resting toe brachial index (TBI)&#xD;
             is performed only if unable to reliably assess ABI. TBI must be &lt;0.70; or (ii) Normal&#xD;

             above the bottom of the femur.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Target lesion(s) reference vessel diameter is between 5.0 mm and 6.7 mm by operator's&#xD;
             visual estimate.&#xD;

             stenosis by operator's visual estimate. Tandem target lesions are considered a single&#xD;
             continuous lesion if the gap between lesions is ≤ 5 cm and &gt; 30% diameter stenosis&#xD;
             between the lesion(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patient has a patent popliteal artery (no stenosis ≥ 50%) distal to the treated&#xD;
             segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patient has at least one patent infrapopliteal vessel (&lt; 50% stenosis) with run-off to&#xD;

&#xD;
         19. Patient has other medical, social or psychological problems that, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigator, preclude them from receiving this treatment, and the procedures and&#xD;
             evaluations pre- and post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Patient has significant disease or obstruction (≥ 50%) of the inflow tract that has&#xD;
             not been successfully treated at the time of the index procedure (success measured as&#xD;
             ≤ 30% residual stenosis, without complication).&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Patient has no patent (≥ 50% stenosis) outflow vessel providing run-off to the ankle.&#xD;
