      The objective of this project is to determine if in patients admitted to the hospital with&#xD;
      septic shock (population), does treatment with a bundle including hydrocortisone, thiamine,&#xD;
      and ascorbic acid improve in-hospital or 28-day mortality (primary outcomes) or surrogate&#xD;
      markers of illness severity including: (1) ICU or hospital length-of-stay, (2) duration of&#xD;
      invasive mechanical ventilation, (3) duration of vasopressor administration, (4) incidence&#xD;
      and severity of ICU delirium, and (5) illness severity (secondary outcomes).&#xD;

      This trial is designed as a multi-center prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled&#xD;
      study. The objective of this project is to determine if in patients admitted to the hospital&#xD;
      with septic shock (population), does treatment with a bundle including hydrocortisone,&#xD;
      thiamine, and ascorbic acid improve in-hospital or 28-day mortality (primary outcomes) or&#xD;
      surrogate markers of illness severity including: (1) ICU or hospital length-of-stay, (2)&#xD;
      duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, (3) duration of vasopressor administration, (4)&#xD;
      incidence and severity of ICU delirium, and (5) illness severity (secondary outcomes). The&#xD;
      calculated sample size is 80. Subjects will be followed for 28 days or until hospital&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients eligible for inclusion must be admitted with septic shock (as defined by SEPSIS-3)&#xD;
      requiring vasopressors to maintain MAP â‰¥ 65 AND serum lactate level &gt;2 mmol/L after adequate&#xD;
      fluid resuscitation (generally recognized at 30 ml/kg crystalloid unless contraindicated as&#xD;
      deemed by treating clinician) within the first three hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria are: age &lt; 18 years, pregnant, patients with limitation of care (i.e.&#xD;
      do not resuscitate [DNR]), known Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) Deficiency, and&#xD;
      vasopressor use for &gt; 24 hours prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in Arm 1 will randomized to receive usual care + hydrocortisone, thiamine and&#xD;
      ascorbic acid. Arm 2 will be randomized to receive usual care alone. Crossover is not&#xD;
      allowed. If a patient is randomized into study Arm 2, the treating physician may decide to&#xD;
      administer study medications if they feel it is in the best interest of the patient. In this&#xD;
      case the patient will continue to be analyzed in their assigned arm on an intention to treat&#xD;
      basis. Source of participants will be in-hospital and Emergency Department patients.&#xD;
