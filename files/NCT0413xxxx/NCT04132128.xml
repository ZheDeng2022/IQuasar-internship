      Counting Carbohydrates (CC) is the preferable method used to calculate the amount of insulin&#xD;
      needed for a meal. This method is employed by patients with type 1 diabetes melitus (T1DM).&#xD;
      the patients receive the general arithmetic calculation of how much insulin to inject for 15&#xD;
      grams/1 portion of carbohydrate (carb to insulin ratio (C:I) and insulin sensitivity (IS).&#xD;
      However, Diabetes Educators are often confronted with difficulties guiding their T1DM patient&#xD;
      when using this method and find patients get confused calculating the amount of carbs needed.&#xD;
      The investigators sought to create a simple tool that would help our patients implement the&#xD;
      CC method easily and properly.&#xD;

      Objectives: To develop an easily understood CC tool accessible to all T1D patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome - HbA1c at 3 and 6 months after intervention. Second primary - patients&#xD;
      satisfaction with the tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators created a tool which includes two tables with the patients'&#xD;
      individual doses calculated by the clinics professional team, displaying his IS and C:I. The&#xD;
      first table's values drive from the IS, showing how many insulin units should be given to&#xD;
      correct blood sugar levels according to the measured result before the meal, and second&#xD;
      drives from the patient's own C:I, which shows how many insulin units should be given&#xD;
      according to the chosen food items. Blood glucose target is also decided on an individual&#xD;
      basis. Together, with the patient, the investigators create a list containing only food items&#xD;
      in one's personal diet with attached values. Protein dishes and fatty items such as oil or an&#xD;
      egg appear with the value of zero insulin if that is the correct figure for the particular&#xD;
      patient. After filling out the two tables, the investigators apply them in 8 steps 1-measure&#xD;
      blood sugar, 2-find the right insulin correction dose according to the 1st table, 3-plan the&#xD;
      meal, 4-find the insulin dose for the food items chosen, 5-combine the insulin dose of step&#xD;
      2+4, 6-injection insulin by pen or insulin pump, 7-consume the meal. 8-measure blood sugar 2&#xD;
      hours after meal to make sure the right dose was applied. At all visits the lists are&#xD;
      discussed and missing food items are added. Using this tool enables to introduce CC to most&#xD;
      patients.The tool has been applied in different languages: Hebrew, Arabic, Russian, English&#xD;
      and Amharic and was used by patients whose individual learning skills varied over a very wide&#xD;
      spectrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomized into two groups. Group 1-received the new tool. Group 2-learned carb&#xD;
      counting on customary basis. All participants met 6 times with a registered dietician&#xD;
      diabetes educator to practice carb counting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected at recruitments and at the end of the study: HbA1c, daily insulin dosage,&#xD;
      lipids profiles and questioners (PAID of WHO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup analyses were done according to gender, diabetes years and education.&#xD;
