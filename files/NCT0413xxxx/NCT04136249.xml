      This study is based on the assumption that muscle strength and muscle mass will be better&#xD;
      preserved in an &quot;intervention&quot; group with specific management combining retraining and&#xD;
      nutritional monitoring compared to the &quot;no intervention&quot; group and that this will be positive&#xD;
      consequences for fatigue and quality of life. In addition, this project is also based on the&#xD;
      assumption that these gains will be at least partially preserved 3 months after the end of&#xD;
      specific care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients have a significant risk of losing muscle mass, mainly related to cachexia, as&#xD;
      a result of metabolic changes associated with the tumor process and treatments. However, it&#xD;
      is reinforced by the sedentary lifestyle that results from fatigue felt by patients. This&#xD;
      loss of muscle mass causes in patients with general weakness and a loss of maximum strength.&#xD;
      However, it has recently been shown that muscle weakness is not only a consequence of muscle&#xD;
      atrophy, but also the result of contractile dysfunction, which reduces fatigue resistance to&#xD;
      exercise. Cancer cachexia can also be directly associated with high levels of subjective&#xD;
      cancer-related fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While it has been reported that resistance exercise programs can mitigate the deleterious&#xD;
      effects of the disease and / or treatment, the results are likely to be partly debated&#xD;
      because these programs are not optimized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to use eccentric contraction and electromyostimulation because there is&#xD;
      evidence that the effects of these methods used in combination may be greater in developing&#xD;
      strength and muscle mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to muscle building, nutritional monitoring is a key element of recovery. For&#xD;
      example, it has been shown that a preoperative exercise and nutritional support program has&#xD;
      the potential to reduce sarcopenia and improve postoperative outcomes in elderly sarcopenic&#xD;
      patients with gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultimately, this study is based on the assumption that muscle strength and muscle mass will&#xD;
      be better preserved in an &quot;intervention&quot; group with specific management combining retraining&#xD;
      and nutritional monitoring compared to the &quot;no intervention&quot; group and that this will be&#xD;
      positive consequences for fatigue and quality of life. In addition, this project is also&#xD;
      based on the assumption that these gains will be at least partially preserved 3 months after&#xD;
      the end of specific care.&#xD;
