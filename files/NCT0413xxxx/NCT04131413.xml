      The primary goal of this phase I open label study is to determine the safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of pNGVL4aCRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine, as administered by intramuscular (IM) injection with&#xD;
      TriGrid™ electroporation to both HIV- or HIV+ adult female subjects (≥ 19 years), with biopsy&#xD;

This dose cohort will consist of 3 participants and a monitoring period of one week after the final dose mandated. If there are 0 participants in the 0.3 dose level cohort that experience dose limiting toxicities (DLT), a new cohort of 3 participants will be vaccinated at the 1.0 mg dose level. If there are 0 participants in the 1.0 mg dose level that experience DLT, then a new cohort of 3 participants will be vaccinated at the 3.0 mg dose level. If there is 1 participant experiencing DLTs, an additional cohort of 3 subjects will be enrolled and treated at the current dose level. If there are 2 or more participants experiencing DLTs in the 3 or additional cohort of 3 vaccinated at the current dose level, then the next lower dose level will be determined as the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD).</description>

&#xD;
          -  Individuals in whom the ability to observe possible local reactions at the eligible&#xD;
             injection sites (deltoid region) is, in the opinion of the investigator, unacceptably&#xD;
             obscured due to a physical condition or permanent body art.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute or chronic, clinically significant hematologic, pulmonary, cardiovascular, or&#xD;
