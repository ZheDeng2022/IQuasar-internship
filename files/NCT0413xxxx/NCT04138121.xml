  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cricothyroid membrane acts a route through which the upper airway can be accessed in&#xD;
      order to provide oxygen and ventilation to patients. The need to provide oxygen and&#xD;
      ventilation to patients is essential particularly under general anesthesia, where patients&#xD;
      may lose the ability to breathe for themselves. Access through this membrane to provide&#xD;
      oxygen and ventilation is critical in emergency situations where other traditional means to&#xD;
      access the airway (e.g through endotracheal ventilation, supraglottic airway devices or face&#xD;
      mask ventilation) have failed. It is known that due to the physiological changes of&#xD;
      pregnancy, the upper airway of the body undergoes changes that can make accessing the airway&#xD;
      through traditional means more difficult. Ultrasound is becoming increasingly popular due to&#xD;
      its ability to identify the cricothyroid membrane, to improve success in accessing the airway&#xD;
      through the cricothyroid membrane. Studies to date in non pregnant adults have shown that&#xD;
      alterations in the head and neck position can alter the position and size of the cricothyroid&#xD;
      membrane. No study to date however has looked at how changing the position of the head and&#xD;
      neck effects the position and size of the cricothyroid membrane in pregnant patients. It is&#xD;
      important to study these changes in the pregnant population, given the physiological changes&#xD;
      of pregnancy that make accessing the airway through traditional methods more difficult in non&#xD;
      pregnant patients. The investigators hypothesize that in pregnant patients in the third&#xD;
      trimester, that changing the head from the neutral to maximally extended neck position will&#xD;
      alter the position of the cricothyroid membrane in relation to anatomical skin markings&#xD;
      between positions. The investigators also hypothesize that in pregnant patients in the third&#xD;
      trimester that changing the head from the neutral to maximally extended neck position will&#xD;
      increase the size of the cricothyroid membrane. The investigatorsalso aim to determine at&#xD;
      what position in the neck a theoretical standardized incision will allow access to the&#xD;
      cricothyroid membrane.&#xD;

      This is an observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. One of two anesthesiologists trained in cricothyroid membrane ultrasound scanning&#xD;
           technique in pregnant population (study investigators)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects to be assessed: pregnant patients in their third trimester on the labor and&#xD;
           delivery floor comfortable enough to take part in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two anesthesiologists will undergo ultrasound imaging training by an expert staff&#xD;
      anesthesiologist whom is already trained in the procedure. As per previous published evidence&#xD;
      on this, the investigator will need to correctly identify the location of cricothyroid&#xD;
      membrane and its height in 15 volunteers. This will constitute the standardized training&#xD;
      component of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon admission to the Labor and Delivery floor, women will be further explained the protocol&#xD;
      and asked to sign the consent form. Then, they will have the cricothyroid membrane assessed,&#xD;
      as per description above, and quantitative assessment will be performed. Firstly,&#xD;
      quantitative assessment of the height of the cricothyroid membrane will be performed in the&#xD;
      supine position (with left uterine displacement) with the neck in the neutral position. The&#xD;
      central point of the cricothyroid membrane will be marked using a removable skin ink marker.&#xD;
      The patient will then be asked to fully their neck. The change in distance of the midpoint of&#xD;
      the cricothyroid membrane from the neutral head and neck position to fully extended&#xD;
      positioned will be performed, as will the change in height of the cricothyroid membrane&#xD;
      between the two positions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative assessment for change in central cricothyroid membrane distance will be done&#xD;
      with measuring central points marked on the patients neck with skin marker ink. Quantitative&#xD;
      assessment of change in cricoid thyroid membrane will be conducted using caliper measuring&#xD;
      software build into the ultrasound machinery. Finally, the investigators will establish the&#xD;
      starting distance above the sternal notch over which a theoretical 8cm incision in the neck&#xD;
      which will overlie the cricothyroid membrane. This will be done by measuring the distance&#xD;
      above the sternal notch with a surgical measuring ruler.&#xD;
