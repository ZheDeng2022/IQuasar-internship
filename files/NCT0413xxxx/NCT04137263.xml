  <brief_summary>

      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy, of D.O.S.E formulations in the treatment&#xD;
      of melasma and cutaneous signs of aging.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Melasma is a hyperpigmentation disorder that presents as irregularly shaped macules on the&#xD;
      face of women. The etiology is unknown however there is strong evidence that genetics,&#xD;
      hormones, sun exposure can trigger and worsen the disease. Increased dermal vascularity and&#xD;
      expression of angiogenic factors also seem to play a role. Melasma is a chronic and relapsing&#xD;
      condition, that is difficult to treat, and can have a negative impact on quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous treatments exist for melasma including topical lightening agents, chemical peels,&#xD;
      and a variety of laser and light based options. Long-term management is difficult as topical&#xD;
      agents can often cause irritation, burning, peeling and inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Light&#xD;
      based therapies can also lead to relapse or worsening of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melasma, in combination with photodamage from cumulative sun exposure and aging, can lead to&#xD;
      a complex picture when making a skin care plan for a cosmetic patient. The custom D.O.S.E&#xD;
      professional service can be utilized to make a personalized serum to improve skin&#xD;
      discoloration and the visible signs of aging. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of D.O.S.E formulations in the treatment of melasma and visible signs of aging.&#xD;
