  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to characterize the diffusion of dolutegravir and&#xD;
      associated backbone (abacavir/lamivudine or tenofovir/emtricitabine) in HIV-1 chronic&#xD;
      patients in the main putative reservoirs, namely inguinal lymph nodes, rectal, fat tissues&#xD;
      and sperm.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The major obstacle to a functional cure of HIV infection is the persistence of the latent HIV&#xD;
      reservoir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several arguments suggest the persistence of a residual viral replication in different&#xD;
      compartments, despite an effective antiretroviral treatment. This residual viral replication&#xD;
      partially comes from pharmacological sanctuaries where the drugs do not largely penetrate. In&#xD;
      such sanctuaries a recent report published in Nature has shown that the virus can replicate&#xD;
      with less antiviral pressure contributing to continuously replenish the reservoirs.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, this study concerned a limited number of patients and only blood and lymph-node&#xD;
      samples were collected for viral analysis. Moreover, the drug distribution was estimated&#xD;
      based on mathematical hypotheses without drug measure concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The International AIDS Society recommend for most patients an optimal initial regimen&#xD;
      containing 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus an integrase strand&#xD;
      transfer inhibitor (InSTI)2. The new integrase inhibitor dolutegravir is more and more widely&#xD;
      used in combination with nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase. Indeed, this drug shows&#xD;
      a good tolerance and demonstrates a particularly fast inhibition of the viral replication.&#xD;
      Moreover, dolutegravir is active against HIV strains that are resistant to the first&#xD;
      generation of integrase inhibitors, raltegravir and elvitegravir. However the penetration of&#xD;
      dolutegravir in deep compartments has not been fully characterized: the studies comprised a&#xD;
      small number of patients and were not able to estimate the distribution in several&#xD;
      compartments at the same time for each patient. Moreover the levels of residual viral&#xD;
      replication in those compartments during treatment are unknown, making it difficult to&#xD;
      evaluate the capacity of this drug and associated backbone to efficiently act against viral&#xD;
      reservoirs maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to measure simultaneously dolutegravir and nucleoside/nucleotide&#xD;
      reverse transcriptase inhibitors in different compartments to obtain cartography of&#xD;
      dolutegravir and associated backbone distribution and the spatial dynamics of virus in each&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision to study dolutegravir and the two associated backbones (abacavir / lamivudine or&#xD;
      tenofovir /emtricitabine) was decided as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The International AIDS Society recommend for most patients an optimal initial regimen&#xD;
           containing 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus an integrase&#xD;
           strand transfer inhibitor (InSTI)2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dolutegravir viral power is established for high levels of viral load 90 and this drug&#xD;
           is widely used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study is very complementary of studies ANRS SIVART and ANRS 169 OPTIPRIM 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dolutegravir is combined with abacavir + lamivudine in a single-tablet and is largely&#xD;
           prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Raltegravir and elvitegravir will not be analysed because the number of recruited&#xD;
           patients should be more important to obtain sufficient data and the feasibility would&#xD;
           not be sure.&#xD;
