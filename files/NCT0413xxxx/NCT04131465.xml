  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many older adults in rural South Africa still lack knowledge of their HIV status despite a&#xD;
      high probability of infection. Older adults tend to test less for HIV because most HIV&#xD;
      testing and prevention programs have been targeted at younger age groups. Other reasons for&#xD;
      failure to test for HIV include frailty and lack of financial resources to travel to HIV&#xD;
      testing centers. Home-based testing is a powerful approach to bring HIV testing services --&#xD;
      and HIV status knowledge -- to older adults. In real-life health systems, community health&#xD;
      workers, such as the South African community care givers, could potentially provide&#xD;
      home-based HIV testing on a routine basis. In this study, the investigators are trying to&#xD;
      establish the best 'form' for the 'function' home-based HIV testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators aim to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establish the comparative effectiveness of three home-based HIV testing options among&#xD;
           older adults in rural South Africa&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identify spill-over effects of the different home-based HIV testing options to other&#xD;
           adults in the households and communities of the older adults receiving the testing&#xD;
           options&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the comparative cost-effectiveness of the three home-based HIV testing options&#xD;
           among older adults.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background In the first wave of a large population-representative study of older adults in&#xD;
      rural South Africa, the 'Health and Aging in Africa: A Longitudinal Study of an INDEPTH&#xD;
      Community in South Africa (HAALSI)' study, large gaps in knowledge of HIV status were found&#xD;
      among participants, coupled with low rates of recent HIV testing and high rates of sexual&#xD;
      behaviour that can lead to acquisition and transmission of HIV. In general, older adults&#xD;
      should test for HIV at least once per year (HIVAge.org), but few do so, in part because&#xD;
      current HIV testing programmes have traditionally focused on young and middle-age adults and&#xD;
      HIV testing facilities are often difficult to access for older populations. Only 17% of older&#xD;
      adults in the HAALSI community reported having tested for HIV in the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home testing can provide a powerful approach to bring the health systems 'function' of HIV&#xD;
      testing to older adults in rural Africa. In the routine health system, community health&#xD;
      workers, such as the South African community care givers, could provide this 'function' on a&#xD;
      regular basis. Home rapid HIV testing and HIV self-test kits have been intensively studied in&#xD;
      many populations. HIV self-test kits have recently become available as over the- counter&#xD;
      products in South Africa, after the South African Pharmacy Council (SAPC) lifted a ban on&#xD;
      their sale in pharmacies in December 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, however, no study has compared head-to-head different 'forms' of home testing for&#xD;
      HIV. In this study, the investigators aim to establish the comparative effectiveness and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of three different options of home HIV testing among older adults in rural&#xD;
      South Africa: (1) home delivery of HIV self-test kits, (2) home HIV rapid testing, and (3)&#xD;
      both home delivery of HIV self-test kits and home HIV rapid testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, home HIV testing is likely attractive for older adults because it allows testing&#xD;
      without having to visit a health care facility. Home delivery of HIV self-testing kits has&#xD;
      the additional advantage that it allows HIV testing in a place and at a time of one's own&#xD;
      choosing. Home approaches to HIV testing are particularly policy-relevant at this time,&#xD;
      because South Africa and many other countries in sub-Saharan Africa are currently expanding&#xD;
      in re-designing their community health worker programs, through which home HIV testing could&#xD;
      be provided on a routine basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary evidence in this and in other populations have suggested that HIV testing and&#xD;
      linkage to HIV treatment and care improve health care utilization for other non-HIV chronic&#xD;
      care and reduce risky sexual behavior. The investigators will thus not only assess the&#xD;
      effects of the different home HIV testing offers on HIV testing but also assess comparative&#xD;
      effects on healthcare utilization, noncommunicable disease endpoints, and sexual behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study thus aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establish the comparative effectiveness of three options for home HIV testing for older&#xD;
           adults in rural South Africa&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identify spill-over effects of the different options for home HIV testing to other&#xD;
           adults in the families and communities of the older adults receiving the testing options&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Establish the comparative cost-effectiveness of the three options for home HIV testing&#xD;
           among older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Participants in Wave 2 of the HAALSI study will be offered one of three options&#xD;
      (randomly assigned 1:1:1) for home HIV testing: (1) three oral HIV self-test kits with a&#xD;
      brief introduction to HIV self-testing (home HIV self-testing arm), (2) home rapid HIV&#xD;
      testing and counselling (home rapid HIV testing arm), and (3) three oral HIV self-test kits&#xD;
      with a brief introduction to HIV self-testing plus home rapid HIV testing and counselling&#xD;
      (home HIV self-testing and HIV rapid testing arm). The brief introduction to HIV self-testing&#xD;
      will include encouragement of both self-use and onward distribution to household and&#xD;
      community members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HAALSI participants were randomized (sample ~3,600; 1,200 individuals in each of the&#xD;
      three arms). Randomization has occurred during routine HAALSI fieldwork visits, using a&#xD;
      pre-programmed randomization process that is integrated into the tablet-based HAALSI&#xD;
      computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI). This randomization was completed during a&#xD;
      three-month period between May and July 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Assessment The primary outcomes (1-2) and a group of secondary outcomes (3-21) will&#xD;
      be assessed by telephone at 9 months after randomization. Based on the timing of&#xD;
      randomization, primary data collection will take place from February through May 2020. Then,&#xD;
      both the primary and an expanded set of secondary outcomes including several&#xD;
      biologically-measured secondary outcomes (1-25) will be assessed at 18-24 months, during the&#xD;
      subsequent, planned cohort-based data collection (HAALSI Wave 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Calculation In the first wave of the HAALSI study, the proportion of people having&#xD;
      tested for HIV in the past 6 months (which was about 17%) was measured. Assuming uniform&#xD;
      distribution of testing over time, it would be expected that about 3% of older adults in the&#xD;
      HAALSI population tested in the past month. Based on the HAALSI 1 data, the proportion of&#xD;
      older adults who ever tested for HIV is 65%. Given these estimates for the endpoints in the&#xD;
      control arm, this study is powered to detect a 3 percentage point difference in HIV testing&#xD;
      in the past month and a 6 percentage point difference in ever testing for HIV across the&#xD;
      three arms. For this power calculation the investigators further assumed, 20% loss to&#xD;
      follow-up, 80% power and a significance level for rejecting the Null hypothesis of 0.0167.&#xD;
      This significance level results from the adjustment of the standard 0.05 significance level&#xD;
      for multiple hypothesis testing - each arm compared to each other arm - using the&#xD;
      Holm-Bonferroni method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analyses The investigators will measure risk ratios for all the binary outcomes in this&#xD;
      study, using modified Poisson regression implemented in generalized linear models with&#xD;
      Poisson distribution and log link. Furthermore, the effect sizes for count outcomes using&#xD;
      generalized linear models with negative binomial distribution and log link will be measured;&#xD;
      the investigators will measure effect sizes for continuous outcomes using generalized linear&#xD;
      models with normal distribution and identity link. All estimations will be adjusted for&#xD;
      clustering of outcomes at the household level as well as for baseline values of the&#xD;
      endpoints. Baseline values of our primary and secondary endpoints will be assessed during the&#xD;
      baseline visit before the HAALSI participants receive the trial exposure.&#xD;
