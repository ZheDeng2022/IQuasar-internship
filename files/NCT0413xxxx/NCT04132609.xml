  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research will provide foundational research to develop this low-burden&#xD;
      behavioral intervention that can potentially improve outcomes of OUD. The Specific Aims of&#xD;
      the proposal include conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial with post-intervention&#xD;
      and 3 month follow up to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness&#xD;
      of CBM task for opioid and pain cues (Aim 1), examine naturalistic assessment of opioid&#xD;
      craving and pain intensity/interference (Aim 2), and conduct qualitative analysis of Veterans&#xD;
      experiences of adjunctive treatment in MAT clinic and perceptions of CBM as an intervention&#xD;
      (Aim 3). Male and female Veterans meeting DSM5 criteria for OUD (N=60) currently on MAT will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to 4 weeks of CBM for opioid and pain cues or control (standard&#xD;
      attentional bias). CBM/control tasks will be administered during weekly MAT clinic&#xD;
      appointments and opioid craving and pain intensity/interference will be randomly assessed&#xD;
      during the day using a mobile device. Post-intervention, Veterans will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in a digitally recorded semi-structured interview for qualitative assessment of&#xD;
      CBM and treatment adjunctive to MAT. MAT outcomes (urine toxicology screens, MAT&#xD;
      appointments) will also be measured at 3-month follow up. The current study will elucidate&#xD;
      dynamic relationships between attention to opioid and pain cues and whether modifying&#xD;
      attention can reduce risk factors associated with treatment failure. If successful, with its&#xD;
      low patient and provider burden, CBM could be readily incorporated in research and clinical&#xD;
      practice as an adjunctive treatment for OUD.&#xD;

      Participants will complete the standard attentional bias task (control) or CBM up to 3x/week&#xD;
      during MAT clinic visits for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attentional bias: Attentional bias will be assessed during MAT clinic visits using the visual&#xD;
      probe task, which is considered the gold standard to evaluate vigilance to salient cues. In&#xD;
      the standard attentional bias task, a drug or pain-related word is presented next to a&#xD;
      neutral word for 500ms. Subsequently, a probe (i.e., a &quot;q&quot; or &quot;p&quot;) replaces the drug/pain&#xD;
      word or the neutral word at an equal rate. The participant's task is to indicate the location&#xD;
      of the probe as quickly as possible by pressing &quot;q&quot; or &quot;p&quot;. Attentional bias is calculated&#xD;
      from the difference in reaction times (i.e., neutral cue minus drug/pain cue) to indicate the&#xD;
      location of the probe, with higher values indicating greater attentional bias. For all tasks,&#xD;
      opioid and pain words will be presented in separate blocks in counterbalanced order. Neutral&#xD;
      words paired with opioid or pain words will be matched for length and frequency of use in the&#xD;
      English language. Opioid (e.g., syringe, needle, high, blues) and pain sensory (e.g., stuff,&#xD;
      throbbing, shooting, burning) and affective (e.g., miserable, tiring, unbearable, exhausting)&#xD;
      words will be taken from prior research demonstrating attentional bias in OUD and chronic&#xD;
      pain patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBM treatment: In CBM, the task presentation and timing is the same as attentional bias,&#xD;
      except the probe always replaces the neutral word. It ensures that: 1) the duration of CBM&#xD;
      and control training should not differ; 2) CBM and control participants receive equal&#xD;
      practice on the motoric aspects of the task; and 3) CBM and control participants are exposed&#xD;
      to the same word cues. Based on previous data, duration of CBM and control trainings will be&#xD;
      about 10 minutes.&#xD;
