  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, prospective, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study. Subjects who sign&#xD;
      informed consent would undergo study-specific screening assessments within 45 days from the&#xD;
      day of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible study subjects will receive a HAV and will be followed to 12 months&#xD;
      post-implantation at routine study visits regardless of patency status. After 12 months,&#xD;
      subjects with a patent HAV will be followed (while the HAV remains patent) for up to 3 years&#xD;
      (36 months) post implantation at study visits every 6 months.&#xD;

    <description>The HAV is a tissue-engineered vascular conduit (6mm diameter) for hemodialysis access in patients with end-stage renal disease. HAV for this study will be manufactured using the commercial manufacturing system.It will be implanted in the forearm or upper arm using standard vascular surgical techniques. All subjects will be required to start taking daily aspirin (75 or 325 mg) on Day 1 after surgical implantation of HAV unless they are already taking another antiplatelet agent. If low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is administered post-operatively, aspirin or other antiplatelet agents should be initiated after stopping LMWH. Subjects who are known to be aspirin-sensitive should take another antiplatelet agent at the discretion of the Principal Investigator.</description>
