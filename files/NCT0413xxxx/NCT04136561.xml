  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine if early placement of a midline catheter in patients&#xD;
      with a central venous catheter (CVC) will decrease the number of days the CVC is in place.&#xD;
      Patients who are in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) and have a CVC may be approached&#xD;
      to join the study. Those who meet study eligibility and provide written consent will be&#xD;
      enrolled. The longer the CVC remains in place,the greater the chance of developing an&#xD;
      infection or blood clot. Any IV line that is placed (CVC, midline, peripheral line) comes&#xD;
      with the risk of infection or blood clots, although that risk is generally less with the&#xD;
      midline and peripheral IV lines than a CVC. The treating team will make the decision when to&#xD;
      remove the CVC. The timeline of removal will be compared to previous data collected on&#xD;
      patients similar to the ones in this study. During their hospital stay, study patients will&#xD;
      be monitored for how well the midline catheter is functioning as well as if they develop a&#xD;
      catheter related blood clot or infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) remains a serious problem contributing&#xD;
      to patient morbidity and mortality. These potentially preventable complications have high&#xD;
      costs. Significant interventions focusing on insertion of catheter and care and maintenance&#xD;
      protocols have been helpful in reducing CLABSI rates. One component that remains a challenge&#xD;
      is early/appropriate removal of central venous catheters (CVCs). The longer the central line&#xD;
      remains in the patient, the increased chance of developing a CLABSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is case-controlled with a control group composed of patients admitted in the&#xD;
      previous year who received a CVC as part of the treatment plan and who did not received a&#xD;
      midline catheter.The intervention phase of this study will involve placement of a standard of&#xD;
      care, FDA approved midline catheter in patients that have a CVC. The Medical Intensive Care&#xD;
      Unit (MICU) treating team will be consulted prior to approaching the patient. Written&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained from the patient or legal authorized representative prior&#xD;
      to enrollment. The midline catheters will be inserted by the vascular access team within 24&#xD;
      hours of CVC insertion. Midline catheters will be assessed daily for function, phlebitis, and&#xD;
      infection for up to 7 days. Mechanical complications or premature line failures will be&#xD;
      tracked. Data specific to blood sampling will be collected daily. If the catheter was&#xD;
      identified to have failed during follow-up assessment the date and time of failure and the&#xD;
      reason for failure will be documented. If the catheter failed or was removed prior to the&#xD;
      follow-up assessment then the VAD failure time and the assessment of failure and reason for&#xD;
      line removal will be obtained through chart review. For all failed catheters, re-insertion&#xD;
      attempt data will be tracked through the medical record. If the patient is discharged prior&#xD;
      to the time of follow-up assessment then the time of discharge will be documented and the VAD&#xD;
      will be presumed functional until time of discharge unless otherwise noted in the chart. Some&#xD;
      patients may leave the hospital with VAD in place for additional intravenous therapies. This&#xD;
      information will be noted, but these patients will not receive follow-up assessments&#xD;
      post-discharge for the research.If the patient has the midline longer than 7 days, the status&#xD;
      of the line will be assessed via documentation in the electronic health record (EHR). The&#xD;
      decision to remove the CVC is up to the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Midline catheters will be assessed by research staff daily for usage. The medication&#xD;
      administration record will be queried for all medications given through each catheter.&#xD;
      Specifically, at the bedside we will assess whether the midline catheter is being used for&#xD;
      any purpose. Of interest is the use of vesicants through the midline, medications that are&#xD;
      generally given via central line or considered caustic to the vessel will be noted in both&#xD;
      groups. Number of doses will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rates of symptomatic upper extremity superficial venous thrombosis (SVT) and deep venous&#xD;
      thrombosis (DVT) rates, as confirmed by sonography will be calculated. Radiology&#xD;
      interpretations will be reviewed for findings consistent with catheter-related symptomatic&#xD;
      upper extremity venous thrombosis (CR-UEVT). This review will occur thirty days post patient&#xD;
      discharge. Symptoms and rationale for imaging will be documented. If the patient is diagnosed&#xD;
      with thrombophlebitis, the location of the thrombus will also be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infection rate will be tracked using confirmed catheter-related blood stream infection data&#xD;
      from the surveillance team within the epidemiology department. The team utilizes the CDC&#xD;
      definition of laboratory-confirmed blood-stream infection (LCBSI). The IV team will assess&#xD;
      all IV insertions sites for infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control data was collected as a separate IRB-approved study. Additional data for control&#xD;
      and intervention groups includes but is not limited to: patient medical record number (MRN),&#xD;
      sex, age, admission diagnosis (top 2), discharge diagnosis (top 2), admission from Emergency&#xD;
      center/floor/transfer, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), date of central line placement, date&#xD;
      of central line removal, location of central line, number of lumens, medications with&#xD;
      particular attention to drips and vesicants, ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay,&#xD;
      disposition from the ICU, CLABSI. Baseline variables will be evaluated for differences&#xD;
      between cases and controls. Matching will be used to select the controls used for analysis.&#xD;
