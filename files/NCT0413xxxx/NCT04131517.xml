          <description>Participants received a single dose of OC tablet on Day 1 during first Treatment Period. Participants received padsevonil tablets 100 mg up-titrated to 400 mg, bid on Day 18 to 23 followed by padsevonil 400 mg bid on Day 24 to 31 along with a single dose of OC tablet on Day 30 and, then padsevonil down-titrated from 400 mg to 100 mg bid from Day 32 to 36 during second Treatment Period. There was a Washout Period of 14 days between the two Treatment Periods.</description>
