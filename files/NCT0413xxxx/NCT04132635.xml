  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Double layer artificial dermis repair material has been widely used in scar plastic, burn,&#xD;
      trauma, chronic wounds and other aspects of wound repair and reconstruction. In the course of&#xD;
      clinical application, we found that for chronic wounds, the combination of artificial dermis&#xD;
      and growth factor can shorten the wound healing cycle, and have a positive impact on the&#xD;
      economy and psychology of patients. In order to verify this effect, we plan to carry out this&#xD;
      study to evaluate whether double-layer artificial dermis repair material combined with growth&#xD;
      factor treatment can improve wound closure rate and shorten closure cycle compared with&#xD;
      single artificial dermis for chronic wound.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients diagnosed as chronic wounds ulcer;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The affected limb has sufficient blood perfusion. The ankle brachial index was&#xD;
             0.65-1.3, or the partial pressure of oxygen was more than 40 mmHg, or Doppler&#xD;
             ultrasound showed enough blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. After debridement, the distance between the wound and the edge of other ulcers was&#xD;
             &gt;2cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. After debridement, the area of exposed bone or tendon was &gt;4cm2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The wound was completely debridement without obvious necrosis, infection control or&#xD;
             osteomyelitis control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The duration of ulcer wound was at least 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Sign the informed consent voluntarily.&#xD;

          2. The researchers think that there are factors affecting wound healing, such as the use&#xD;

             within one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. To receive or plan to receive drugs or treatment, the researchers believe that these&#xD;
             drugs or treatment will interfere with or affect the speed and quality of wound&#xD;
             healing;&#xD;
