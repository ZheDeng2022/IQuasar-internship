  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infection of the ascitic fluid is a serious complication associated with high morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. This fluid is often colonized with bacteria that can cause infection of the&#xD;
      peritoneum and possibly sepsis. Many bacteria of the human intestinal microbiome can't be&#xD;
      cultured by standard methods; therefore it seems likely that many of the relevant bacteria&#xD;
      are not discovered in routine diagnostics, but may be relevant to pathogenesis.&#xD;
      Culture-independent approaches such as NGS (Next generation Sequencing) have in principle&#xD;
      made it possible to study or prove complex microbial colonization. Because NGS is a&#xD;
      relatively new technology, microbiological diagnostic protocols need to be further customized&#xD;
      and refined to integrate with the standard diagnostic workflow, if necessary. For&#xD;
      microbiological diagnostics, material is collected from the appropriate ascites patients and&#xD;
      sent for microbiological diagnostics. Afterwards the cultural diagnostics are carried out as&#xD;
      part of the patient care at the university hospital. In this study the investigators plan to&#xD;
      use these samples to analyze and compare the presence of bacteria by NGS in parallel to the&#xD;
      culture diagnostics, and then compare it to the patients' gut microbiome, to understand the&#xD;
      possible effect of the microbiome on ascites pathogenesis and outcome.&#xD;

        The study will include adult consent intensive care patients who undergo parenthesis for&#xD;
        diagnostic purposes to exclude ascitic infection, regardless of the clinical picture. The&#xD;
        indication for puncture is provided by the attending clinician regardless of the study.&#xD;
