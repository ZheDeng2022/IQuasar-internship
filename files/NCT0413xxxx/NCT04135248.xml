    <textblock>
      Fasting Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Islam and requested only from healthy adults to&#xD;
      abstain from eating and drinking from sunrise to sunset. People with type 1 diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      (TIDM) are exempted from fasting, as their chronic condition could be adversely affected by&#xD;
      fasting. Nevertheless, many insist on fasting and it has been experienced and advocated that&#xD;
      with proper education and follow-up with health care providers, people with uncomplicated&#xD;
      T1DM could safely fast Ramadan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adopted IDF-DAR guidelines for people with diabetes planning to fast Ramadan are available&#xD;
      but are based on opinions and largely untested. These current guidelines recommend a&#xD;
      significant reduction in insulin doses and a change of the timing of basal insulin and&#xD;
      highlight the increased risk of hypoglycemia. Our local DAFNE patient's experience with&#xD;
      fasting during the past years points towards no significant changes in insulin timing with&#xD;
      minor reductions of insulin without a significant increase in the risk of hypoglycemia. There&#xD;
      is no randomized control trial to test the efficacy of the IDF-DAR guidelines specifically&#xD;
      looking at changing basal insulin timing This study aims to assess whether insulin doses&#xD;
      require reduction and change of timing during Ramadan. We aim to compare the effectiveness&#xD;
      and safety of two management strategies. This will help to provide robust guidelines to help&#xD;
      both health care professionals and people with type 1 diabetes&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes and Ramadan (DAR) and IDF international collaboration created the IDF-DAR guidelines&#xD;
      which include the practical recommendations for HCP to better manage people with diabetes who&#xD;
      plan to fast Ramadan. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has&#xD;
      recommended implementation of structured education programs to help individuals enhance their&#xD;
      knowledge about diabetes and improve their management techniques. The educational program&#xD;
      needs to ensure that patients can cope with specific situations such as exercise, illness&#xD;
      which should extend to religious fasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have developed and adopted a 5-day educational program widely used in the UK for delivery&#xD;
      in Kuwait. The course trains adults with Type 1 Diabetes in the UK to manage their condition&#xD;
      more effectively using multiple injections. As part of our course, DAFNE graduates receive&#xD;
      yearly Ramadan diabetes educational specific session (separate from the main 5-day course)&#xD;
      and all DAFNE graduates are invited. During the 6 hours session, we seek patients' views,&#xD;
      willingness to fast and introduced to the specific food that commonly consumed during&#xD;
      Ramadan. Previous personal experiences of fasting and problems encountered are collected.&#xD;
      Patients who are intending to fast and whom we deem safe to undertake this, receive clear and&#xD;
      practical guidance on safe fasting during Ramadan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current Gaps in the Literature&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most intervention studies up to date have been performed in controlled conditions, using a&#xD;
      small number of participants and with a short duration of intervention, ie not closely&#xD;
      related to real-life. The variability of insulin regimens, dietary patterns and physical&#xD;
      activity levels and the complexity of ways in which they are tested make it difficult to&#xD;
      identify the individual effects of each component on diabetes outcomes. As a result, further&#xD;
      research is needed to help expand the currently available knowledge regarding the management&#xD;
      of diabetes and its associated complications when fasting during Ramadan. We believe that&#xD;
      large, randomized, controlled intervention trials are necessary to broaden our understanding&#xD;
      of the implications of fasting and evaluate guidance without bias. Further research into the&#xD;
      effect of fasting during Ramadan on both high (measured by SMBG and HbA1C) and low glucose&#xD;
      (measured by the incidence of hypoglycemia) is required. Robust evaluation of evidence-based&#xD;
      guidelines will lead to useful practical assistance for patients who can fulfill religious&#xD;
      obligations despite the additional burden of insulin-treated diabetes. This pilot study&#xD;
      builds on an educational program, DAFNE which includes many of the elements of flexible&#xD;
      eating and insulin dose adjustment which should permit patients to fast safely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adopted IDF-DAR guidelines are available but recommend a significant reduction in insulin&#xD;
      doses and change to the timing of basal insulin for MDI users. There is no evidence that&#xD;
      fasting increases the risk of hypoglycemia, and glucose tends to be higher during Ramadan, as&#xD;
      a result of a reduction in insulin doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local DAFNE patient's experience with fasting during the past years points towards no&#xD;
      significant changes in insulin doses (minor reductions were needed in basal or bolus insulin&#xD;
      doses) without the need of the change of basal insulin timing, however we are not aware&#xD;
      without running a randomized control trial (RCT) to test DAFNE guidelines versus DAR-IDF&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES / HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study are to assess whether insulin doses require reduction&#xD;
      during Ramadan and change of timing and whether fasting increases the risk of hypoglycemia&#xD;
      for people with T1DM who fast Ramadan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study hypothesized no changes in insulin dose timing and fasting does not increase the&#xD;
      risk of hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential patients will be identified via DAFNE database at DDI. Candidate subjects who are&#xD;
      current users of (FSL) and administer insulin via (MDI) will be contacted by phone and will&#xD;
      be offered conditional participation in the study. Those agreeable will be given the consent&#xD;
      form with the preferred language (Arabic or English) and will be scheduled a study visit. The&#xD;
      same will be done for insulin pump users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-label randomized controlled trial in people with uncomplicated T1DM fasting during&#xD;
      Ramadan (1 month) comparing insulin management according to IDF-DAR guidelines (IDF-DAR arm)&#xD;
      and local experience (DAFNE arm), on time spent in range (TIR) of 4-10 mmol/L, and&#xD;
      hypoglycaemic self-reported episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Percentage TIR 4-10mmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rate of self-reported hypoglycemia by participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Percentage time &lt;4mmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Percentage time &gt;10mmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Number of sensors detected hypoglycaemic events&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Number of days needed to break the fast&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion/exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mentioned in separate section&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention in this study is insulin dosing and timing during Ramadan, and it will be&#xD;
      assessed by creating two groups of participants that are similar to one another in all&#xD;
      respects, except to the intervention to be assessed. Participants will be DAFNE graduates who&#xD;
      were trained properly on carbohydrate counting and adjusting insulin doses according to the&#xD;
      carbs consumed. The whole cohort will be using the same insulin regimen; multiple daily&#xD;
      injections (MDI) and monitoring glucose using the same monitoring systems; flash glucose&#xD;
      monitoring (FGM) system: FreeStlye Libre (FSL) Reader and sensors, and self-monitoring of&#xD;
      blood glucose (SMBG) using the FreeStyle optimum test strips, or insulin pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the rates of hypoglycemia between basal&#xD;
      insulin taken at iftar time versus bedtime in people with T1DM during fasting Ramadan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ramadan Workshop&#xD;
&#xD;
      DAFNE structured education program was conducted to all subjects in a stage their life with&#xD;
      T1DM. Consequently, subjects are familiar with carbohydrate counting and aware of dose&#xD;
      adjustments needed to cover their meals. Nevertheless, this workshop will include food tables&#xD;
      with real food models of traditional Ramadan plates. The workshop includes advices on healthy&#xD;
      eating habits during Ramadan. General instructions will be provided to all participants which&#xD;
      are part of DAFNE Ramadan protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ramadan Visits, Daily messages, and Calls&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits: Weekly or whenever required, to upload FSL reader and adjust doses without crossing&#xD;
      the arm recommendations for adjustments. This can be done in person or via the cloud Daily&#xD;
      Messages: Did you fast full day? If no, was it due to hypoglycemia, and did you check BG to&#xD;
      confirm hypoglycemia? Daily count of hypoglycemic episodes? Was all confirmed with SMBG? Are&#xD;
      you wearing a glucose sensor, and scanning readings at least once every 8 hours? Calls: If&#xD;
      participant was not answering messages, calls will be initiated. A message or call should be&#xD;
      performed in the last day of Ramadan to instruct participants about the insulin dosing and&#xD;
      timing post-Ramadan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Ramadan Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Upload FSL reader&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Physical examination will be repeated, including weight and routine blood will be&#xD;
           collected again including HbA1C, FBC, U&amp;Es with eGFR, full chemistry, urine ACR within&#xD;
           three months&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. This will conclude the study visits for the subject&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      For statistical analysis, this can be done using two-tailed unpaired t-test as we are&#xD;
      comparing results of different subjects who are in different conditions and the change can be&#xD;
      rise or fall in time in range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telemonitoring data including daily questionnaires, WhatsApp messages, food logs, and meal&#xD;
      pictures will be collected and added to an excel sheet for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FreeStlye libre software will be used to extract reports and data export readings of FSL&#xD;
      readers. The following analysis will be carried out for both arms and for all fasted days:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Total average of 24 hours of glucose&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Estimated A1c&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Percentage time in range 4.0-10mmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Percentage time spent &lt;4.0mmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Percentage of time spent &gt;10mmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Low glucose events&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Low glucose duration&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Total patient-reported hypoglycemia events (from telemonitoring data mentioned above)&#xD;
           One-way ANOVA to compare means of percentage time in all above glucose ranges with an&#xD;
           alpha &lt;0.05&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPORTANCE OF THE RESEARCH OUTCOMES&#xD;
&#xD;
      IDF-DAR guidelines recommend reducing insulin doses in people with T1DM or insulin-dependent&#xD;
      T2DM to prevent hypoglycemia especially in the 3 to 4 hours before iftar, in addition to&#xD;
      changing the basal insulin timing. DAFNE earlier work at DDI demonstrated that fasting&#xD;
      Ramadan did not require a significant reduction of background basal insulin (most 5-10% if&#xD;
      needed) without reduction of meal bolus insulin. It also advocates that there is no increased&#xD;
      risk of hypoglycemia in Ramadan if done with the support of diabetes with prior education and&#xD;
      close glucose monitoring. However, there is significant evidence that glucose tends to be&#xD;
      higher during Ramadan especially post-iftar, as a result of eating feasting behavior and most&#xD;
      probably a reduction in insulin doses as per guidelines. There is no consensus between&#xD;
      guidelines and local experience and no evidence about the cut-off reduction in insulin doses&#xD;
      which requires running this randomized control trial which hypothesized that the change in&#xD;
      eating behavior in Ramadan does not change insulin requirement and carb counting will provide&#xD;
      safe insulin dosing during Ramadan similar to that outside Ramadan&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS Informed Consent Forms&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will give a patient information sheet for the participant to keep and ask for written&#xD;
      informed consent. We will document that 3 copies have been distributed: one to the&#xD;
      participant, another to his/her doctor and one for the study team&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONFIDENTIALITY&#xD;
&#xD;
      All hard copies of any study material will be kept in locked cabinets on the premises of DDI.&#xD;
      Subject identifiable information will be only available to study team and ethics committee&#xD;
      for inspection in case this becomes required.&#xD;
