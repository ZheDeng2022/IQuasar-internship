  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some people with diabetes get foot ulcers that do not heal. These ulcers can get infected and&#xD;
      cause other medical problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five patients with these foot ulcers volunteered to participate in the first part of this&#xD;
      study (C9T12015, NCT02657876). They are called Cohort 1 in this registration. Cohort 1&#xD;
      received one application (piece) of an experimental skin tissue to make sure it was safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will extend the safety test of the experimental skin tissue. It will find out if&#xD;
      it is safe to use more than once to cover non-healing ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This extension will include two more groups, Cohort 2 and Cohort 3. Cohort 2 may get up to 5&#xD;
      applications. Cohort 3 may get up to 10 applications. The number of applications will depend&#xD;
      on how well the wound is healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be in the study up to one year.&#xD;

        Volunteers will be consented. Then there will be a run-in period for the doctor to run some&#xD;
        tests. If the tests show the study would be good for the patient, the doctor will enroll&#xD;
        them as participants in the trial.&#xD;
