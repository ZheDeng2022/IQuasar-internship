  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnesium plays a role in an array of critical body functions, controls normal adenosine&#xD;
      triphosphate function, the metabolism of glucose, and cardiac muscle function, as well as the&#xD;
      maintenance of cell membrane function. Low magnesium intakes and blood levels have been&#xD;
      associated with a number of chronic diseases including hypertension, type 2 diabetes,&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome, vascular disease, osteoporosis, and colon cancer. Magnesium deficiency is&#xD;
      common. In the U.S. population, nearly 4% of men and 7% of women have hypomagnesemia&#xD;
      (typically defined as a serum concentration &lt;0.75 mmol/L, or &lt; 17mg/L), which has been&#xD;
      previously shown to be associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality after 30&#xD;
      years of follow-up. In addition, hypomagnesemia is seen in approximately 11% of hospitalized&#xD;
      patients and 52% of patients in coronary care units. Approximately half of the U.S.&#xD;
      population does not currently reach the estimated average requirement (EAR) for magnesium&#xD;
      from food. Yet magnesium deficiency is often overlooked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnesium is relatively well absorbed by the gut; oral bioavailability varies from 35 to 70%&#xD;
      and depends on a variety of factors such as the form of the magnesium salt (organic vs.&#xD;
      inorganic), its rate and extent of uptake from the intestine into the blood, and its transfer&#xD;
      into tissues because magnesium is primarily an intracellular cation. The absorption rate&#xD;
      increases when dietary intake is low. In terms of the effectiveness of oral dietary&#xD;
      supplements, bioavailability and tolerability of various formulations are important&#xD;
      considerations. Similar bioavailability has been demonstrated between inorganic formulations&#xD;
      (magnesium oxide vs. magnesium chloride), however some studies have shown magnesium oxide to&#xD;
      be less bioavailable. Diarrhea and abdominal cramping are side effects that are commonly&#xD;
      reported from oral oral supplementation. These symptoms are thought to be due to the osmotic&#xD;
      activity of unabsorbed salts in the intestine and colon and the stimulation of gastric&#xD;
      motility. A new picometer-ionic form of magnesium chloride, was developed to efficiently&#xD;
      deliver stabilized magnesium ions that are similar in size to plant magnesium. Picometer&#xD;
      magnesium is smaller in diameter than the body's cell mineral ion channels, therefore it has&#xD;
      the potential to be completely absorbed and not cause adverse side effects in the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal system (e.g., diarrhea). The aim of this research is to assess the&#xD;
      bioavailability of this new picometer-ionic form of magnesium chloride by comparing its&#xD;
      bioavailability to that of a standard magnesium oxide and magnesium citrate supplement in&#xD;
      healthy, adult, normotensive subjects.&#xD;

    <description>Ionized magnesium in whole blood is the primary outcome measure which will be measured by using a magnesium selective electrode clinical analyzer (Stat Profile Prime® Model, Prime Electrolyte System) at multiple time points following the oral doses of the magnesium supplements (MgCl vs MgO vs placebo). The time points will be -15 minutes prior to dose and post dose at 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hour, 3 hour, 4 hour, 6 hour, 8 hour and 24 hour.</description>

    <description>Total magnesium in serum and urine are the secondary outcome measures which will be measured by using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) at multiple time points following the oral doses of the magnesium supplements (MgCl vs MgO vs placebo). The time points for serum total magnesium will be -15 minutes prior to dose and post dose at 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hour, 3 hour, 4 hour, 6 hour, 8 hour and 24 hour. Complete urine collections will be obtained at pooled intervals that coincide with timing of blood draws.</description>
