  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EaseVRx, a software-based virtual reality (VR) medical device, is intended to offer users a&#xD;
      prescription pain management tool that manages the symptoms associated with chronic pain and&#xD;
      reduces or eliminates the risk of opioid dependence. The investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      proof-of-concept randomized study to assess the feasibility and efficacy of using EaseVRx as&#xD;
      a 56-day, VR-based, at-home program among 100 chronic low back pain patients by gathering&#xD;
      pilot data on the efficacy of the intervention in decreasing pain, reducing opioid/non-opioid&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy, and improving pain-related quality of life.&#xD;

      EaseVRx, a software-based virtual reality (VR) medical device, is intended to offer users a&#xD;
      prescription pain management tool that manages the symptoms associated with chronic pain and&#xD;
      reduces or eliminates the risk of opioid dependence. EaseVRx is based on principles of&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy, pain psychology, mindfulness-based stress reduction,&#xD;
      biofeedback, and distraction therapy commonly used in interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation&#xD;
      programs. The investigators will conduct a proof-of-concept randomized study to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility and efficacy of using EaseVRx as a 56-day, VR-based, at-home program among 100&#xD;
      chronic low back pain patients by gathering pilot data on the efficacy of the intervention in&#xD;
      decreasing pain, reducing opioid/non-opioid pharmacotherapy, and improving pain-related&#xD;
      quality of life. While VR has been tested in academic medical centers and shown to be&#xD;
      efficacious in the management of acute pain, this study will investigate the feasibility of&#xD;
      VR use at home to manage chronic pain in preparation for a larger efficacy trial.&#xD;
