    <textblock>
      The investigators are testing two digital health interventions for obsessive compulsive&#xD;
      disorder (OCD). The investigators hope that these digital health programs will increase&#xD;
      access to treatment for OCD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aims of this study are to test the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of&#xD;
      two digital health interventions for adults with OCD recruited nationally. Eligible subjects&#xD;
      (N=120) will be randomly assigned (50/50 chance) to 12 weeks of app-based CBT on their&#xD;
      personal Smartphone or 12 weeks of web-based health and well-being education in addition to&#xD;
      completing clinical assessments and questionnaires from home. All participants will have&#xD;
      access to a coach to help guide them through their assigned program. Total participation time&#xD;
      for the study is approximately 6 months, and all study appointments (5 total) occur over&#xD;
      secure phone or video conference call.&#xD;

    <measure>Difference in OCD severity (YBOCS) at the end of Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) is the gold-standard, semi-structured clinician-administered assessment of OCD severity. It contains 10 items ranging from 0 to 4, which are summed to generate a total score (range = 0-40). Higher scores indicate more severe OCD symptoms. The Y-BOCS will be used to assess change in OCD symptoms from baseline to endpoint.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in depression at the end of Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The QIDS-SR is a self-report measure of depressive symptoms consisting of 16 scale items with responses ranging from 0 to 3, including one suicide item (item #12). Higher scores correspond with greater depression severity, and the measure is a well-validated, sensitive measure of symptom severity in depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in functional impairment at the end of Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The SDS uses a Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely) to assess impairment in occupational, social, and family domains. Higher scores indicate greater impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in quality of life at the end of Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The Q-LES-Q-SF is a self-report measure of subjective quality of life, containing Likert items ranging from 1 (Very Poor) to 5 (Very Good). Total scores are presented as a percentage of the maximum value (i.e., ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater quality of life).</description>
