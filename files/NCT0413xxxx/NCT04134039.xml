  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation is designed to evaluate the performance rate of a polyurethane (PU) condom&#xD;
      versus a standard natural rubber latex (NRL) condom.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical investigation, a new PU male condom (test condom) will be evaluated against&#xD;
      a marketed NRL male condom (reference condom). This clinical investigation will also evaluate&#xD;
      the in-use tolerance of the test and reference condoms.&#xD;

    <measure>Compared clinical failure rate of condom use between the test condom group and the reference condom group</measure>
    <time_frame>within 2 hours following each coital act for each condom use</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical failure rate is calculated as the number of condoms with at least 1 acute clinical failure event divided by the number of condoms used during intercourse, reported as a percentage. Clinical failure events, defined in ISO 29943-1:2017, will be reported by subjects.</description>

    <measure>Performance (clinical slippage rate) of the Polyurethane (PU) condom</measure>
    <time_frame>within 2 hours following each coital act for each condom use</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical slippage rate is calculated as the number of condoms with at least 1 clinical slippage event divided by the number of condoms used during intercourse, reported as a percentage. Clinical slippage events, defined in ISO 29943-1:2017, will be reported by subjects.&#xD;
A clinical slippage is defined as a condom slipping off completely during intercourse or during withdrawal from the vagina. Slippage that occur because the user failed to hold onto the condom at the base of the penis during withdrawal and/ or because the user delayed withdrawal after sex are to be record as &quot;non-clinical slippage&quot;, these events are considered user failures.</description>

&#xD;
          6. A female partner that has been diagnosed with or treated for vaginal complaints&#xD;

&#xD;

             vaginal mucosal secretion, such as Chlorpheniramine at any time in the 14 days (or 5&#xD;
             half-lives of the drug, whichever is longer) before first condom use.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. A male partner with abnormal penile anatomy that would, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, affect the ability to keep the condom in place during intercourse.&#xD;
&#xD;
