  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Postpartum depression follows approximately 10-15% of deliveries. Maternal&#xD;
      functional disability, particularly in the relationship with the infant, a hallmark of PPD,&#xD;
      causes impairment in the mother's ability to bond with her infant. Subsequently, this&#xD;
      impairment leads to deleterious long-term consequences for infant cognitive, neurological,&#xD;
      and social-emotional growth, and is associated with psychiatric disorders in later life.&#xD;
      Therefore, the development of effective short-term treatment in such a highly prevalent&#xD;
      phenomenon is of a high clinical priority. While pharmacological and psychological treatments&#xD;
      are effective in treating PPD , these interventions have failed to show a significant&#xD;
      improvement in mother-child interaction quality and infant development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Oxytocin System: Oxytocin (OXT) is a nine amino acid neuro-peptide, found exclusively in&#xD;
      mammals and is released during labor and lactation. Among the central influences of OXT on&#xD;
      human social behavior are increased trust, empathy and eye contact. Brain imaging found that&#xD;
      maternal attachment activates regions in the brain's reward systems that are rich with&#xD;
      oxytocin and vasopressin receptors . Such findings led researchers to speculate that OXT may&#xD;
      be involved in linking and maintaining the connection between social recognition systems and&#xD;
      feelings of pleasure . According to this speculation, pair bonding is a form of conditioned&#xD;
      reward learning, whereby OXT promotes the reward in social encounters, thus enhancing the&#xD;
      motivation to engage in such interaction .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disruptions to the oxytocin system in depression have been repeatedly observed, and woman&#xD;
      suffering from PPD have lower plasma OXT concentrations in comparison to the control group .&#xD;
      A recent small treatment study of OXT in women suffering from PPD did not show a positive&#xD;
      effect on mood; however, it did show improved mother-child interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies suggest a bio-behavioral feedback loop of OXT, parenting, and infant social&#xD;
      competence. Rationale and Hypotheses of the Current Research: We speculate that mothers&#xD;
      suffering from PPD exhibit high levels of depression and low levels of OXT, hence&#xD;
      experiencing the interaction with their child as less rewarding, which in turn promote&#xD;
      further depressive symptoms and interfere with child development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the relationship between levels of oxytocin in mothers suffering from&#xD;
           postpartum depression and their babies, before and after psychological dyadic treatment&#xD;
           compered to supportive treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study the added value of dyadic treatment over conventional supportive treatment for&#xD;
           PPD that does not focus specifically on the mother's relationship with her baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To show the effects of dyadic treatment for PPD mothers and their children on the&#xD;
           child's emotional and behavioral development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Subjects: 50 Mothers will be interviewed and diagnosed as suffering from PPD&#xD;
      according to DSM-IV-TR, will be enrolled within 2-8 months postpartum.&#xD;

      Background: Postpartum depression follows approximately 10-15% of deliveries. Maternal&#xD;
      functional disability, particularly in the relationship with the infant, a hallmark of PPD,&#xD;
      causes impairment in the mother's ability to bond with her infant. Subsequently, this&#xD;
      impairment leads to deleterious long-term consequences for infant cognitive, neurological,&#xD;
      and social-emotional growth, and is associated with psychiatric disorders in later life.&#xD;
      Recently, biological correlates of maternal deprivation and maternal depression on the&#xD;
      infant's brain in both animal and human studies have been found . Therefore, the development&#xD;
      of effective short-term treatment in such a highly prevalent phenomenon is of a high clinical&#xD;
      priority. While pharmacological and psychological treatments are effective in treating PPD,&#xD;
      these interventions have failed to show a significant improvement in mother-child interaction&#xD;
      quality and infant development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Oxytocin System: Oxytocin (OXT) is a nine amino acid neuro-peptide, found exclusively in&#xD;
      mammals and is released during labor and lactation. The effects of OXT on the anterior&#xD;
      cingulate, OFC and vmPFC, suggesting its effect on 'social brain' areas have been reported in&#xD;
      the past , including modulation of maternal behaviors and paternal behaviors including&#xD;
      positive affect, social gaze, touch, and vocal synchrony with the infant . Among the central&#xD;
      influences of OXT on human social behavior are increased trust , empathy and eye contact .&#xD;
      Brain imaging found that maternal attachment activates regions in the brain's reward systems&#xD;
      that are rich with oxytocin and vasopressin receptors . Such findings led researchers to&#xD;
      speculate that OXT may be involved in linking and maintaining the connection between social&#xD;
      recognition systems and feelings of pleasure . According to this speculation, pair bonding is&#xD;
      a form of conditioned reward learning, whereby OXT promotes the reward in social encounters,&#xD;
      thus enhancing the motivation to engage in such interaction .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disruptions to the oxytocin system in depression have been repeatedly observed, and woman&#xD;
      suffering from PPD have lower plasma OXT concentrations in comparison to the control group .&#xD;
      Recent studies investigated the therapeutic potential of OXT in psychopathologies involving&#xD;
      impaired social functioning such as autism spectrum disorders where OXT was found to&#xD;
      facilitate social information processing and retention of social information, in social&#xD;
      anxiety disorder , and schizophrenia where OXT administration resulted in a significant&#xD;
      improvement in several social cognition measures and symptom reduction. Furthermore, a recent&#xD;
      small treatment study of OXT in women suffering from PPD did not show a positive effect on&#xD;
      mood; however, it did show improved mother-child interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies suggest a bio-behavioral feedback loop of OXT, parenting, and infant social&#xD;
      competence. The mechanisms of cross-generation transmission in the OXT system have been&#xD;
      observed in human parents and infants in the first months of the infant's life and showed&#xD;
      that parent and child's OXT levels are highly correlated and higher parental OXT was&#xD;
      associated with higher infant OXT. Studies in non-human primates have shown long-term&#xD;
      consequences on the development of social competence and infant's ultimate parental skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale and Hypotheses of the Current Research: We speculate that mothers suffering from&#xD;
      PPD exhibit high levels of depression and low levels of OXT, hence experiencing the&#xD;
      interaction with their child as less rewarding, which in turn promote further depressive&#xD;
      symptoms and interfere with child development.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Methods: Subjects: 50 Mothers will be interviewed and diagnosed as suffering from PPD&#xD;
      according to DSM-IV-TR, will be enrolled within 2-8 months postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An informed consent will be obtained, inclusion and exclusion criteria will be examined,&#xD;
      demographic information, psychiatric and medical history will be obtained, and MADRS, CGI-S,&#xD;
      and GAD7 questionnaires will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline assessment will be conducted at the infant's home, at that time, a mother&#xD;
      -infant interaction will be videotaped, and the YIPTA, BDI, EPDS, STAI, PSI, NMR, ERC, IOS,&#xD;
      PBI, EQ and IRI questionnaires will be administered. Salivary OXT samples will be collected&#xD;
      from the infants and salivary OXTsamples will be collected from the parent .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with PPD will be invited for a mid-point clinical evaluation at the outpatient&#xD;
      Psychiatric Department, Haemek Medical Center. The evaluation will include a psychiatric&#xD;
      evaluation using MADRS, CGI-S, and GAD-7 questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the women in the PPD group will participate in 8 weeks of dyadic psychotherapy (DP) combining&#xD;
      video feedback. The treatment will be conducted at the subject's home. Additional 25 PPD&#xD;
      women will receive only supportive treatment at their home. The supportive treatment will&#xD;
      include psychoeducation regarding the development of the infant. During the 8-week treatment,&#xD;
      salivary OXT,Estradiol, Progesterone, SIGA and Vasopressin samples will be collected from the&#xD;
      mother and infant at the beginning and the end of each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four weeks into DP, women with PPD will undergo another clinical evaluation at the outpatient&#xD;
      Psychiatric Department, Haemek Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A final end-of-study clinical evaluation, for all women in the groups, will be conducted at&#xD;
      the end of 12 weeks. Another assessment will be conducted at the infant's home, including&#xD;
      mother -infant interaction. Mother-infant interaction will be filmed and assessed using the&#xD;
      CIB Manual and the NOLDOS coding system. Salivary OXT, Estradiol, Progesterone, SIGA and&#xD;
      Vasopressin samples will be collected from the mother and from the infant. PPD and control&#xD;
      mothers. For PPD mothers, the evaluation will include a psychiatric evaluation (MADRS, CGI-S,&#xD;
      and GAD-7 the MADRS) and the emotional conflict task at the outpatient Psychiatric&#xD;
      Department, Haemek Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: The study is expected to proceed for approximately 2 years. First year:&#xD;
      setting up study infrastructure, preparation of collaborations, beginning of patient&#xD;
      recruitment and treatment. Second year: patient recruitment and treatment according to&#xD;
      protocol and data analysis.&#xD;
