  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is both a prospective and retrospective study of patients with a known diagnosis of&#xD;
      optic neuritis (ON) only, multiple sclerosis (MS) with ON, or neuromyelitis spectrum disorder&#xD;
      (NMOSD) with ON. There will be no requirement for blinding (patient or assessor) and data&#xD;
      collected with the Reflex app will be compared against other data that track optic nerve&#xD;
      functional status, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), visual fields (VF),&#xD;
      low-contrast sensitivity, MRI orbits/brain and visual evoked potentials (VEP). Patients who&#xD;
      have any diagnosis of ON, with or without a diagnosis of MS or NMOSD and who have had testing&#xD;
      using other modalities such as VEPs, VF, low-contrast sensitivity studies, OCT, and MRI of&#xD;
      brain or orbits will be included as retrospective subjects in the study. In this cohort, RAPD&#xD;
      assessments will be completed and compared to against the data that has accrued as noted.&#xD;

      The purpose of this research is to gather information on whether using quantitative- or&#xD;
      numerical measurements of pupil changes as an alternative to qualitative- or observation&#xD;
      based- testing can be done to assess optic nerve dysfunction in ON, MS with ON, and NMOSD&#xD;
      with ON. One way this is done is through evaluating relative afferent pupillary defect&#xD;
      (RAPD), which is a clinical sign that is used to detect an injury or defect in the pupil's&#xD;
      pathway and this often involves the retina of the eye, which focuses light, and the optic&#xD;
      nerve, which sends visual information to the brain. When shining a light into each eye, the&#xD;
      eye with RAPD shows a slowed response to light, and when the light moves to the normal eye,&#xD;
      the pupil of RAPD eye will dilate. Observational evaluations of RAPD are very common in&#xD;
      clinical neurology to detect these optic nerve diseases. As technology has advanced, to&#xD;
      lessen the observation errors, numerical measurement of RAPD is now possible through a web&#xD;
      based app called Reflex (Brightlamp Inc., Purdue University), which is a FDAapproved class I&#xD;
      regulated medical device. In this study, the investigator will compare the results of a&#xD;
      participant's app recording to other data that has been collected which also tracks optic&#xD;
      nerve function status.&#xD;

    <description>The Reflex pupillometer is a mobile based application that provides a quantitative way to monitor pupillary activity and responsiveness. It uses the mobile phone as a source of light and records pupillary response, as well as analyzes and compiles the data. It produces quantitative measures such as latency, minimum and maximum pupil diameter, maximum and average constriction velocity, dilation velocity, and 75% recovery time.</description>
