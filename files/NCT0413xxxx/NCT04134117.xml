    <textblock>
      In this study, is researching the safety of tisagenlecleucel in participants with primary&#xD;
      central nervous system lymphoma. .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining&#xD;
      this intervention in people with primary central nervous system lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The name of the study intervention is tisagenlecleucel. Tisagenlecleucel is an&#xD;
           investigational treatment that uses the participants own immune cells, called T cells,&#xD;
           to try to kill the cancerous cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment&#xD;
           including, leukapheresis, evaluations, and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study treatment will be one day and participants will be followed for up to 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is expected that about 6 people will take part in this research study&#xD;
