      The AlloSure test is approved by the FDA for use in Medicare patients to assess the&#xD;
      probability of allograft rejection in kidney transplant patients. The pivotal DART study&#xD;
      discusses the use of the non-invasive AlloSure test to measure donor derived cell-free DNA&#xD;
      (dd-cfDNA) and the Allosure test can by used to discriminate active rejection in renal&#xD;
      transplant patients. Pancreas allograft rejection still remains a major clinical challenge&#xD;
      and is a primary cause of death censored pancreas allograft loss. Pancreas transplant&#xD;
      rejection is diagnosed by biopsy, however it is not commonly performed because of the&#xD;
      complications such as pancreatic leak, graft loss and patient death. Currently at Rush&#xD;
      surveillance biopsy of the pancreas are not performed routinely due to the above risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At RUMC, patients are followed post-transplant with series of labs at set intervals that&#xD;
      include lipase, DSA, C-Peptide, and GAD65 for surveillance of rejection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AlloSure test was introduced for routine use in kidney transplant recipients at Rush&#xD;
      University Medical Center in October 2017, after FDA approval and then as part of the KOAR&#xD;
      Study in May of 2018. AlloSure test has been included as part of the routine labs for&#xD;
      surveillance of rejection in pancreas transplant recipients at RUMC since September 2018&#xD;
      after it was approved for compassionate use. The addition of AlloSure has helped to improve&#xD;
      surveillance of rejection in pancreas transplant recipients and has reduced the need for the&#xD;
      kidney biopsy as a surrogate marker of rejection in the pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our goal is to determine if AlloSure can be used for surveillance for rejection in recipients&#xD;
      of Simultaneous Pancreas and Kidney (SPK) Transplant recipients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective and retrospective cohort study of recipients of simultaneous pancreas&#xD;
      and kidney transplant recipients (SPK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      New SPK transplant recipients and previous SPK transplant recipients from September 2012 will&#xD;
      be enrolled in the study, expected duration of participation will therefore range from a&#xD;
      minimum of 1 year to a maximum of 5 years for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The visits are incorporated into the current standard of care in our program and no extra&#xD;
      visits are required. Mobile draw for AlloSure can be obtained if the patient is not due for a&#xD;
      visit when the AlloSure draw is due.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AlloSure labs will be drawn on all new SPK patients and results obtained as well as&#xD;
      retrospective results that have already been received on past SPK recipients. The AlloSure&#xD;
      will be added to the standard of care schedule for all SPK patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The schedule will be the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For newly transplanted patients, AlloSure will be checked at 14 days post-transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      From 1 month to 12 months post transplant: AlloSure will be obtained monthly with their&#xD;
      transplant date as the reference time point&#xD;
&#xD;
      From 12 months to 36 months: AlloSure will be obtained every 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      From 36 months to 60 months: AlloSure will be obtained every 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AlloSure may be obtained more frequently than the above schedule, with other clinical data or&#xD;
      allograft biopsy, if there is graft dysfunction or suspicion for rejection.&#xD;
