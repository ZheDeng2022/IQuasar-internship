  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standard palliative radiotherapy regimens may provide limited durability of response in large&#xD;
      tumors. Thus, there is a clinical need for a new approach. The Lattice SBRT approach will&#xD;
      deliver 20 Gy in 5 fractions with partial volume simultaneous integrated boosts to 66.7 Gy.&#xD;
      This is hypothesized to improve symptom response, local control, and better prime the tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment for immune response compared with standard palliative radiotherapy doses. It&#xD;
      is also hypothesized that this will be associated with less toxicity than the traditional&#xD;
      homogenous SBRT plan delivered to a large tumor. Blood will be collected before and after&#xD;
      Lattice SBRT for evaluation of the peripheral blood immune microenvironment.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planning to undergo palliative radiotherapy to a lesion ≥ 4.5 cm as measured with&#xD;
             radiographic imaging or with calipers by clinical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiotherapy is known to be teratogenic. For this reason, women of childbearing&#xD;
             potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method&#xD;
             of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
             participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately. Men&#xD;
             treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             prior to the study, for the duration of the study, and 6 months after completion of&#xD;
             the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent&#xD;
             document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiotherapy that overlaps with any planned site of protocol radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with tumors in need of urgent surgical intervention, such as life-threatening&#xD;
             bleeding or those at high risk for pathologic fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently receiving any cytotoxic cancer therapy regimens or VEGF inhibitors that will&#xD;
             overlap with the Lattice SBRT administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *Cytotoxic chemotherapy and VEGF inhibitors prior to radiotherapy or planned after&#xD;
             radiotherapy delivery are allowed at the discretion of the treating radiation&#xD;
             oncologist. This includes continuing a treatment plan which was initiated prior to the&#xD;
             start of radiotherapy. A 2 week washout is recommended, but not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 20 days of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with HIV are eligible unless their CD4+ T-cell counts are &lt; 350 cells/mcL or&#xD;
             they have a history of AIDS-defining opportunistic infection within the 12 months&#xD;
             prior to registration. Concurrent treatment with effective ART according to DHHS&#xD;
             treatment guidelines is recommended. Recommend exclusion of specific ART agents based&#xD;
             on predicted drug-drug interactions (i.e. for sensitive CYP3A4 substrates, concurrent&#xD;
             strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir and cobicistat) or inducers (efavirenz) should be&#xD;
             contraindicated).&#xD;
