  <brief_summary>

      rate of participants who receive JNJ-68284528.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma is characterized by the production of monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig)&#xD;
      proteins or protein fragments (M proteins) that have lost their function. The main aim of the&#xD;
      study is to determine the safety and efficacy of JNJ-68284528 in various clinical settings.&#xD;
      JNJ-68284528 is an autologous chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy that targets&#xD;
      B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA). The study comprises of a Screening Phase (less than or&#xD;
      equal to [&lt;=] 28 days prior to apheresis) followed by Apheresis (will occur upon enrollment);&#xD;
      a Treatment Phase including a conditioning regimen followed by infusion of JNJ-68284528 and&#xD;
      post-infusion assessments from Day 1 to Day 100 (participants who receive an infusion of&#xD;
      JNJ-68284528 should continue all subsequent assessments); and a Post-treatment Phase (Day 101&#xD;
      and up to the end of each study cohort). Safety evaluations will include a review of adverse&#xD;
      events, laboratory test results, vital sign measurements, physical examination findings&#xD;
      (including neurologic examination), assessment of cardiac function, immune effector&#xD;
      cell-associated encephalopathy (ICE) score, handwriting assessment, and assessment of Eastern&#xD;
      Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status grade. Efficacy evaluations will include&#xD;
      measurements of tumor burden/residual disease, myeloma proteins, bone marrow examinations,&#xD;
      skeletal surveys, extramedullary plasmacytomas, and serum calcium corrected for albumin. For&#xD;
      certain participants (those without measurable disease in serum or urine) efficacy will be&#xD;
      assessed via imaging: positron emission tomography/ computed tomography (PET/CT) or whole&#xD;
      body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The overall duration of the study is up to 2.5 years.&#xD;
