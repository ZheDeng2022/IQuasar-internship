  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oropharyngeal dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, is a devastating condition that affects&#xD;
      physiological and psychosocial functioning in 1 in 25 adults. Many dysphagia treatments&#xD;
      exist, but our ability to adequately measure treatment outcomes is limited. Pharyngeal&#xD;
      high-resolution manometry (pHRM) directly measures swallowing pressures, providing an&#xD;
      objective measurement of physiology that characterizes the basic mechanisms of swallowing.&#xD;
      pHRM is well-poised to measure outcomes of dysphagia treatments due to its direct, objective,&#xD;
      and reproducible measures of swallowing function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed project will address a central hypotheses that objective swallowing measures&#xD;
      (including (pHRM) will reveal treatment-mediated swallowing changes, will align with&#xD;
      patient-reported outcome measures, and will be able to predict who will benefit from&#xD;
      treatment. The investigators will follow a cohort of participants with oropharyngeal&#xD;
      dysphagia as they undergo either pharyngeal strengthening therapy or relief of upper&#xD;
      esophageal sphincter outlet obstruction at three time points: baseline, mid-treatment (4-6&#xD;
      weeks) and post-treatment (10-12 weeks). The investigators will compare participants to&#xD;
      healthy controls using pHRM, videofluoroscopy, diet assessment, functional reserve tests, and&#xD;
      patient-reported outcome measures.&#xD;

    <description>pHRM data collected from the 250 adults undergoing dysphagia treatment and 50 healthy controls at three time points (baseline, mid-treatment, and post-treatment) will be used.</description>

    <measure>Change in Sydney Swallowing Questionnaire between timepoints</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, mid-treatment 4-6 weeks, post-treatment 10-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Sydney Swallowing Questionnaire is a 17-item inventory scored on a visual analog scale (VAS) (with the exception of Q12) developed to measure symptomatic severity of pharyngeal dysphagia. Each VAS is 100 mm, where the left side of the scale is lesser symptoms and the right hand of the scale is increased symptoms. Scoring is measured in distance (mm) from the left. Maximum range in the scoring is 0 - 1700, the higher the score, the more severe the symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in Eat Assessment Tool Score between timepoints</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, mid-treatment 4-6 weeks, post-treatment 10-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Eat Assessment Tool is a 10-item survey where each item is scored 0-4 where 0 is no problem and 4 is severe problem. The total range in score is 0-40 where higher scores indicate increased severity of symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in Hand Grip Strength Test between timepoints</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, mid-treatment 4-6 weeks, post-treatment 10-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will squeeze a dynamometer at maximum pressure 3 times and hold for 5 seconds each. 10 seconds rest will be given between each trial.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Maximum Isometric Pressure between timepoints</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, mid-treatment 4-6 weeks, post-treatment 10-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Iowa Oral Pressure Instrument (IOPI) will be used to measure maximum isometric pressure. IOPI will be used to evaluate anterior and posterior maximal isometric tongue-pressures. A small (3.5 cm long and 4.5 cm in diameter) air-filled plastic pressure bulb will be placed in the mouth at two different positions: directly posterior to the incisors and at the posterior oral tongue. Participants will be asked to squeeze the bulb against the roof of the mouth with maximal effort and to perform saliva swallows. Three tasks in each position will be recorded and participants will rest for 10 seconds between each trial.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Dietary Assessment between timepoints</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, mid-treatment 4-6 weeks, post-treatment 10-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will undergo diet assessment by using International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative Framework. This framework defines and scores food textures/consistencies for participants with dysphagia. Liquids are scored 0-4 where 0 is thin and 4 is extremely thick. Foods are scored from 3-7 where 3 is liquidized food and 7 is regular food.</description>

        300 adults will be recruited to participate in the study. Participants will include 250&#xD;
        patients with heterogeneous causes of dysphagia undergoing active swallowing treatment and&#xD;
        50 age- and sex-match control participants with healthy swallow function. Participants will&#xD;
        be stratified into the following goals of swallowing rehabilitation: Group A) Pharyngeal&#xD;
        strengthening (n=125); and Group B) Relief of upper esophageal sphincter (UES) dysfunction&#xD;
        or pharyngeal outlet obstruction (n=125). Classification will be based on clinician-driven&#xD;
        diagnoses and treatment goals based on standard of care evaluation. The control group of&#xD;
        healthy individuals will be Group C (n=50).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants' age may range from 18-99 years old; as dysphagia is more frequent in the&#xD;
        elderly, the sample will most likely include individuals age 60 and over.&#xD;
