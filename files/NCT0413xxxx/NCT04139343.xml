  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this research protocol is to study and follow the course of motor&#xD;
      neuron loss in individuals with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) using the electrophysiological&#xD;
      technique of motor unit number estimation (MUNE). This study is based on the hypothesis that&#xD;
      the electrophysiological technique of motor unit number estimation (MUNE) and compound muscle&#xD;
      action potential (CMAP) provide sensitive indicators to assess the severity and progression&#xD;
      of disease in adults with SMA.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective pilot study to determine MUNE and CMAP values in a population of adults&#xD;
      with SMA, assess how these electrophysiologic parameters change over time, and explore how&#xD;
      well these parameters correlates with other outcome measures in SMA, including functional&#xD;
      scales (SMAFRS and SF-36) and muscle strength (by MMT, MVICT, 6 minute walk test, time to&#xD;
      climb 4 stairs and handheld myometry). The study was started in 2006 with 4 visits. It was&#xD;
      initially intended to measure baseline and variability of values at baseline, 6 months, 10-14&#xD;
      months, and 20-24 months to better characterize the disease and to validate measurements as&#xD;
      suitable outcome measures to be used in future therapeutic trials on adults. Individuals who&#xD;
      do not take nusinersen would continue on this visit plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the addition of the FDA approved drug nusinersen for SMA we would like to follow people&#xD;
      who are receiving that treatment more frequently. The visits will fall in relationship to&#xD;
      their treatment doses. Those patients who are receiving nusinersen will come in at a baseline&#xD;
      visit that will be1 to 6 weeks prior to first treatment. Then they would follow-up one to 2.5&#xD;
      weeks after each treatment dosing that happens quarterly after the initial loading dose.&#xD;
      There will be 10 visits over 3 years. The visits will occur at baseline, 2, 6, 10, 14, 18,&#xD;
      22, 26, 30, and 34 months. These additional visits will allow for better uniform monitoring&#xD;
      of the response to treatment and resubmission to insurance providers. Additional long term&#xD;
      data will be collected from interested/available patients every 2-3 years up to a max of&#xD;
      fifteen years. Being followed long term would add 4-6 visits over 12 years. If subjects&#xD;
      completed the study course in the past and are now starting nusinersen (SPINRAZA), those&#xD;
      individuals are able to enroll again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 100 people with SMA will be enrolled in this trial. This will allow for two&#xD;
      cohorts of people with SMA; those receiving treatment and those not receiving treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control participants will only come to a baseline visit and the only tests that will be&#xD;
      completed are the EMG Measures (MUNE, CMAP, decomposition EMG) and EIM. There will be no&#xD;
      further testing for those participants. This visit will take approximately 30-60 minutes. A&#xD;
      total of 40 control participants are being recruited for this study.&#xD;
