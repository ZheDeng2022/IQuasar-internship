    <textblock>
      This overall goal of this trial will be to demonstrate that DYV700 is safe and effective as a&#xD;
      treatment for acute gout flares.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gout presents as intermittent acute painful and debilitating gout flares. High serum uric&#xD;
      acid levels lead to the deposition of urate crystals in and around the joints, most commonly&#xD;
      the big toe (also called podagra) and other peripheral joints. An acute gout flare causes&#xD;
      extreme pain and inflammation of the afflicted joints. It initially presents as a&#xD;
      monoarticular condition but can affect several joints as the disease progresses. Gout flares&#xD;
      typically take 7-10 days to resolve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the inflammation and pain associated with acute gout flares are treated&#xD;
      anti-inflammatories, including non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine,&#xD;
      corticosteroids, and adrenocorticotropic hormone. However these drugs are limited in&#xD;
      efficacy, contraindicated for some patients and may take more than 24 hours to relieve gout&#xD;
      symptoms (e.g. colchicine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DYV700 will be developed to reduce the pain associated with acute gout flares. DYV700 is&#xD;
      applied topically and utilizes a proprietary drug delivery system to deliver it's active&#xD;
      ingredients.&#xD;
