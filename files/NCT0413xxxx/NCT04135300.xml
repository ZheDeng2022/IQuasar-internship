      GT2019001 is a Phase 1, open- label, non- randomized, uncontrolled, single dose pilot study&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability and kinetics of a single intravenous infusion of&#xD;
      BBM-H901 in hemophilia B subjects with ≤2IU/dl residual FIX levels. BBM-H901 is an&#xD;
      adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector designed to drive expression of the human factor IX&#xD;
      (hFIX) transgene and raise circulating levels of endogenous FIX.&#xD;

      GT2019001 is a Phase 1, open- label, non- randomized, uncontrolled, single dose pilot study&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability and kinetics of a single intravenous infusion of&#xD;
      BBM-H901 in hemophilia B subjects with ≤2IU/dl residual FIX levels. Three subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled and administered with single infusion of BBM-H901, an AAV at one dose level of&#xD;
      5x1012 vg/Kg.Subjects will provide informed consent and then undergo screening assessments up&#xD;
      to 4-8weeks prior administration of BBM-H901. All subjects will undergo 52(+- 2) weeks safety&#xD;
      observation and will be encouraged to enroll in an extension study to evaluate long- term&#xD;
      safety of BBM-H901 for a total 5 years.The first subject will be dosed at 5x1012 vg/Kg and&#xD;
      undergo 2 months safety observation of which the data will undergo review by an independent&#xD;
      safety committee. The dosing to the second subject will not be performed until acquiring the&#xD;
      approve from independent safety committee.&#xD;

             &gt;2% due to insufficient washout from FIX protein product, then the severity of&#xD;
             hemophilia B may be confirmed by documented historical evidence from a certified&#xD;
             clinical laboratory demonstrating ≤2% FIX coagulant activity (FIX:C) ;&#xD;
