  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the VATS procedure, some pulmonary nodules are relatively small or far away from the&#xD;
      pleura, resulting that they are difficult to be accurately located during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of using disposable pulmonary&#xD;
      surgical markers to localize pulmonary nodules in subjects prior to the resection of&#xD;
      pulmonary nodules by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS).&#xD;

      It is a prospective, multicenter, single group target value clinical trial. The subjects will&#xD;
      undergo VATS within 24h after the placement of the Marker, then the Marker and targeted&#xD;
      nodule will be removed during VATS. Subjects will be followed up intraoperatively,&#xD;
      immediately after placement procedure to the end of VATS resection, 7 days after placement&#xD;
      procedure/before discharge (whichever occurs earlier), and 30 days after Marker placement&#xD;
      procedure. Demographic and baseline information of subjects, immediate operation success rate&#xD;
      of marker placement, positioning success rate, and adverse events will be collected and&#xD;
      recorded in this study.&#xD;
