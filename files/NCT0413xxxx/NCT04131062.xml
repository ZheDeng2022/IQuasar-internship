      The goal of this trial is to determine whether the Sage eConsent framework (presented using&#xD;
      an electronic application) is non-inferior to traditional, paper-based, human-mediated&#xD;
      consent-and therefore could be part of an acceptable population screening approach to&#xD;
      identifying patients and others with actionable hereditary syndromes-and to increase basic&#xD;
      knowledge about patients' informational needs about different aspects of genetic/omic&#xD;
      screening. After receiving either 1) the traditional consenting approach, or 2) a consenting&#xD;
      approach presented on an electronic tablet, the investigators will test for differences&#xD;
      between these two arms in a variety of outcome measures including objective and perceived&#xD;
      comprehension, time spent and informational needs, and enrollment decision, among others.&#xD;

      The usual consent process for MyCode proceeds as follows: each day, trained MyCode consenters&#xD;
      receive a list of patients who are eligible to be approached about MyCode and are scheduled&#xD;
      to be seen that day in certain clinics in Geisinger's two-state catchment area. (Any&#xD;
      Geisinger patient is eligible who has not previously enrolled in, or declined to enroll in,&#xD;
      MyCode.) When an eligible patient arrives at the clinic, the consenter approaches them,&#xD;
      confirms their identity, and then asks them if they would like to hear about MyCode. If they&#xD;
      decline, the consenter thanks the patient for their time and the encounter is over. If the&#xD;
      patient agrees, the consenter goes through a script that the MyCode team has developed from&#xD;
      the written consent form that highlights the most important aspects of MyCode, including&#xD;
      return of actionable results to participants and their primary care physicians, genetic&#xD;
      privacy, and data sharing for research purposes. At the end of the script, the consenter&#xD;
      invites and answers questions from the patient. Next, the consenter hands the patient the&#xD;
      7-page written consent form and asks if they would like a few minutes to review it. Finally,&#xD;
      the consenter asks the patient whether they wish to enroll in MyCode or not and records their&#xD;
      answer-Yes, No, or Thinking (i.e., the patient needs more time to consider)-into the&#xD;
      patient's electronic health record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present trial, patients are randomized at the individual level to receive either this&#xD;
      usual consent or eConsent via iPad app. During the pilot phase of this trial, 11 Research&#xD;
      Assistants (RAs) were trained on both MyCode consenting and on this trial's protocol. As per&#xD;
      usual care, the RAs receive a daily list of MyCode-eligible patients scheduled to appear in&#xD;
      clinic. And, as per usual care, the RAs approach the patient, confirm their identity, and ask&#xD;
      if they wish to learn about MyCode. Those who do are then randomized to the usual care&#xD;
      (paper) or eConsent (iPad) arm of the trial, according to whether the current time, as&#xD;
      indicated by digital stopwatches, ends in an even or odd number. In the paper arm, the&#xD;
      consent process proceeds as usual, with only two minor changes: 1) the RA uses the stopwatch&#xD;
      to time the duration of the consent encounter (beginning from the moment they are randomized&#xD;
      to the paper arm and ending when either the consent process is interrupted-e.g., because the&#xD;
      patient is called back to the examination room-or when the consent process terminates with an&#xD;
      enrollment decision (Yes, No, or Thinking); and 2) the RA uses a tracking sheet to record&#xD;
      MyCode response rate (i.e., patients approached who did not want to hear about MyCode) and&#xD;
      study attrition (e.g., consent process was interrupted). In the iPad arm, the RA hands the&#xD;
      patient the iPad and explains that the interactive app will tell them all about MyCode.&#xD;
      Patients reluctant to use an iPad are encouraged once to try, with the RA showing them that&#xD;
      all that is involved is tapping, but patients who continue to resist are switched to the&#xD;
      paper arm and this is noted on the tracking sheet. In the iPad arm, the RA also records&#xD;
      whether the patient asks the RA any questions about MyCode and, as with the paper arm, when a&#xD;
      patient declines to hear about MyCode and when the consent process is interrupted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, patients are then asked to complete a survey, which serves as the primary&#xD;
      source of data for the study. The survey is administered on paper in the paper arm and on&#xD;
      iPad (via the Qualtrics platform) in the iPad arm. The eConsent app generates a random study&#xD;
      ID number that is sent to Qualtrics, where the user's click behavior during the consent&#xD;
      process (e.g., time spent on each screen and in total, whether the user clicked &quot;learn more&quot;&#xD;
      on each page, (in)correct answers to teach-back questions) is anonymously combined with their&#xD;
      survey responses. Survey questions are closed-end (true/false, multiple choice, Likert scale)&#xD;
      and based on the Quality of Informed Consent and All of Us participant-provided information&#xD;
      surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to be powered at 99% to detect an effect of modest size (half a point&#xD;
      on the comprehension quiz), requiring 526 participants. Very high levels of power (here, 95%&#xD;
      or 99%)-as opposed to the more standard benchmark power level of 80%-are desirable in tests&#xD;
      of non-inferiority so that investigators can be as certain as possible that an inference of&#xD;
      &quot;no effect&quot; is not a Type II error. In the very unlikely event that data collection proceeds&#xD;
      much more slowly than it has in the pilot, the study retains 95% power to detect a one-half&#xD;
      question effect with only 372 participants.&#xD;
