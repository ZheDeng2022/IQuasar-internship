  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether massage can attenuate the loss of muscle&#xD;
      mass in humans after a short period of disuse.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The loss of skeletal muscle mass is a common symptom associated with diseases such as cancer,&#xD;
      AIDS, diabetes, and congestive heart failure, and with aging. Muscle atrophy is associated&#xD;
      with poor disease prognosis and decreased quality of life and therefore, maintaining muscle&#xD;
      size and reducing the loss of muscle during disuse atrophy is of vital significance.&#xD;
      Mechanical stimulation of muscle, such as during resistance exercise, stimulates protein&#xD;
      synthesis that increases muscle protein content, and muscle size. The investigators have&#xD;
      shown that mechanical stimulation applied to skeletal muscle in the form of massage is an&#xD;
      effective mechanotherapy in rats, since it leads to a shift in protein turnover favoring&#xD;
      anabolism, attenuation of muscle loss and enhanced regrowth after disuse-induced atrophy.&#xD;
      Whether the same positive effect of massage occurs in humans is currently unknown, but would&#xD;
      be extremely beneficial for skeletal muscle and overall health in case where resistance&#xD;
      exercise is contraindicated or not feasible. In addition to the direct anabolic effects on&#xD;
      the massaged rat muscle, the investigators have shown an equally beneficial response on the&#xD;
      homologous muscle in the contralateral non-massaged limb. This novel finding indicated the&#xD;
      existence of indirect mechanisms that could have profound systemic effects beyond the&#xD;
      massaged muscle. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid membrane-bound vesicles released from&#xD;
      cells with the ability to modulate function of cells from which they are released, as well as&#xD;
      in cells with which they fuse. As such EVs are likely mediators of the well-documented but&#xD;
      poorly-understood effects of massage in humans on the brain and other organs, such as relief&#xD;
      of pain, anxiety or depression or changes in immunity. Therefore, the goal of this proposal&#xD;
      is to determine anabolic effects of massage in human muscle, and to identify whether EVs&#xD;
      released with massage are candidates for beneficial effects of this mechanotherapy on muscle&#xD;
      as well as other organs. In Aim 1 the investigators will address the following hypothesis:&#xD;
      Massage acts as a mechanotherapy by attenuating muscle atrophy through a shift in protein&#xD;
      biogenesis towards anabolism in humans. Using a novel massage device we will apply mechanical&#xD;
      load to muscle undergoing atrophy through unilateral lower limb suspension and muscle size as&#xD;
      well as protein synthesis and degradation will be determined. In Aim 2 the investigators will&#xD;
      test the hypothesis that massage attenuates the loss of EVs during atrophy by enhancing EV&#xD;
      biogenesis in muscle. The investigators will measure EVs and their miRNA cargo in the serum,&#xD;
      and markers of EV biogenesis in muscle of human subjects from Aim 1. Results from this study&#xD;
      will indicate not only whether mechanotherapy, such as massage, can attenuate atrophy and&#xD;
      enhance anabolic processes during disuse, but also determine whether EVs are a candidate&#xD;
      mechanism for the overall health benefits of massage.&#xD;
