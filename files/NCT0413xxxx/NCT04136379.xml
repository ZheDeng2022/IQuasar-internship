    <textblock>
      Summary: Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most prevalent form of birth defect with a&#xD;
      global rate of 1.35 million newborns born with CHD annually. Patients with CHD have an&#xD;
      increased risk of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) compared to age-matched control populations.&#xD;
      Anticoagulation with warfarin is the mainstay of antithrombotic treatment in these patients&#xD;
      and requires frequent monitoring of the International Normalized Ratio (INR). The CoaguChek&#xD;
      monitor is a point of care device that enables patients to self-monitor and manage their INR&#xD;
      without the need to attend a warfarin clinic. The aim of this study is to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy and outcomes of standard clinic management and home management of INR in patients&#xD;
      with CHD. Analysis of time in therapeutic range (TTR), INR variability, major and minor&#xD;
      bleeding events, incidence of CVA and other thrombotic events will be undertaken. Original&#xD;
      Hypothesis: There will be a difference in the proportion of time that patients spend in their&#xD;
      therapeutic range and the amount of adverse events that occur between those who use a&#xD;
      CoaguChek monitor and those who use standard clinic monitoring of their INR. The primary&#xD;
      outcome will be time in therapeutic range (TTR). Secondary outcomes will be INR variability,&#xD;
      minor / major bleeding complications and thromboembolic events.&#xD;

      Aims and Objectives: The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and outcomes of&#xD;
      standard clinic management and home management of INR in patients over 14 years of age with&#xD;
      CHD and to determine which method of INR management results in a greater time in therapeutic&#xD;
      range, less INR variability and fewer adverse events. This study will have a number of&#xD;
      objectives as detailed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether patients who home monitor their INR or those who use standard&#xD;
           clinic management spend more time in therapeutic range with less INR variability and&#xD;
           have fewer adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To survey patient views on the ease of use, practicality and their satisfaction with&#xD;
           their current method of INR management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine patients overall health related quality of life (HRQoL) using RAND SF-36&#xD;
           survey for participants who are 18+ years and the PedsQL quality of life inventory for&#xD;
           participants who are 14-17 years of age, and determine whether there is a difference in&#xD;
           HRQoL between the two cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To undertake structured interviews with the participants' General Practitioners (GPs) to&#xD;
           examine their views / beliefs about INR home monitoring; and to undertake&#xD;
           semi-structured interviews with the ACHD clinical nurse specialists and the clinical&#xD;
           research nurse (who is responsible for training patients in the use of home monitoring)&#xD;
           to examine their views about INR home monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental details and design of proposed investigation: This research will be a 1-year&#xD;
      prospective cohort study monitoring CHD patients who are on warfarin. Recruitment of patients&#xD;
      will be from the ACHD clinics in the Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH), Belfast. There are&#xD;
      approximately 4,000 patients with CHD who attend these clinics from the age of 14 years&#xD;
      onwards, with a proportion of these patients on warfarin therapy. Patients on warfarin will&#xD;
      be identified by Jan Gordon (ACHD clinical nurse specialist) or Deirdre Lovell (clinical&#xD;
      research nurse). Suitable patients who attend one of the ACHD clinics during the 6 month&#xD;
      recruitment period will be sent a participant information leaflet at the same time as they&#xD;
      are sent their clinic appointment letter (which is sent out two weeks prior to their&#xD;
      appointment). Eligible participants can also be recruited from other clinics in RVH. The&#xD;
      participant information sheet will inform them about the study and contain contact&#xD;
      information for the PhD student, Rachel Savage, who can provide more information and explain&#xD;
      the study further. Interested patients will have two weeks to consider their participation&#xD;
      prior to their clinic appointment. The PhD student will attend the ACHD clinics up to three&#xD;
      times per week for six months to explain the study and recruit patients. Dr Lockhart (Adult&#xD;
      CHD Consultant) and Jan Gordon will support this recruitment process. Patients who agree to&#xD;
      participate in the study will be screened for inclusion / exclusion criteria as detailed&#xD;
      below, and if eligible be asked to provide informed consent. Inpatients who meet the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be identified by a clinical member of the research team, and&#xD;
      provided with the participant information sheet. Those who are interested in participating in&#xD;
      the study will notify one of the clinical member of the research team, in which case the PhD&#xD;
      student will be informed, and will attend the RVH to gain informed consent allowing at least&#xD;
      one week to consider their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently a home monitoring programme at the RVH which is run by a nurse specialist&#xD;
      who trains patients how to use their CoaguChek monitor and how to self manage their warfarin&#xD;
      dose, following the RVH protocols regarding frequency of testing and dose adjustment. After a&#xD;
      4 month training period, long term follow up of these patients is undertaken by their GP.&#xD;
      There is a proportion of ACHD patients who currently home monitor using the RVH protocols. In&#xD;
      the event of any issues with home monitoring, patients can contact their GP or one of the&#xD;
      ACHD clinical nurse specialists for advice. The patients who currently home monitor will have&#xD;
      chosen to home monitor and will either have purchased the CoaguChek monitor themselves, or&#xD;
      will have received a monitor which has been funded by Children's Heartbeat Trust, who provide&#xD;
      funding for 15 new monitors for ACHD patients per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection: Patients in both cohorts will be asked to submit an electronic INR record,&#xD;
      which includes their INR level, warfarin dose, acute illnesses, changes in medications and&#xD;
      any warfarin-related adverse events e.g. minor / major bleeding and thromboembolic events, as&#xD;
      per normal practice. Acute illnesses and changes in medications are potential covariates and&#xD;
      will be included in covariate analysis. Additionally alcohol intake is a potential covariate,&#xD;
      which will be recorded at recruitment. An email and/or text message will be sent to all&#xD;
      participants at the end of each month to remind them to submit their INR record&#xD;
      electronically to Rachel Savage. Participants in the home monitoring cohort will be invited&#xD;
      to attend the RVH at 6 months and at the end of the 12 months to have their INR data&#xD;
      downloaded from their CoaguChek monitor. Data for the standard clinic monitoring cohort will&#xD;
      also be obtained at 6 months and again at 12 months, from the participants' electronic health&#xD;
      record (ECR), by either the clinical research nurse or one of the ACHD clinical nurse&#xD;
      specialists within the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust. In cases of suspected CVA, the&#xD;
      CT/MRI will be reviewed by a Consultant Radiologist as per normal clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the twelve month follow up period all participants will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      patient satisfaction questionnaire, which will evaluate the ease of use, practicality and&#xD;
      their satisfaction with the method of INR management they use. Questions will include, but&#xD;
      are not limited to the following: indication for warfarin therapy, INR target range, duration&#xD;
      of warfarin therapy, history of blood clots/stroke/TIA, history of INR levels &lt;1.5 or &gt;8 and&#xD;
      how often their INR is checked. A link to the patient questionnaire will be sent&#xD;
      electronically to all participants at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are 18+ years will be asked to complete a health related quality of life&#xD;
      (HRQoL) survey RAND SF-36, to determine whether home management of INR affects quality of&#xD;
      life. A link to the HRQoL survey will be sent electronically to all participants who are 18+&#xD;
      years at the end of the 12 month follow up period. For participants who are 14-17 years, the&#xD;
      PedsQL inventory will be used, which is a validated, disease-specific questionnaire for use&#xD;
      by paediatric patients. At the end of the twelve month follow up period, an electronic link&#xD;
      to the PedsQL inventory will be sent to participants who are 14-17 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant's General Practitioner (GP) will be invited to take part in structured&#xD;
      interviews to examine their views / beliefs regarding INR home monitoring. If there is a GP&#xD;
      in the practice who specializes in warfarin monitoring, this GP will also be invited to take&#xD;
      part in structured interviews. The aim of the interviews is to determine GP's views on INR&#xD;
      monitoring and to examine whether GP preferences influence the method of INR monitoring that&#xD;
      patients choose. The participant information sheet and consent form will be sent to each GP&#xD;
      along with the letter informing them that their patient is participating in the cohort study.&#xD;
      If a GP consents to participate in a structured interview, the PhD student will arrange a&#xD;
      suitable time and/or venue to conduct the interviews either face to face or via telephone.&#xD;
      All interviews will be audio recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ACHD clinical nurse specialists and the clinical research nurse responsible for training&#xD;
      patients how to home monitor will be invited to participate in semi-structured interviews,&#xD;
      which will take place face to face. The aim of these interviews is to determine the views and&#xD;
      preferences of clinical nurses on INR monitoring and to examine whether these preferences&#xD;
      influence the method of INR monitoring that patients choose. A participant information sheet&#xD;
      will be given to the nurses during the 6 month recruitment period of the ACHD participants.&#xD;
      All interviews will be audio recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: Patient reported INR results will be cross-referenced with INR results&#xD;
      downloaded from the CoaguChek monitor (home monitoring cohort) or the participants'&#xD;
      electronic health record (clinic monitoring cohort), and data will be input into SPSS for&#xD;
      analysis. To determine if there are differences in patient characteristics between cohorts,&#xD;
      categories such as gender, age, indication for warfarin therapy as well as levels of&#xD;
      education, work and income will be compared. Normality will be tested using the Shapiro-Wilk&#xD;
      test. Categorical variables such as number of adverse events will be displayed as&#xD;
      frequency/percentages and statistical significance will be determined using chi-square.&#xD;
      Continuous variables such as time in therapeutic range will be displayed as mean ± SD and&#xD;
      statistical significance will be determined using t-test. Covariates such as alcohol intake,&#xD;
      acute illnesses and changes in medications will be analyzed using ANCOVA.&#xD;
