  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COPD is a common complex disease with debilitating breathlessness; mortality and reduced&#xD;
      quality of life, accelerated by frequent lung attacks (exacerbations). Changes in&#xD;
      breathlessness, cough and/or sputum production often change before exacerbations but patients&#xD;
      cannot judge the importance of such changes so they remain unreported and untreated. Remote&#xD;
      monitoring systems have been developed but none have yet convincingly shown the ability to&#xD;
      identify these early changes of an exacerbation and how severe they can be.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study asks if a smart digital health intervention (COPDPredict™) can be used by both&#xD;
      COPD patients and clinicians to improve self-management, predict lung attacks early,&#xD;
      intervene promptly, and avoid hospitalisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COPDPredict™ consists of a patient-facing App and clinician-facing smart early warning&#xD;
      decision support system. It collects and processes information to determine a patient's&#xD;
      health through a combination of wellbeing scores, lung function and biomarker measurements.&#xD;
      This information is combined to generate personalised lung health profiles. As each patient&#xD;
      is monitored over time, the system detects changes from an individual's 'usual health' and&#xD;
      indicates the likelihood of imminent exacerbation of COPD. When this happens, alerts are sent&#xD;
      to both the individual and the clinician, with instructions to the patient on what actions to&#xD;
      take. Any advice from clinicians can be exchanged via the App's secure messaging facility. If&#xD;
      patients have followed the action plan but fail to improve or if an episode triggers an 'at&#xD;
      high risk alert', clinicians are further prompted to case manage and intervene with escalated&#xD;
      treatment, including home visits, if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COPDPredict™ intervention aims to assist patients and clinicians in preventing clinical&#xD;
      deterioration from COPD exacerbations with prompt appropriate intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will randomise 384 patients who have frequent exacerbations, from hospitals in the&#xD;
      West Midlands, to either (1) standard self-management plan (SSMP) with rescue medication&#xD;
      (RM), or (2) COPDPredict™ and RM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Changes in dyspnoea, coughing and/or sputum production often precede exacerbations but as&#xD;
      symptoms vary within-same day and across days, patients cannot easily judge the significance&#xD;
      of such changes with the result that exacerbations remain unreported and untreated.&#xD;
      Furthermore due to heterogeneity amongst COPD patients, predictions must be personalised to&#xD;
      be clinically meaningful. Remote monitoring and POC systems have evolved rapidly but none&#xD;
      have yet convincingly demonstrated the capability to predict exacerbations and stratify&#xD;
      episode severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the above problem, COPDPredictTM has been created and developed. This System&#xD;
      automatically processes information that is regularly sent by patients using COPDPredictTM),&#xD;
      which connects to peripheral monitors via Bluetooth and uses intelligent software to&#xD;
      determine a patient's health through a combination of wellbeing scores, lung function and&#xD;
      measurements of key biomarkers in blood and saliva. The clinical team has access to a secure&#xD;
      web portal (dashboard) which allows them to monitor patient data, case manage and make&#xD;
      informed decisions on clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the degree of change from a given patient's 'usual health', timely alerts are&#xD;
      sent to the individual, with sign-posting to an action plan. Alerts are also sent to&#xD;
      clinicians who support and advise patients via App's secure messaging facility. If patients&#xD;
      fail to improve with self-treat plan or if an episode triggers an 'at high risk alert' from&#xD;
      the start, clinicians are prompted to be involved and intervene with escalated treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Clinician facing dashboard allows for &quot;real-time&quot; case management and the ability to&#xD;
      remotely monitor the patients and facilitate interaction. Clinicians can choose to escalate&#xD;
      treatments based on the results being transmitted by the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical investigation asks if COPDPredictTM can be used by patients with COPD at home&#xD;
      and the clinicians managing the patients to improve self-management and help them identify&#xD;
      exacerbations, intervene promptly and avoid hospitalisation. The clinical investigation will&#xD;
      randomise 384 patients, from 4 hospitals in the West Midlands. United Kingdom, who have&#xD;
      frequent AECOPD to use either the SSMP and RM (if needed according to the SSMP) or the&#xD;
      COPDPredict App and RM (if needed according to the App self-management plan or clinician&#xD;
      input).&#xD;
