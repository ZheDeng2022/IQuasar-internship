  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study to understand the safety and tolerability of AXA4010, a novel&#xD;
      composition of amino acids in adult and adolescent subjects with sickle cell disease over 12&#xD;
      weeks. The study also assesses the effects of this amino acid composition on the structure&#xD;
      and function of the vascular system. Physiological effects on structure and function will be&#xD;
      assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to assess blood flow in the brain and kidneys&#xD;
      and the 6-Minute walk with pulse oximetry. Changes in blood biomarkers of inflammation will&#xD;
      also be assessed.&#xD;

    <description>The study will initiate with approximately eight (8) adult subjects (≥18 y/o) with SCD (Cohort 1). Each subject will receive AXA4010 twice a day (BID) for 12 weeks. Safety and tolerability will be monitored, and study procedures will be performed. Analysis of safety, tolerability and laboratory assessments at week 12 would be performed. Based on the 12-week observations from at least three subjects in Cohort 1, subsequent Cohorts 2 and 3 in Part II may be initiated.</description>
