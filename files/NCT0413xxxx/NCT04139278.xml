    <textblock>
      In the context of reduced resources and rising demand for unplanned care, the delivery of&#xD;
      appropriate services to support people with frailty will be key to providing cost-effective,&#xD;
      quality care for older people. There is recognition of an evidence gap in relation to the&#xD;
      planning, commissioning and delivery of services for older people living with frailty.&#xD;
      Questions remain about the incidence and prevalence different levels of frailty and the&#xD;
      consequences for health outcomes, health and care service use and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will explore the incidence and prevalence, development and&#xD;
      impact of frailty within the population using retrospective primary care data on patients&#xD;
      aged 50 and over in 2006 within the database. The investigators will stratify the cohort by&#xD;
      severity of frailty and explore frailty status over time, determining incidence, prevalence&#xD;
      and progression of frailty. The relationships between factors such as age, deprivation,&#xD;
      ethnicity, location and comorbidities of individuals in relation to development of, and&#xD;
      deterioration in, frailty status will be examined. The influence of frailty on outcomes,&#xD;
      service use and costs will be explored. These analyses will be used to inform the development&#xD;
      of a prototype simulation model, which will use a System Dynamics (SD) based approach to&#xD;
      explore the development and impact of frailty in the population and likely future scenarios&#xD;
      over a 10-year timeframe. Finally, 'what if' scenarios developed with the stakeholder&#xD;
      engagement group will be explored via simulation modelling.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The impact of frailty on demand for and outcomes of care has emerged as a significant issue&#xD;
      for the National Health Service (NHS) in recent years. The association between frailty and&#xD;
      adverse outcomes such as unplanned admission, transfer to residential care and high service&#xD;
      use is well recognised (BGS 2014/15; NIHR 2017; Clegg et al. 2013). As the population ages,&#xD;
      prevalence of frailty and associated demand for health care rise. In the context of reduced&#xD;
      resources and rising demand for unplanned care, the delivery of appropriate services to&#xD;
      support people with frailty will be key to providing cost-effective, quality care for older&#xD;
      people. Recent consensus guidelines have emphasised the importance of identification and&#xD;
      clinical management of frailty (BGS 2014; NICE 2016) and effective interventions are&#xD;
      available, but capacity and resources for delivery are limited. There is recognition of an&#xD;
      evidence gap in relation to the planning, commissioning and delivery of services for older&#xD;
      people living with frailty (NIHR 2017). Questions remain about the incidence and prevalence&#xD;
      different levels of frailty and the consequences for health outcomes, health and care service&#xD;
      use and costs. Addressing these issues requires exploration of population trends in the&#xD;
      development and impact of frailty, but this research has previously been limited because of&#xD;
      the need for clinical assessment for the identification of frailty. The recent introduction&#xD;
      of the electronic Frailty Index (eFI) (Clegg et al. 2016) allows routine primary care data to&#xD;
      be used to identify the presence and severity of frailty in real-world populations. The eFI&#xD;
      therefore facilitates the exploration of the dynamics of frailty and its impact at a&#xD;
      population level. It enables stratification of the primary care population into robust, mild,&#xD;
      moderate and severe frailty groups, so enabling comparison of trajectories of decline and&#xD;
      pathways of care between these groups, which will be key to service development and&#xD;
      commissioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will explore the incidence and prevalence, development and&#xD;
      impact of frailty within the population using retrospective data from the Royal College of&#xD;
      General Practitioners Research Surveillance Centre (RCGP RSC) database, which holds data for&#xD;
      1.8m patients from 230 practices. The eFI tool will be utilised to stratify a cohort of&#xD;
      people aged 60 and over within the database between 2004-8 into robust, mild, moderate and&#xD;
      severe frailty groups. Data will be extracted on frailty status, health care use, and&#xD;
      outcomes for the subsequent 10 years, calculating key service use costs from these data.&#xD;
      Outcomes will include mortality, unplanned hospital admission, Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E)&#xD;
      attendance and General Practitioner (GP) appointments. The RCGP RSC dataset will also provide&#xD;
      data on socio-economic factors, practice size and location and residence. The cohort will be&#xD;
      stratified by severity of frailty, and frailty status explored over time, determining&#xD;
      incidence, prevalence and progression of frailty. The investigators will examine the&#xD;
      relationships between factors such as age, deprivation, ethnicity, location and comorbidities&#xD;
      of individuals in relation to development of, and deterioration in, frailty status. The&#xD;
      influence of frailty on outcomes, service use and costs will be explored. Results from these&#xD;
      analyses will be used to inform development of guidelines for service commissioners,&#xD;
      developed in partnership with experts in service delivery, commissioning and Public Patient&#xD;
      Involvement (PPI) representatives through stakeholder engagement. These analyses will inform&#xD;
      the development of a prototype simulation model, which will use a System Dynamics (SD) based&#xD;
      approach to explore the development and impact of frailty in the population and likely future&#xD;
      scenarios over a 10-year timeframe. The simulation model population projections will be&#xD;
      externally validated against retrospective data from the Leeds Data Model (LDM) dataset,&#xD;
      which holds data for 810,000 primary care patients from 108 practices in the Leeds area.&#xD;
      Residence data from RCGP RSC will be supplemented by data on residential care transitions and&#xD;
      social care use by frailty status from the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL)&#xD;
      Databank, which holds primary and social care data on up to 30,000 individuals in Wales, to&#xD;
      inform simulation of impacts and costs beyond the health care setting. Finally, 'what if'&#xD;
      scenarios developed with the stakeholder engagement group (SEG) will be explored via&#xD;
      simulation modelling.&#xD;
