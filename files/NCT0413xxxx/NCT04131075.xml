    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort blinded study with the aim to investigate the prevalence and&#xD;
      clinical impact of coronary microcirculatory dysfunction (CMD) in patients with ischemic&#xD;
      heart disease, and its association with cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) and depressive&#xD;
      disorders. In addition, CMD and CSVD linkage to systemic inflammation and endothelial&#xD;
      function will also be investigated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of stable CAD is largely based on a paradigm that gives epicardial coronary&#xD;
      stenoses a central role in the generation of myocardial ischaemia. However, coronary&#xD;
      microcirculatory dysfunction (CMD) is a major and frequently ignored cause of ischaemia that,&#xD;
      according to retrospective studies, influences the outcomes of patients with CAD. In&#xD;
      addition, patients with CMD may not experience symptomatic relief with myocardial&#xD;
      revascularization or pharmacological treatment. This constitutes one of the causes of&#xD;
      persistent angina despite successful revascularization, causing not only an impairment of the&#xD;
      quality of life and higher consumption of healthcare resources, but potentially affective&#xD;
      disorders like depression, which has been found to be associated with CAD and with prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It also remains largely unknown whether CMD in stable CAD is organ-specific only or rather&#xD;
      indicative of involvement of other vital organs. While this seems to be the case in the&#xD;
      kidney and the retina, the relationship between CMD in the heart and the brain has not been&#xD;
      studied. Beyond classical cardiovascular risk factors linked to the development of ischemic&#xD;
      heart disease, systemic endothelial dysfunction could constitute a link between&#xD;
      microcirculatory involvement in both organs: the heart and the brain. Additionally, the&#xD;
      relation between chronic inflammatory status and microvascular disease in both the heart and&#xD;
      the brain is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal hypotheses and sub-hypotheses are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal hypotheses: 1. Patients with CMD have worse prognosis compared to those ones with&#xD;
      normal coronary microcirculation. 2. Patients with CMD have a higher prevalence of CSVD. 3.&#xD;
      Chronic systemic inflammation status is an independent predictor of CMD and CSVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-hypotheses: 1. The presence of CMD is associated to recurrent/persistent angina. 2. The&#xD;
      presence of CMD is associated to higher prevalence of depressive disorders. 3. CMD and CSVD&#xD;
      are associated to systemic endothelial dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives associated to Principal hypotheses: 1. To investigate the relationship&#xD;
      between the presence of CMD and the development of patient-focused outcomes at 1 year of&#xD;
      follow-up. 2. To determine the prevalence of CSVD in patients with CAD with and without CMD.&#xD;
      3. To investigate the relationship between systemic inflammation and CMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives associated to Sub-hypotheses: 1. To determine the prevalence of persistent&#xD;
      or recurrent angina in patients with and without CMD in whom revascularization of CAD is&#xD;
      guided by FFR. 2. To determine the prevalence of depressive disorders in patients with and&#xD;
      without CMD. 3. To investigate the relationship between the status of systemic endothelial&#xD;
      function and the presence of CMD and CSVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Patients with CAD undergoing FFR-guided revascularisation will be prospectively&#xD;
      enrolled. FFR, coronary flow reserve (CFR) and the index of hyperemic microvascular&#xD;
      resistance (HMR) will be measured with the Doppler guidewire (Combowire, Volcano - Philips&#xD;
      corporation) under steady state hyperemia (intravenous adenosine infusion, 140 mcg/Kg/min).&#xD;
      CMD will be defined according to CFR and HMR, and will be used to classify the overall&#xD;
      population in two groups: the study group (presence of CMD) and the control group (absence of&#xD;
      CMD). Coronary revascularization will be decided according to result of FFR (cutoff ≤0.80).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the procedure the patient will undergo baseline clinical assessment: • Neurological&#xD;
      clinical assessment and Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound. • Psychiatric clinical assessment. •&#xD;
      Stress Cardiac MRI and Cerebral MRI. • Peripheral endothelial function test with&#xD;
      plethysmography-based device EndoPat. • Laboratory blood tests for systemic inflammation&#xD;
      markers, platelet function and endothelial progenitor cells. • Baseline assessment of angina&#xD;
      status by the Seattle Questionnaire of angina (SAQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical follow-up will be performed at 1-month, 6-months and 1-year, and will include: •&#xD;
      clinical cardiology and psychiatric assessment, assessment of angina status by the SAQ. •&#xD;
      stress test (1-year). • peripheral endothelial function test with plethysmography-based&#xD;
      device EndoPat (1-year). • neurological clinical assessment and Transcranial Doppler&#xD;
      Ultrasound (1- year). • laboratory blood tests for systemic inflammation markers, platelets&#xD;
      function and endothelial progenitor cells(1-year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of blinding: Data regarding coronary microcirculation invasive assessment, neurologic&#xD;
      and psychiatric clinical assessment, cardiac and cerebral MRI, Trans-cranial Doppler&#xD;
      Ultrasound, laboratory blood tests, systemic endothelial function and follow-up will be&#xD;
      collected in a blinded fashion, so that patient and the other investigators, apart from the&#xD;
      invasive cardiology team responsible for patient enrollment and study coordination, could not&#xD;
      access to them. Primary events rate (major adverse cardiovascular events, incidence of CSVD,&#xD;
      systemic inflammation status, depressive disorders, recurrent angina and systemic endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction) will be analyzed and correlated to CMD in a blinded fashion.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Systemic endothelial dysfunction is defined as the inability of the arterial system to dilate appropriately in response to hyperaemia stimulus in order to increase blood flow according to metabolic demands. In this study, we will use the EndoPat technology that allows non-invasive evaluation of vasoreactivity by the assessment of the pulsatile arterial flow in the fingertip. We will assess changes in the flow from baseline and after inducing ischaemia by inflating a blood pressure cuff to occlude the brachial artery. Changes in endothelial measurements and in vascular tone after each occlusion of the brachial artery are a reflection of the hyperaemic vasoreactivity and endothelial function. By comparing the results during rest and ischaemia to the results obtained in the contralateral arm (which has not been subjected to ischaemia) we will obtain the index of reactive hyperaemia or EndoScore´. This Endoscore can then be used to evaluate endothelial function.</description>
