  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the development of neoadjuvant therapy for tumors, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has&#xD;
      become one of the most common and effective methods for preoperative systemic treatment of&#xD;
      locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). Although epirubicin combined with cyclophosphamide and&#xD;
      sequential docetaxel has been widely recognized as the first-line NAC for LABC, there are&#xD;
      still some inoperable LABCs that are insensitive to chemotherapy and miss the opportunity of&#xD;
      surgery, especially those with luminal A and low expression of Ki67. Therefore, neoadjuvant&#xD;
      endocrine therapy has important clinical value for such patients. At present, the combination&#xD;
      of aromatase inhibitor drugs and cyclin dependent kinase 4/6 can significantly improve the&#xD;
      prognosis and survival of LABC compared with aromatase inhibitor monotherapy. However,&#xD;
      whether inoperable LABC patients, especially those who are not susceptible to chemotherapy,&#xD;
      can choose the combination of aromatase inhibitor drugs and cyclin dependent kinase 4/6 as&#xD;
      neoadjuvant endocrine therapy to replace NAC remains unclear. Because the main principle of&#xD;
      endocrine therapy is to induce tumor cell cycle arrest, leading to apoptosis of tumor cells,&#xD;
      the effect is slower than that of chemotherapy. In addition, whether endocrine therapy can&#xD;
      replace chemotherapy as a new adjuvant treatment for patients with inoperable LABC to improve&#xD;
      the operability rate has not yet been fully evidenced. Therefore, this trial aims to conduct&#xD;
      the prospective randomized controlled phase IV clinical trial of palbociclib combined with&#xD;
      letrozole versus epirubicin combined with cyclophosphamide and sequential docetaxel as NAC to&#xD;
      prove the efficacy of palbociclib combined with letrozole in postmenopausal estrogen&#xD;
      receptor-positive LABC patients with low Ki67 expression.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      reast cancer is one of the most prevalent malignant tumors in women, accounting for 23% of&#xD;
      all malignant tumors. Approximately 1.3 million people are diagnosed with breast cancer every&#xD;
      year in the world, and approximately 400,000 people die of breast cancer. The overall median&#xD;
      survival time of patients with advanced breast cancer is only 2-3 years, and the 5-year&#xD;
      survival rate is only about 20%. At present, a considerable number of patients are diagnosed&#xD;
      as LABC at the time of initial diagnosis. Because of the wide range of lesions or poor lymph&#xD;
      node status, surgical treatment is very difficult, and even some patients cannot be operated&#xD;
      on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the development of neoadjuvant therapy for tumors, NAC has become one of the most common&#xD;
      and effective methods for preoperative systemic treatment of LABC. The 2018 V2 version of the&#xD;
      National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for breast cancer diagnosis clearly states&#xD;
      that preoperative chemotherapy for LABC should be based on an anthracyclines and can be&#xD;
      combined with taxanes, but about 20% of LABC patients are not sensitive to this protocol.&#xD;
      Heller et al. performed NAC with 5-fluorouracil + epirubicin + cyclophosphamide for 6 weeks&#xD;
      in 88 patients with LABC, and the total effective rate was 78%. After 4 weeks of docetaxel&#xD;
      treatment in patients with poor response, approximately 10% of patients are still not&#xD;
      sensitive. In addition, many studies in and outside China have pointed out that the NAC&#xD;
      effect in some estrogen receptor-positive LABC patients, especially postmenopausal luminal A&#xD;
      patients, is worse than that of estrogen receptor negative or Ki67 overexpression patients.&#xD;
      Ring et al. treated 435 cases of breast cancer with NAC of doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide or&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/fluorouracil. Pathological complete remission rate was 8.1% in&#xD;
      estrogen receptor-positive patients and 21.6% in estrogen receptor negative patients. Similar&#xD;
      results were obtained in NSABP B-27 test, with the ratio of 8.3% and 16.7% respectively.&#xD;
      Simultaneously, Fashing et al. found that the pathological complete remission of patients&#xD;
      with relatively high Ki67 after NAC with anthracyclines combined with taxanes was higher than&#xD;
      that of patients with low Ki67. Many clinical studies in China have also obtained similar&#xD;
      results; that is, the low expression of Ki67 indicates that the effect of NAC in LABC is not&#xD;
      good.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the above situation, some scholars gradually introduce endocrine therapy into the&#xD;
      NAC of postmenopausal estrogen receptor-positive LABC, namely neoadjuvant endocrine therapy.&#xD;
      At present, neoadjuvant endocrine therapy is practical and feasible for breast cancer with&#xD;
      large tumors and positive hormone receptor. Simultaneously, the efficacy of the&#xD;
      third-generation aromatase inhibitors is better than that of tamoxifen. Z1031 clinical trial&#xD;
      of 381 patients with stage II or III postmenopausal estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer&#xD;
      in the United States preliminarily confirmed that the third-generation aromatase inhibitors&#xD;
      are currently the first choice of effective neoadjuvant endocrine therapy for postmenopausal&#xD;
      estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. However, 30% to 40% of breast cancer patients&#xD;
      receiving endocrine therapy still have disease progression due to drug resistance, which is&#xD;
      very disadvantageous for LABC patients. The emergence of cyclin dependent kinase 4/6&#xD;
      inhibitors has given hope to such patients. In the guidelines for advanced breast cancer,&#xD;
      Cardoso et al. suggested that a first-line treatment with aromatase inhibitors combined with&#xD;
      cyclin dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors should be preferred. In a phase II randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to explore the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive and epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor receptor-2-negative advanced breast cancer by combination of palbociclib, a cyclin&#xD;
      dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor, and letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, the results found that&#xD;
      the former could significantly prolong progression-free survival of hormone receptor-positive&#xD;
      advanced breast cancer. Therefore, in February 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      approved the combination of palbociclib and letrozole for first-line treatment of hormone&#xD;
      receptor-positive advanced breast cancer. However, for inoperable LABC patients, especially&#xD;
      those who are not sensitive to chemotherapy, whether the combination of palbociclib and&#xD;
      letrozole can be used as a neoadjuvant endocrine therapy instead of NAC is not clear.&#xD;
      Although there are relatively few controlled studies on neoadjuvant endocrine therapy and&#xD;
      NAC, the existing evidence suggests that the high level of Ki67 in hormone receptor-positive&#xD;
      cases indicates that the effect of chemotherapy is better than that of endocrine therapy, but&#xD;
      the adverse reaction rate of chemotherapy is high, especially for LABC or older and infirm&#xD;
      patients, while neoadjuvant endocrine therapy can achieve similar effect to NAC. Therefore,&#xD;
      the efficacy of palbociclib combined with letrozole as neoadjuvant endocrine therapy is still&#xD;
      worth looking forward to. Because the principle of endocrine therapy is mainly to induce&#xD;
      tumor cell cycle arrest, leading to apoptosis of cancer cells, so the effect is slower than&#xD;
      that of chemotherapy. In addition, whether the efficacy can replace chemotherapy as NAC in&#xD;
      inoperable LABC patients to improve the operability rate has not yet been fully evidenced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this trial aims to conduct the prospective randomized controlled phase IV clinical&#xD;
      trial using palbociclib combined with letrozole versus epirubicin combined with&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide and sequential docetaxel as NAC to prove the efficacy of palbociclib&#xD;
      combined with letrozole in postmenopausal estrogen receptor-positive LABC patients with low&#xD;
      Ki67 expression.&#xD;
