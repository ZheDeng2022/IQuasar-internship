  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Virtual reality has been shown to be an effective way to treat pain and anxiety in various&#xD;
      different settings. Palliative care is an area of medicine that often deals with patients&#xD;
      suffering from pain and anxiety. The medication used to manage these symptoms are often&#xD;
      opioids and benzodiazepines due to their rapid onset however they do have a significant side&#xD;
      effect burden on patients. Very few studies have looked at the effect of virtual reality in&#xD;
      this patient population. The goal of this study is to measure if virtual reality can decrease&#xD;
      the required amount of medication used in managing pain and anxiety in palliative care. The&#xD;
      secondary outcome will look at perceived benefit by patients&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Virtual reality has been available for many years and is starting to gain traction in&#xD;
      clinical setting in varied fields with multiple applications. Some of the primary clinical&#xD;
      settings that virtual reality has shown benefit are in pain attenuation and mental health,&#xD;
      particularly anxiety. Palliative Care is a field of medicine that most patients have both&#xD;
      pain and anxiety to a certain degree. The medications used to manage this (opioids,&#xD;
      benzodiazepines) are used but not without side effects to the patient as well as cost to the&#xD;
      medical system. So far, there are very few studies looking at the effect of virtual reality&#xD;
      on symptom burden in palliative care. The primary outcome of this study would be to look at&#xD;
      virtual reality's role in decreasing breakthrough opioids use for pain and benzodiazepine use&#xD;
      for anxiety by decreasing symptoms experienced by patients by providing them with an&#xD;
      immersive computer generated experience. The secondary outcome of this study will be&#xD;
      patient's perception of symptoms with the use of virtual reality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual reality has been shown to be effective in many areas of medicine, particularly in&#xD;
      pain management and mental health. Studies utilizing VR in pain management have commonly been&#xD;
      done with burn victims, as burns are thought to be among the most painful injuries people&#xD;
      sustain. Using a within subject design where the patient is his/her own control, these&#xD;
      studies have shown an observable benefit in decreasing pain as well as cutting down on the&#xD;
      opioid doses required to get analgesia in patients requiring wound debridement and&#xD;
      physiotherapy in both adults and children. The investigator's patient population in&#xD;
      palliative care is susceptible to painful metastases, pressure ulcers, and other causes of&#xD;
      pain, which are comparable to pain experienced by burn victims. Therefore, the results of&#xD;
      theses studies are relevant and may prove beneficial for patients receiving palliative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients will receive alternating days of standard palliative care and&#xD;
      standard palliative care with virtual reality as an option for symptom management for a total&#xD;
      of 4-10 days. Patients will be randomized to start with standard care with virtual reality or&#xD;
      start with standard care alone. The immersive virtual reality experience would be delivered&#xD;
      through an Oculus Quest. There will be 3 different software options that can be used based on&#xD;
      preference. Patients will be asked the degree of pain/anxiety prior to applying the virtual&#xD;
      reality headset and then the same scale immediately after indicating their pain/anxiety&#xD;
      during the experience. After the 4-10 days, breakthrough use of opioids and benzodiazepines&#xD;
      during days with standard care and virtual reality will be compared to breakthrough use with&#xD;
      standard care alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that the use of virtual reality will decrease the amount of medication&#xD;
      necessary to manage symptoms of pain and/or anxiety. It is also anticipated that this will&#xD;
      provide the patient with a pleasant respite from their symptoms.&#xD;
