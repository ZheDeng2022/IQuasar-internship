      This Phase 1, first-in-human, open-label, multicenter study follows a 3+3 ascending dose&#xD;
      escalation design to determine the MTD/RP2D and to characterize the safety, tolerability, PK,&#xD;
      and antitumor effects of LNS8801 alone and in combination with pembrolizumab. The study will&#xD;
      include a dose escalation phase, a dose expansion phase, and phase 2A cohorts. Up to 200&#xD;
      patients will be accrued for this study. Up to ten study sites in the United States will&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this Phase 1, first-in-human, open-label, multi-center study. Cohorts will enroll at least&#xD;
      3 patients in accordance with a traditional dose escalation 3+3 design, and the study will&#xD;
      determine the MTD/RP2D of LNS8801. With permission from the Safety Review Committee (SRC), 2&#xD;
      cohorts may be expanded to include 8 to 10 patients to further explore PK and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics. LNS8801 will be administered 3 days/week or once or twice a day during 21&#xD;
      day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments will be performed on all patients at screening, throughout their&#xD;
      participation in the study, and for 30 days (90 days in combination cohorts) following the&#xD;
      last dose of study drug. Throughout the study, imaging of tumors for evidence of tumor&#xD;
      response and/or progression will be performed; biopsies will be performed on accessible&#xD;
      lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the RP2D of LNS8801 is identified and the safety of dosing LNS8801 with pembrolizumab&#xD;
      has been established, expansion cohorts and Phase 2A cohorts will open. Any 2 dose escalation&#xD;
      cohorts may be expanded to 8 to 10 patients to include additional patients to further explore&#xD;
      PK and PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol also includes RP2D PD-1/L1 refractory expansion cohorts of advanced cancer&#xD;
      patients who have previously had a clinical benefit on anti-PD-1/L1 therapy alone or in&#xD;
      combination (complete response or partial response of any duration, or confirmed stable&#xD;
      disease for at least 16 weeks) but have since relapsed and not had an intervening cytotoxic&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Up to 28 patients may be studied in each cohort with LNS8801 therapy alone or&#xD;
      with a combination of LNS8801 and pembrolizumab. The monotherapy cohort will also study&#xD;
      patients that are no longer eligible for PD-1/L1 therapy due to serious immune related side&#xD;
      effects to prior therapy regardless of response to the prior therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also include the following 12 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT M1: 10 patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies having received ≤4 prior lines&#xD;
      of prior systemic therapy will be treated with the monotherapy RP2D of LNS8801. Immediate&#xD;
      prior line of therapy must have been anti-PD-1/L1 (mono or combination) therapy with&#xD;
      demonstrated clinical benefit (complete response or partial response of any duration, or&#xD;
      stable disease for ≥16 weeks) and subsequent progression of disease with no intervening&#xD;
      cytotoxic chemotherapy. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will otherwise be consistent with&#xD;
      those criteria specified above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT M2: 10 patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies having received ≤2 prior lines&#xD;
      of systemic therapy, and not eligible for cohort M6, will be treated with the monotherapy&#xD;
      RP2D of LNS8801. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will otherwise be consistent with those&#xD;
      criteria specified above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT M3: 10 patients with advanced malignant cutaneous melanoma having received as their&#xD;
      immediate prior line of therapy a PD-1/L1 targeted immune checkpoint inhibitor (IO), alone or&#xD;
      in combination, and having been forced to discontinue IO therapy due to an immune-related&#xD;
      adverse event (irAE) will be treated with the monotherapy RP2D of LNS8801. Inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will otherwise be consistent with those criteria specified above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT M4: 10 patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies, other than cutaneous melanoma,&#xD;
      having received as their immediate prior line of therapy a PD-1/L1 targeted immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitor (IO), alone or in combination, and having been forced to discontinue IO therapy due&#xD;
      to an immune-related adverse event (irAE) will be treated with the monotherapy RP2D of&#xD;
      LNS8801. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will otherwise be consistent with those criteria&#xD;
      specified above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT M5: 10 patients with metastatic uveal melanoma that is refractory to or ineligible for&#xD;
      an approved standard-of-care therapy and have not been previously treated with a PD-1/L1&#xD;
      therapy will be treated with the monotherapy RP2D of LNS8801. Inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will otherwise be consistent with those criteria specified above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT M6: 10 patients with ALK mutation-positive NSCLC that is refractory to or ineligible&#xD;
      for an approved standard-of-care therapy will be treated with the monotherapy RP2D of&#xD;
      LNS8801. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will otherwise be consistent with those criteria&#xD;
      specified above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combination with Pembrolizumab:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT C1: 10 patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies having received ≤4 prior lines&#xD;
      of prior systemic therapy will be treated with the combination of LNS8801 + pembrolizumab.&#xD;
      The immediate prior therapy must have included anti-PD-1/L1 therapy, dosed alone or in&#xD;
      combination, with demonstrated clinical benefit (complete response or partial response of any&#xD;
      duration, or stable disease for ≥16 weeks) and subsequent progression of disease with no&#xD;
      intervening cytotoxic chemotherapy. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will otherwise be&#xD;
      consistent with those criteria specified above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT C2: 10 patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies having received ≤2 prior lines&#xD;
      of prior systemic therapy, and not eligible for cohort M6, will be treated with the&#xD;
      combination of LNS8801 + pembrolizumab. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will otherwise be&#xD;
      consistent with those criteria specified above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT C3: 10 patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) expressing PD-L1&#xD;
      (Tumor Proportion Score [TPS] ≥1% and ≤49%) as determined by an FDA-approved test will be&#xD;
      treated with the combination of LNS8801 plus pembrolizumab. Eligible patients must either&#xD;
      have no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations or have not demonstrated disease response on or&#xD;
      following FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will&#xD;
      otherwise be consistent with those criteria specified above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT C4: 10 patients with metastatic or unresectable, recurrent Head and Neck Squamous Cell&#xD;
      Cancer (HNSCC) expressing PD-L1 (Combined Positive Score [CPS] ≥1 and ≤19) as determined by&#xD;
      an FDA-approved test will be treated with the combination of LNS8801 plus pembrolizumab.&#xD;
      Disease can either be treatment-naive or with disease progression on or following&#xD;
      platinum-containing chemotherapy. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will otherwise be&#xD;
      consistent with those criteria specified above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT C5: 10 patients with metastatic uveal melanoma that is refractory to or ineligible for&#xD;
      an approved standard-of-care therapy and have not been previously treated with a PD-1/L1&#xD;
      therapy will be treated with the combination of LNS8801 plus pembrolizumab. Inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will otherwise be consistent with those criteria specified above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT C6: 10 patients with advanced malignant cutaneous melanoma that is refractory to or&#xD;
      ineligible for an approved standard-of-care therapy will be treated with the combination of&#xD;
      LNS8801 + pembrolizumab. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will otherwise be consistent with&#xD;
      those criteria specified above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming pembrolizumab is not contraindicated, enrollment to cohorts M1 and C1, cohorts M2&#xD;
      and C2, and cohorts M5 and C5 will occur in parallel with assignment of patients based on a&#xD;
      simple central randomization conducted by the study CRO. If pembrolizumab is contraindicated,&#xD;
      the patient will be assigned to the next appropriate monotherapy cohort, if possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further evaluate the correlation of prolactin response and antitumor activity, in all&#xD;
      study cohorts, ≥5/10 patients with prolactin response (a 25% or greater increase in&#xD;
      circulating prolactin on Cycle 1, Day 1) must be evaluated. If ˂5/10 patients are available&#xD;
      for evaluation in any cohort, up to 5 additional patients will be enrolled to ensure&#xD;
      evaluation of at least 5 prolactin responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 200 patients will be accrued for this study at up to ten study sites in the United&#xD;
      States.&#xD;

             estrogen-based contraceptives], patch, and vaginal ring), some intrauterine devices&#xD;
             (IUDs) (eg, IUD or intrauterine system), sexual abstinence, or a monogamous&#xD;
             relationship with a vasectomized partner. True abstinence, when in line with the&#xD;
             preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient, is considered a highly effective method&#xD;
             only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period&#xD;
             of risk associated with the study drug (ie, 60 days after discontinuing study drug or&#xD;
             5 times the terminal elimination half-life, whichever is longer). Periodic abstinence&#xD;
             (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post ovulation methods) and withdrawal are&#xD;
             not acceptable methods of contraception.)&#xD;
