  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term objective initiated with this study is to determine which brain areas&#xD;
      functionally contribute to learning a motor skill. The primary hypothesis of this trial is&#xD;
      that premotor cortex (PMC) is necessary to learn a new motor skill. Participants may undergo&#xD;
      a MRI scan to acquire a structural image of their brain to target noninvasive stimulation,&#xD;
      using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to one of two brain areas: PMC or primary motor&#xD;
      cortex (M1). A third group of individuals will undergo a placebo stimulation protocol. For&#xD;
      all three groups, stimulation will be used to create a transient 'virtual lesion' during&#xD;
      motor skill training. Temporarily disrupting the normal activity of these brain regions&#xD;
      during training will allow us to determine which regions are causally involved in learning a&#xD;
      new motor skill. The primary outcome measure will be the change in skill after training in&#xD;
      each group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Recent findings in humans suggest that motor sequences are represented in the premotor cortex&#xD;
      once learned. Studies in animal models have also shown that the premotor cortical areas&#xD;
      encode sequence-specific information. However, it is currently unknown if premotor cortical&#xD;
      areas are involved in the acquisition or consolidation of sequences in humans. In this&#xD;
      project, the investigators will evaluate the functional contributions of human premotor&#xD;
      cortex to sequence learning. The primary overarching research objective is to determine the&#xD;
      brain regions causally involved in motor skill acquisition and consolidation. The main&#xD;
      hypothesis is that disrupting premotor cortex activity during motor sequence learning will&#xD;
      reduce the acquisition and consolidation of the skill. Transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      (TMS) will be used to temporarily disrupt activity of premotor cortex or primary motor&#xD;
      cortex, and skill learning will be assessed in both groups. A sham stimulation group, where&#xD;
      participants will feel the coil on their head and hear the click of the TMS pulses but not&#xD;
      actually receive stimulation to the brain, will be used as a control. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to be in the premotor cortex, primary motor cortex, or sham stimulation&#xD;
      group. Participants may be asked to undergo a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan at Wesley&#xD;
      Woods prior to TMS testing, which will occur at the Emory Rehabilitation Hospital. The MRI&#xD;
      scan would be used to help target TMS to the intended brain area. Participants will be&#xD;
      recruited using flyers around the local community. Consent forms will be provided with ample&#xD;
      time for the participant to read it over and ask any questions that may arise. Participants&#xD;
      will be compensated for their time. The proposed work will be the first to evaluate the&#xD;
      causal role of premotor cortex in motor sequence learning in humans. Findings from this&#xD;
      project are expected to inform the design and application of therapeutic interventions that&#xD;
      improve motor functioning and learning in clinical populations.&#xD;
