      A randomized control trial was conducted at physiotherapy department of Pakistan Railway&#xD;
      General Hospital from July 2017 to Dec 2017. 30 patients with stable COPD were enrolled in&#xD;
      the study on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria. The participants were randomly&#xD;
      assigned into two groups, Group A= interventional group, Group B = control group through toss&#xD;
      and coin method using non-probability convenient sampling technique and written consent was&#xD;
      obtained from each patient participated in the study. From 30 patients 15 patients were&#xD;
      randomly allocated to each group, Group A: Interventional (n= 15), Group B: Control (n=15). 1&#xD;
      patient in control group B was dropout because he didn't come for follow up. Overall 29&#xD;
      patients were evaluated for study as in Group A, interventional (n=15) and Group B control&#xD;
      (n=14).Patients in group A were performed breathing control at the start of session and then&#xD;
      Purse lips breathing technique during aerobic bicycling for 8 min while in group B patients&#xD;
      first perform breathing control and then aerobic bicycling for 8 min. Subjects in both&#xD;
      experimental and control group underwent spirometry and baseline vitals, such as Respiratory&#xD;
      rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation, at rest and at the completion of session was&#xD;
      noted. Borg scale of dyspnea also used to rate the level of dyspnea at rest and at the end of&#xD;
      session. Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) was used at 1st and final week of evaluation. It&#xD;
      was 6 weeks training protocol, with three days per week session was given to the patient.&#xD;

      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a main and growing worldwide prevailing&#xD;
      disease that has lacking consideration from medical practitioners. COPD is self-imposed by&#xD;
      cigarette smoking and underlying pathology is commonly irreparable. This is main reason of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in under developing countries, so quick response is necessary to be&#xD;
      aware of disease signs and symptoms to provide valuable impediment and management programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In U.S public survey the way prevalence of COPD has figure out by questioning adult&#xD;
      population in case they had one of seventeen pulmonary diseases in previous months. Asthma,&#xD;
      bronchitis and emphysema listed in these 17 diseases to approximate the cases for prevalence&#xD;
      of disease. In era of 2000, approx. 10 million people diagnosed with COPD by doctor. Along&#xD;
      this calculation large ratio of COPD-ers left over under diagnosed. In different countries&#xD;
      the occurrence rate varies from 3.5% in Hong Kong and Singapore to 6.7% in Vietnam. Taken as&#xD;
      a whole the prevalence rate is higher in Asian Pacific countries about 6.3% as compared to&#xD;
      World Health Organisation (WHO) report data that hypothesized the figure of 3.8%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dyspnea is a main cause for seek medical advice or referral to pharmacotherapy and pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation regimes to lessen the inflammation and spasm of airways in addition to self&#xD;
      management approach for example breathing retraining techniques. COPD patients have&#xD;
      inadequate exhalation time because of increased resistance in the airways with increase&#xD;
      chance of collapse. While doing exercise airflow limitation exacerbates that leads to air&#xD;
      trapping with shortened exhalation phase. This is noticeable by increase in expiratory lung&#xD;
      volumes which causes reduction in exercise capacity that might be restricted by fatigue of&#xD;
      their lower limb muscles other than the ventilatory causes. The disease severity can be&#xD;
      decided through the intenseness of breathlessness therefore the primary aim of COPD&#xD;
      management is dyspnea reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Commonly used strategy for ventilatory pattern training is purse lips breathing technique&#xD;
      (PLB). PLB is supposed to alter the ventilatory pattern as a result of that breathlessness is&#xD;
      decreased. The action of PLB technique is to improve exhalation and prevent airway&#xD;
      obstruction. The patient performs expiration actively by means of partly opened mouth by&#xD;
      applying pressure of 5cm of water (H2O).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLB reduces rapid and prolong breathing and causes increased level of Carbon dioxide (CO2) in&#xD;
      alveoli. These improved levels may dilate the airway smooth muscles and V/Q ratio and O2 in&#xD;
      circulation. PLB is worked by generating back pressure in airways in a way to open up the&#xD;
      narrowed airways. It is also create positive pressure during expiratory phase to prolong the&#xD;
      exhalation time in order to decrease expiratory lung volumes and increase in tidal volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with emphysema and bronchial atelectasis tried to perform PLB the expired air volume&#xD;
      increased as compared to forced exhalation. This proposed that patient expires in a relaxed&#xD;
      manner with PLB which causes less air trapping and also reduced dynamic hyperinflation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2012 a randomized control study conducted on 14 stable COPD patients to rule out the&#xD;
      effects of imposed purse lips breathing on exercise tolerance. In this study it has been&#xD;
      shown that at rest PLB improves gaseous exchange, breathing pattern and lessen the&#xD;
      respiratory rate near to normal.As in COPD patients' diaphragm hyperinflate due to air&#xD;
      trapping by performing this breathing technique, diaphragm brings to a vantage point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In COPD metabolic disruption in skeletal muscles is a main factor for exercise intolerance.&#xD;
      Previous Investigators compared the upper and lower limb activities in COPD patients&#xD;
      presented with obvious dyspnea and limited active daily living (ADLs). In COPD-ers due to&#xD;
      decreased strength and endurance are correlated with early sarcopenia, reduced capacity of&#xD;
      aerobic exercises and rapid collection of lactic acid while doing exercise these factors&#xD;
      possible culprits for muscle fatigue. Aerobic training is well known and consistent in the&#xD;
      improvement of disease symptoms, exercise tolerance and quality of life in patients with&#xD;
      COPD. According to data of various studies cycle ergometer (CET) is commonly used training to&#xD;
      increase strength and endurance in lower limb musculature. In one study results CET can cause&#xD;
      physiological effects on COPD patients thought to improve O2 uptake &amp; minute tidal volume&#xD;
      with reduction in pulse rate, sensation of breathlessness and muscle fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Pakistan about 6-7 million people have suffering due to COPD and death rate is 71 for each&#xD;
      10000 population. Although the demand for such strategies is considerable but at the same&#xD;
      time the facility to grant these services is deprived. When talk about data on application of&#xD;
      purse lips breathing technique in COPD patients, very few researches are found in Pakistan.&#xD;
      Currently in Peshawar work on chest physiotherapy for worsening symptoms of COPD is reported.&#xD;
      If the implication of these techniques in symptoms free period of disease this might be cause&#xD;
      improvement in health related quality of life. The present study is to determine the effects&#xD;
      of imposed purse lips breathing technique on dyspnea, breathing pattern and pulmonary&#xD;
      function testing during rest and exercise in patients with COPD.&#xD;
