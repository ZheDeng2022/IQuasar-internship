  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health- and nutrient-related labelling is often used to draw consumer's attention to the&#xD;
      potential benefits of consuming one product over another. However, research suggests that&#xD;
      products believed to be 'healthier' and/or lower calorie are often experienced as less&#xD;
      satiating, and may actually prompt people to consume more or these foods, or others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current research aimed to whether consuming a reduced-calorie product labelled &quot;Healthier&#xD;
      Choice&quot; affects compensatory eating behaviour (relative to an unlabelled product), and the&#xD;
      extent to which this depends on the product's sensory characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-session randomised study was used to test the satiety value of a reduced-calorie&#xD;
      beverage - characterised as changes in rated appetite and later food intake (kcal) relative&#xD;
      to an original-calorie version - consumed in one of four contexts varying in label and&#xD;
      sensory cues. The beverage-contexts were assessed in a non-crossover manner.&#xD;

      Reformulation strategies to reduce the energy density of commonly consumed food and beverage&#xD;
      products are needed to support weight management, but one concern is that awareness of&#xD;
      consuming 'healthier' foods can promote compensatory eating behaviours. An alternative&#xD;
      solution is not to label calorie-reductions so consumers are unaware that they are consuming&#xD;
      fewer calories in reformulated products, which has been described as a 'stealth health'&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigated whether consuming a reduced-calorie product labelled with Singapore's&#xD;
      'Healthier Choice Symbol' impacts its satiating power relative to an unlabelled control, and&#xD;
      the extent to which this can be further modified by changes to the product's sensory&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were randomised to consume an original (211 kcal per portion; kcal/g) and&#xD;
      reduced calorie (98 kcal per portion; kcal/g) versions of a soymilk, with the reduced calorie&#xD;
      version presented in one of four beverage context conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Context 1 - Sensory-matched, unlabelled calorie reduction (control) - Sensory matched to&#xD;
           taste like the original (equally sweet, thick and creamy), without a label identifier&#xD;
           (covert energy reduction).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Context 2 - Sensory-matched, labelled calorie reduction - The same sensory matched&#xD;
           beverage as above, but with the HCS attached (explicit energy reduction).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Context 3 - Sensory-reduced, labelled calorie reduction - Designed to taste less thick,&#xD;
           sweet and creamy than the original, with the HCS attached (explicit energy reduction).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Context 4 - Sensory-enhanced, labelled calorie reduction - Designed to taste thicker,&#xD;
           creamier and sweeter than the original, with the HCS attached (explicit energy&#xD;
           reduction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants consumed the two beverages (original vs. reduced energy) in one of the four&#xD;
      beverage contexts on two non-consecutive test sessions at the Clinical Nutrition Research&#xD;
      Centre, with at least three days washout between each session. The calorie reduction was&#xD;
      conducted as full-crossover while the beverage context groups were assigned non-crossover, to&#xD;
      reduce demand awareness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective was to assess changes in lunch energy intake (kcal) after consuming the&#xD;
      original and reduced-calorie beverages, depending on the beverage context the reduced calorie&#xD;
      version was presented in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives were to assess the sensory evaluations of the beverages (liking and&#xD;
      perceived thickness, sweetness and expected fullness etc.), changes in rated appetite up to&#xD;
      180 minutes post-consumption and energy intake (kcal) for the rest of the test day (recorded&#xD;
      in a food diary), as a function of the beverages energy density and context.&#xD;
