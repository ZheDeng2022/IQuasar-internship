      This study is designed to improve the response rate of anti-PD-1 among patients with&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 resistant/refractory digestive (including gullet, stomach and intestine) system&#xD;
      cancers through the intervention on their gut microbiota. Healthy people who have the gut&#xD;
      microbiota profile similar to the responders of anti-PD-1 therapy will be identified. The gut&#xD;
      microbiota of these healthy people will be extracted to product FMT capsule. Gastrointestinal&#xD;
      (GI) cancer patients who failed anti-PD-1 treatment will be administrated with anti-PD-1&#xD;
      immunotherapy combined with FMT. The enrolled subjects will firstly receive 1-week of FMT&#xD;
      therapy. Subsequently, each anti-PD-1 treatment will be combined with the maintenance dose of&#xD;
      FMT capsules to ensure the efficiency of gut microbiota colonization. Each subject will&#xD;
      receive anti-PD-1 therapy for 6 cycles. After the completion of both 3 and 6 cycles of&#xD;
      therapy, safety and efficacy assessments will be conducted. The subjects who complete 3&#xD;
      cycles of treatment but are clinically evaluated as disease progression will not continue to&#xD;
      the following 3 cycles of treatment.&#xD;
