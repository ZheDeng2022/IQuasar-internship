      This study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the prevalence of Helicobacter infection in Myanmar (this would be the largest&#xD;
           ever series in the country)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the clinical and epidemiological associations of Helicobacter infection in&#xD;
           Myanmar&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the utility of stool antigen testing to diagnose the infection and confirm&#xD;
           eradication&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Compare the relative efficacies of concomitant and sequential therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Determine the relative efficacies of first, second and third line therapies in Myanmar&#xD;
           in 2018&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are very few published studies to examine the prevalence of Helicobacter infection in&#xD;
      Myanmar. Two previous studies (both &lt; 400 participants) suggested that the prevalence was&#xD;
      approximately 50% (Myint WJG 2015, Aye MMJ 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The high prevalence of H.pylori is important because gastric adenocarcinoma is the fourth&#xD;
      most common cancer in the country (WHO 2014). Gastric cancer has an almost uniformly dismal&#xD;
      5-year survival rates in this resource-limited country and is estimated to kill almost 5000&#xD;
      patients per year in Myanmar (WHO 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, anecdotally there is a significant associated burden of peptic ulcer disease in&#xD;
      the country, although there are few published data to examine the issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategies to diagnose and eradicate H.pylori must be considered in the context that the&#xD;
      annual per capita health budget is USD103 (World Bank 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic regimens must also consider the issue of antimicrobial resistance, which varies&#xD;
      from country to country. There are very few data from Myanmar to guide us and those that are&#xD;
      available vary enormously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vitro antibiotic resistance by agent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amoxycillin 0%, 8%, 7%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metronidazole 33%, 54%,100%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clarithromycin 0%, 13%, 50%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levofloxacin 6%, NR, 3%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tetracycline 0%, NR, NR&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ciprofloxacin 6%, NR NR&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies: Mahachai 2012, Aye 2005, Aye 2014&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it is also known that in vitro resistance does not necessarily translate into in&#xD;
      vivo failure. Furthermore in a resource poor setting like Myanmar, a strategy of&#xD;
      susceptibility guided treatment is not feasible. Indeed, this is not likely to be&#xD;
      cost-effective in even wealthy countries (ACG guidelines 2017 and Maastricht consensus&#xD;
      guidelines 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current first line therapy for H.pylori in Myanmar is 10-14 days of concomitant bd PPI +&#xD;
      bd Clarithromycin + bd Amoxycillin + bd metronidazole. This regimen contains up to 126 pills&#xD;
      (14 days) and costs up to USD16 (14 days). It is likely that 14 days of 4 drug therapy will&#xD;
      generate issues with side effects and adherence, although again this has not been examined&#xD;
      locally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternatively, a 10-day sequential regimen of 5 days of bd PPI + Amoxycillin, then 5 days of&#xD;
      bd PPI + Clarithromycin and Tinidazole reduces the pill load to 50 pills and the total drug&#xD;
      cost to USD6. This regimen has been shown to be highly effective in Slovenia (94.2%),&#xD;
      Portugal (90%), Belgium (90%), Israel (95.9%), Thailand (94%), Taiwan (91.9%), Singapore&#xD;
      (90.3%), and the United Arab Emirates (88.6%) (Review, De Francesco 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sequential regimen has been shown to have less satisfactory success rates in Greece ,&#xD;
      Spain, Ireland, Turkey, Iran, Korea, China, and Puerto Rico (although in many of these&#xD;
      studies, metronidazole was used instead of tinidazole (Review, De Francesco 2017)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current second-line regimen in Myanmar is 10-14 days of bd PPI + Levofloxacin +&#xD;
      Amoxycillin (pill load 80 pills for 10 days, total cost USD3). In this era of evolving drug&#xD;
      resistance, we may not want to use quinolones as first line therapy however.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current third line therapy is Bismuth based quadruple therapy (BQT). This regimen is&#xD;
      comprised of Bismuth + PPI + Tetracycline + Tinidazole (pill load 120 pills, total cost&#xD;
      USD50)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study aims to demonstrate that a 10-day course of sequential therapy is not&#xD;
      inferior to 14 days of 4 drug concomitant therapy. Assuming a cure rate of 80% for&#xD;
      Concomitant 4 drug therapy, and an inferiority bound of 10%, the sample size is 626 (313&#xD;
      patients in each arm). To identify 626 patients, we will need to screen approximately 1250&#xD;
      patients. In this resource-poor setting, diagnosis will be established using monoclonal stool&#xD;
      antigen testing (SAT BioMerieux BioNexia). Patients who test positive with SAT will be&#xD;
      randomised 1:1 in an open label study to either a 10-day course of sequential therapy or the&#xD;
      current first line regimen of concomitant 4 drug therapy. Four weeks after completing&#xD;
      therapy, eradication will be confirmed with repeat SAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients failing the first line therapy would then receive second line levofloxacin and&#xD;
      then tested to confirm eradication. This would determine the efficacy of the country's&#xD;
      current second line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, patients failing first and second line therapy would receive the more involved and&#xD;
      expensive third line therapy. Once again, this would determine the efficacy of third line&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure all participants had their H.pylori infection eradicated, those failing three lines&#xD;
      of therapy would be offered endoscopy and culture directed therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The performance of the stool antigen test is affected by the PPI therapy, so the study can't&#xD;
      easily enrol patients presenting with acute symptoms who will frequently have already been&#xD;
      taking PPI therapy (higher rate of false negatives). Therefore, the study will enrol&#xD;
      outpatients about to commence aspirin, NSAIDs or anticoagulants (in whom the risk of GI&#xD;
      bleeding is higher) or patients with a personal history of peptic ulcer disease or family&#xD;
      history of gastric cancer. These are all indications for H.pylori testing (ACG guidelines&#xD;
      2017 and Maastricht consensus guidelines 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
             4. Current third line therapy: 14 days of Bismuth + PPI + tetracycline + metro (BQT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Acceptability - to patients and staff - of stool antigen testing for H.pylori screening&#xD;
           and for confirming eradication.&#xD;
