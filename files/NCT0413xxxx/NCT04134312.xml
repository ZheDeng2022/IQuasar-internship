    <textblock>
      A Phase 1 open label trial of intravenous administration of MVA-BN-Brachyury vaccine in&#xD;
      patients with advanced cancer. Patients with metastatic or unresectable locally advanced&#xD;
      malignant solid tumors will be enrolled and treated according to a 3+3 dose escalation&#xD;
      scheme. Up to 3 dose levels will be explored. Patients will receive MVA-BN-Brachyury every&#xD;
      three weeks, three administrations in total. Patients will be hospitalized after each&#xD;
      vaccination, over 48 hours. Trial duration will be approximately 24 weeks per patient&#xD;
      including 3 months after the last vaccination follow up (FU) period.&#xD;
