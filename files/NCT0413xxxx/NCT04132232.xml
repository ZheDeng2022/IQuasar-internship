  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to encourage smoking cessation in women with substance use disorders&#xD;
      by providing knowledge of expired carbon monoxide. We hypothesize that women who are provided&#xD;
      knowledge of their expired carbon monoxide and the associated percent fetal carboxyhemoglobin&#xD;
      will have a greater success at quitting smoking during pregnancy than women who are not&#xD;
      provided this information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim of the study is to correlate expired carbon monoxide throughout pregnancy&#xD;
      with infant birth weight.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial. Pregnant smokers who are substances users who meet&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be offered participation in the study at their first obstetrical&#xD;
      appointment. Patients who consent to participate will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the enrollment/randomization visit, women will be randomized to either the intervention&#xD;
      (knowledge of and interpretation carbon monoxide levels and associated percent fetal&#xD;
      carboxyhemoglobin) or control group (no information on carbon monoxide and associated percent&#xD;
      fetal carboxyhemoglobin). Allocation will be computer generated. This will be done after the&#xD;
      patient meets all inclusion criteria. If randomization to the intervention arm, the patient&#xD;
      will be notified of carbon monoxide and associated fetal carboxyhemoglobin levels at each&#xD;
      obstetrical visit and counseled on how it affects maternal and fetal health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If randomized to the control arm, the patient will have expired carbon monoxide and&#xD;
      associated fetal carboxyhemoglobin levels measured at each obstetrical visit but blinded to&#xD;
      these results. These patients will not be notified of the levels, nor counseled on what&#xD;
      levels mean for maternal or fetal health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      See below for intervention and control protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal demographic (age, race, socioeconomic status), medical history (other medical&#xD;
      problems, medications, height, weight) and obstetric history (parity, gestational age) data&#xD;
      will be abstracted from the patient's chart and supplemented with a patient questionnaire at&#xD;
      the enrollment/randomization visit. The primary outcome is the expired maternal carbon&#xD;
      monoxide level at the last obstetric visit or at delivery. This will be determined by the&#xD;
      Smokerlyzer device used to measure this. Secondary aims of the study will be to evaluate how&#xD;
      maternal carbon monoxide levels correlate with fetal growth, cigarette use per day, patient&#xD;
      satisfaction and neonatal birth weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have the following performed at the enrollment/randomization visit and&#xD;
      subsequent prenatal visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. The order of events for all patients will be as follows: i. Blood pressure evaluation ii.&#xD;
      Weight iii. Fundal height iv. Patient will be asked the number of cigarettes used per day v.&#xD;
      Patient will exhale into Smokerlyzer device to obtain expired carbon monoxide and associated&#xD;
      percent fetal carboxyhemoglobin vi. Patients will be provided smoking cessation resources and&#xD;
      counseling on smoking cessation in pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intervention group will undergo Smokerlyzer ® exhaled carbon monoxide measurements at&#xD;
           enrollment, each prenatal visit, and at their last (&gt;36 week) prenatal visit or at&#xD;
           delivery if not captured in clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Women will be informed of their exhaled carbon monoxide measurement at each visit as&#xD;
           well as the correlation to fetal carboxyhemoglobin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At each visit, the intervention group will receive counseling on fetal impact of smoking&#xD;
           based on fetal carboxyhemoglobin level and institutional and state information on&#xD;
           smoking cessation will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The patient will then proceed to the remainder of the obstetrical visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Women in the control group will undergo Smokerlyzer ® exhaled carbon monoxide&#xD;
           measurements at enrollment, each prenatal visit and at their final (&gt;36 week) prenatal&#xD;
           visit or at delivery if not captured in clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Both levels (maternal carbon monoxide and fetal carboxyhemoglobin) will be recorded by&#xD;
           the co-investigatory, but NOT disclosed to the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At each visit, control group will be provided institutional and state information on&#xD;
           smoking cessation if they report continued smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The patient will then proceed to remainder of the obstetrical visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of delivery, maternal and neonatal outcome data will be recorded from the chart,&#xD;
      including gestational age at delivery, mode of delivery, indications for delivery, birth&#xD;
      weight, Apgar score, cord blood gas, length of stay, and neonatal complications, if any. A&#xD;
      survey will be completed for both intervention and standard care groups after delivery.&#xD;
