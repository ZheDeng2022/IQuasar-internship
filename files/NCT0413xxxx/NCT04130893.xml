  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While invasive vagal stimulation has proven its therapeutic effectiveness over the past 20&#xD;
      years, particularly in the treatment of epilepsy or depression, its implementation is&#xD;
      hampered by the high cost, high technicality and sometimes significant side effects.&#xD;
      Non-invasive vagal stimulation, most often electric, is a less expensive therapeutic&#xD;
      alternative and easier to implement, although the level of evidence is lower than that of&#xD;
      invasive stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some so-called traditional therapies, such as acupuncture, also stimulate certain parts of&#xD;
      the ear by mechanical means, most often by puncturing the ear or the concha. In these&#xD;
      traditional therapies, more than one hundred stimulation points have been described, each&#xD;
      precisely positioned according to an empirical topography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, electrical non-invasive stimulation recognizes only three areas of interest on the&#xD;
      ear, which are the areas of sensitive innervation, namely the afferences of the vagus nerve&#xD;
      in the concha, which is the only one used in practice, the large occipital nerve on the lobe&#xD;
      and part of the helix, and the auriculotemporal nerve on the rest of the auricular flag.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we would like to explore the justification for the topographic precision,&#xD;
      adopted by traditional therapies, for non-invasive vagal stimulation on the concha.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Main objective: to measure the physiological impact of two auricular stimuli on the same&#xD;
      innervation territory but with opposite actions according to traditional therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An identical physiological response on both stimulation points would be an argument against&#xD;
      the topographical precision adopted by traditional therapies; conversely, a different&#xD;
      physiological response would suggest the existence of a somatotopy nestled in the same&#xD;
      innervation territory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine, by sinus variability analysis, the intensity of the sympathetic and&#xD;
           parasympathetic cardiac response of mechanical stimulation of the ear concha.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the existence of a blockage of the sympathetic reaction on cutaneous&#xD;
           vasoconstriction after mechanical stimulation of the ear concha.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure the relationship between sinus variability and paradoxical skin vasodilation&#xD;
           after exposure to cold, as considered in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the justification for the topographical precision adopted by traditional&#xD;
      therapies, we designed an experiment that consists of studying the autonomous, sympathetic&#xD;
      and parasympathetic response to two stimuli performed over two different times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sympathetic stimulation will be done by immersing the right hand up to the wrist in a tub&#xD;
      of cold water maintained at 5°C Mechanical parasympathetic stimulation will be performed on&#xD;
      the ear in two different locations, by placing an adapted needle through an introducer to&#xD;
      respect a standardized insertion depth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The autonomous response will be measured by sinus variability, which responds to a double&#xD;
      innervation, sympathetic and parasympathetic, and by the capillary skin response, which&#xD;
      responds only to a sympathetic innervation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The capillary skin response is measured by the amplitude and latency of the paradoxical&#xD;
      vasodilation reflex following thermal stimulation, in this case the immersion of a limb's tip&#xD;
      in cold water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 3 sessions, as shown in the figure below. This is a prospective&#xD;
      crossover study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first session, the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria will be checked, then a&#xD;
      water immersion test will be carried out to ensure the good tolerance of this test and then&#xD;
      determine the basic values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of acclimatization, the paradoxical vasodilation reflex is highly&#xD;
      reproducible. During the second and third sessions, a mechanical stimulation will be done to&#xD;
      the ear during the skin immersion test.&#xD;
