  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microneedling is a relatively new, minimally invasive technique originally developed for skin&#xD;
      rejuvenation. Controlled micro-injury to the dermis via the application of several small&#xD;
      needles connected to a motorized device stimulates the wound healing process, resulting in&#xD;
      the formation of new tissue and blood vessels. The SkinPen by Bellus Medical is an&#xD;
      FDA-cleared microneedling device proven to improve the appearance of acne scars This study&#xD;
      evaluates the clinical performance of the SkinPen device for the treatment of signs of aging&#xD;
      on the back of the hand.&#xD;

      SkinPen microneedling treatment of dorsal hand skin This is a single-site, non-randomized,&#xD;
      non-controlled study designed to follow at least twenty&#xD;
&#xD;
      three (23) qualified and consenting subjects treated with 4 Skinpen microneedling treatments.&#xD;
      The sample size determination of this study is based on the recommendations of the sponsor.&#xD;
      These patients will be treated four times over the dorsum of the hand from the wrist to the&#xD;
      knuckles each month for four months, followed by two follow-up visits at 1-month and 3-months&#xD;
      post-treatment. The acute effects of microneedling will be determined by subjective and&#xD;
      objective analysis using standard and close-up photography. Additionally, the effects of this&#xD;
      treatment will be analyzed at 1-month and 3-month post-treatment through clinician and&#xD;
      subject assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be identified from Dr. Jeffrey Kenkel's clinical practice at the University of&#xD;
      Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Subjects will be numbered sequentially in the order in&#xD;
      which they qualify for entry into the study.&#xD;
