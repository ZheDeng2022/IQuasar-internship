      1. Background and rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Bladder cancer is the ninth most common cancer in the world while being considerably&#xD;
           common in both developed and developing countries. Bladder cancer is the most common&#xD;
           malignancy among Egyptian males and it had been previously attributed to Schistosoma&#xD;
           infection, a major risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Recently, transitional&#xD;
           cell carcinoma (TCC) incidence has been increasing while SCC has declined. Exposures to&#xD;
           tobacco smoke, occupational toxins, and environmental sources of heavy metals such as&#xD;
           arsenic are the major reported risk factors for TCC .&#xD;
&#xD;
           Acute perioperative pain management has been a matter of attention especially in major&#xD;
           abdominal surgeries like radical cystectomy. Poor perioperative pain management&#xD;
           especially with major abdominal surgeries can lead to deterioration of both&#xD;
           physiological and psychological status of the patient leading to anxiety, stress, and&#xD;
           patient's dissatisfaction while also leading to severe abdominal pain and diminished&#xD;
           respiratory functions due to impaired function of accessory respiratory muscles which&#xD;
           may precipitate shallow breathing, atelectasis, retained secretions, and also lack of&#xD;
           patient's cooperation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adequate multimodal perioperative pain management improves patient's recovery and&#xD;
           survival on a general prospective due to decreased surgical stress response leading to&#xD;
           better immunological functions and coagulation profile, and hence improving the outcome&#xD;
           of the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Perioperative epidural analgesia has been associated with improved overall survival but&#xD;
           not reduced cancer recurrence. However, patients receiving epidural analgesia with or&#xD;
           without general anesthesia have shown longer survival over 5 years period&#xD;
           postoperatively than those receiving general anesthesia alone which can be related to&#xD;
           better immunological profile and decreased stress response in regional anesthesia group&#xD;
           of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Epidural analgesia for perioperative pain management has proven earlier recovery in post&#xD;
           anesthesia care unit (PACU) with better pain and respiratory tolerance and decreased&#xD;
           need for intravenous opioid administration. Perioperative continuous epidural analgesia&#xD;
           was found to reduce hospital stay for patients undergoing major abdominal surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Quadratus lumborum (QL) block was first described by Blanco and was previously called&#xD;
           (the posterior approach of TAP block). Volunteers for QL spread of local anesthetic have&#xD;
           shown a good spread of local anesthetics from T4 to L1 proving adequacy of QL block for&#xD;
           analgesia over both posterior and anterior abdominal region surgeries. Further studies&#xD;
           are being made to assess the adequacy of QL block as an analgesic technique for major&#xD;
           abdominal surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Perioperative analgesia using QL block with the ipsilateral technique following minor&#xD;
           abdominal surgeries has shown decreased need for intravenous administration of opioids&#xD;
           and has also shown promising results for adequate perioperative analgesia after major&#xD;
           abdominal surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Many reports have suggested that QL block can provide adequate analgesia not only for&#xD;
           abdominal wall somatic pain but for severe visceral pain as well. The mechanism for&#xD;
           visceral pain analgesia is not fully understood but it is suggested to be due to&#xD;
           paravertebral spread of the injected local anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Early post-operative ambulation of bladder cancer patients undergoing radical cystectomy&#xD;
           can be achieved using QL block which have a positive impact on both surgical outcome and&#xD;
           patient survival. Radical cystectomy patients receiving QL block have shown decreased&#xD;
           hospital stay with earlier discharge due to adequate long lasting analgesia and early&#xD;
           ambulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To test feasibility, efficiency, and safety of continuous perioperative QL block for&#xD;
           perioperative pain management in bladder cancer patients undergoing radical cystectomy&#xD;
           in comparison to continuous perioperative epidural analgesia for the same surgical&#xD;
           procedure.&#xD;

&#xD;
        5. Study Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pre-interventional preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sedation for all patients prior to analgesic procedure at preoperative preparatory&#xD;
                room using midazolam (0.02 mg/kg) intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients will be re-instructed about our anesthetic procedure steps according to&#xD;
                each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Standard ASA monitoring for all patients before and during the anesthetic&#xD;
                procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Anesthetic procedure will start at the preoperative preparatory room in the form of&#xD;
                regional block according to each of the study groups with catheter insertion and&#xD;
                assessment of procedure success as discussed later.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients will be subjected to either quadratus lumborum block or epidural catheter&#xD;
                insertion and analgesia as described later on.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Success of catheter insertion will be evaluated using 5ml of lidocaine 5% per&#xD;
                catheter injection before proceeding with regular anesthetic doses. Analgesia level&#xD;
                of T4 will be satisfactory for permitting transfer of patients to OR to proceed&#xD;
                with general anesthesia and surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Routine assessment of all patients including assessment of patient's medical&#xD;
                history, clinical examination, laboratory investigations (kidney and liver&#xD;
                functions, CBC, and coagulation profile), ECG will be conducted on all patients&#xD;
                above 40 years old and echocardiography for patients with suspected&#xD;
                cardiomyopathies by medical history or preoperative examination. Chest X-ray for&#xD;
                all patients suspected for respiratory diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients will be subjected to continuous monitoring during surgery for any further&#xD;
                complications related to anesthetic techniques and to surgery itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients will be monitored at PACU post-operatively to ensure hemodynamic&#xD;
                stability, adequate analgesia, and attention for any possible complications that&#xD;
                may occur due to anesthetic or surgical techniques used.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients will be discharged using the modified Aldrete's scoring system, a score of&#xD;
                9 or more will be sufficient for safe discharge of the patient to ward for further&#xD;
                monitoring, continuation of analgesic techniques, and assessment of adequacy of&#xD;
                analgesia post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients' discharge time till reaching sufficient Aldrete's score for each study&#xD;
                group will be calculated and included in the study parameters for further&#xD;
                assessment of safety and efficiency of analgesic techniques used.&#xD;
&#xD;
                • Possible risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Orthostatic hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hemodynamic instability (e.g. bradycardia, ECG changes, tachycardia).&#xD;
&#xD;

    <description>Ultrasound guided transmuscular approach for quadratus lumborum block using an 18 gauge Touhy's epidural needle to insert the catheter. Normal saline 5 mL will be used to identify that plane. A volume of 20 ml of 0.25% of Bupivacaine bolus will be injected in that plane just over QL. This will be followed by epidural catheter insertion to facilitate continuous infusion. A similar procedure will be performed on the other side. A continuous infusion of 0.2% Bupivacaine at 5 ml/h will be administered to the patient.&#xD;
This transmuscular quadratus lumborum (TQL) block, has been suggested to be a simple and perhaps safer alternative to the anterior approach as was described for the original QL block</description>
