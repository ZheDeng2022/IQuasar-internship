  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Purpose of this study is to assess the relative bioavailability, dose proportionality,&#xD;
      the impact of food on the rate and extent of absorption, palatability of the selected&#xD;
      pediatric formulation of maribavir and the safety and tolerability of two candidate pediatric&#xD;
      formulations and the adult tablet formulation of maribavir in healthy participants.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in two parts (Part 1 and Part 2). Part 1 consists of three&#xD;
      treatment periods in six sequences and part 2 consists of four treatment periods in four&#xD;
      sequences. In Part 1 two pediatric candidate powder formulations will be compared with&#xD;
      maribavir 200mg tablet under fasted conditions in regards to their bioavailability and&#xD;
      palatability. In Part 2 dose proportionality and impact of food (a high-fat meal) on the rate&#xD;
      and extent of absorption of the selected pediatric formulation will be assessed. The&#xD;
      pediatric formulation which will be evaluated in Part 2 will be chosen based on the results&#xD;
      of planned analysis of Part 1 PK and palatability data from two candidate pediatric&#xD;
      formulations and the doses to be evaluated in Part 2 may be adjusted based on relative&#xD;
      bioavailability of the selected pediatric formulation (powder for oral suspension) to the&#xD;
      Phase 3 tablet formulation observed in Part 1.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </detailed_description>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study was stopped because based on the planned interim analysis of the data of Part 1,&#xD;
    palatability of both pediatric formulations was not acceptable.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted at single site in United States of America from 25 October 2019 (first participant first visit) and 06 January 2020 (last participant last visit).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>This study was planned to be conducted in 2 parts: Part 1 and Part 2. However, study was terminated based on planned interim analysis of the data of Part 1, palatability of both pediatric formulations was not acceptable and therefore, Part 2 was not conducted. Participants were randomized to 1 of 6 sequences with treatment A, B and C. Baseline characteristics of participants were only analyzed and reported for overall study period, as planned, and not per treatment to avoid double-counting.</pre_assignment_details>
