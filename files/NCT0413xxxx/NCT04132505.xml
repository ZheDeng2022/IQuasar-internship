      This phase I trial studies the best dose of hydroxychloroquine when given together with&#xD;
      binimetinib in treating patients with KRAS gene mutated pancreatic cancer that has spread to&#xD;
      other places in the body (metastatic). Binimetinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Hydroxychloroquine may prevent&#xD;
      autophagy, a normal process in which a cell destroys proteins and other substances which may&#xD;
      lead to cell death. Autophagy may prevent normal cells from developing into tumor cells, but&#xD;
      it may also protect tumor cells by destroying anticancer drugs or substances taken up by&#xD;
      them. Giving hydroxychloroquine together with binimetinib may work better in treating&#xD;
      patients with pancreatic cancer compared to binimetinib alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) when combined with a&#xD;
      fixed dose of binimetinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the response rate among a pilot cohort of pancreatic cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the safety and toxicity profile of the combination of binimetinib and HCQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the ability of the combination to halt tumor growth as measured by&#xD;
      progression free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the overall survival of patients treated on this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the efficacy of treatment to somatic gene mutation profile as acquired by&#xD;
      standard of care testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess pre- and post- treatment tissue to determine if markers of autophagy correlate&#xD;
      with response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the effect of this binimetinib/HCQ treatment on changes in muscle and fat mass&#xD;
      as analyzed by computed tomography (CT) scan (as standard of care treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of hydroxychloroquine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive binimetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and hydroxychloroquine PO BID on&#xD;
      days 1-14. Cycles repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 30 days.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator. Evidence for&#xD;
             such abnormalities/conditions will be documented in the patient's medical record.&#xD;

             deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary emboli. Note: Patients with either deep vein&#xD;
             thrombosis or pulmonary emboli that does not result in hemodynamic instability are&#xD;
             allowed to enroll as long as they are on a stable dose of anticoagulants for at least&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has a history of active bleeding requiring transfusion within a 3 month period prior&#xD;
             to screening. (Transfusions attributed to chemotherapy related anemia do not meet this&#xD;
             exclusion criterion.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known cases of drug-induced hepatobiliary toxicities (other than a radiological&#xD;
             finding of fatty liver).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has had prior treatment with a MEK or ERK inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Partial or complete bowel obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Impaired gastrointestinal function that may significantly alter the absorption of&#xD;
             binimetinib (e.g., ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled vomiting, malabsorption syndrome,&#xD;
             small bowel resection with decreased intestinal absorption) or baseline diarrhea &gt;=&#xD;

             genistein, prazosin, sulfasalazine, or antiepileptics if used for seizures (ok to use&#xD;
             the latter if part of a pain regimen). Prior loperamide use for diarrhea is permitted&#xD;
             at enrollment but should be changed to diphenoxylate / atropine before initiation of&#xD;
