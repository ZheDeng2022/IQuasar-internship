      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, three arm study in adult men&#xD;
      with biopsy confirmed NASH. The study is aimed at evaluating efficacy and tolerability of&#xD;
      LPCN 1144 in adult men with NASH. The study will be conducted across multiple centers in the&#xD;
      United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 75 subjects will be randomized in 1:1:1 ratio to receive one of the following&#xD;
      treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment A: Oral LPCN 1144 Formulation A&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment B: Oral LPCN 1144 Formulation B&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment C: Oral matching placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo a screening period to determine study eligibility. As a part of&#xD;
      screening, liver biopsies will be performed for subjects who have not had a liver biopsy&#xD;
      within 6 months of Day 1, and fat fraction will be measured by MRI-PDFF in all subjects.&#xD;
      Adult male subjects with histologic evidence of NASH will be enrolled into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be randomized to one of the three treatment arms. The treatment phase&#xD;
      will be for a duration of 36-weeks with assessments of liver biopsies, hepatic fat fraction,&#xD;
      liver enzymes, lipid levels and other safety parameters. Safety and tolerability will be&#xD;
      assessed throughout the study.&#xD;
