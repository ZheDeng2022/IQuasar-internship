  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will assess the safety and feasibility of using an implantable microdevice&#xD;
      to measure local intratumor response to chemotherapy and other clinically relevant drugs in&#xD;
      malignant brain tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The device involved in this study is called a microdevice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The drugs used in this study will only include drugs already used systemically for the&#xD;
           treatment of gliomas.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining&#xD;
      this study device in brain tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the microdevice as a&#xD;
      treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators are studying the safety of the microdevice and the effects of different drugs&#xD;
      for each specific tumor. Brain tumors are known to be very different from each other and&#xD;
      respond differently to different drugs. It would be very helpful to find out what drugs have&#xD;
      the best chance of working in each specific tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study involves drugs that are released by a small device, as small as the tip&#xD;
      of a needle, that is inserted into the tumor at the time of surgery and is removed at the end&#xD;
      of the surgery. The goal of this research study is to prove that microdevices can be used to&#xD;
      find out which drugs have better effects on treating malignant brain tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be in this research study for up to 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected enrollment is about 12 people.&#xD;

    <description>The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
Patients with newly found supratentorial lesions, or patients previously diagnosed with supratentorial gliomas at time of recurrence, whose treatment plan includes partial or total resection surgery as a component of standard-of-care treatment will be included.&#xD;
- Placement of 1-3 microdevices (depending on the size of the tumor) before tumor resection is started.&#xD;
-- The microdevices will dwell in the tumor tissue for a time window of 2-4 hours to allow time for tissue effects of the drugs microdoses for intratumor release of the following 8 approved drugs: Temozolomide, Lomustine, Irinotecan, Carboplatin, Lapatinib, Osimertinib, Abenaciclib, and Everolimus. The drugs used in this study will only include drugs already used systemically for the treatment of gliomas.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have operable supratentorial tumor presumed to be WHO grade II-IV glioma&#xD;
             (Astrocytoma, Oligodendroglioma, Anaplastic Astrocytoma, Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma,&#xD;
             or Glioblastoma) based on radiological evidence at MRI, where a gross total or partial&#xD;
             surgical resection is intended.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histological confirmation of WHO grade II-IV glioma at time of intraoperative frozen&#xD;
             analysis (for newly diagnosed tumors). This is not necessary in cases where a&#xD;
             histopathologic diagnosis is already available from prior surgeries/biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky Performance Score ≥ 60 (Appendix C).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine levels&#xD;
                  above institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be evaluated by a neurosurgeon who will determine the feasibility of&#xD;
             microdevice implantation based on clinical history, extent, and anatomical location of&#xD;
             the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because participants will be exposed to microdoses of therapeutic agents only in a&#xD;
             localized setting and for a short period of time (2-4 hours), the risk of interaction&#xD;
             with other drugs routinely assumed by participants is considered not applicable. Thus,&#xD;
             participants receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers&#xD;
             of CYP450 enzymes remain eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of the microdevice on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this&#xD;
             reason and because the therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be&#xD;
             teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential must agree to have a negative serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 48 hours prior to registration. Women of child-bearing potential&#xD;
             and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth&#xD;
             control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.&#xD;
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men&#xD;
             treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             prior to the study and for the duration of study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse&#xD;
             events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to the microdevice or any agents used in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because agents released by the microdevice&#xD;
             have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with the agents used in this study, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated in the study for a total of 14 days after&#xD;
             removal of the microdevice.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumor size &lt; 5 cm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumor located in deep brain structures (e.g. thalamus, brainstem).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncorrectable bleeding or coagulation disorder known to cause increased risk with&#xD;
             surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If there are significant risk factors (e.g. high risk of venous thrombosis, pulmonary&#xD;
             embolism, stroke or myocardial infarction) precluding the safe cessation of&#xD;
             anticoagulation medication as per SIR guidelines, patients will be excluded from the&#xD;
             trial.&#xD;
