  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the effects of GWP42003-P on cognition in pediatric&#xD;
      participants, aged 3 to 10 years, with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a 30-week (4-week baseline period; 26-week treatment period) open-label&#xD;
      exploratory investigation of the effects of GWP42003-P on cognitive abilities in participants&#xD;
      with LGS who reside in the United States.&#xD;

  <overall_status>Withdrawn</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The decision to withdraw the study was based on pandemic-related concerns of conducting a Phase&#xD;
    IV study requiring multiple clinic visits when medication is commercially available. The study&#xD;
    was withdrawn before any participants were recruited.&#xD;

    <description>For the first 7 days of the treatment period, participants are to take GWP42003-P at a dose of 5 milligrams per kilogram per day (mg/kg/day), administered as 2 equally divided doses (i.e., 2.5 mg/kg in the morning and 2.5 mg/kg in the evening). On Day 8, participants are to increase the dose to 10 mg/kg/day, administered as 2 equally divided doses (i.e., 5 mg/kg in the morning and 5 mg/kg in the evening). The 10 mg/kg/day dose should be maintained for the remainder of the treatment period; however, per labeling, investigators may increase the dose to a maximum of 20 mg/kg/day if clinically warranted by titrating an additional 5 mg/kg/day each week until reaching the maximum dose. GWP42003-P will be taken b.i.d. (morning and evening).</description>
