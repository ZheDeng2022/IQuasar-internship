               -  Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic&#xD;
                  events such as heart failure, hypokalaemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family&#xD;

                  limit of normal of the institutional standard will be excluded, whichever is&#xD;

                  confirm eligibility (e.g., echocardiogram [ECHO], multi-gated acquisition scan&#xD;
                  [MUGA]). A historic measurement of EF no older than 6 months prior to first&#xD;
                  administration of study drug can be accepted provided that there is clinical&#xD;
                  evidence that the EF value has not worsened since this measurement in the opinion&#xD;
                  of the Investigator or of the treating physician or both&#xD;

             or active ulcers (gastro-intestinal tract, skin) or laboratory abnormality that may&#xD;
             increase the risk associated with trial participation or trial drug administration,&#xD;
