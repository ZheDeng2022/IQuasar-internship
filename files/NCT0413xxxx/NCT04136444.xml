                  insufficiency:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must have characteristics that will meet the clinical criteria usually&#xD;
             found in participants with chronic hepatic insufficiency, as determined by medical&#xD;

             participate in this study, such as a history of schizophrenia, or other psychotic&#xD;
             disorder, bipolar disorder, or severe unipolar depression. The presence of potential&#xD;
             psychiatric exclusion criteria will be determined based on the psychiatric history&#xD;

             be prolonged. Specific medications may be allowed. Participant has used hepatic&#xD;
             enzyme-inducing drugs (eg, glucocorticoids, phenobarbital, phenytoin, isoniazid, or&#xD;
             rifampicin, etc.) within 2 months prior to dosing unless required to treat an adverse&#xD;

             intrauterine devices (IUDs) /intrauterine systems (IUSs) delivering progesterone (for&#xD;
             female study participants) or acetaminophen with a maximal dose of 2 g/day or with a&#xD;
             maximum of 10g over 15 days. In case of uncertainty, the UCB Study Physician should be&#xD;
             consulted&#xD;

             minimum: amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates, cannabinoids, and&#xD;
             benzodiazepines). A participant with a positive finding on the drug screen may still&#xD;
             be enrolled at the discretion of the Investigator if a plausible clinical explanation&#xD;
             exists (eg, prior or concomitant medication use)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a history of unexplained syncope or a family history of sudden death&#xD;
             due to long QT syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has renal impairment as indicated by an estimated glomerular filtration&#xD;
             rate (GFR) &lt;60 mL/min, calculated by using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology&#xD;
             Collaboration (CKD-EPI)&#xD;
&#xD;

             biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic&#xD;
             gallstones) Note: For participants with a Baseline result &gt;ULN for ALT, AST, ALP, or&#xD;
             total bilirubin, a baseline diagnosis and/or the cause of any clinically meaningful&#xD;
             elevation must be understood and recorded in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).&#xD;
             If participant has &gt;ULN ALT, AST, or ALP that does not meet the exclusion limit at&#xD;
             Screening, repeat the tests, if possible, prior to dosing to ensure there is no&#xD;
             further ongoing clinically relevant increase. In case of a clinically relevant&#xD;
             increase, inclusion of the study participant must be discussed with the UCB Study&#xD;
             Physician&#xD;
&#xD;

             insufficiency that is not established in dose and schedule for at least 14 days before&#xD;
