      This is an open-label, sing-arm, single site, phase IV clinical study. The main objective is&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy of afatinib in LSQC patients with EGFR sensitive mutation, and to&#xD;
      explore the clinical factors which might be predictive for the effectiveness in LSQC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, sing-arm phase IV clinical study which will recruit about 20 patients&#xD;
      in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of afatinib in LSQC patients&#xD;
      with EGFR sensitive mutation, and to explore the clinical factors which might be predictive&#xD;
      for the effectiveness in LSQC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target patient population:Locally advanced (IIIB) or metastatic (stage IV)&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry (IHC)-verified Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSQC) with EGFR sensitive&#xD;
      mutation patients, whom previously untreated or received platinum-based doublet chemotherapy&#xD;
      as first-line treatment with subsequent disease progression, and had to be eligible for&#xD;
      second-line treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational product, the dose and administration method: Afatinib is a member of the&#xD;
      second generation TKIs, which binds irreversibly to the erbB family of receptors. Afatinib&#xD;
      will be administrated orally with the starting dose of 40 mg tablets, once per day. If&#xD;
      patients can't tolerate drug related AEs with 40mg, patients can receive 30mg once per day&#xD;
      after AEs recovered to Grade 0-1 (CTCAE 5.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study assessment: The collected data include the patient's demographic characteristics,&#xD;
      information needed to determine whether the patient is eligible (including medical history,&#xD;
      attributes of previous and current disease, and EGFR mutation status in tumor tissues),&#xD;
      efficacy of objective response rate(ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival&#xD;
      (OS), and safety (including serious adverse events and dose change-induced adverse events).&#xD;
