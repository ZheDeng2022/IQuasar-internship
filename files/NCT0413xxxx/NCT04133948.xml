    <textblock>
      DONIMI is a phase 1b trial testing the combination of domatinostat + nivolumab or nivolumab&#xD;
      monotherapy in IFN-gamma signature high patients and of domatinostat + nivolumab or&#xD;
      domatinostat + nivolumab + ipilimumab in IFN-gamma signature low patients with de-novo or&#xD;
      recurrent macroscopic stage III cutaneous or unknown primary melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will include 45 stage III cutaneous or unknown primary melanoma patients with&#xD;
      RECIST 1.1 measurable de-novo or recurrent disease (short axis lymph node metastasis ≥1.5cm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NanoString IFN-gamma signature high patients will be randomized to be treated pre-surgically&#xD;
      for 6 weeks with nivolumab (arm A; 10 patients) or domatinostat + nivolumab (arm B; 10&#xD;
      patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IFN-gamma signature low patients will be randomized to be treated pre-surgically for 6 weeks&#xD;
      with domatinostat + nivolumab (arm C; 10 patients) or domatinostat + nivolumab + ipilimumab&#xD;
      (arm D; 15 patients). Patients will be stratified according to center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-surgery (starting at week 12), the patients will start with adjuvant nivolumab or&#xD;
      pembrolizumab for 52 weeks according to institute's standard. BRAF V600E/K mutation positive&#xD;
      patients with no pathologic response after neoadjuvant therapy may also receive adjuvant BRAF&#xD;
      + MEK inhibition if commercially available and according to the patient's and the treating&#xD;
      physician's decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up after the adjuvant therapy will be for 2 years, according to the institutes'&#xD;
      standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity and pathologic response rates will be descriptive. In case of 2/5 or 4/10 patients&#xD;
      not undergoing their lymph node dissection at week 6 +/- 1 week due to treatment related&#xD;
      toxicity, this arm will be declared unfeasible.&#xD;
