  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled multi-center trial to measure&#xD;
      if postoperative pain and the amount of narcotics used are reduced by a clinically&#xD;
      significant amount in women undergoing minimally invasive hysterectomy receiving a continuous&#xD;
      infusion of intraperitoneal (IP) local anesthetic (LA) or a continuous infusion of LA&#xD;
      combined with an NSAID compared with a control group who receives only 0.9% normal saline.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Any patient desiring minimally invasive hysterectomy will be contacted by a study team&#xD;
           member during their visit to the MIGS (minimally invasive gynecologic surgery) clinic.&#xD;
           The risks and benefits of participation will be explained to them. If they choose to&#xD;
           participate they will sign the consent form at that time or if they need more time to&#xD;
           consider participation they will sign later. They will then complete the health-related&#xD;
           quality of life (HrQoL) questionnaire UFS-QOL* before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Computer-generated randomization will be used to randomize patients between 3 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: receiving a continuous infusion of intraperitoneal local anesthetic (LA) during&#xD;
           72 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: receiving a continuous infusion of intraperitoneal LA combined with an NSAID&#xD;
           during 72 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group C: receiving a continuous infusion of intraperitoneal placebo during 72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study participants will then undergo a minimally invasive hysterectomy by one of the&#xD;
           highly experienced minimally invasive gynecologists using a standard technique. At the&#xD;
           conclusion of the procedure, all women will have an infusion catheter attached to an&#xD;
           ON-Q pump inserted percutaneously into the pelvis under direct laparoscopic vision. The&#xD;
           catheter tip will be placed in the peritoneal cavity at the vaginal vault. In order to&#xD;
           ensure patency of the catheter tubing, a 10 mL bolus of assigned medication will be&#xD;
           given. The ON-Q pump infusion will then provide 540 mL of assigned medication for a&#xD;
           total of 72 hours following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical variables (length of surgery, estimated blood loss, type of analgesia and&#xD;
           anesthesia used, concomitant procedures, uterine weight, ASA, and intraoperative&#xD;
           complications - organ injury (bladder, bowel, vaginal laceration), EBL &gt; 1000 cc,&#xD;
           conversion to laparotomy, transfusion) will be recorded on a data collection sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional analgesia will be administered by the nursing staff in the PACU at the&#xD;
           patient's request. The total dose of analgesia over the 72 postoperative hours will be&#xD;
           calculated for each woman (e.g. each of the following was considered to be one dose; 1 g&#xD;
           of paracetamol, 50 mg diclofenac, 400 mg ibuprofen, 50 mg tramadol). The total morphine&#xD;
           equivalents per patient will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All medication administered for pain as well as VAS pain scores at 1, 2, 4, 6, 24, 48,&#xD;
           and 72 hours postoperatively will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be discharged when clinically appropriate and according to our usual&#xD;
           hospital procedure, which is usually same day discharge. Subjects staying in hospital&#xD;
           for less than 72 hours will be given verbal and written instructions on catheter&#xD;
           removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subjects will be given a post-operative pain diary to fill out during their 2 week&#xD;
           recovery period including pain scores and amount of pain medication used. This diary&#xD;
           will be collected at their first post-operative visit at around 2 weeks postoperatively.&#xD;
           Subjects will be asked to complete the EQ-5D again during this visit. Postoperative&#xD;
           complications will also be recorded (ICU-admission, reoperation, transfusion, DVT/PE,&#xD;
           readmission, bowel obstruction/ileus, incision&#xD;
           seroma/cellulitis/hematoma/separation/hernia, and cuff&#xD;
           cellulitis/abscess/dehiscence/granulation tissue).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital (operative and pathology reports) and clinical (clinical visit notes) reports&#xD;
           will be reviewed to compare baseline demographics, past surgical history, past medical&#xD;
           history, comorbidities, and complications between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pumps and syringes will be filled with study drugs depending on the assigned group to a&#xD;
           max of 540 mL for pumps and a max of 10 mL for syringes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: receiving a continuous infusion of intraperitoneal local anesthetic (LA) during&#xD;
           72 hours: 10 mL bolus of 0.2% Ropivacaine + 540 mL of 0.2% Ropivacaine at 8 mL/hour&#xD;
           infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: receiving a continuous infusion of intraperitoneal LA combined with an NSAID&#xD;
           during 72 hours: 10 mL bolus of 0.2% Ropivacaine combined with 30mg/550mL toradol + 540&#xD;
           mL of 0.2% Ropivacaine combined with 30mg/550mL toradol at 8 mL/hour infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group C: receiving a continuous infusion of intraperitoneal placebo during 72 hours: 10&#xD;
           mL bolus of 0.9% normal saline + 540 mL of 0.9% normal saline at 8 mL/hour infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The IDS research pharmacist will fill the pumps for use and a member of the research&#xD;
           team will transport the filled pumps to the hospital for the surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical Analysis: Pre-operative variables such as patient demographic and clinical&#xD;
           information (medical and surgical history) will be recorded and compared as well as&#xD;
           intra-operative variables such as surgical modality, length of surgery, estimated blood&#xD;
           loss, concomitant procedures, uterine weight, ASA, and complications. Before and after&#xD;
           their surgery, patients will complete a questionnaire regarding quality of life and&#xD;
           pain. To combine the results of both sites, REDCap will be used to securely share&#xD;
           de-identified data. These outcome variables will be analyzed by calculating the&#xD;
           unadjusted and adjusted means and 95% confidence intervals using simple and multiple&#xD;
           linear regressions.&#xD;
