      CandeSpartan Study Candesartan Spanish Response-prediction and Tolerability study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational study on response predictors and tolerability of Candesartan in usual clinical&#xD;
      practice&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Migraine is a neurological disease with a prevalence of 14% of the population 1, 2. It is the&#xD;
      second most disabling disease in terms of years of life lived with disability, especially in&#xD;
      the age group between 15 and 49 years3. Migraine is also the headache the most frequently&#xD;
      seen in neurology consultations and headache units4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the 1970s, numerous preventive drugs have been developed. One of the problems is that&#xD;
      many of these drugs come from other indications, such as depression, epilepsy or&#xD;
      hypertension5. Nowadays, clinical practice guidelines base the indication mainly on the level&#xD;
      of evidence6, which, given the age and scarcity of these studies, is limited. Although the&#xD;
      new drugs are based on clinical trials according to the current methodology, they are&#xD;
      unlikely to be indicated in patients who have not tried any preventive treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candesartan is an angiotensin-2 receptor antagonist drug that has shown efficacy in episodic&#xD;
      migraine mainly in two clinical trials compared to placebo, using a 16 mg daily dose. The&#xD;
      first study showed a monthly headache days reduction of 4.9 days of (standard deviation 10.6)&#xD;
      in episodic migraine patients that had previously failed to none or one preventive, with 2-6&#xD;
      episodes of headache per month at baseline7. The second study had three arms, including&#xD;
      propranolol and placebo showing a montly headache days reduction of -2.91 days (standard&#xD;
      deviation 1.06) and showing no-inferiority with respect to propranolol8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spanish official headache guidelines recommend Candesartan use in patients with migraine with&#xD;
      and without aura, particularly if they have hypertension or comorbid depression6. In some&#xD;
      international prestige centers, it is the first choice drug. In habitual clinical practice,&#xD;
      one aspect that limits its use is tolerability, being frequent the presence of hypotension&#xD;
      and dizziness, even at the dose of 8mg, frequently used in our environment9. In the studies&#xD;
      carried out, there were adverse effects in 45-50% of the patients and in 10% of patients was&#xD;
      a reason for treatment discontinuation 7, 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to evaluate which clinical factors are associated with a better&#xD;
      therapeutic response or a worse tolerability in usual clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The therapeutic response and tolerability to candesartan may be influenced by&#xD;
      individual factors or related to the evolution of migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      The study will not interfere in the current practice, participants will receive the&#xD;
      candesartan in the same manner and intensity if they were not enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be allowed to use their usual symptomatic treatment as usual. The number of&#xD;
      days of symptomatic treatment and the number of use of triptans will be reflected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concomitant drugs with potential use as a preventive according to National Clinical&#xD;
      Practice guidelines (gabapentin, pregabalin, tricyclic antidepressants, duloxetine, valproic&#xD;
      acid, phenytoin, lamotrigine, topiramate, botulinum toxin, anti-CGRP antibodies,&#xD;
      beta-blockers, lisinopril) will not be permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment failure shall be defined as insufficient efficacy at a sufficient dose and for an&#xD;
      adequate duration or withdrawal due to adverse effects of a drug present in the national&#xD;
      headache guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention and visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The visits will be carried out in the Headache Units of the participating centers. At the&#xD;
      baseline visit, investigators will review that patients meet all inclusion criteria and none&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. In accordance with the Good Clinical Practice guidelines12, a clear&#xD;
      explanation will be given of the objective of the study, the role of the participant and the&#xD;
      complete absence of risks that the study pose, due to the observational nature. The&#xD;
      participant will be provided with a contact telephone number where he or she can contact in&#xD;
      the event of an incident that want to refer to the investigators. The informed consent will&#xD;
      be signed and a copy given to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the initial visit, the monthly headache days at baseline will be gathered, including&#xD;
      the number of days of intense pain, the number of days of taking symptomatic medication, the&#xD;
      number of days of taking triptans and the number of visits to the emergency department. A&#xD;
      number of demographic and clinical variables (described below) will be reviewed. The patient&#xD;
      will be asked to make a prospective record of his or her days of headache as well as the&#xD;
      intensity of headache and the use of medication in a standardized diary (appendix) for&#xD;
      thirty-six weeks. The presence of possible adverse effects will be detailed. The patient will&#xD;
      be evaluated and both basal blood pressure and heart rate will be measured. Headache Impact&#xD;
      Test (HIT-6) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Allodynia Symptom Checklist&#xD;
      (ASC-12) scales will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of candesartan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive candesartan in the same manner and intensity as if they would not&#xD;
      be enrolled in the study, according to the Spanish national guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow up visit will be done at week 12 to analyze response to candesartan and the&#xD;
      possibility of adverse effects. Physicians will modify candesartan dose according to their&#xD;
      criteria and the local guidelines. Treatment response will be analyzed during the third&#xD;
      visit, at week 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sex, current age, age of onset, type of migraine (episodic/chronic), months of evolution of&#xD;
      chronic migraine, weight, height, overweight (determined according to the CUN-BAE scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presence of aura, bilateral or unilateral predominance, headache intensity (0-10 verbal&#xD;
      analogue scale), presence of allodynia (ASC-12 scale), prior history of psychiatric&#xD;
      comorbidity (anxiety, depression), impact of headache (HIT-6 scale score).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Headache days per month, intense headache days per month, emergency department visits per&#xD;
      month, medication days per month, triptan days per month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous preventive drugs: drug, maximum dose, time of use, presence of adverse effects,&#xD;
      response rate (0-30, 30-50, 50-75 or 75-100%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure (mmHg), heart rate (beats per minute).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dizziness, tiredness, reduced physical capacity, nausea, constipation, sleep disturbance,&#xD;
      sexual dysfunction and paresthesias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of adverse effects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will spontaneously report the presence of an adverse effect and will also be&#xD;
      asked through a structured questionnaire during each visit (appendix). The severity of the&#xD;
      adverse effect and the relationship with the study drug with the drug will be detailed and&#xD;
      described by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will use a prospective monthly calendar that will facilitate a correct recording&#xD;
      of the characteristics of the headache, including frequency, intensity, need of symptomatic&#xD;
      drugs and presence of any adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each visit, presence of adverse effects such as pain, sensation of contracture or&#xD;
      discomfort will be systematically evaluated. Spontaneous reporting of adverse effects will be&#xD;
      allowed and also direct questions will be asked.&#xD;

&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For calculation of sample size we used the combined data from both studies, in which, through&#xD;
      analysis by intention to treat, the 50% response rate in the group treated with candesartan&#xD;
      was 18/57 and 24/66, for a combined response rate of 42/123=34.1%. In the placebo group the&#xD;
      50% response rate in the placebo group was 1/57 and 14/64, for a combined ratio of&#xD;
      15/121=12.4%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open, not controlled with placebo study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no stratification of patients. Regression analysis will be performed to&#xD;
      evaluate factors associated with better response or worse tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An anonymous database will be created in which the identity of the patient will be&#xD;
      dissociated from the rest of the data. SPSS statistics package will be used for statistical&#xD;
      analysis. Analyses will be performed both by intention to treat and per protocol, the primary&#xD;
      objective being determined by intention to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main variable will be calculated by evaluating percentage of patients in whom the number&#xD;
      of headache days per month, evaluated between weeks 20-24, is at least 50% lower than the&#xD;
      number of headache days per month in the baseline period, before the use of candesartan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Logistic regression analysis and linear regression will be performed depending on the type of&#xD;
      variable and those associated variables with a value of p&lt;0.05 will be selected. In addition,&#xD;
      a multivariate regression analysis will be carried out in which all variables with a p&lt;0.015&#xD;
      will be included and a second analysis will be carried out in which the number of days of&#xD;
      reduction with respect to the baseline situation between weeks 20 and 24 will be used as a&#xD;
      variant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Factors associated with the presence of adverse effects will be analyzed by logistic or&#xD;
      linear regression analysis. 30%, 75% and 100% response rate analysis will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the reduction in days of pain, the mean number of days of pain between weeks&#xD;
      20-24 and the baseline period will be compared. It will be evaluated if the distribution is&#xD;
      normal using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and if appropriate, the Student t test will be&#xD;
      performed for paired samples; using the Mann-Whitney U test in case the distribution is not&#xD;
      normal. The analysis will be repeated for the period between weeks 8-12 and weeks 32-36. The&#xD;
      same analysis will also be done to determine the change in the average number of days of&#xD;
      severe pain and days of use of symptomatic medication. The mean score on the HIT-6 and HADS&#xD;
      scales over the same periods and the change in heart rate and blood pressure will also be&#xD;
      compared. The Bonferroni method will be used to correct for multiple comparisons. In the&#xD;
      comparison of qualitative variables, the Chi-square test or the exact Fisher test in&#xD;
      non-parametric variables will be used. An intermediate analysis will be carried out when 50%&#xD;
      of the patients have been recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of lost data will be done by imputation in a worse-case scenario. Missing days&#xD;
      will be considered days with pain and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical and legal aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be exposed to the possibility of participating in the study and if&#xD;
      they accept, they will be explained in detail the objective, the procedure and what their&#xD;
      participation consists of. If they accept, they must sign an informed consent12. In the event&#xD;
      of refusing participation or revoking consent, patients may continue their usual treatment&#xD;
      and care process without any modification or conditions. They will be free to refuse to&#xD;
      participate in the study or to suspend their collaboration whenever they wish, with no impact&#xD;
      on their future medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An anonymized database will be created and stored in the hospital of the principal&#xD;
      investigator with the list of participants and personal data dissociated and separated from&#xD;
      it.&#xD;
