      The aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of a newly developed intervention to&#xD;
      improve family support for patient with acquired brain injury (ABI) in early phase of&#xD;
      hospitalization (SAFIR): the main components are the assessment of the family, the emotional&#xD;
      support for the families, the information giving to the families, the inclusion of the&#xD;
      families in the care process and the care coordination between the inter professional team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcomes of the study are feasibility and acceptability outcomes of the newly&#xD;
      developed intervention, and trend in efficacy in the family functioning, coping and perceived&#xD;
      support from the nurses.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine the feasibility of a newly developed intervention called&#xD;
      SAFIR© to support families of Acquired Brain Injuries (ABI) patients, from the early phase&#xD;
      (acute phase) of hospitalization. It will be conducted in the Department of Clinical&#xD;
      Neurosciences (DNC) of Lausanne University Hospital. According to the study design, there&#xD;
      will be no control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention process engages all stakeholders, but is led by the trained clinical nurse&#xD;
      specialist (CNS) of the care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening for recruitment by the head nurse or the CNS will start from day 1 of patients'&#xD;
      hospitalization at DNC. The CNS will meet the screened patients and their family with the&#xD;
      medical team. This first contact will allow the CNS to introduce him/herself, to explain&#xD;
      his/her role, to give all relevant information and forms, and to schedule a second&#xD;
      appointment after 24 hours of reflection. In particular, he/she will explain to each&#xD;
      participant the nature of the study, its purpose, the procedures involved, the expected&#xD;
      duration, the potential risks and benefits and any discomfort it may entail. Information and&#xD;
      Consent Forms will be provided to patients when relevant, or its Legal Representative, as&#xD;
      well as to potential participants among family members. Each participant will be informed&#xD;
      that the participation in the study is voluntary, he or she may withdraw from the study at&#xD;
      any time, and withdrawal of consent without affecting the patient's subsequent medical care&#xD;
      and treatment. A 24-hour reflection period for consent will be offered to the potential&#xD;
      participants. The consent form will be signed and dated by the investigator or his designee&#xD;
      at the same time as the participant sign. A copy of the signed informed consent will be given&#xD;
      to the study participant. An &quot;Independent physician consent form&quot; will also be signed by the&#xD;
      medical doctor in charge of the patient The consent form will be retained as part of the&#xD;
      study records, as well as the &quot;Independent physician consent form&quot;. The informed consent&#xD;
      process will be documented in the research files and any discrepancy to the process described&#xD;
      in the protocol will be explained, if necessary. Overall, the study will be conducted in&#xD;
      compliance with the protocol, the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant agrees to take part in the study (D0), the intervention will start. The&#xD;
      intervention is organized in three main phases at day 3, day 5 and day 10, with a follow-up&#xD;
      at day 30. Each phase include a preparation with the inter professional team for family&#xD;
      interview, a structured family interview lead by CNS, and a feed-back with the inter&#xD;
      professional team. Measures related to the ability to carry out the intervention&#xD;
      (acceptability and integration of the intervention to the nursing care), the fidelity to the&#xD;
      protocol, the recruitment and the retention will be collected throughout the process. At&#xD;
      baseline, data collection will include socio-demographics data on the participants,&#xD;
      Iceland-Expressive Family Functioning Questionnaire, Iceland-Family Perceived Support&#xD;
      Questionnaire and Brief-Cope Questionnaire measures. These measures will be repeated at D10&#xD;
      and D30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both Investigator and Sponsor-Investigator will make a severity assessment of all adverse&#xD;
      events as mild, moderate or severe. Mild means the complication is tolerable, moderate means&#xD;
      it interferes with daily activities and severe means it renders daily activities impossible.&#xD;
      All serious adverse event (SAE) will be documented and reported immediately (within a maximum&#xD;
      of 24 hours) to the Sponsor-Investigator of the study. If it cannot be excluded that the SAE&#xD;
      is attributable to the intervention under investigation, the Investigator will report it to&#xD;
      the Ethics Committee within 15 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An annual safety report will be submitted to the local Ethics Committee by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount and reasons for missing data would be gathered, summarized and analyzed in order&#xD;
      to understand which part of data collection is not feasible again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No imputation procedures will be applied to handle missing data due to design of the study.&#xD;
      As far as possible, incomplete data will be included into analyses to avoid bias. The methods&#xD;
      that will be applied to the quantitative analyses can cope with incomplete data. Data of&#xD;
      those participants who are unwilling to continue the program once started will still be&#xD;
      included the analysis in order to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the&#xD;
      intervention. Nevertheless if patient recover and can give his/her consent a posteriori, it&#xD;
      will be possible until the end of the study: if the patient refuse to consent, his/her data&#xD;
      will not be used but all data of his/her family members that consent to participate will be&#xD;
      kept and the intervention will go on for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As it is a feasibility study, no criteria for withdrawal will be applicable in the study,&#xD;
      except if participant would like to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analyses will be performed. The qualitative data will be analyzed using Maxqda&#xD;
      software following a methodology for thematic analysis. Comparisons of quantitative data&#xD;
      between baseline (D0) and after the intervention (D10 and D30) will be assessed by means of&#xD;
      generalized linear mixed regression models, using STATA Release 15. Such models deal with the&#xD;
      non-independence of data repeatedly measured on the same subjects and allow the use of&#xD;
      incomplete data. This model will also take into account the non-independence of family&#xD;
      members within a family (three level models: time repeated within family members and family&#xD;
      members clustered within family). Time will be treated as the fixed part of the model,&#xD;
      whereas the families and family members will represent the random parts (hence the name mixed&#xD;
      model). The effect of time will assessed by two regression coefficients representing the mean&#xD;
      change in the dependent variables from D0 to D10 and from D0 to D30. A calculation of the&#xD;
      size of effect of the intervention will be performed in order to measure the magnitude of the&#xD;
      intervention. A Cohen d will be calculated considering &gt;0.5 as a moderate effect size.&#xD;
      Process factors variables will be analyzed using descriptive tests. As it is a feasibility&#xD;
      study no sample size calculation is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substantial changes to the study setup and study organization, the protocol and relevant&#xD;
      study documents will be submitted to the Ethics Committee for approval before implementation.&#xD;
      Under emergency circumstances, deviations from the protocol to protect the rights, safety and&#xD;
      well-being of human subjects may proceed without prior approval of the Ethics Committee. Such&#xD;
      deviations shall be documented and reported to the Ethics Committee as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sponsor-Investigator may terminate the study prematurely according to certain&#xD;
      circumstances, Upon regular study termination, the Ethics Committee will be notified within&#xD;
      90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon premature study termination or study interruption, the Ethics Committee will be notified&#xD;
      within 15 days. In the event of study-related damage or injuries, the liability of the&#xD;
      institution Institute for Higher Education and Healthcare provides compensation, except for&#xD;
      claims that arise from misconduct or gross negligence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits from participating in the study have not been demonstrated, however it is more&#xD;
      likely that family members may benefit from having additional support. Nevertheless, it is&#xD;
      not excluded that some family members may experience negative thoughts during the study; the&#xD;
      participants will, therefore, be informed they can get support other than the one provided if&#xD;
      required. This will be documented as it is an important information of this feasibility&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For quality assurance the sponsor, the Ethics Committee or an independent trial monitor may&#xD;
      visit the research sites. Direct access to the source data and all study related files is&#xD;
      granted on such occasions. A trained trial monitoring person will verify collected data&#xD;
      accuracy, completeness, and traceability. All involved parties keep the participant data&#xD;
      strictly confidential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be coded following Swiss ethics recommendation: year of birth + ... (3 letters of&#xD;
      code) for code identification. Original data of forms and questionnaires will be kept locked&#xD;
      in a secure location specifically dedicated to study records . Interviews will be recorded&#xD;
      and protected by a password to which only the research team will have access to. Data will be&#xD;
      collected and recorded on REDCAP©.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial and participant data will be handled with uttermost discretion and is only accessible&#xD;
      to authorized personnel who require the data to fulfill their duties within the scope of the&#xD;
      study. On the Case Report Forms (CRF) and other study specific documents, participants are&#xD;
      only identified by a unique participant number. The co-investigator stores the participants&#xD;
      identification list on a locked place as well as the numeric data will be protected by a&#xD;
      password.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study data will be archived for 10 years after study termination or premature termination&#xD;
      of the study. All study data will be archived and locked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be available for monitors and questions will be answered as well, in any time. Data&#xD;
      monitoring will be conducted following the standard guideline This will guarantee the&#xD;
      protection of the participant's safety, their rights, integrity and confidentiality and data&#xD;
      quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be registered in French in the Swiss National Clinical trial Portal (SNCTP via&#xD;
      BASEC) in addition of being registered on Clinicaltrial.gov No conflict of interest is&#xD;
      declared.&#xD;
