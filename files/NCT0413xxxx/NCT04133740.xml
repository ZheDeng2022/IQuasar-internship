    <textblock>
      During surgery high concentrations of supplementary oxygen are routinely administrated.&#xD;
      However, there is increasing evidence of potential harm with liberal oxygen therapy. The&#xD;
      hypothesis of the present study is that oxygen therapy adjusted to a normal arterial oxygen&#xD;
      target is feasible and will attenuate the side effects of supplementary oxygen therapy. The&#xD;
      study design is a before-and-after study in which 25 patients will follow the standard regime&#xD;
      with high concentrations of oxygen therapy and 25 patients will be treated with oxygen to&#xD;
      achieve a normal value of arterial oxygenation.&#xD;

      Background Oxygen is essential to life and supplementary oxygen therapy is routinely&#xD;
      administrated during surgery to avoid life-threatening hypoxemia. Supplementary oxygen&#xD;
      therapy is often given as a high and fixed fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ranging from&#xD;
      0.60 to 1.00. As a consequence, the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) often exceeds&#xD;
      normal levels. There is increasing evidence of potential harm with liberal administrated&#xD;
      oxygen therapy. Therefore, the standard regimes for oxygen therapy during surgery have to be&#xD;
      further investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether a regime for oxygen therapy targeting normal&#xD;
      levels of PaO2 during elective cardiac surgery with use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and&#xD;
      in the first postoperative day in the intensive care unit (ICU) is feasible. Additionally,&#xD;
      metabolic changes in exhaled breath condensate and in arterial blood collected prior to&#xD;
      surgery, before and after CPB, the first postoperative day in the ICU and the third&#xD;
      postoperative day at the surgical ward will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design The study design is a before-and-after study in patients scheduled for elective&#xD;
      cardiac surgery being coronary artery bypass grafting or valve replacement or a combination&#xD;
      of both. The first 25 patients will follow our institutional the standard regime for&#xD;
      supplementary oxygen therapy; i.e. a minimum FiO2 of 0.60 during mechanical ventilation and&#xD;
      at least 3 liters oxygen per minute after weaning from the ventilator in the ICU. Thereafter,&#xD;
      another 25 patients will receive supplementary oxygen therapy to achieve a normal PaO2&#xD;
      defined as 10-12 kPa (75-120 mmHg) during surgery and in the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exhaled breath condensates will be collected via a mouthpiece during spontaneous breathing&#xD;
      prior to surgery, first and third postoperative day while the condensates will be collected&#xD;
      via the tracheal tube during mechanical ventilation. Arterial blood samples will be collected&#xD;
      simultaneously. Exhaled breath condensates and serum samples will be divided into aliquots&#xD;
      and stored in a -80 degree Celsius freezer until final analyses after all patients have been&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic changes in exhaled breath condensates and in serum samples will be analyzed using&#xD;
      nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS). The spectra's will&#xD;
      give a snapshot of all metabolites in a given sample and elucidate changes in the metabolic&#xD;
      profiles in response to oxygen exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The hypothesis is that oxygenation targeting is feasible and that changing the&#xD;
      supplementary oxygen therapy to a oxygenation targeting within the normal range will reduce&#xD;
      the FiO2 and thus the PaO2/FiO2 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes Primary outcome is the PaO2/FiO2 ratio on the third postoperative day. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will be changes in metabolic profiles in exhaled breath condensates and serum&#xD;
      samples, changes in oxygenation parameters, PaO2 and oxygen saturation, changes in time to&#xD;
      weaning from the ventilator in the ICU, changes in FiO2 and in supplementary oxygen therapy&#xD;
      after weaning from the ventilator, and changes in postoperative complications defined as&#xD;
      pneumonia, arrhythmias, re-operation, and re-admission to the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses This is a pilot study being a feasibility before-and-after study. Based&#xD;
      on institutional data a power calculation is performed estimating an increase in the&#xD;
      PaO2/FiO2 ratio from 30 ± 7 kPa with the standard regime for oxygen therapy to 36 ± 7 kPa&#xD;
      with a oxygenation targeting approach and with an alpha of 0,05 and a power of 80% (1-beta),&#xD;
      23 patients are needed in each group. To cover to dropouts at total of 50 patients, 25&#xD;
      patients in each group, will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be assessed for normality. Continuous normally distributed variables will be&#xD;
      compared using Student t tests and reported as mean and standard deviation, while&#xD;
      non-normally distributed data will be compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and reported as&#xD;
      median and interquartile range. All analyses will be performed by using Stata (Metrika&#xD;
      Consulting AB, Stockholm, Sweden), Matlab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The composition of metabolomics will be compared by multivariable analysis. For multivariate&#xD;
      analysis, various unsupervised and supervised analyses will be carried out in Matlab (The&#xD;
      MathWorks Inc., Natick, United States) and Python (Python Software Foundation, Delaware,&#xD;
      United States) software with in-house scripts. Principal component analysis will be used to&#xD;
      obtain a preliminary outlook of the data, to screen for outliers and detect clusters.&#xD;
      Eventually, partial least squares discriminant (PLS-DA) analyses coupled to different vv rs&#xD;
      selections algorithms will be employed to perform data reduction and classification of&#xD;
      treatments. For validation purposes, the Venetian-Blinds cross-validation approach will be&#xD;
      applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics Patients will be included after an informed signed content is obtained. FiO2 of 0.60&#xD;
      is given routinely to patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB at Aalborg University&#xD;
      Hospital. Targeting a physiological PaO2 level between 10 and 12 kPa is considered to be&#xD;
      safe. Patients undergoing cardiac surgery is routinely maximal monitored during surgery and&#xD;
      in the ICU. The cardiac anaesthetist in charge can charge the PaO2 target at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collection of exhaled breath condensate is painless and without any discomfort for the&#xD;
      patient. The arterial blood sample on the third postoperative day will be performed by a&#xD;
      cardiac anaesthetist experienced in this procedure, who will apply a subcutaneous analgesia&#xD;
      with Lidocain 1% prior to the puncture and thus avoiding pain during the procedure.&#xD;
      Thereafter, a manual compression will be performed for 2 minutes to minimise the risk of a&#xD;
      haematoma. In total, four extra blood samples are collected for the metabonomics and one&#xD;
      extra blood gas analyses. The total amount of blood extracted in the study is 12.5 mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All other procedures and treatments follow the standard regimes.&#xD;
