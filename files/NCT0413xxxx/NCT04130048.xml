  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous Thrombo-Embolic Disease (VTED) is a serious and common ailment, defined by the growth&#xD;
      of a clot - or thrombus - in a vein, and/or as the migration of this thrombus to a pulmonary&#xD;
      artery. It represents the third cause of death after cardio-vascular disease and cancer, and&#xD;
      encompass superficial, muscular and Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT), and Pulmonary Embolisms&#xD;
      (PE), which can be isolated or associated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound is today the most frequently used exam to diagnose DVT. However, it's unable to&#xD;
      provide information on thrombus age or cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elastography is an imaging technic which aims to analyse elastic properties of a tissue, by&#xD;
      applying a mechanical impulse on it, and could be an interesting tool in thrombus&#xD;
      exploration, and provide additional information.&#xD;

      Proximal deep venous thrombosis of a lower limb was defined as any venous thrombosis&#xD;
      involving the ilio-femoral and/or femoro-popliteal axes, with or without cava thrombosis or&#xD;
      distal DVT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A DVT was assumed provoked, as recommended by AFSSAPS (2009) and ACCP (2012), when there was&#xD;
      a major transient risk factor (surgery, prolonged immobilization â‰¥3 days, lower limb&#xD;
      fracture) in the last three months, or a persistent risk factor (Antiphospholipid syndrome,&#xD;
      active cancer). In case of absence of at least one of these factors, DVT was considered&#xD;
      unprovoked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A DVT was supposed recent when there was no known DVT in the patient medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association with a Pulmonary Embolism was assessed by the presence of PE diagnosis in the&#xD;
      medical report. It had to be diagnosed following the ESC guidelines, with a thoracic CT scan&#xD;
      and/or a V/Q lung scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we analysed the shear wave's velocity (expressed in m/s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acquisitions were obtained during the venous ultrasound realised for the diagnosis of DVT.&#xD;
      All measures were made on the same ultrasonic device, with the ShearWave module.&#xD;
