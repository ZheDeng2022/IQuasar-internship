  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, risk-stratified, sequential treatment, phase 2 study of newly&#xD;
      diagnosed post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders with positive CD20 and CD30&#xD;
      expression. It includes an induction phase with rituximab and brentuximab vedotin (RBv),&#xD;
      followed by a treatment phase with RBv or RBv in combination with bendamustine (RBvB) based&#xD;
      on response to induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point is treatment efficacy measured as the overall response rate (ORR) and&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorders (PTLD) are defined by the revised 2017 edition&#xD;
      of the WHO Classification of Tumours of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues as &quot;lymphoid or&#xD;
      plasmacytic proliferations that develop as a consequence of immunosuppression in a recipient&#xD;
      of a solid organ, bone marrow or stem cell allograft&quot;. Within this definition 4 distinct&#xD;
      categories exist, including: (1) Non-destructive PTLDs (plasmacytic hyperplasia, infectious&#xD;
      mononucleosis, and florid follicular hyperplasia) (2) Polymorphic PTLD; (3) Monomorphic PTLD&#xD;
      and (4) Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma type PTLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of PTLD varies between different transplanted organs. Across all transplants&#xD;
      monomorphic PTLD is the most common accounting for 75% of all cases. Lymphoma derived of B-&#xD;
      cell origin account for the majority of cases (70%), while T-cell neoplasms represent a small&#xD;
      minority (5%). Within monomorphic PTLD 50% of cases demonstrate association with the Epstein&#xD;
      Barr Virus (EBV). Polymorphic PTLD accounts for 15-20% of all PTLD cases with the majority&#xD;
      demonstrating EBV involvement. Early lesions account for 5% of PTLD and are all uniformly&#xD;
      associated with EBV as are all the cases of Classic Hodgkin Lymphoma type PTLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current understanding of the pathogenesis of PTLD is incomplete. Despite concerted&#xD;
      efforts, the investigators are unable to predict who will develop PTLD and do not understand&#xD;
      why only 1 - 2% of all transplant recipients develop these disorders.&#xD;
