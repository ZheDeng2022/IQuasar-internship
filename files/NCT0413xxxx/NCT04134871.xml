  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who have a severe mental illness can have poorer physical health and higher mortality&#xD;
      rates than the general population. Their medications combined with low levels of physical&#xD;
      activity and increased sedentary behaviour can general population and may help people with&#xD;
      severe mental illness to be more active.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous feasibility study has been conducted in the UK in a large city with positive&#xD;
      findings. The current study will be conducted in rural settings in Northern Ireland and&#xD;
      Republic of Ireland. The intervention will last 13 weeks. People with Severe Mental Illness&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned into one of two groups. Both groups will get information on the&#xD;
      benefits of physical activity. In addition, one group will be shown how to use a step counter&#xD;
      to measure their steps, be invited to a weekly group walk, and meet their coach every 2 weeks&#xD;
      contribute to this. Walking is a good way to increase physical activity in the to see how&#xD;
      they are getting on and to support them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team are interested in finding out how willing clinicians are to recruit people&#xD;
      into the study, how willing people are to take part, do people then stick with the programme,&#xD;
      and if not the reasons for people dropping out. Qualitative findings will explore whether&#xD;
      participants feel they benefited from and enjoyed the programme. Findings will be used to&#xD;
      investigate the feasibility to conduct a larger trial like this in the future.&#xD;
