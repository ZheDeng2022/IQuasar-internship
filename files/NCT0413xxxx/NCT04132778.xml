      Asthma self-management is dependent on support and education. To facilitate self-management&#xD;
      have we developed and CE-mark a novel digital self-management system called Asthmatuner&#xD;
      (Medituner AB, Sweden).The primary aim of this program is to evaluate if self-management with&#xD;
      Asthmatuner improves asthma control more than traditional self-management. RCT with two arms,&#xD;
      Asthmatuner or traditional asthma management, during at least 6 months. Thereafter, the study&#xD;
      continues to be observational from 6- 12 months. Eligible patients with doctor's diagnosed&#xD;
      asthma that are managed within the municipality of Tiohundra and Astrid Lindgren Children's&#xD;
      Hospital will be invited to participate. Approximately 800 patients, adults and&#xD;
      schoolchildren of the age of 6 years will be recruited.Outcomes: Asthma Control Test, number&#xD;
      of exacerbations, unplanned healthcare visits, Medicine Adherence Report Scale and lung&#xD;
      function.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ultimate goal for all patients is to achieve asthma control. There are various tools for&#xD;
      evaluating a patient's asthma control, one is to use validated questionnaires e.g. Asthma&#xD;
      Control Test (ACT) (1), another is to evaluate symptoms in patient history based on&#xD;
      recommended characteristics from the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) (2). These&#xD;
      characteristics emphasize optimal asthma control as no symptoms, undisturbed sleep, no severe&#xD;
      exacerbations, no emergency visits, normal lung function and no limitations in daily&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The characteristics defining asthma control according to GINA guidelines are widely used as&#xD;
      the golden standard for both clinical research and for asthma care (3, 4). Based on a&#xD;
      patient's number of characteristics, GINA classifies asthma as controlled, partly controlled&#xD;
      or uncontrolled (5). The GINA guidelines include two domains for assessment, the first is the&#xD;
      evaluation of symptoms and the second is physicianÂ´s evaluation of patient's future risk for&#xD;
      exacerbations. Indicators of increased health cost of asthma like e.g. health care&#xD;
      utilization, medication and lost school/work days are associated with uncontrolled asthma&#xD;
      (6). In addition, studies have shown that patients with lower socio-economic status are&#xD;
      associated with more impaired asthma control (7-9), and further attention is needed to assist&#xD;
      patients with impaired asthma control through new approaches and better management&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poor adherence to asthma management and simple practical tools for diagnosing asthma can lead&#xD;
      to under- and over-diagnosis of asthma in primary health care (10, 11). In most cases,&#xD;
      including in the EU, asthma patients visit their doctors less than once a year, giving&#xD;
      healthcare providers only a snapshot of the patient's condition (12, 13). New approaches are&#xD;
      needed to improve adherence in asthma care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient education in self-management using self-monitoring of lung function and symptoms,&#xD;
      coupled with adjustable treatment plan appear to be effective compared with other forms of&#xD;
      asthma self-management according to a Cochrane review (14). National asthma programmes&#xD;
      focusing on management and improving asthma care has proved to reduce the morbidity of asthma&#xD;
      and its impact on individuals as well as on the society (15). Patient education in&#xD;
      self-management improves health and the quality of life for people with asthma, as well as&#xD;
      reducing health care costs (14). However, in spite of this convincing evidence on how to&#xD;
      treat and manage asthma, there is worldwide significant discrepancy between real life&#xD;
      practice and guidelines of asthma management (16, 17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical decision support systems for self-management Significant worldwide discrepancy&#xD;
      exists between real life asthma practice and guidelines of management (16, 17).&#xD;
      Self-management based on self-monitoring of lung function and symptoms, coupled with&#xD;
      adjustable treatment plan appear to be effective compared with other forms of asthma&#xD;
      self-management according to a Cochrane review (14). Furthermore, electronic medical records&#xD;
      are largely implemented in asthma care, and it is feasible to enable health care providers to&#xD;
      monitor and support patient's self-management with computer decision support systems (CDSS).&#xD;
      Therefore, we target to improve incomplete asthma management by develop and CE-mark the novel&#xD;
      digital self-management system Asthmatuner (Medituner AB, Sweden). The system consists of a&#xD;
      patient smartphone application and a portable wireless spirometer for measuring lung&#xD;
      function, and a healthcare provider user interface to prescribe treatment plan and assess&#xD;
      patient data. The app provides patients with a daily treatment recommendation linked to&#xD;
      patient's current status of asthma (controlled, partly- or uncontrolled asthma) (2). Recently&#xD;
      in 2018, Asthmatuner significantly reduced asthma symptoms in children and adolescents&#xD;
      compared to traditional management in a randomised controlled cross-over trial (18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevention of exacerbations and symptoms is major health care challenge. Combining data from&#xD;
      a variety of sources, including risk factors and real-time biological and environmental data&#xD;
      has the potential to improve the prediction of asthma attacks in individuals. Quantifying&#xD;
      time-serial measures of lung function contain unexpected amounts of information that can be&#xD;
      linked to occurrence of symptoms and exacerbations (19). Thus, our hypothesis is that&#xD;
      Asthmatuner constitutes a unique data source that offers identification of longitudinal&#xD;
      fluctuating patterns of lung function that can be used to develop algorithms capable of&#xD;
      predicting airway obstruction and generating early individual-specific action plan.&#xD;
      Individual action plan could contain phenotype specific information about step-up treatment,&#xD;
      reminders on how to use and inhaler medication and avoiding specific factors that may trigger&#xD;
      or worsen asthma symptoms, as well as contact details for healthcare providers (20). In&#xD;
      addition, Asthmatuner has the potential to strengthen quality in primary health care at&#xD;
      reduced cost (21), by identify patients with poor asthma control and therefore most needed&#xD;
      for clinical follow-up or video online visit. Therefore, the municipality of Tiohundra (22),&#xD;
      with a population of more 56000 people, has decided to assess the effect and benefit of using&#xD;
      Asthmatuner in a randomised controlled trial (RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this program is to evaluate if self-management with Asthmatuner improves&#xD;
      asthma control more than traditional self-management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate if Asthmatuner can reduce the number of planned or unplanned health care visits&#xD;
           compared with traditional asthma care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate if Asthmatuner improves adherence to intake of control medication and&#xD;
           health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) more than traditional traditional asthma care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess if Asthmatuner can reduced the number of exacerbations and missed work/school&#xD;
           days due to asthma compared with traditional asthma care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterise specific phenotypes based on biodata and time-serial measurements of lung&#xD;
           function in relation to occurrence of symptoms and exacerbation in patients using&#xD;
           Asthmatuner. The goal is to develop mathematical algorithms generating action plan for&#xD;
           prevention of exacerbation. Moreover, the data collected with Asthmatuner and the daily&#xD;
           treatment recommendations generated with this system will be used to train a deep&#xD;
           (artificial) neural network towards an optimization of the ACT scores (i.e., the level&#xD;
           of asthma control) attained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform a qualitative study with the third and final aim to explore patients' and&#xD;
           caregivers' experience of using Asthmatuner&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODS Design RCT with two arms, Asthmatuner or traditional asthma management,&#xD;
      during at least 6 months. Thereafter, the study continues to be observational from 6- 12&#xD;
      months, offering all willing participants to use Asthmatuner. In addition, a complementary&#xD;
      qualitative study of patients' and caregivers' experiences of the introduction and use of&#xD;
      Asthmatuner and its impact on work processes and communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes at baseline, 3- and 6 months study period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mean score validated Asthma Control Test (ACT) Secondary outcomes by 6 months study&#xD;
           period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids or health care utilisation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unplanned health care visits due to asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mean score of Mini-Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (Mini-AQLQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mean score of Medicine Adherence Report Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluctuation in time-serial measurements (forced expiratory volume in one second FEV1&#xD;
           (L)) with use of Asthmatuner, linked to information about exacerbations and daily or&#xD;
           nocturnal symptoms or treatment with bronchodilator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cost benefit with Asthmatuner compared with traditional health care visits based on&#xD;
           costs for planned/unplanned visits, exacerbations, and effect on ACT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient and caregiver satisfaction with Asthmatuner. using survey and interviews after&#xD;
           completed study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative study will focus on patients' experiences (eg patient satisfaction,&#xD;
      empowerment, communication with healthcare professionals and perceived quality of care) as&#xD;
      well as the caregivers' experiences (eg work processes, perceived stress, impact on&#xD;
      communication and perceived quality of care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Primary care Eligible patients with doctor's diagnosed asthma that are managed at&#xD;
      any health care centre within the municipality of Tiohundra will be invited to participate.&#xD;
      Approximately 400 patients, adults and schoolchildren of the age of 6 years will be included.&#xD;
      Subjects with untreated or treated comorbidity with major effect on the state of asthma will&#xD;
      not be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paediatric cohort The study population will be extended to 400 schoolchildren with asthma to&#xD;
      ensuring sufficient number of participants and time-serial measurements of lung function.&#xD;
      Children and adolescents 6-18 years, at Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital in Stockholm&#xD;
      (Karolinska University Hospital) will be invited to attend during the year 2019-2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size The sample size for the trial will be estimated based on our pilot study showing&#xD;
      that Asthmatuner improves asthma control with 3.72 ACT points compared to traditional&#xD;
      management 2.35 points (mean standard deviation 3.45). Assuming a dropout rate up to 10%,&#xD;
      including 200 eligible subjects for Asthmatuner and equal number in the control group would&#xD;
      be clinical relevant, worthwhile and feasible to attain 80% power at 5% significant level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention - Asthmatuner Patients download the app from AppStore or Google Play and create&#xD;
      a user account. The healthcare provider must also have access to patients' Asthmatuner&#xD;
      accounts so the doctor or asthma nurse can ensure the treatment plan is up to date. The&#xD;
      patient will then be able to see the treatment plan and which inhaler they should use&#xD;
      displayed on the screen of the smartphone. The smartphone application has been designed to&#xD;
      minimize the time needed to generate an individual treatment recommendation. Once the user&#xD;
      profile has been created, the wireless spirometer is paired with the smartphone and the&#xD;
      physician creates and uploads a treatment plan based on an automated recommendation, which is&#xD;
      generated in seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The user interface is intuitively structured into four sections: 1) Lung function, 2)&#xD;
      Symptoms, 3) Treatment, and 4) Trends view.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To get an up-to-date treatment recommendation the patient follows the instructions on the&#xD;
      screen under the Lung function section to generate an FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume) value&#xD;
      using the connected spirometer from MIR (Medical International Research, Italy). The&#xD;
      interface shows if the value was correctly generated and how it relates to patient's personal&#xD;
      best value. Four symptom questions - in accordance with the GINA - are presented and the&#xD;
      patient answers yes or no. Once the symptom questions have been saved, the patient is&#xD;
      automatically transferred to the &quot;treatment section&quot; where the current treatment&#xD;
      recommendation is presented based on lung function and symptoms. The trend feature shows the&#xD;
      patient/provider a historical overview of lung function, symptoms and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group - Traditional asthma management Traditional self-management is defined as all&#xD;
      other types of non-digital asthma management. This could be treatment plan written on paper&#xD;
      or by oral communication to patient/caregiver on asthma treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registers Complementary information about unplanned visits and health care utilisation both&#xD;
      in-patient care and out-patient care in Sweden will be collected from the medical record Take&#xD;
      Care or the National Quality Register for Asthma and COPD &quot;LuftvÃ¤gsregistret&quot;. The study will&#xD;
      be registered at ClinicalTrials.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma control test Asthma symptoms during the last 4 weeks will be assessed using Childhood&#xD;
      asthma control test (C-ACT) in children 6-11 years and ACT patients aged &gt; 12 years. The&#xD;
      questionnaire is validated and regular used in clinical practice (23). Well-controlled asthma&#xD;
      is defined as score &gt; 20 points and uncontrolled asthma score of &lt; 19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health survey Health survey including socio-demographics, medical history about asthma,&#xD;
      comorbidities and symptoms, as well as ACT will be filled out by patient/caregiver at&#xD;
      inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic questionnaires Questionnaires will be sent out electronically by use of KI-survey,&#xD;
      collecting information on ACT, symptoms, exacerbations, unplanned health care&#xD;
      visits/consultations due asthma, loss of work and school days due to asthma at 3 and 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) HR-QoL will be applied at baseline, 3- and 6 months&#xD;
      using the validated Swedish translated the Mini-AQLQ in patients from 12 years of age (24).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MARS questionnaire Self-reported medication adherence will be measured with validated&#xD;
      five-item MARS, developed to assess adherence with asthma medication (25). The MARS comprises&#xD;
      statements about medication use behaviors. The patient is asked to answer each behavior with&#xD;
      a score between 1-5 based on of following alternatives; &quot;always&quot;, &quot;often&quot;, &quot;sometimes&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;rarely&quot; or &quot;never&quot;. A mean MARS score will then be calculated, and a score of 4.5 or greater&#xD;
      indicates good adherence (25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung function testing Lung function will be measured at each study visit, analysing FEV1,&#xD;
      forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC and forced expiratory flow after 25-75% of vital&#xD;
      capacity (FEF25-75). At visit 1 is a reversibility test performed after intake short-acting&#xD;
      beta-2 agonist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits Frequency of follow-up visits and management are recommended according to&#xD;
      Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare, Table 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Statistical analysis will be carried out analysing proportion of&#xD;
      subjects maintaining asthma control or improving their asthma control according to ACT and&#xD;
      GINA between management groups, as well as the numeric change in ACT scores from baseline to&#xD;
      study end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of computational methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fluctuation-based clustering (FBC) method consists of identifying clusters of patients&#xD;
      with similar patterns of lung function fluctuation by comparing each patient's empirical&#xD;
      distribution of daily lung function measurements recorded over a predetermined window of&#xD;
      observation. The FBC method has been described in detail elsewhere (26). In brief, this&#xD;
      approach consists of the following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quantification of similarity in lung function fluctuation between individuals; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Grouping of individuals into clusters such that similarity between members of the same&#xD;
           cluster is strong and between different clusters is weak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the FBC method includes a data-driven process for determining the tolerable&#xD;
      amount of missing measurements. It starts with the selection of a highly compliant subset of&#xD;
      patients (i.e. with a high number of performed lung function measurements, normally with at&#xD;
      least as many measurements as the 60th percentile of the overall distribution of the number&#xD;
      of lung function measurements from the entire analysis population), the so-called gold&#xD;
      standard. Then, within the gold standard, to quantify similarities in lung function&#xD;
      fluctuation between individuals, the distribution of normalised lung function values of a&#xD;
      given patient is compared with the distributions of all other patients in the gold standard.&#xD;
      This pairwise comparison is done using the earth mover's distance. A low value of earth&#xD;
      mover's distance indicates high similarity in lung function fluctuation between two&#xD;
      individuals. Patients are then grouped into clusters, such that the similarity between&#xD;
      members of the same clusters is strong while that between different clusters is weak, using&#xD;
      Ward's minimum-variance hierarchical clustering method. Following this, a cluster stability&#xD;
      analysis is performed to assess the stability of the clusters upon random data point removal.&#xD;
      The outcome of this stability analysis enables us to establish the minimum number of lung&#xD;
      function measurements required to ensure the clusters' stability. Those patients who&#xD;
      performed the minimum number of lung function measurements required but were not part of the&#xD;
      gold standard are now added to the gold standard. Finally, the cluster analysis procedure is&#xD;
      repeated with this extended gold standard to obtain the final clusters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring plan Before the beginning of the investigation, the Sponsor will appoint an&#xD;
      independent monitor. Monitoring will be performed before, during the study and after the&#xD;
      study is completed in accordance with the ISO 141 55 GCP (Good Clinical Practice) standard.&#xD;
      Study conductance, source data, device accountability, adherence to the study protocol, Good&#xD;
      Clinical Practice, and regulatory requirements will be monitored in approximately 30-50% of&#xD;
      all included subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be monitored at site are e.g.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient information and Informed Consent. That patient included in the study has signed&#xD;
           an Informed Consent and that no study procedures have begun before the date of the&#xD;
           consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  That inclusion and exclusion criteria are met for the included patients that are&#xD;
           monitored&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  That all types of adverse events and serious adverse events, device related or not, as&#xD;
           well as, those that might have led to SAE shall be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Check that CRF data are entered in those subjects that are monitored&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other CRF data will be source data verified against patient records according to a&#xD;
           detailed Monitoring Plan (that will contain details regarding the overall monitoring)&#xD;
           signed by the Sponsor prior to the start of the study. At least 20% of the patients will&#xD;
           have data in the CRFs 100% source data verified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The monitor and possible authorities must be given direct access to source documents&#xD;
      (original documents, data and records). Direct access includes permission to examine,&#xD;
      analyse, verify and reproduce any record(s) and report(s) that are important to the&#xD;
      evaluation of the clinical investigation. In order to be able to do that, a written consent&#xD;
      from each patient should be obtained. Also a secrecy agreement between the monitor and the&#xD;
      person responsible for patient records at the study site will be signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management Procedures for data management will be implemented in collaboration with KTA&#xD;
      and conducted according to standards of GCP. Due to work load and the nature of the&#xD;
      intervention, neither health care personnel nor participants can be blinded to allocation. An&#xD;
      employee outside the research team will feed data into the computer in separate datasheets so&#xD;
      that the researchers can analyse data without having access to information about the&#xD;
      allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Database cleaning and issuing data queries will be traceable and transparent with logs and&#xD;
      data is stored at Karolinska Institutet, department of Women's and Children's Health. Audit&#xD;
      will be performed once by certified CRO to assure quality, and to verify the monitoring&#xD;
      process and data as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paper case report forms (CRF) will be completed for each included patient in combination with&#xD;
      standardized health questionnaires at baseline, together with validated ACT at 3- and 6 or&#xD;
      later after study inclusion. Investigators will ensure completion and review of the CRF.&#xD;
      Investigators have personal responsibility for the accuracy and authenticity of all clinical&#xD;
      and other data that are entered into the CRF. Subjects included in the study will be&#xD;
      desidentified on the CRFs and subsequent reporting. A Subject Identification List, with cross&#xD;
      reference between the subjects identification number in the study and the subjects personal&#xD;
      data, will be kept looked away with the study documentation at the study centre. Monitors&#xD;
      will do on site monitoring to review the data in the CRFs versus source data and issue&#xD;
      queries to the Investigator to correct and clean data before CRF is sent to be entered into&#xD;
      the a database, stored and kept by the Sponsor. The study database will be reviewed and&#xD;
      cleaned prior to locking the study database and analysing the data, and a Clean File Report&#xD;
      will be issued. During the course of the study the investigational team, and the monitor will&#xD;
      have access to the study material, which will be kept in a locked place. Retention period for&#xD;
      data storage is 10 years. All study documentation will be saved as paper copies and&#xD;
      electronic files after the study has been published and reported. Participating investigators&#xD;
      / Sponsor will be responsible for data collection, data processing and report writing.&#xD;

      Adverse events, adverse device effect and device deficiencies&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEFINITIONS of categories of adverse events from ISO/FDIS 14155:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Device Effect (ADE) is an adverse event related to the use of Asthmatuner:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE 1- This includes any adverse event resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the&#xD;
      instructions for use, the deployment, the implantation, the installation, the operation, or&#xD;
      any malfunction of the investigational medical device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE 2- This includes any event that is a result of a use error or intentional misuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury or any&#xD;
      untoward clinical signs (including an abnormal laboratory finding) in subjects, users or&#xD;
      other persons whether or not related to the investigational medical device:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE 1: This includes events related to the investigational device or the comparator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE 2: This includes events related to the procedures involved (any procedure in the&#xD;
      clinical investigation plan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE 3: For users or other persons this is restricted to events related to the&#xD;
      investigational medical device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device deficiency is inadequacy of a medical device related to its identity, quality,&#xD;
      durability, reliability, safety or performance, such as malfunction, misuse or use error and&#xD;
      inadequate labeling. Investigational medical device Asthmatuner will in this clinical&#xD;
      investigation be assessed for safety or performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE) is adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the&#xD;
      consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is an adverse event that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. led to a death,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. led to a serious deterioration in health that either:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. resulted in a life-threatening illness or injury, or&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent life threatening illness or&#xD;
                injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE 1: This includes device deficiencies that might have led to a serious adverse event if&#xD;
      a) suitable action had not been taken or b) intervention had not been made or c) if&#xD;
      circumstances had been less fortunate. These are handled under the SAE reporting system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE 2: A planned hospitalization for pre-existing condition, or a procedure required by the&#xD;
      Clinical Investigation Plan, without a serious deterioration in health, is not considered to&#xD;
      be a serious adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect is serious adverse device effect which by its&#xD;
      nature, incidence, severity or outcome has not been identified in the current version of the&#xD;
      risk analysis report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: Anticipated: an effect which by its nature, incidence, severity or outcome has been&#xD;
      previously identified in the risk analysis report&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reportable events according 90/385/EEC and 93/42EEC. The following events are considered&#xD;
      reportable events based on definitions above:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  any SAE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  any Device Defieciency that might have led to a SAE if a) suitable action had not been&#xD;
           taken or b) intervention had not been made or c) if circumstances had been less&#xD;
           fortunate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  new findings/updates in relation to already reported events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Report by whom: Reportable events have to be reported by the sponsor of the clinical&#xD;
      investigation, which could be the manufacturer, the authorized representative or another&#xD;
      person or entity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Report to whom: Reportable events must be reported at the same time to all NCA where the&#xD;
      clinical investigation has commenced using the summary tabulation featured in the Appendix 4.&#xD;
      A list of clinical investigation contact points within the NCA's is published at the&#xD;
      Commission's homepage&#xD;
      (http://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/medical-devices/contacts/index_en.htm), access date:&#xD;
      2016-02-22&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting timelines&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor must report to the NCAs where the clinical investigation has commenced:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a SAE which indicates an imminent risk of death, serious injury, or serious illness and&#xD;
           that requires prompt remedial action for other patients/subjects, users or other persons&#xD;
           or a new finding to is: immediately, but not later than 2 calender days after awareness&#xD;
           by sponsor of a new reportable event or of new information in relation with an already&#xD;
           reported event.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  any other reportable events as described in section &quot;Reportable events according&#xD;
           90/385/EEC and 93/42EEC&quot; or a new finiding/update to it: immediately, but not later than&#xD;
           7 calendar days following the date of awareness by the sponsor of new reportable event&#xD;
           or of new information in relation with an already reported event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Report by the investigator to the sponsor The sponsor will implement and maintain a system&#xD;
      consisting of email address and phone number to sponsor, to ensure that the reporting of the&#xD;
      reportable events will be provided by the investigator to the sponsor in acceptable timely&#xD;
      conditions, but not later than within 3 calendar days after the occurrence of the event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting form The reporting form template for the summary SAE tabulation is given in the&#xD;
      Appendix 4 of this document. The table gives a cumulative overview of the reportable events&#xD;
      per clinical investigation and will be updated and transmitted to participating NCAs each&#xD;
      time a new reportable event or a new finding to an already reported event is to be reported.&#xD;
      More detailed information has to be provided on request of an NCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor shall identify the new/updated information in the status column of the tabular&#xD;
      form featured in the Appendix 4 as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a = added = new reportable event; m = modified = new finding/update to an already reported&#xD;
      event; u = unchanged. Changes in a line should be highlighted in bold and/or color in the&#xD;
      respective column. English is the recommended language for the reporting form. The report&#xD;
      should be sent by email.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preexisting conditions and unanticipated adverse device effects In this trial, a preexisting&#xD;
      condition i.e. asthma, should not be reported as an adverse event unless the condition&#xD;
      worsens or episodes increases (i.e. exacerbations) in the frequency during the adverse event&#xD;
      reporting period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Diagnostics and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery,&#xD;
      should not be reported as adverse events. However, the medical condition for which the&#xD;
      procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. The AE&#xD;
      reporting period begins upon starting the use of Asthmatuner or conventional management&#xD;
      (visit 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be questioned about AE for each visit. All AE that occur in the trial&#xD;
      should be reported to investigator and specified in the participantsÂ´ medical journal and in&#xD;
      a separate AE form with following information:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of AE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date and time of AE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Association with Asthmatuner (No/Yes/Unknown)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gravity (Serious or Non-serious)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reporting time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up (resolved or unresolved)&#xD;

           Phone: +46 706628642 QUALITATIVE STUDY - PROCEDURES Before the introduction of&#xD;
           Asthmatuner, caregivers will be interviewed focusing on their expectations. After at&#xD;
           least 6 months, caregivers and patients will be interviewed with regard to how they&#xD;
           experienced the use of Asthmatuner. All caregivers within Tiohundra's primary care that&#xD;
           work with asthma/COPD patients are asked about participation in the interview study. The&#xD;
           patient selection for the qualitative part is done among adult patients with asthma&#xD;
           diagnosis who are randomized to use Asthmatuner. They will have mixed disease history,&#xD;
           sex and age for maximum selection width.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participation in the qualitative study, the participants will be informed that all&#xD;
      participation is voluntary and can be discontinued when and without any specific reason. The&#xD;
      participants who are patients will be asked at the primary care center in connection with the&#xD;
      planned visit, or be contacted via letter for participation in the interview. The responsible&#xD;
      doctor, nurse or researcher obtains informed written consent after the research subjects have&#xD;
      received sufficient time for consideration. When the caregivers are informed about the study,&#xD;
      participation in the qualitative study is offered. Information is then given that all&#xD;
      participation is voluntary and it can be interrupted at any time without specific reason and&#xD;
      the consent is then signed before the interview is carried out. Signed consent is saved in&#xD;
      study folder and a copy is submitted to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sound recordings will be made during the interviews and transcribed afterwards. The&#xD;
      transcribed interviews will be provided with information on time, place and a serial number&#xD;
      for informants and researchers. No personal data is collected together with the interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Archiving of interview data for the qualitative part takes place on digital medium according&#xD;
      to current security procedures that ensure that only authorized researchers have access to&#xD;
      the material. Recorded material will be unidentified and stored for 10 years as digital audio&#xD;
      files in our digital archive. Then the material will be destroyed.&#xD;

    <description>Asthmatuner (Medituner AB, Stockholm, Sweden) is a CE-marked cloud-computing-based system with a healthcare interface and a downloadable patient app (Android or iOS).The intended use of Asthmatuner is to automate asthma self-management by letting patients register symptoms and measure forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) with a Bluetooth spirometer (MIR, SmartOne). The patient then receives immediate feedback on the status of symptom control (controlled, partly controlled or uncontrolled), and a treatment recommendation, with an image of the correct inhaler or other type of medication and the dose. Symptom control is quantified based on lung function; litre to percentage of personalised best FEV1, using a cut-off â¤80% and symptoms during the last week based on four questions: 1) need for rescue medication more than twice due to asthma symptoms, 2) any daytime symptoms, 3) nocturnal symptoms/awakenings, and 4) limitation in physical activities.</description>
