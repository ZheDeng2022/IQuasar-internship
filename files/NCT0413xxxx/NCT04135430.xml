  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infant bronchiolitis is a frequent pathology that is the cause of a very large number of&#xD;
      medical outpatient and physiotherapy treatments in France. Many international studies and&#xD;
      recommendations have invalidated any drug treatment during its management during the first&#xD;
      episode. In France, the consensus conference promoted by the National Agency for&#xD;
      Accreditation and Health Evaluation (ANAES) in September 2000 was in the same vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the respiratory physiotherapy component, posture drainage, vibration and percussion&#xD;
      are not considered effective. ANAES recommended the use of respiratory physiotherapy with&#xD;
      passive exhalation techniques. This is a method of care that has developed mainly in&#xD;
      French-speaking countries, making it difficult to compare with the habits of Anglo-Saxon&#xD;
      countries, which, more generally, do not prescribe it. In France, the level of evidence of&#xD;
      its effectiveness is considered low (grade C). To date, the vast majority of studies have&#xD;
      focused exclusively on a population of infants hospitalized for severe bronchiolitis. For&#xD;
      this type of population, the value of such treatment to shorten the healing time has not been&#xD;
      demonstrated. So much so that the ANAES, in its time, recommended that studies be carried out&#xD;
      &quot;on an outpatient basis&quot; to assess their degree. In this respect, several recent studies have&#xD;
      provided new data. Despite the reservations inherent in their methodologies and/or staff,&#xD;
      they raise the question of the interest of the respiratory physiotherapy on an outpatient&#xD;
      basis. In terms of professional practice, the American recommendations state that clinicians&#xD;
      should educate family members about evidence-based diagnosis, treatment and prevention in&#xD;
      bronchiolitis. Finally, an opinion survey concludes that holders of parental authority are&#xD;
      seeking information on bronchiolitis and that approximately 90% have read the brochure given&#xD;
      out of the maternity ward explaining the modes of transmission, manifestations, care and&#xD;
      hygiene measures in the event of bronchiolitis. Pending new French recommendations, it seems&#xD;
      legitimate to evaluate the level of perception of the effect of pediatric respiratory&#xD;
      physiotherapy with increase in expiratory flow (IEF) in urban practice on the respiratory&#xD;
      comfort of infants directly with families confronted with this pathology.&#xD;
