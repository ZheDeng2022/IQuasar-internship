             metastases, defined as untreated and symptomatic, or requiring therapy with&#xD;
             corticosteroids or anticonvulsants to control associated symptoms. Subjects with&#xD;
             clinically inactive brain metastases may be included in the study. Subjects with&#xD;
             treated brain metastases that are no longer symptomatic and who require no treatment&#xD;
             with corticosteroids or anticonvulsants may be included in the study if they have&#xD;
             recovered from the acute toxic effect of radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient with bone metastatic disease only.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient with multiple primary malignancies within 3 years, except adequately resected&#xD;
             non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated in-situ disease, other solid tumors&#xD;
             curatively treated, or contralateral breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Persistent unresolved toxicities with grade ≥2 (except alopecia and renal function).&#xD;
             Subject with chronic Grade 2 toxicities may be eligible per the discretion of the&#xD;
             Investigator after consultation with the Sponsor (eg, Grade 2 chemotherapy-induced&#xD;
             neuropathy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient receiving treatments such as chemotherapy (including antibody drug therapy,&#xD;
             retinoid therapy, hormonal therapy) within 3 weeks before inclusion (within 2 weeks or&#xD;
             5 half-lives, whichever is longer, for small-molecule targeted agents, within 6 weeks&#xD;
             for nitrosureas or mitomycin C), immunotherapy within 4 weeks before inclusion,&#xD;
             radiotherapy within 4 weeks (if palliative stereotactic radiotherapy: within 2 weeks)&#xD;
             or major surgery within 4 weeks. Participation in other studies involving&#xD;
             investigational drug(s) within 4 weeks prior to study entry and/or during study&#xD;

          7. Patient using drugs that could have pharmacokinetics interaction with investigational&#xD;
             drugs. Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or OATP 1B inhibitors should be&#xD;
             avoided. If concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 or OATP 1B inhibitors is unavoidable,&#xD;
             consider delaying DS-8201a treatment until the inhibitors have cleared from the&#xD;
             circulation (approximately 3 elimination half-lives of the inhibitors) when possible.&#xD;
             If a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor or an OATP 1B inhibitor is co-administered and DS-8201a&#xD;
             treatment cannot be delayed, patients should be closely monitored for adverse&#xD;
             reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with a concomitant use of chronic systemic (intravenous or oral)&#xD;
             corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications except for managing adverse&#xD;
             events (inhaled steroids or intra articular steroid injections are permitted in this&#xD;
             study.) Subjects with bronchopulmonary disorders who require intermittent use of&#xD;
             bronchodilators (such as albuterol) will not be excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient with history of (noninfectious) interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis&#xD;
             that required steroids, has current ILD/pneumonitis, or suspected ILD/pneumonitis that&#xD;
             cannot be ruled out by imaging at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patient with clinically significant corneal disease in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Known prior severe hypersensitivity to investigational product or any component in its&#xD;
             formulation, including known severe hypersensitivity reactions to study drug (National&#xD;
             Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v5.0 Grade&#xD;
             ≥3).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patient has a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other monoclonal&#xD;
             antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients previously treated with topoisomerase 1 inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patient has substance abuse or any other medical conditions that would increase the&#xD;
             safety risk to the subject or interfere with participation of the subject or&#xD;
             evaluation of the clinical study in the opinion of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Known history of testing positive for HIV or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.&#xD;

         17. Active infection requiring systemic therapy (as intravenous antibiotics, antivirals,&#xD;
             antifungals,…).&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions or psychiatric conditions including&#xD;
             recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior; or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study&#xD;
             treatment administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results&#xD;
             and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for&#xD;
             entry into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Patient with a history of symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart&#xD;

&#xD;
         22. Patient with any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition&#xD;
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those&#xD;

&#xD;
         23. Patient unwilling to participate to the biological investigations.&#xD;
