  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and tolerability of RBX7455 given for at least 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
      surgery. To evaluate intratumoral immunomodulatory effects, including TILs, CD4, and CD8 T&#xD;
      cells, in operable breast cancer patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Microbiota and host form a complex super-organism with symbiotic relationships, which confer&#xD;
      several benefits to the host. However, disruptions and alterations of the microbiome through&#xD;
      environmental changes may disturb this symbiotic relationship and promote disease,&#xD;
      particularly cancer(1). Growing literature indicates the key role of gut microbiome and&#xD;
      carcinogenesis. Perturbations of gut microbiome through changes in diet and use of&#xD;
      antibiotics have been shown to sufficiently promote cancer in mouse models(2,3). The&#xD;
      mechanisms, which microbiotas promote carcinogenesis, were through the increase in&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory stimuli via Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which is a cornerstone of innate&#xD;
      immunity, as well as the release of genotoxins, virulence factors, and carcinogenic&#xD;
      metabolites. Furthermore, multiple studies also demonstrated that gut microbiota can alter&#xD;
      the efficacy of anticancer therapy via immunological modulation in several preclinical&#xD;
      models. These immunomodulatory effects include induction of TH1 response(4), increase in&#xD;
      intratumoral cytotoxic T lymphocytes/regulatory T (Treg) cells ratio(5), increase in&#xD;
      long-term memory CD4+ T helper cells, increase tumor-infiltrating interferon γ (IFNγ)&#xD;
      producing γδT cells. Nevertheless, the effects of changing gut microbiome using probiotics in&#xD;
      human breast cancers are largely unknown. In this particular study, we propose to evaluate&#xD;
      the immunological effects of a novel oral Microbiome Restoration Therapy™ (MRT), RBX7455, in&#xD;
      patients with stage I-III breast cancer prior to undergoing definitive surgery.&#xD;
