    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore and collect the perceptions, expectations and needs&#xD;
      of CF patients about parenting. This will be done in the context of several small groups of&#xD;
      patients led by a psychologist who will ensure that all the participants express themselves;&#xD;
      he will encourage them to develop their points of view, their divergences and their common&#xD;
      points about what constitutes to be a parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected information should make it possible to develop and propose adapted&#xD;
      medico-psycho-social interventions, if necessary, in connection with patient associations&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Life expectancy has improved significantly in cystic fibrosis in recent years. From&#xD;
      paediatric disease, it has become a disease of the adult, with the emergence of new issues,&#xD;
      such as becoming a parent. Parent patients still face the risk of complications and death&#xD;
      while their child is still young. However, there is very little data in the literature on&#xD;
      parenting in cystic fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore and collect the perceptions, expectations&#xD;
      and needs of CF patients and their spouses about parenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with children, followed in 2 large adult CF centers, and their spouses will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in a 6 to 10-person discussion group (focus group) led by a&#xD;
      psychologist. He will ensure that all the participants express themselves and are encouraged&#xD;
      to develop their points of view, their divergences and their common points about what&#xD;
      constitutes to be a parent. The discussions will be recorded and transcribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who cannot participate in groups (e.g. patients colonized with Burkholderia cepacia&#xD;
      complex) but wish to be included in the study will benefit from an individual interview with&#xD;
      the psychologist, also registered and transcribed. A thematic analysis will be carried out&#xD;
      from the transcriptions of group contents. For individual interviews, phenomenological&#xD;
      interpretative analysis (IPA) will be used. A synthesis of the two analyses will then be&#xD;
      done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected information should make it possible to develop and propose adapted&#xD;
      medico-psycho-social interventions, if necessary, in connection with patient associations.&#xD;
