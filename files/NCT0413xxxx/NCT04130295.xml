  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spasticity is muscle spasms, bouncing (clonus) or stiffness that can negatively impact the&#xD;
      quality of life of people with spinal cord injury (SCI). In people with spinal cord injury,&#xD;
      spasticity can limit muscle control of the arms and hands and cause pain, discomfort, and&#xD;
      frustration. Transcutaneous electrical stimulation has been shown to reduce spasticity after&#xD;
      SCI. However, this type of stimulation's effects during prolonged, at-home use has not been&#xD;
      well studied. Additionally, traditional stimulation techniques are often only available in&#xD;
      the clinic. Therefore, this study aims to identify if wearable intensive nerve stimulation&#xD;
      decreases spasticity in the legs of people with SCI, and if this intervention is usable and&#xD;
      desirable to individuals with SCI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Involuntary muscle activation, also referred to as spasticity is a common characteristic of&#xD;
      spinal cord injuries. It can present as stiffness, clonus, and spasms that can impact a&#xD;
      person's ability to perform daily tasks. Over half of individuals with spinal cord injuries&#xD;
      that have spasticity report medication alone does not control the spasticity. Because of this&#xD;
      clinical research is investigation different ways to manage spasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stretching and vibration have demonstrated the ability to reduce spasticity but only for&#xD;
      short periods of time requiring repeated use of the intervention. Additionally, vibration&#xD;
      devices are not very practical to implement at home due to their high cost. Due to these&#xD;
      factors, a solution that could be used multiple times a day and remains cost effective is&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) has also demonstrated effectiveness in reducing&#xD;
      spasticity after one session but shows greater benefit when it is able to be used for&#xD;
      multiple sessions. A wearable intensive nerve stimulator (WINS) device has been shown to be&#xD;
      safe for daily wear which makes it a feasible solution to address spasticity at home.&#xD;
      Research has not yet looked at the efficacy of using the WINS device for spasticity and this&#xD;
      study proposes to begin to fill that gap.&#xD;
