  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The object of this non-randomized, prospective study is to assess the effectiveness of&#xD;
      ablative fractional 2940 nm laser treatment of vulvar lichen sclerosus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To assess physical and histological changes related to vulvar lichen sclerosus before&#xD;
      and after laser treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To evaluate participant satisfaction for laser treatment of vulvar lichen sclerosus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will determine whether fractional 2940 nm laser is an effective&#xD;
      treatment option for lichen sclerosus, particularly for those participants not eligible for&#xD;
      high-dose topical steroids or who have failed prior treatment with topical steroids.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a non-randomized, open-label, prospective study. Participants will be recruited&#xD;
      in general and subspecialty obstetrics and gynecology clinics. Participants who meet all&#xD;
      eligibility criteria, including providing written informed consent, will have three treatment&#xD;
      visits and three follow-up visits in an outpatient setting. Participants will not be charged&#xD;
      for any treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each treatment visit, participants will be asked to complete questionnaires to assess&#xD;
      their symptoms. The investigators will also take photographs of the affected area at each&#xD;
      treatment visit. Photographs will include only the area of lichen sclerosus, such that&#xD;
      individuals cannot be identified in the photographs. Participant photographs will be taken&#xD;
      using the BIDMC PhotoConsult iOS application that allows providers to upload photographs to a&#xD;
      patient's online medical record through a secure application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with biopsy-proven lichen sclerosus will be treated with the ProFractional hand piece&#xD;
      using the sapphire plate stand-off (Sciton, Inc. Palo, Alto, CA). The laser energy is&#xD;
      delivered in a scanning fractional pattern to ablate microchannels in tissue to allow faster&#xD;
      healing. Treatment will be delivered in 3 sessions scheduled 4 weeks (+/- 1 week) apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to receiving treatment, topical 4% lidocaine anesthetic will be applied to the affected&#xD;
      area for 20-30 minutes and then wiped away. The treatment area will be cleaned and dried of&#xD;
      any moisture prior to treatment. The disinfected standoff with sapphire plate will then be&#xD;
      applied to the ProFractional hand piece. Based on the biopsy results, the appropriate&#xD;
      ablation depth will be inputted with 11% treatment density selected. Each treatment will&#xD;
      include two passes of the laser over the affected area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment visit 1, month 0: On the first pass, the depth of the laser will be from 300&#xD;
           to 500 microns, or the thickness of 3 to 5 sheets of paper; the depth will be based on&#xD;
           the biopsy that was used to diagnosis the lichen sclerosus. On the second pass, the&#xD;
           depth will be 50 microns deeper than the first pass and the hand piece rotated 45˚.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment visit 2, month 1: The first pass of the laser will be the same depth as the&#xD;
           second pass from the last visit. The second pass will be 50 microns deeper and the hand&#xD;
           piece rotated 45˚.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment visit 3, month 2: The first pass of the laser will be the same depth as the&#xD;
           second pass from the last visit. The second pass will be 50 microns deeper and the hand&#xD;
           piece rotated 45˚.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will return for follow-up visits at 1, 3, and 6 months (months 3, 6 and 9 of the&#xD;
      study) following the third treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up visit 1, month 3&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires to assess outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The investigators will take photographs of the affected area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up visit 2, month 6&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires to assess outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The investigators will take photographs of the affected area.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Biopsy of area with lichen sclerosus; the biopsy will be done the same way as the&#xD;
                one that was done to diagnosis your lichen sclerosus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up visit 6, month 9&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires to assess outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The investigators will take photographs of the affected area.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in histology and depth of disease from baseline to three months after the last laser treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>From enrollment to 9 month follow up visit</time_frame>
    <description>The baseline depth of lichen sclerosus will be based on the results of the clinical biopsy performed before study participation. The investigators will use the study biopsy collected at the follow-up visit three months after the last treatment to determine resolution of disease or, if disease persists, to what depth. The biopsies will therefore serve as an objective means to determine effective treatment of disease.</description>

    <description>The VSQ is a 21-item written questionnaire with four scales: symptoms, emotions, life-impact, and sexual impact. Each item is assessed with yes or no questions. If a participant answers no, they receive a score of 0, and if the participant answers yes, they receive a score of 1 for each question. The results are added to a composite score.&#xD;
