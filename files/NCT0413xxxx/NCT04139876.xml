    <textblock>
      This is a single center randomized clinical trial comparing Ligasure Hemorrhoidectomy and&#xD;
      Open Hemorrhoidectomy for the treatment of prolapsing haemorrhoids. The primary aim of the&#xD;
      study is to evaluate symptoms related to hemorrhoids one year postoperatively, according to a&#xD;
      hemorrhoidal disease symptom score (HDSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are patient satisfaction with the operation, Health related Quality of&#xD;
      Life and effect on anal continence.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemorrhoids is one of the oldest known medical conditions. Description of hemorrhoids is&#xD;
      found as early as 2250 Before Christ (BC) in the code of king Hammurabi in Babylon. Even&#xD;
      though first recorded treatment is thought to be found in the &quot;Edwin Smith Papyrus&quot; from 1700&#xD;
      BC as of today the treatment of this benign state is still debated. A wide range of&#xD;
      prevalence rates of hemorrhoids have been stated in part because of the varying definition&#xD;
      ,but the general consensus is that hemorrhoidal disease is a common anorectal disease&#xD;
      affecting the quality of life of millions of people worldwide. Operation for hemorrhoid is&#xD;
      one of the most common operations for benign disease in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemorrhoids arise from the normal vascular structures in the anal canal also referred to as&#xD;
      anal cushions or sinusoids as they do not contain muscular cells like arteries or veins.&#xD;
      These cushions are typically arranged in three main columns or piles in the anal canal&#xD;
      forming an important part of the intricate mechanism of the anal canal preventing&#xD;
      incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemorrhoids is a pathologic term describing the symptomatic abnormal downward displacement&#xD;
      and enlargement of the anal cushions. The term hemorrhoidal disease is used when the&#xD;
      hemorrhoids cause symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of hemorrhoidal disease consists of conservative management with lifestyle and diet&#xD;
      changes or local treatment, minor surgery and surgical treatment depending on the severity of&#xD;
      disease and symptoms. The staging of internal hemorrhoids in four categories by the Goligher&#xD;
      classification is the classification that generally forms the basis of the treatment in&#xD;
      Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local treatment consists of corticosteroids and anaesthetic ointments. Minor surgery includes&#xD;
      rubber band ligation and sclerotherapy. Operation is reserved for subjects with prolapse,&#xD;
      Goligher grade II and IV. Grade II hemorrhoids may be treated by operation if still&#xD;
      symptomatic after banding or sclerosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard in the operative treatment of hemorrhoidal is the Milligan-Morgan&#xD;
      Hemorrhoidectomy also referred to as hemorrhoidal excision or Open Hemorrhoidectomy (OH). The&#xD;
      operation can also be performed as a Closed Hemorrhoidectomy when the wound is closed with&#xD;
      sutures (Ferguson's Hemorrhoidectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conventional excisional operation has been associated with postprocedural pain and&#xD;
      delayed healing of wounds. In recent years there have been suggestions for and a development&#xD;
      toward a less traumatic Open Hemorrhoidectomy. Injuries to the internal anal sphincter during&#xD;
      dissection is thought to be one cause for pain. The less traumatic operations include&#xD;
      dissection of the hemorrhoid preserving the fascia over the internal anal sphincter and also&#xD;
      smaller excision of skin and mucosa - the technique used in this study is described in more&#xD;
      detail under Methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several new procedures have been proposed in the last decades. Common for all is the&#xD;
      implementation of a new technical device, meaning increased operative costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LigaSure Trademark (TM) hemorrhoidectomy (LH) is a hemorrhoidectomy performed with the use of&#xD;
      the LigaSure TM instrument in stead of the traditional diathermy. The LigaSure TM technology&#xD;
      patented in 1998 as &quot;Energy Delivery System for Vessel Sealing&quot; creates vessel fusion by a&#xD;
      combination of pressure and energy17. The LigaSure device excises the hemorrhoids and seals&#xD;
      the wound in the same procedure delivering the energy in a controlled way between the&#xD;
      diathermy forceps theoretically limiting thermal spray and tissue charring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemorrhoidal Disease is a benign disease and should be evaluated by it's effect on&#xD;
      hemorrhoidal symptoms together with its effect on quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemorrhoidal symptoms should be the main outcome variable when evaluating surgery for&#xD;
      hemorrhoidal disease. This information is largely lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of a validated symptom score with long term follow-up could yield important&#xD;
      information for the choice of treatment of haemorrhoidal disease.&#xD;

Each symptom graded on a five-point scale (0=never, 1=less than once a month, 2=less than once a week, 3=1-6 days per week, 4=every day / always), giving a total score ranging from 0-20. Zero meaning no symptoms. (See reference).</description>

    <description>Patient operated in the lithotomy position. The external components are grasped by clamps using gentle traction. Diathermy is used for dissection and hemostasis. The skin is incised midway to one-third of the distance from the top of the pedicle, thus, minimizing the skin excision. The subdermal fascia continuing into a submucosal fascia covering the internal anal sphincter is identified as are fibers passing between the hemorrhoid (H) and this fascia. The H is dissected free from the underlying internal sphincter in this plane, leaving the sphincter unharmed. The anal mucosa is incised at the transition from anal mucosa to hemorrhoidal mucosa and only anal mucosa overlying the H is excised. Only the caudal part of the H is excised. With the H held with gentle traction it is divided at the anal orifice. There will thus be a residual part of the H intra-anally with its caudal end 1-2 cm proximal to the anal orifice.</description>

    <description>Patient is operated in the lithotomy position. The main haemorrhoidal (H) masses are identified and delineated. The H are prolapsed out from the anal canal with Allis clamps or similar pick up forceps. Tension is applied to visualise the junction between the nodule and the mucosal wall (internal) or the perianal tissue (external). A small V-shaped anodermal seal is performed by applying the LigaSure (LS) forceps close to the edge of each pile. The seal is then transacted with scissors along the line of coagulum. Care should be taken to limit the amount of tissue removed to minimize the stricture risk. Repeated applications of the device are performed and the excision is continued into the anal canal, lifting the pile from the internal anal sphincter to the level of the vascular pedicle that is finally sealed by LS and divided.</description>
