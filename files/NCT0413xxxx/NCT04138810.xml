  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative follow up is necessary following any surgical procedure and has been conducted&#xD;
      in the same manner since the field of surgery began. The study will determine feasibility and&#xD;
      patient satisfaction of innovative postoperative virtual clinical encounters utilizing mobile&#xD;
      video conference technology for women undergoing pelvic reconstructive surgery through a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective randomized control study comparing postoperative virtual clinical&#xD;
      encounters versus traditional in-office postoperative visits in women undergoing pelvic&#xD;
      reconstructive surgery. The postoperative experiences of both groups will be assessed via&#xD;
      surveys. Virtual Clinical Encounter Group: - Receive video-conference call from office nurse&#xD;
      48-72 hours post discharge from hospital - Receive video-conference call from fellow and/or&#xD;
      attending physician approximately 30 days (4-6 weeks) from surgery -- Complete telephone&#xD;
      survey one day later - Have in-office postoperative visit with fellow and/or attending&#xD;
      physician approximately 90 days (10-12 weeks) from surgery -- Fill out surveys after office&#xD;
      visit Traditional Office Group: - Receive telephone call from office nurse 48-72 hours post&#xD;
      discharge from hospital - Have in-office postoperative visit with fellow and/or attending&#xD;
      physician approximately 30 days (4-6 weeks) from surgery -- Complete telephone survey one day&#xD;
      later - Have in-office postoperative visit with fellow and/or attending physician&#xD;
      approximately 90 days (10-12 weeks) from surgery -- Fill out surveys after office visit&#xD;

    <description>PSQ-18 is a validated eighteen item patient satisfaction questionnaire that has been utilized across diverse healthcare settings. It measures satisfaction across the following domains: general satisfaction, technical quality of care, interpersonal manner of healthcare provider, communication, financial aspects of care, time spent with healthcare provider and accessibility/convenience of care. Total scores range from 18 to 90, with higher scores indicating higher patient satisfaction.</description>
