  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is aimed at evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of systemic pharmacotherapy as&#xD;
      a part of combination treatment, and its influence on the overall treatment outcomes in&#xD;
      patients with skin changes (CEAP class C4a and C4b).&#xD;

      Primary goal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the efficacy of systemic pharmacotherapy as part of combination therapy and its&#xD;
      impact on the:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  thickness of the skin-fat fold (ultrasound examination);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  change in the venous clinical severity score (VCSS);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  change in the CEAP clinical class of CVD;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evolution of CVD symptoms characteristic for CEAP class C4 (sensations of skin&#xD;
           tightening, burning, itching, pain, and exudation) using the Visual Analogue Scale&#xD;
           (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study the efficacy of systemic pharmacotherapy as part of combination therapy and its&#xD;
           impact on the:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  area of affected skin determined by curvimetry technique (only in selected centers&#xD;
                that use this technique routinely) before and after the treatment in patients with&#xD;
                skin changes of CEAP class C4a or C4b in real clinical practice;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  skin density determined by durometry technique (only in selected centers that use&#xD;
                this technique routinely).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the changes in the quality of life using the CIVIQ-14 questionnaire (global&#xD;
           index score [GIS]) .&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study the tolerability of systemic pharmacotherapy as part of combination therapy in&#xD;
           patients with skin changes of CEAP class C4a or C4b.&#xD;
