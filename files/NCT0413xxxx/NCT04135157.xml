    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the analgesic effects of pectoralis nerve block (PECS II) and erector&#xD;
      spinae plane block (ESP) in patients having segmental mastectomy and sentinel lymph node&#xD;
      biopsy (SLNB). Each one-third of patients will have ESP block and pectoralis nerve block&#xD;
      (PECS II) 30 min before general anesthesia , while other one-third of patients will have only&#xD;
      general anesthesia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been proven that PECS II and ESP both supply effective analgesia in the first 24 hours&#xD;
      after mastectomy. But they do so by different mechanishms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to survey that ESP and PECS II may supply acute and chronic analgesia by&#xD;
      reducing pain scores in the first 24 hours and 3 months after the surgery, also the&#xD;
      comparison of the analgesic activity among themselves for acute / chronic pain and opioid&#xD;
      consumption will be searched.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study patients are divided into three groups. Patients in PECS group will have PECS&#xD;
      II block in a separate section from the operating rooms (PNB practice room). In addition,&#xD;
      patient controlled analgesia (PCA) will be used in the first 24 hours postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in ESP group will have ESP block in a separate section from the operating rooms (PNB&#xD;
      practice room). In addition, PCA will be used in the first 24 hours postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in control group will not be performed nerve block. Only general anesthesia (GA)&#xD;
      will be performed in the operation room. In addition, PCA will be used in the first 24 hours&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;

    <measure>Opioid consumption in the first 24 hours after surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Morphine consumption in the first 24 hours will be counted by IV PCA. Patients will be able to request opioids via PCA device when the vas score is 4 points or more when the arm is in the resting position.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-operative acute pain</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Pain status will be evaluated based on VAS scores in two different positions: arm at rest and arm in abduction. Pain status will be evaluated at 1-3-6-12-24. hours after surgery. Each VAS is scores 0-10. (0=no pain ; 10=pain as bad as can be)</description>

    <measure>Remifentanil consumption during the surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>During the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Following induction of general anesthesia, anesthesia maintenance will be continued with sevoflurane to BIS 40-60 (bispectral index). When the BIS is between 40-60, remifentanil infusion rate will be changed considering ± 20% changes in blood pressure compared to baseline values.The total amount of remifentanil consumed will be recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The incidences of post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The patients will be evaluated according to the five-stage verbal descriptive PONV scale. If it is 3 points or more, ondansetron 4 mg IV will be administered. Wait for 8 hours for the next dose of ondansetron. (0 = None, 1 = Slight nausea, 2 = Moderate nausea, 3 = Once vomiting, 4 = vomiting more than one)</description>

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The number of patient requires rescue analgesic will be recorded at 1-3-6-12-24. hours after surgery</description>

    <measure>Post-operative chronic pain</measure>
    <time_frame>3. month after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Pain status will be evaluated in the third month after surgery based on VAS scores in two different positions: arm at rest and arm in abduction. Each VAS is scores 0-10. (0=no pain ; 10=pain as bad as can be)</description>
