  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood arthritis is an important cause of pain for affected children and youth&#xD;
      (adolescents). Many youth with arthritis also have trouble sleeping. They often struggle to&#xD;
      sleep through the night, wake up earlier, and are sleepier during the day compared to healthy&#xD;
      children. Our research group, among others, has shown a strong link between sleep and pain.&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to assess the impact of changing sleeping patterns on pain,&#xD;
      and disease activity, in teenagers with arthritis. We think that better sleep will directly&#xD;
      lead to better health.&#xD;

    <description>measured using the Inattention and Sleepiness Behaviour Rating Scale, scored on a scale of 0-39 with 0 representing the best possible score. Each sub-section can also be scored individually, with sleepiness being scored on a scale of 0-15 and inattention being scored on a scale of 0-27, with 0 representing the best possible score in both cases (i.e. the least sleepiness and least inattention)</description>
