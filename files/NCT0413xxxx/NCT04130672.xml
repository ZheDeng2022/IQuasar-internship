      Objective: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of hot posterior nasal packing and&#xD;
      hot saline irrigation in bleeding control after adenoidectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 130 patients scheduled for the only adenoidectomy were included, and randomized into&#xD;
      two groups at the beginning of the surgical operation. After adenoidectomy, saline&#xD;
      impregnated tampon, and saline irrigation at room temperature (22 ° C) was applied to the&#xD;
      patients in one group while 50 °C saline impregnated tampon and saline irrigation at the same&#xD;
      temperature were applied to the patients in the other group. We record the time for up to 3&#xD;
      minutes after tamponage for bleeding control, bleeding volume, and the amount of bleeding in&#xD;
      the nasopharynx&#xD;

      A prospective controlled randomized, single-blind study was designed to investigate the&#xD;
      effect of a hot tampon with hot saline irrigation in hemostasis of adenoidectomy. After the&#xD;
      parents signed informed consent, the patients under the age of 16 years, who underwent&#xD;
      adenoidectomy due to the chronic nasal obstruction, were included in this study. Patients&#xD;
      with chronic diseases, patients with bleeding diseases, and patients who had additional&#xD;
      procedures were excluded from the study. Among 137 patients who met the inclusion criteria,&#xD;
      one hundred and thirty patients agreed to give an informed consent form were included in the&#xD;
      study. Under the Declaration of Helsinki, the study protocol was approved by the Clinical&#xD;
      Research Ethics Committee (Permit number:5/2019 ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were divided into 22 ° C and 50 ° C irrigation groups using a computerized&#xD;
      random number chart for each working day. To provide blind-evaluation of bleeding by the&#xD;
      surgeon, a nurse organized heating the tampon and water, placed both nostrils latex Foley&#xD;
      catheters and performed the irrigation processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The temperature of the irrigation water and the tampon was adjusted through mixing hot and&#xD;
      cold water while immersing a thermometer in the water. The temperature of the irrigation&#xD;
      fluid was also controlled every minute to make sure it is a constant value of 50 °C (Fig. 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All operations will be performed under general anesthesia and a flexible fiberoptic endoscope&#xD;
      carefully assessed adenoid size before the operation with the following grading system: grade&#xD;
      1 (&lt;1/3 of posterior choanae obstructed), grade 2 (1/3-2/3 of posterior choanae obstructed)&#xD;
      and grade 3 (&gt;2/3 of posterior choanae obstructed) [13]. Following the patients lay down with&#xD;
      Rose's position which their head and neck were extended by placing rolls under the shoulder,&#xD;
      the Boyle-Davis mouth retractor was placed, and adenoidectomy was performed via curettes.&#xD;
      Complete excision was confirmed by digital palpation and nasopharyngeal mirror. After&#xD;
      adenoidectomy, tonsil tampon at room temperature or 50 ° C was placed in the nasopharynx.&#xD;
      Five minutes later, the tampon was removed, and 22 ° C or 50 ° C saline irrigation was&#xD;
      applied. The scoring system described by Boezaart et al. [14] was adapted to the nasopharynx&#xD;
      and using this scoring system and the direct visual observation instead of scoring endoscopy,&#xD;
      the nasopharynx was scored and recorded at four different time points: after just tamponing,&#xD;
      at the end of one, two and three minutes. The scoring was consisted of following scores:&#xD;
      0=there is no bleeding, 1=accumulation in the nasopharynx is very slow and slightly leak, 2=&#xD;
      nasopharynx filling if not aspirated intermittently, 3= blood accumulation in the nasopharynx&#xD;
      requiring frequent aspiration, 4= nasopharynx filling if not continuously aspirated, 5=&#xD;
      severe bleeding overflowing to the oropharynx. The scoring process was terminated when the&#xD;
      washing liquid was clean from bleeding during the irrigation. If this washing time was less&#xD;
      than 3 minutes, bleeding scores at remaining time points were also accepted as 0. The&#xD;
      irrigation fluids were applied at a rate of about 150 ccs per minute and not exceeding 500&#xD;
      ccs in total. When the irrigation time exceeded 3 minutes, the procedure was stopped to&#xD;
      control the bleeding through bipolar cauterization, and the irrigation was continued with&#xD;
      saline at the same temperature. The amount of bleeding was determined by removing the volume&#xD;
      of irrigation fluid from the volume of the material accumulated in the aspirator chamber. The&#xD;
      bleeding site and residual adenoid were detected by the nasopharyngeal mirror.&#xD;
