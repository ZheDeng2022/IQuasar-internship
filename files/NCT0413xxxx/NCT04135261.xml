  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the study drug HBM4003, and to&#xD;
      determine the maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended Phase 2 study dose of HBM4003. The&#xD;
      study will also look at the anti-tumor activity of HBM4003.The study consists of 2 parts. In&#xD;
      Part 1, patients are enrolled into different cohort doses in order to identify the&#xD;
      appropriate recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) or maximum tolerated dose (MTD). In Part 2,&#xD;
      participants with metastatic/unresectable melanoma will receive the MTD and/or RP2D&#xD;
      established in Part 1 of the study. In Part 1 and Part 2, participants will be administered&#xD;
      treatment either once per week or once every 3 weeks.&#xD;
