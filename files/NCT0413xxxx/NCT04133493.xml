  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical evaluation is to collect patient outcome data on a commercially&#xD;
      available 510K FDA-approved product that is derived from minimal processing of Atlantic cod&#xD;
      fish skin: KerecisTM Omega3 Wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, two groups of UT grade IA/1C diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), full skin thickness&#xD;
      or extending through the subcutaneous or fat layers but not into tendon, muscle, or bone will&#xD;
      receive standard of care (SOC) treatment for their condition. Patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      SOC treatment and a 510k FDA-approved collagen alginate dressing (Fibracol Plus) or SOC and&#xD;
      KerecisTM Omega3 Wound. The primary endpoint is the percentage of index ulcers (the ulcers&#xD;
      being treated in the study) healed at 12 weeks in which two groups that will be compared are&#xD;
      SOC with Fibracol Plus or SOC with KerecisTM Omega3 Wound&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, multi-center, parallel-group RCT designed to collect outcome data&#xD;
      for the treatment of DFUs. The trial will be single blinded in regard to wound healing&#xD;
      assessment (confirmation of wound healing will be overseen by an independent wound care&#xD;
      adjudicator).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two arms in the study, both of which will receive standard of care (SOC):&#xD;
      offloading of the DFU (CAM boots (Royce walker with diabetic inlay or equivalent) or total&#xD;
      contact casting [TCC] if compliance issues or the subject's foot is too large for a CAM),&#xD;
      appropriate sharp or surgical debridement. Patients cannot be on systemic antibiotics prior&#xD;
      to randomization, infection management during treatment phase can include systemic&#xD;
      antibiotics only in conjunction with debridement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1 will receive, in addition, a fish skin graft (KerecisTM Omega3 Wound) secured with&#xD;
      Steristrips, sutures or staples, covered with a nonadherent dressing (Adaptic, Systagenix,&#xD;
      Yorkshire, UK or equivalent), the product bolstered down to the wound bed with a foam&#xD;
      dressing (HydraFoam, DermaRite) and hydrogel as needed to retain adequate moisture balance&#xD;
      and padded with stretch gauze and self adherent wrap as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2 will receive a wound care covering comprising collagen alginate Fibracol plus dressing&#xD;
      followed by a padded dressing comprised of 4x4 gauze pads, stretch gauze and self adherent&#xD;
      wrap The wound will be dressed by patients or their caregivers at home 3 times a week and by&#xD;
      the site investigator 1 day a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves two phases: Screening and Treatment&#xD;

             application of topical steroids to the ulcer surface within 1-month prior to first&#xD;
             SV1, or who receive such medications during the screening period or who are&#xD;
             anticipated to require such medications during the course of the study.&#xD;
