      Introduction. The goal of our study was to compare results in patients with large midline&#xD;
      incisional hernia (LMIH) using only anterior compònent separation (CST) versus preoperative&#xD;
      botulinum toxin (BT) and following Rives repair (RSR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods. From to December 2016 to December 2018, a prospective comparative study&#xD;
      was performed in 80 consecutive patients with LMIH and hernia transverse diameter between&#xD;
      12-18 cms at our tertiary center. Two groups were prospectively analyzed: patients underwent&#xD;
      open CST (component separation group or CSG) and patients with preoperative BT administration&#xD;
      and following open RSR (botulinum toxin group or BTG).&#xD;

      Multiple techniques have been described to decrease tension in the closure of the hernia&#xD;
      defect in the large midline incisional hernias (LMIH) (1). Anterior component separation&#xD;
      (CST) has demonstrated to accomplish primary fascial closure, while maintaining normal&#xD;
      anatomy and physiology of the abdominal wall (2,3). However, described limitations of this&#xD;
      technique are complications involving the skin and subcutaneous tissue, most likely caused by&#xD;
      surgical interruption of perforating vessels during exposure of the external oblique muscle.&#xD;
      So, CST has been related to surgical site occurrences (SSO), especially skin necrosis, up to&#xD;
      17% of cases, as well as recurrence rates between 7 and 18% (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, botulinum toxin type A (BT) has been reported as a therapeutic option to&#xD;
      decrease tension of a fascial closure in LMIH (5). It is a neurotoxin that causes a&#xD;
      reversible denervation and paralisis of the lateral abdominal muscle, and has been considered&#xD;
      as a &quot;chemichal component separation&quot; by some working groups (6). Our long experience about&#xD;
      use of preoperative techniques like BT and progressive pneumperitoneum (PPP) allowed us to&#xD;
      raise the possibility of planning the isolated use of BT in case of long transverse hernia&#xD;
      diameters in patients with LMIH (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking advantage of the beneficial effect of the neurotoxin, we considered interesting to try&#xD;
      to downstage the CST to other hernia repair with less morbidity, like Rives-Stoppa&#xD;
      retromuscular repair (RSR). This technique has been traditionally considered the gold&#xD;
      standard technique in midline hernias, especially in hernia defects with transverse diameters&#xD;
      around or less than 10 cms, and appears to be more advantageous compared to other surgical&#xD;
      techniques concerning complications and recurrence rates (8). RSR achieves several&#xD;
      objectives: a tension-free closure due to extensive overlap between the prosthesis and the&#xD;
      fascial edges, and the placement of the mesh next to the vascular-rich rectus muscles&#xD;
      facilitates tissue incorporation and minimizing complications related to SSO (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of our study was to compare results in two groups of patients with LMIH, using&#xD;
      only CST versus preoperative BT plus following RSR, focusing on the SSO, possibility of&#xD;
      primary fascial closure, length of hospital stay and hernia recurrence rate.&#xD;
