      In this prospective randomized clinical study sinus floor elevation procedures are preformed&#xD;
      using different biomaterials with the lateral window technique. After a 6-month healing, at&#xD;
      the time of dental implant placement bone core biopsy samples are harvested. The samples&#xD;
      undergo micro-Ct and histomorphometric analysis.&#xD;

      Aim of the study The aim of this prospective randomized study is to evaluate the remodeling&#xD;
      capacity of albumin impregnated freeze-dried bone allograft in sinus floor augmentation by&#xD;
      histomorphometry and micro-CT analysis and to compare it to anorganic bovine xenograft&#xD;
      material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical methods Patients performed oral rinse with 0.2% chlorhexidine solution for 1 min&#xD;
      before surgery. Under local anesthesia a full thickness flap was raised from a midcrestal&#xD;
      incision along with two relieving incisions. Lateral window osteotomies were carried out with&#xD;
      diamond burs. The Schneiderian membrane was carefully elevated. Bone graft material was&#xD;
      packed in the defect with light force. Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups based on&#xD;
      the type of bone filler: albumin impregnated allograft (BoneAlbumin, OrthoSera GmbH, Krems an&#xD;
      der Donau, Austria) or anorganic bovine bone mineral (ABBM), (Bio-Oss Geistlich Wolhusen,&#xD;
      Switzerland). A porcine collagen membrane (Bio Gide, Geistlich GmbH, Wolhusen, Switzerland)&#xD;
      was placed over the lateral window and fixed by titanium pins (Titan Pin Set, Ustomed&#xD;
      Instruments Ulrich Storz GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Tuttlingen, Germany). The buccal flap was mobilized&#xD;
      to allow tension-free primary closure. The margins were stabilized with single interrupted&#xD;
      sutures. Antibiotics (1 g amoxicillin-clavulanate twice a day for 5 days, or in case of side&#xD;
      effects or known allergy to penicillin, 300 mg clindamycin 4 times a day for 4 days),&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs (50 mg diclofenac 3 times a day for 3 days), and chlorhexidine&#xD;
      mouthwash (twice a day for 21 days from the first day after surgery) were prescribed. Sutures&#xD;
      were removed after 10 days. After 6 months healing surgical re-entry procedure took place&#xD;
      under local anesthesia. A bone core biopsy was taken with a trephine with an external&#xD;
      diameter of 3.5 mm and an internal diameter of 2.5 mm (330 205 486 001 025 Hager &amp; Meisinger&#xD;
      GmbH, Neuss, Germany) and implants of at least 4.0 mm of diameter were placed into the&#xD;
      grafted alveolus nonsubmerged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histomorphometry Bone core biopsy material was fixed in 10% buffered formaldehyde solution.&#xD;
      Following decalcination and dehydration, the biopsy material was embedded in paraffin and 20&#xD;
      µm sections were prepared. The sections were stained with routine haematoxylin eosin stain.&#xD;
      Sections were evaluated under a light microscope in magnification 40×-400× .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histomorphometric measurements were completed on sections with Panoramic Viewer 1.15&#xD;
      (3DHISTECH Ltd., Budapest, Hungary) using a combination of Adobe PhotoShop (Adobe System&#xD;
      Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) and ImageJ, the public domain NIH Image program (US National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health' http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/) at 150× magnification. Two slides&#xD;
      of the augmented areas in each bone core biopsy sample were evaluated to record area&#xD;
      percentage of newly formed bone, residual particles of the bone graft material, and the bone&#xD;
      marrow space according to published protocols. Histomorphometric data consisted of the area&#xD;
      percentage of newly formed bone, residual particles of the graft material and bone marrow&#xD;
      were identified in each section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Micro-CT analysis The bone core biopsy samples were scanned using a microcomputed tomography&#xD;
      (μCT) scanner (Skyscan 1172 X-ray microtomograph, Bruker µCT, Kontich, Belgium). After the&#xD;
      acquisition, raw images were reconstructed using NRecon software (v.1.7.1.6., Bruker µCT,&#xD;
      Kontich, Belgium). The morphometric variables relevant to our study calculated by CTAn&#xD;
      software (v.1.17.7.2, Bruker µCT, Kontich, Belgium). On the reconstructed images of each&#xD;
      sample the demarcation plane of the host and the augmented area was identified and the&#xD;
      complete available tissue (maxilla or augmented bone, respectively) were selected as regions&#xD;
      of interest (ROIs) for quantitative analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Micromorphometric data was collected by evaluation of the augmented bone of the test or&#xD;
      control group. Additional micromorphometric data was recorded by analyzing the native bone of&#xD;
      the alveolar ridge within the bone core biopsy samples of both test and control group. The&#xD;
      microarchitectural parameters of the augmented bone of the BoneAlbumin group and the ABBM&#xD;
      group; the augmented bone of the BoneAlbumin group and the native bone of the alveolar ridge;&#xD;
      the augmented bone of the ABBM group and the native bone of the alveolar ridge were compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Percentage values of each bone core biopsy sample were used to calculate&#xD;
      descriptive statistics for the histomorphometrical and quantitative µCT analysis. The results&#xD;
      were analyzed statistically using the IBM SPSS Statistics 23 data analysis software program&#xD;
      (IBM Corporation, New York, NY. USA). The Kruskal Wallis One-way ANOVA test was used to&#xD;
      compare two sets of data for the statistical analysis of the histomorphometric results.&#xD;
      One-way ANOVA test was used to compare three sets of data for the statistical analysis of the&#xD;
      micromorphometric results of the micro-CT. Values of p &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBCT CBCT imaging (PaX-Reve3D, Vatech, Hwaseong, South-Korea) was carried out prior to sinus&#xD;
      floor elevation to evaluate the anatomy and possible pathology of the maxillary sinuses, then&#xD;
      6 months after bone augmentation prior to implant placement (preoperative CBCT), and 3 years&#xD;
      after implant placement (postoperative CBCT). To register the preoperative and postoperative&#xD;
      CBCT data by anatomical landmarks 3DSlicer 4.10.2 software (The Brigham and Women's Hospital,&#xD;
      Inc. Boston, USA) was used. The ROIs were identified by determining the central axis of the&#xD;
      implants and placing a virtual cylinder on the preoperative CBCT image sequence with a&#xD;
      diameter of 2,5 mm and the length of 8 mm on this axis corresponding with the inner&#xD;
      dimensions of the trephine used for bone core biopsy harvesting. The image sequences of&#xD;
      selected ROIs were imported in CTAn software (v.1.17.7.2, Bruker micro-CT, Kontich, Belgium)&#xD;
      and micromorphometric variables were calculated by the software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of CBCT results Correlation of the micromorphometric data obtained from&#xD;
      the CBCT images and micro-CT images was determined by The Spearman's rank-order correlation.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics 25 data analysis software&#xD;
      program (IBM Corporation, New York, USA). Values of P &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
