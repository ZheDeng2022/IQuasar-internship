  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical trial is relevant to public health because it is expected to expand the&#xD;
      differential diagnosis and provide an evidence--based therapy for the large population of&#xD;
      patients with angina in the absence of obstructive CAD who currently remain undiagnosed and&#xD;
      untreated. It, therefore, upholds an important part of the mission of the The National Heart,&#xD;
      Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), which is to promote the treatment of heart disease and&#xD;
      enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Angina in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) affects millions,&#xD;
      resulting in a reduced quality of life and a burden on the health care system. Previous work&#xD;
      has focused on endothelial and microvascular dysfunction as causes of angina in these&#xD;
      patients, but even when these etiologies are tested for, nearly half of patients remain&#xD;
      undiagnosed, and proven therapies are lacking. The long--term goal of this research proposal&#xD;
      is to improve the lives of patients with angina in the absence of obstructive CAD. These&#xD;
      patients have been found to have a disproportionate prevalence of myocardial bridges (MBs)&#xD;
      (60% vs. 30% in the general population).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MBs are known to cause angina, and the mechanism by which they do so is also known, but MBs&#xD;
      have not been actively studied in the context of patients with angina in the absence of&#xD;
      obstructive CAD. Medical therapies for symptomatic MBs, including beta blockers and calcium&#xD;
      channel blocker have been suggested, but have never been appropriately tested, and may not be&#xD;
      better than placebo. The overall objective of this research proposal is to demonstrate that&#xD;
      MBs are an important and treatable cause of angina in patients with non--obstructive CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will conduct the first--ever randomized, double--blind, placebo--controlled&#xD;
      trial of medical therapy in patients with angina and an MB. The rationale is that a proven&#xD;
      treatment would significantly expand the paradigm by which patients with angina in the&#xD;
      absence of obstructive CAD are evaluated and treated. Our central hypothesis is that beta&#xD;
      blockers and calcium channel blockers are effective treatments for reducing angina in&#xD;
      patients with an MB compared with placebo. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis&#xD;
      will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine the efficacy of beta blockers and&#xD;
      calcium channel blockers in treating patients with angina and an MB and 2) Identify&#xD;
      predictors of efficacy of beta blockers and calcium channel blockers in treating patients&#xD;
      with angina and an MB. For Aim #1, the investigator will randomize a total of 360 adult&#xD;
      patients with angina and an MB into one of three treatment arms: beta blocker (nebivolol),&#xD;
      calcium channel blocker (diltiazem), or placebo (1:1:1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be determined after 30 days on the study drug by a change in angina, as&#xD;
      assessed by the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ). The investigator will also evaluate&#xD;
      changes in exercise capacity, as well as drug adherence and side effects. For Aim #2, the&#xD;
      investigator will evaluate MB muscle index (MMI, a product of MB length x depth) by coronary&#xD;
      computed tomography angiography, as well as male sex, as predictors of efficacy.&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified on sex, ensuring a balance of women and men in each arm. The&#xD;
      proposed research is innovative because it shifts the current clinical perspective on angina&#xD;
      in the absence of obstructive CAD by considering myocardial bridging as a potential etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also significant because it will substantially increase the number of patients with&#xD;
      angina in the absence of obstructive CAD that clinicians are able to diagnose and treat,&#xD;
      ultimately leading to improvements in quality of life and a reduction in health care costs.&#xD;

    <description>Changes in exercise capacity will be measured by difference in exercise time increment between the groups. The Duke treadmill score is calculated as exercise time × (5 × ST-segment deviation) - (4 × exercise angina), with 0 = no angina, 1 = non-limiting angina, and 2 = exercise-limiting angina. Scores will be categorized as low risk (≥+5), moderate risk (-10 to +4) and high risk (≤-11).&#xD;
