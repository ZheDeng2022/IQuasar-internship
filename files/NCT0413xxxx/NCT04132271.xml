    <textblock>
      Dysphagia is a difficulty during the swallowing process (transportation food from the mouth&#xD;
      to the stomach. Oropharyngeal Dysphagia (OD) is diagnosed by videofluoroscopy and&#xD;
      faringolaringoscopy. OD threatens the efficacy and safety of swallowing, contributing to an&#xD;
      increased risk of aspiration and pneumonia. There are different interventions aimed to change&#xD;
      and improve the physiology of swallowing; however, OD can be an important predictor of the&#xD;
      progression of malnutrition in different types of patients. Malnutrition is defined as an&#xD;
      acute or chronic disease whereby an energy imbalance, lack of energy, protein or other&#xD;
      nutrients causes measurable and adverse effects on body composition, functional and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes. In addition, it leads to a decrease in the quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To establish a strategy of nutritional treatment and swallowing rehabilitation in&#xD;
      patients with dysphagia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: An adequate nutritional intervention in content and consistency, combined with&#xD;
      swallowing rehabilitation in patients with dysphagia, will improve the nutritional status and&#xD;
      clinical evolution of patients with dysphagia.&#xD;

      Introduction: Dysphagia is a difficulty during the swallowing process (transportation food&#xD;
      from the mouth to the stomach. Oropharyngeal Dysphagia (OD) is diagnosed by videoflouroscopy&#xD;
      and faringolaringoscopy and it is frequently associated with neurodegenerative problems. OD&#xD;
      threatens the efficacy and safety of swallowing, contributing to an increased risk of&#xD;
      aspiration and pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problem statement: There are different interventions aimed to change and improve the&#xD;
      physiology of swallowing; however, OD can be an important predictor of the progression of&#xD;
      malnutrition in different types of patients. Malnutrition is defined as an acute or chronic&#xD;
      disease whereby an energy imbalance, lack of energy, protein or other nutrients causes&#xD;
      measurable and adverse effects on body composition, functional and clinical outcomes. In&#xD;
      addition, it leads to a decrease in the quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification: It is essential to provide adequate nutritional interventions according to the&#xD;
      specifications of the dysphagia in order to improve the nutritional status of these patients,&#xD;
      as well to provide adequate early nutritional treatment when changing from tube to oral&#xD;
      feeding, focusing on dietary factors that can significantly improve nutrition of the patient.&#xD;
      However, there are no studies that evaluate the specific requirements for the nutritional&#xD;
      treatment of these patients. By implementing a diet based on improving the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of swallowing in patients with OD, specific nutritional recommendations that impact&#xD;
      on the rate of malnutrition and mortality of the different pathologies that present this&#xD;
      condition could be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To establish a strategy of nutritional treatment and swallowing rehabilitation in&#xD;
      patients with dysphagia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: An adequate nutritional intervention in content and consistency, combined with&#xD;
      swallowing rehabilitation in patients with dysphagia, will improve the nutritional status and&#xD;
      clinical evolution of patients with dysphagia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: This is a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial, in which OD patients&#xD;
      will be recruited to participate. The participants will be receiving swallowing&#xD;
      rehabilitation by a specialist phoniatrician. They will be randomise assigned to a special&#xD;
      nutritional treatment during 12 weeks. Swallowing rehabilitation, laboratory analyses,&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements and consume and quality of life questionaries will be carried&#xD;
      out.&#xD;
