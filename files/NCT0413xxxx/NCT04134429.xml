      In this pilot study the feasibility of continous monitoring of health data with a small,&#xD;
      on-skin wearable device (the Everion®, by Biovotion, Zurich) in pediatric patients under&#xD;
      chemotherapy for cancer, is studied. Feasibility is assessed by the number of patients&#xD;
      wearing the device on seven consecutive days for at least 18h/day, what will be measured by&#xD;
      monitored heart rate. Study duration for each participant is 14 days.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      No study has proved feasibility of continuous monitoring of health data with a small wearable&#xD;
      device such as the device Everion® in pediatric patients. It is not known if children&#xD;
      tolerate the device and if data quality sustains with smaller arm circumferences or when worn&#xD;
      on the upper leg. Neither is it known if parents and/or patients can and are willing to&#xD;
      handle the device in ambulant setting. Therefore, this pilot study assesses the feasibility&#xD;
      of continous monitoring of health data with a small, on-skin wearable device (the Everion®,&#xD;
      by Biovotion, Zurich) in pediatric patients under chemotherapy for cancer.&#xD;
