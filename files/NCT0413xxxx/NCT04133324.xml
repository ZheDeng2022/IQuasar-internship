  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of the C Protein Reactive&#xD;
      (CRP) for the detection of Anastomotic leakage after surgery for digestive cancer. The&#xD;
      standard protocol in our unit is to measure the CRP on the second and fourth postoperative&#xD;
      day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of the study is to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of the ratio CRP on the&#xD;
      fourth postoperative day on CRP on the second postoperative day (CRP_D4/CRP_D2). Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes are the diagnosis accuracy of the CRP_D4 and CRP_D2.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The occurrence of anastomotic fistula (AF) is the most feared complication after digestive&#xD;
      cancer surgery. It is responsible for high morbidity and accounts for more than a third of&#xD;
      the deaths observed. The rate of anastomotic fistula reported in the literature varies&#xD;
      between 1 and 40% according to the definition chosen by the authors. In the literature, the&#xD;
      occurrence of the anastomotic fistula is responsible for a mortality rate of 4% and an&#xD;
      overall morbidity of 35%. In the short term, the anastomotic fistula can put the patient's&#xD;
      vital prognosis at risk by its septic consequences. Also, it is responsible for increasing&#xD;
      the length of stay and costs. In the longer term, anastomotic fistula affects the functional&#xD;
      prognosis of the patient as well as oncology in patients operated for cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early rehabilitation becomes a standard in colorectal surgery, with exits around the 5th&#xD;
      postoperative day. Anastomotic fistulas and their complications may appear well beyond. The&#xD;
      diagnosis is made on average around 6-7 postoperative days. At an early stage, clinical signs&#xD;
      are inconsistent and not very specific. Anastomotic fistula can manifest itself in a variety&#xD;
      of clinical presentations, ranging from no symptoms to life-threatening septic shock. Routine&#xD;
      imaging is neither reliable nor cost-effective for the detection of anastomotic fistulas and&#xD;
      has the disadvantage of radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is necessary to find an intraperitoneal infection marker with a high negative predictive&#xD;
      value. This is particularly important in the era of early rehabilitation, allowing for safe&#xD;
      patient discharge with a low risk of readmission. C-reactive protein (CRP) has already shown&#xD;
      its utility in the early detection of infections after digestive surgery, however, because of&#xD;
      conflicting results, no clear recommendations are established in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study aims are to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of the postoperative CRP trajectory&#xD;
      as an approach to eliminate the diagnosis of anastomotic fistula and to try to establish an&#xD;
      optimal threshold with high sensitivity and negative predictive value.&#xD;
