  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and V938&#xD;
      shedding in participants with advanced/metastatic or recurrent malignancies who receive V938&#xD;
      in Combination with Pembrolizumab (MK-3475). The primary objective is to determine the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability and to identify a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of V938 administered in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
