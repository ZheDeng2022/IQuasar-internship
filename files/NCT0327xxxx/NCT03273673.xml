  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ACL injuries are common among athletes and due to residual muscle weakness, limited knee&#xD;
      motion and asymmetrical movement patterns after surgery many of these athletes will sustain&#xD;
      secondary ACL injuries following return to sports. This project seeks to determine if a novel&#xD;
      biofeedback-based rehabilitation approach can decrease a known risk factor for secondary&#xD;
      injuries to the ACL. The project specifically focuses on correcting asymmetric movement&#xD;
      patterns, a known risk factor for secondary injury that is not directly addressed by existing&#xD;
      interventions through a 6 week therapy based biofeedback intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 1 in 60 adolescent athletes will suffer ACL injuries. Approximately 90% of these&#xD;
      injured athletes will undergo an ACL reconstruction at an estimated annual cost of $3&#xD;
      billion. While reconstruction and subsequent rehabilitation allow these athletes to return to&#xD;
      sports, they have a 15 fold increased risk of secondary ACL injuries, a tear of the ACL graft&#xD;
      or the contralateral ACL. As a result, development of an intervention to reduce the incidence&#xD;
      of secondary ACL tears would meet a critical need. One area in which existing interventions&#xD;
      might be improved is through an increased emphasis on correcting asymmetric movement&#xD;
      patterns-a known risk factor for secondary injury. Thus, our long-term objective is to&#xD;
      decrease the number of secondary ACL tears by decreasing side-to-side movement and loading&#xD;
      asymmetry. The modification of post-operative rehabilitation to focus on movement and loading&#xD;
      symmetry with shift the rehabilitation paradigm. Specifically, we propose to evaluate a novel&#xD;
      biofeedback training program that focuses on altering loading and movement patterns to&#xD;
      improve symmetry and overall lower extremity mechanics in a group of 40 (20 control, 20&#xD;
      intervention) adolescent ACL reconstructed patients. There are two core hypotheses of this&#xD;
      study: 1) biofeedback training will decrease known risk factors for secondary ACL injuries&#xD;
      immediately following the biofeedback program and these changes will be retained 6 week after&#xD;
      the completion of the biofeedback program; and 2) we will be able to recruit and enroll 40&#xD;
      patients and retain 80% of the patients through the end of the follow-up assessment&#xD;
      demonstrating the feasibility of the biofeedback intervention. Implementation of a&#xD;
      biofeedback program prior to returning to dynamic athletic activities could improve physical&#xD;
      performance outcomes, decrease secondary injury risk factors and ultimately decrease the&#xD;
      long-term joint degeneration and development of osteoarthritis that has been associated with&#xD;
      ACL reconstruction. Ultimately this work will lead to additional investigations to&#xD;
      definitively determine the impact of this novel biofeedback program, which could shift the&#xD;
      post-operative rehabilitation paradigm following ACL reconstruction to improve long-term&#xD;
      joint health in these adolescent patients.&#xD;

    <description>The 6-week biofeedback training program is focused on altering loading and movement asymmetry during biweekly sessions on non-consecutive days (12 sessions). The biofeedback training program will provide sensory (visual and tactile) feedback to the subject to heighten awareness of asymmetrical movement strategies (e.g. load shift, movement asymmetry) during a squat. The two exercises that will be completed during the biofeedback training program will be a visual feedback squat and a resisted squat (tactile feedback). Each of these tasks will be completed 30 (3 sets of 10 repetitions) times per session. We will provide a 20 second rest between trials, and a 10 minute break between the visual and tactile feedback exercises to decrease the effect of fatigue.</description>

            <description>The 6-week biofeedback training program is focused on altering loading and movement asymmetry during biweekly sessions on non-consecutive days (12 sessions). The biofeedback training program will provide sensory (visual and tactile) feedback to the subject to heighten awareness of asymmetrical movement strategies (e.g. load shift, movement asymmetry) during a squat. The two exercises that will be completed during the biofeedback training program will be a visual feedback squat and a resisted squat (tactile feedback). Each of these tasks will be completed 30 (3 sets of 10 repetitions) times per session. We will provide a 20 second rest between trials, and a 10 minute break between the visual and tactile feedback exercises to decrease the effect of fatigue.&#xD;

The two exercises that will be completed during the biofeedback training program will be a visual feedback squat and a resisted squat (tactile feedback). Each of these tasks will be completed 30 (3 sets of 10 repetitions) times per session. We will provide a 20 second rest between trials, and a 10 minute break between the visual and tactile feedback exercises to decrease the effect of fatigue.&#xD;

These participants will be asked to meet 6 times during the 6-week intervention time period. Three of these visits will be completed in person and three will be completed using an online educational module (6 sessions). The online sessions will be completed in week 1, week 3, and week 5 while the in person sessions will be completed during week 2, week 4, and week 6.</description>
