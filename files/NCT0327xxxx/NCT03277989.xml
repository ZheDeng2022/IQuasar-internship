      Study Title INFINITY™Total Ankle Replacement Follow-up (ITAR) Study Design Prospective,&#xD;
      multi-site, multi-year post-market clinical follow-up study Study Group Primary/Unilateral&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary outcome measure of this post-market clinical observational study is to collect&#xD;
      data relating to the INFINITY™ Total Ankle System survivorship at 10 years. The secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures are to characterize the improvements after implantation over a 10 year&#xD;
      period using patient reported outcome measures related to quality of life, pain and&#xD;
      functional improvements, safety of the implants, as well as radiographic assessments (X-Rays)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measures collected in this study will be analyzed and reported as required for&#xD;
      local, regional, and country requirements (i.e., regulatory authorities and notified bodies).&#xD;
