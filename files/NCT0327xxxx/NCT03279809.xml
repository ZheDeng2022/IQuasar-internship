  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether administration of aspirin can help maintain the&#xD;
      patency of metallic stents for distal malignant common bile duct obstruction. Metal stents&#xD;
      are mainly used for malignant biliary obstruction if the surgical treatment is not considered&#xD;
      and its maintenance period has been reported to be about 8 months. This study will be&#xD;
      prospectively conducted as a randomized controlled study with aspirin treated patients who&#xD;
      received metal stents in patients over 20 years who were confirmed malignant distal biliary&#xD;
      obstruction. The primary endpoint is the incidence of stent dysfunction in both groups for 6&#xD;
      months after the procedure. The secondary endpoints included duration of metallic stent&#xD;
      patency, incidence of further procedures, and adverse events related with aspirin.&#xD;

      Background -Endoscopic drainage is the first choice for bile drainage in patients with&#xD;
      malignant distal biliary obstruction. Metal stents are mainly used for malignant biliary&#xD;
      obstruction if the surgical treatment is not considered. Metal stents have proven superior in&#xD;
      many clinical aspects over plastic stents. Nonetheless, the maintenance period of the&#xD;
      metallic stent patency has been reported to be around 8 months, and it is often necessary to&#xD;
      undergo further procedure due to dysfunction of stents. Recently, it has been reported that&#xD;
      the duration of the metallic stent patency in patients with aspirin is prolonged. Since the&#xD;
      previous study was a retrospective study, this study will be prospectively conducted as a&#xD;
      randomized controlled study with aspirin treated patients who received metal stents in&#xD;
      patients over 20 years who were confirmed malignant distal biliary obstruction. The incidence&#xD;
      of stent dysfunction in both groups for 6 months after the procedure will be compared. Stent&#xD;
      dysfunction is defined as any case which further procedure is required due to jaundice or&#xD;
      cholangitis after stent insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The aim of this study is to determine whether administration of aspirin can help maintain&#xD;
      the patency of metallic stents for distal malignant common bile duct obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blinding will remain in place until the statistician codes the statistical analyses of&#xD;
           the primary and secondary outcomes. The statistical analyses will be done using the full&#xD;
           analysis set according to the intention-to-treat principle, meaning all the randomized&#xD;
           patients will be analyzed in their allocated groups regardless of any protocol&#xD;
           violations or early treatment discontinuations. The outcomes through a per-protocol&#xD;
           analysis set that will consider only the subjects who followed the protocol effectively&#xD;
           will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The rate of stent dysfunction will be compared using Pearson's chi-squared test with&#xD;
           Fisher's exact test and calculated the odds ratio of the event. The secondary outcomes&#xD;
           (i.e., the duration of stent patency, the rate of reintervention, and the adverse events&#xD;
           related to aspirin administration) will be analyzed using Pearson's chi-squared test&#xD;
           with Fisher's exact test, Student's t-test, and Kaplan-Meier curves stratified by drug&#xD;
           and the hazard ratios between two groups using the Cox proportional hazards. The further&#xD;
           affecting factors for stent dysfunction will be assessed by univariable and&#xD;
           multivariable logistic regression analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the initial plan, it was decided not to perform interim analysis, but it was&#xD;
           confirmed that more adverse events occurred than expected in the process of conducting&#xD;
           the study. Therefore, the interim analysis was performed with the data up to May 2020,&#xD;
           and determine whether to continue the study by measuring the benefits and losses&#xD;
           obtained from aspirin.&#xD;
