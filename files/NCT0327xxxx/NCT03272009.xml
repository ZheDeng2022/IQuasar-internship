    <textblock>
      Bile acids regulating farnesoid X receptor (FXR) interact with hepatitis B virus replication.&#xD;
      EYP001a is a selective, synthetic FXR agonist under development for the treatment of&#xD;
      hepatitis B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase 1b study is designed primarily to determine the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of EYP001a in chronically HBV infected subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled two-part trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part A, EYP001a will be administered as 29 days monotherapy. Three dose-levels and 2&#xD;
      dosing regimens of EYP001a will be explored against placebo. The design also includes an&#xD;
      open-label standard of care Entecavir monotherapy arm (comparator). Subjects will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of the 6 treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment A: oral EYP001a&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment B: oral EYP001a&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment C: oral EYP001a&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment D: oral EYP001a&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment E: oral placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment F: oral Entecavir&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part B, EYP001a or placebo will be administered as 29 days combination therapy with the&#xD;
      standard of care Peg-IFNα2a. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the 3 treatment&#xD;
      arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment G: oral EYP001a plus open label Peg-INFα2a administered as subcutaneous&#xD;
           injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment H: oral EYP001a plus open label Peg-INFα2a administered as subcutaneous&#xD;
           injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment I: oral placebo plus open label Peg-INFα2a administered as subcutaneous&#xD;
           injection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects enrolled in Part A are eligible for participation in Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will include a 40 day screening period, a 29 day treatment period and a 6 day&#xD;
      follow-up evaluation period. For subjects who participate in both Parts A and B, a 14 washout&#xD;
      period between Parts A and B will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and tolerability of EYP001a will be assessed by evaluating physical examinations,&#xD;
      vital signs, ECGs, clinical laboratory parameters, and adverse events.&#xD;

             label dosages and paracetamol). On a case-by-case basis, regular co-medication either&#xD;
             as defined on the medication exception list or as documented by written approval from&#xD;

             be willing to use adequate contraception from screening until 90 days after the&#xD;
             follow-up visit. Adequate contraception is defined as using hormonal contraceptives or&#xD;
             an intrauterine device combined with at least 1 of the following forms of&#xD;
             contraception: a diaphragm or cervical cap, or a condom. Also, total abstinence, in&#xD;

             contraception and not donate sperm from the Day 1 visit to the clinical research&#xD;
             centre until 90 days after the follow-up visit. Adequate contraception for the male&#xD;
             subject (and his female partner) is defined as using hormonal contraceptives or an&#xD;
             intrauterine device combined with at least 1 of the following forms of contraception:&#xD;
             a diaphragm or cervical cap, or a condom. Also, total abstinence, in accordance with&#xD;
