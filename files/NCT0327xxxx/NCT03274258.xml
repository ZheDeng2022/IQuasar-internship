    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab and ipilimumab work in treating patients with&#xD;
      kidney cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab,&#xD;
      may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of&#xD;
      tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) of patients with locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) treated with combination of nivolumab plus&#xD;
      ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the efficacy and safety of the combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in&#xD;
      patients with RMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate potential biomarkers for patient stratification and treatment response, as&#xD;
      well as tumor antigen-specific immune responses, such as antibody and T cell responses, as&#xD;
      surrogates for anti-tumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and ipilimumab IV over 90&#xD;
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive nivolumab IV over 60&#xD;
      minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;

    <description>Descriptive statistics will include tabulations of frequencies. The estimate of the posterior ORR and its 95% credible interval will be estimated using the same prior as utilized in the futility monitoring rules. The posterior distribution for ORR of this trial will be compared to the historical data. The Kaplan-Meier method will be utilized to display time to ORR. Association with ORR, clinical benefit rate (CBR), or toxicity (TOX) events will be explored with logistic regression.</description>

    <description>Adverse effects that will be evaluated include, but are not limited to infections, renal toxicity, hepatic toxicity, and pulmonary toxicity. Methods of assessment will include monitoring blood counts, and performing laboratory tests as indicated by clinical signs and symptoms. Evidence of toxicity or adverse events will be recorded at all clinic visits. All observed adverse effects will be graded for all patients and the degree of association of each with therapy assessed.</description>
