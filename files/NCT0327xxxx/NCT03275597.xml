  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib study to evaluate safety and tolerability of dual checkpoint inhibition&#xD;
      (DCI) of durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) and tremelimumab (anti-CTLA-4) with SBRT in the treatment of&#xD;
      oligometastatic NSCLC. This study will examine the sequential delivery of SBRT to all disease&#xD;
      sites followed by combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab for patients for whom the goal&#xD;
      is ablating all known sites of disease. The investigators anticipate that for many&#xD;
      participants this will be the first line-therapy. Participants who have received&#xD;
      prior-platinum-based chemotherapy and/or any line of prior chemotherapy are eligible. Prior&#xD;
      immunotherapy treatment is not allowed.&#xD;
