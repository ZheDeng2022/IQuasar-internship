  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, multinational,&#xD;
      prospective study in patients with operable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension&#xD;
      (CTEPH) prior to pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) with high preoperative pulmonary vascular&#xD;
      resistance (PVR). Patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive riociguat or matching&#xD;
      placebo for 3 months before undergoing PEA. The primary objective of this study is to assess&#xD;
      the efficacy of riociguat on preoperative PVR compared to placebo in patients with operable&#xD;
      CTEPH.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study was stopped due to slower than expected recruitment and the additional limitations on&#xD;
    clinical research imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, both of which made study completion within&#xD;
    a reasonable timeframe appear unlikely.&#xD;
