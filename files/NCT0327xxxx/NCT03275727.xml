  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Internet-delivered interventions (IDI) can provide remarkable opportunities in&#xD;
      addressing breast cancer (BC) survivors' unmet needs, as they present an effective strategy&#xD;
      to improve care coordination and provide access to efficacious, cost-efficient and convenient&#xD;
      survivorship care. Nevertheless, research focusing on this field and aiming at improving&#xD;
      survivors´ psychosocial needs is scarce and its practical implementation is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: This study aims at studying BC patients´ and healthcare providers' attitudes&#xD;
      towards IDI; exploring BC patients´ unmet support needs and; determining the acceptability,&#xD;
      feasibility, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of iACT-BC, a guided internet-delivered&#xD;
      individually-tailored ACT-influenced cognitive behavioural intervention designed to improve&#xD;
      psychosocial outcomes in BC survivors when compared to treatment as usual. The primary&#xD;
      outcomes in this research are anxiety and depression. Secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      psychological flexibility, fatigue, insomnia, Sexual dysfunction (SD) and Health Related&#xD;
      Quality of Life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A multimethod research design will be applied and two consecutive studies will be&#xD;
      performed. Study 1 will explore participants´ attitudes towards IDI as well as, BC patients'&#xD;
      psychosocial unmet needs by adopting an exploratory cross-sectional study design. Study 2&#xD;
      will investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of iACT-BC in BC survivors, by&#xD;
      implementing a two-arm, parallel, open label, multicentre, waiting list randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results: It is anticipated that iACT-BC will show to be an effective and&#xD;
      cost-effective program in improving anxiety, depression, psychological flexibility, fatigue,&#xD;
      insomnia, SD and HRQoL in BC survivors, as opposing to a waiting list control under treatment&#xD;
      as usual. The results of this research will be published in accordance with CONSORT 2010 and&#xD;
      CONSORT-EHEALTH guidelines and should be available for publication in February 2020.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Breast Cancer (BC) ranks as the most frequent and lethal cancer among women, in&#xD;
      Portugal. However, advances in cancer detection and treatment contributed to a steady and&#xD;
      significant increase in survival over the past years, and 5-year age-standardized relative&#xD;
      survival is currently estimated to be 83,4%. This increase translates into a high and growing&#xD;
      number of BC survivors, with a considerable proportion of these patients experiencing&#xD;
      sequelae of treatment and late effects that can occur immediately to several years after&#xD;
      primary treatment ends. Anxiety, depression, fear of recurrence, existential related issues,&#xD;
      fatigue, pain, physical and cognitive impairment, tailored information needs, and sexual&#xD;
      dysfunction have been reported as the most common unmet support care needs experienced by&#xD;
      these women. The answer to these unmet support care needs relies, in part, on delivering&#xD;
      comprehensive, highly coordinated, patient-centred care. However, operationalizing such care&#xD;
      may prove difficult in a context of competing priorities and constrained health and social&#xD;
      care budgets. In this context, connected health, particularly internet-delivered&#xD;
      interventions, can provide remarkable opportunities in overcoming the aforementioned&#xD;
      constraints, as presenting an effective and innovative healthcare delivery model capable of&#xD;
      improving care coordination and providing access to efficacious, cost-efficient and&#xD;
      convenient survivorship care. Nevertheless, research focusing on this field and aiming at&#xD;
      improving survivors´ psychosocial needs is scarce and its practical implementation is&#xD;
      limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The objectives of this investigation are: studying BC patients´ and healthcare&#xD;
      providers' attitudes towards internet-delivered interventions; exploring breast cancer&#xD;
      patients´ unmet support care needs and; determining the acceptability, feasibility,&#xD;
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of iACT-BC, a guided internet-delivered&#xD;
      individually-tailored Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)-influenced cognitive&#xD;
      behavioural intervention designed to improve psychosocial outcomes in BC survivors when&#xD;
      compared to treatment as usual (TAU) in a waiting list control group (WLC). The primary&#xD;
      outcomes in this research are anxiety and depression. Secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      psychological flexibility, fatigue, insomnia, sexual dysfunction and Health Related Quality&#xD;
      of Life (HRQoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: We hypothesize that participants in the intervention group will have improved&#xD;
      anxiety, depression, psychological flexibility, fatigue, insomnia, sexual dysfunction and&#xD;
      HRQoL, when compared to a WLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A multimethod research design will be applied and two consecutive studies will be&#xD;
      performed: Study 1 - Population characterization study and Study 2 - Efficacy and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness study. Study 1 will explore participants´ attitudes towards&#xD;
      internet-delivered interventions as well as, BC patients' psychosocial unmet support needs by&#xD;
      adopting an exploratory cross-sectional study design. Study 2 will investigate the&#xD;
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of iACT-BC in BC survivors, by implementing a two-arm,&#xD;
      parallel, open label, multicentre, pragmatic, waiting list randomized controlled trial. A&#xD;
      Pilot study, mirroring the conditions applied in Study 2 should be performed in order to&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of iACT-BC. Results from this Pilot study should&#xD;
      be appraised and inform execution of Study 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval: This study will soon be submitted to evaluation by CNPD and local ethic&#xD;
      committees. Authorization to run the study is expected to be received until January 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results: It is anticipated that iACT-BC will show to be an effective and&#xD;
      cost-effective program in improving psychosocial outcomes such as anxiety, depression,&#xD;
      psychological flexibility, fatigue, insomnia, sexual dysfunction and HRQoL in BC survivors,&#xD;
      as opposing to a WLC under TAU. The results of this research will be published in accordance&#xD;
      with CONSORT 2010 and CONSORT-EHEALTH guidelines and should be available for publication in&#xD;
      February 2020.&#xD;
