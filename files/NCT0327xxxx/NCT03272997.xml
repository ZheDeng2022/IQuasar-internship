  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim is to asses the diagnostic power of 18F-FDG PET-CT in discriminating&#xD;
      malignant from nonmalignant causes in patients with a recurrent unilateral pleural effusion&#xD;
      of unknown origin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators follow the STARD 2015 guideline for reporting diagnostic accuracy studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will review the hospital's administrative database of patients who&#xD;
      underwent a thoracocentesis from January 2013 to January 2015. Patients at Department of&#xD;
      Respiratory Medicine, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde and Department of Respiratory&#xD;
      Medicine, Naestved Hospital, Region Zealand, Denmark (two large respiratory centres with&#xD;
      specialised functions) is eligible for inclusion. Patients are included irrespective of&#xD;
      cytology and chemical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will review the patients' medical records and images retrospectively. To&#xD;
      reduce the number of false negatives, the investigators complete a 1-year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients older than 16 years are included, irrespective of smoking history and comorbidities,&#xD;
      if both thoracocenteses, chest x-ray, a CT-scanning and a PET-CT scanning is performed.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are previously diagnosed lung cancer, thoracic malignancy or incomplete&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classification of results The investigators chose the combination of investigations&#xD;
      recommended by the internationally acknowledged BTS guideline, which is endorsed by the&#xD;
      Danish Society of Respiratory Medicine. Thoracocentesis, chest x-ray, CT findings and PET-CT&#xD;
      findings is categorized as either normal (i.e. not suggestive of any aetiology of the&#xD;
      unilateral pleural effusion), suggestive of other lung pathology or suggestive of malignancy&#xD;
      (i.e. representing a possible aetiology of the unilateral pleural effusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The thoracocentesis is classified as malignant if cytological examination revealed malignant&#xD;
      cells. The chest x-ray is classified as malignant if suspicion of malignant disease is not&#xD;
      rejected. The CT findings are classified as malignant according to Leung et. al. for pleural&#xD;
      abnormalities (circumferential pleural thickening, nodular pleural thickening, parietal&#xD;
      pleural thickening &gt; 1 cm and mediastinal pleural involvement) and The Fleischner Society for&#xD;
      parenchymal abnormalities (nodules &gt; 8 mm). The PET-CT findings are classified as malignant&#xD;
      if any findings suspicious for malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT and PET-CT images, as well as the scan reports by the radiologist and the nuclear medicine&#xD;
      physician, is reviewed by two experienced pulmonologists. They are blinded to all patient&#xD;
      information, including final diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final diagnosis, the reference standard, is extracted from the patients' medical records.&#xD;
      When no diagnosis is found, two investigators agree on a consensus diagnosis based on all&#xD;
      investigation results. If no reasonable diagnosis can be established based on the findings,&#xD;
      the patient case is categorized as having no final diagnosis. These cases are treated as a&#xD;
      worst-case scenario, i.e. patients with a malignant disease are treated as false negative,&#xD;
      and patients without malignant disease are treated as false positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Data are presented as frequencies and/or mean ± standard deviation (SD). Test&#xD;
      characteristics were compared using McNemar's test with Bonferroni correction (two-sided&#xD;
      level of significance &lt; o.o5). Diagnostic power of thoracocentesis, chest x-ray, CT-scanning,&#xD;
      PET-CT scanning and the combination are calculated. Diagnostic power is defined as true&#xD;
      positive, true negative, false positive, false negative, sensitivity, specificity, likelihood&#xD;
      ratio+, likelihood ratio-, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV)&#xD;
      and diagnostic accuracy (TP+TN)/(TP+FP+TN+FN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combined sensitivity will be calculated using the formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivitytest A + Sensitivitytest B + Sensitivitytest … - (Sensitivitytest A x&#xD;
      Sensitivitytest B x Sensitivitytest …)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combined specificity will be calculated using the formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specificitytest A x Specificitytest B x Specificitytest… Data were analyzed using STATA&#xD;
      (StataCorp LLC, Version 15.0, College Station, Texas, USA).&#xD;
