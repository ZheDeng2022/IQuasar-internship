      The Specifying and Treating the Anxiety Phenotype in Autism Spectrum Disorder (STAAR) study&#xD;
      aims to better characterize the sub-group of children and preadolescents with ASD that&#xD;
      exhibit clinically significant anxiety by conducting a 16-week randomized comparative&#xD;
      treatment trial of the Behavioral Intervention for Anxiety in Children with Autism (BIACA),&#xD;
      the medication sertraline, and placebo in youth with ASD ages 8-14 years old. The study&#xD;
      involves 2-3 half day telehealth visits for behavioral and medical assessments, 1-2 lab&#xD;
      visits for safety testing, and 1-2 optional fMRI visits. The study provides 16-weeks of&#xD;
      anxiety treatment involving weekly BIACA therapy either in-person or through telehealth, or&#xD;
      medical check-up visits either at the UC Davis MIND Institute or via telehealth. After study&#xD;
      completion a 3 month follow up call is conducted and participants in the placebo group are&#xD;
      given the option to participate in an additional study phase with the study treatment of&#xD;
      their choice. Study participation can be done remotely through the use of telehealth and&#xD;
      local labs, visits to the UC Davis MIND Institute are not required for most participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 40%-80% of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit&#xD;
      clinically significant anxiety symptoms. These symptoms are associated with increased social&#xD;
      deficits, depression, irritability, and stereotyped and self-injurious behaviors. Children&#xD;
      and adolescents with anxiety also frequently avoid potentially stressful situations, thereby&#xD;
      missing opportunities to learn important new skills. Despite the significant consequences of&#xD;
      anxiety symptoms, several critical treatment-relevant issues remain unresolved. First, there&#xD;
      is a lack of clarity about how to differentiate ASD and anxiety symptoms. Second, little is&#xD;
      known about how anxiety manifests in those with ASD and intellectual disability (ID). Third,&#xD;
      the neural substrates of anxiety in ASD are poorly understood. The overarching goal of this&#xD;
      project is to investigate these open issues in order to make interventions more precise, more&#xD;
      personalized, and more likely to promote positive outcomes -- an objective consistent with&#xD;
      the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Roadmap, Precision Medicine, and Research Domain&#xD;
      Criteria Project (RDoC) Initiatives and the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC)&#xD;
      Strategic Plan, Chapter 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there is no doubt that anxiety is a very serious issue for those with ASD, what to do&#xD;
      about this problem is less clear. The search for empirically-validated treatments has begun&#xD;
      with multiple small trials providing promising evidence that selective serotonin reuptake&#xD;
      inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) might reduce anxiety in those with&#xD;
      ASD. However, this work is in its early stages. There is a great need for large, rigorously&#xD;
      designed trials that validate the effectiveness of both medication and CBT, as well as&#xD;
      functional neuroimaging studies that identify neural predictors of treatment efficacy and&#xD;
      markers of therapy-induced change. Such work holds the potential to help answer the questions&#xD;
      posed above and to assist the field in developing more personalized treatments. In Project 1&#xD;
      of the Center for the Development of Phenotype-Based Treatments of Autism Spectrum Disorder,&#xD;
      we will conduct a study in children with ASD and clinically significant anxiety ages 8-14 to&#xD;
      compare efficacy of these different treatment types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aims of the study are to better characterize the sub-group of children and&#xD;
      preadolescents with ASD that exhibit clinically significant anxiety and fears through a&#xD;
      16-week randomized comparative treatment trial of Behavioral Intervention for Anxiety in&#xD;
      Children with Autism (BIACA), sertraline, and placebo in youth with ASD, IQ&gt;50, and&#xD;
      clinically significant anxiety as assessed by a PARS score that is greater than or equal to&#xD;
      8. Clinician-administered gold standard assays will be used of traditional DSM (Pediatric&#xD;
      Anxiety Rating Scale [PARS] and the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule-IV [ADIS-IV]), and&#xD;
      nontraditional ASD related anxiety symptoms (Autism Spectrum Addendum to the ADIS [ASDD]), as&#xD;
      well as parent reports of potentially overlapping symptoms that complicate the ASD anxiety&#xD;
      phenotype. Additionally fMRI will be used to investigate neural predictors of treatment&#xD;
      efficacy, markers of treatment induced change, and signatures of anxiety sub-types.&#xD;
