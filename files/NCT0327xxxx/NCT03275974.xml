      The clinical trial studies how well 11C-glutamine and 18F-FSPG positron emission tomography&#xD;
      (PET) imaging works in detecting tumors in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer&#xD;
      compared to standard imaging methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scanning.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish and validate a 11C-glutamine (11C-Gln) and fluorine F 18 L-glutamate&#xD;
      derivative BAY94-9392 (18F-FSPG) PET image guided gene signature to predict response to&#xD;
      EGFR-targeted therapy in patients with advanced wild-type RAS colorectal cancer (CRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive 11C-glutamine intravenously (IV) and undergo PET imaging over 120 minutes.&#xD;
      Beginning 2 hours to 7 days after 11C-glutamine PET, patients receive fluorine F 18&#xD;
      L-glutamate derivative BAY94-9392 IV and also undergo PET imaging over 120 minutes. During&#xD;
      each of the 11C-Glutamine and 18F-FSPG PET/CT scans, venous blood draws will be performed.&#xD;

    <description>The pharmacokinetic rate constants for 11C-Glutamine and 18F-FSPG will be determined using compartmental modeling of PET imaging data. Venous samples will be collected over the course of both 11C-Glutamine and 18F-FSPG scans for use in modeling.</description>

    <description>Change in tumor size will be derived from standard-of-care computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The tumor size will be reported as either the long-axis diameter or as tumor volume.</description>

    <measure>Gene expression</measure>
