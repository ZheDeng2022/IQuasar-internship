      Perioperative hypothermia carries high risk of associated complications. In the observational&#xD;
      study, the standard perioperative temperature management will be evaluated and the influence&#xD;
      of the hypothermia on the coagulation system according to routine coagulation testing in&#xD;
      combination with ROTEM will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative hypothermia is one of the complications of surgical interventions in total or&#xD;
      regional anaesthesia. It is defined as a drop in body core temperature under 36°C. It occurs&#xD;
      as a result of combination of anaesthesia, effecting of central thermoregulation control,&#xD;
      environment temperature (i.e. operating theatre) and unsufficient isolation combined with&#xD;
      patient's unability to actively warm up. As the body temperature drop in patients under&#xD;
      anaesthesia is very frequent, body temperature checks became part of surgical patients care&#xD;
      optimalisation. Furthermore, it is associated with complications, such as higher incidency of&#xD;
      surgical wound infection, elongated healing process, longer time spent in a hospital, cardiac&#xD;
      complications, elongated effect of most of anaesthetics, immunity and blood clotting&#xD;
      disorders. Hypothermia elongates the initial phase of coagulation and results in thrombocytes&#xD;
      malfunction. Normothermia reduces blood loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective observative study has two parts. In the first one, investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate the perioperative management of temperature in paediatric patients in Department of&#xD;
      children anaesthesia and intensive care, University hospital Brno, Czech republic, where is&#xD;
      intended to involve 1,000 patients. In the second phase, the patients who, based on the first&#xD;
      phase of the study, would be the most prone to perioperative hypothermia, will be examined&#xD;
      for any change of coagulation parameters related to the hypothermia. Investigators intend to&#xD;
      involve 100 consecutive patients of the original group. The examined parameters are standard&#xD;
      coagulation tests, EXTEM, FIBTEM tests obtained from a rotational thromboelastometry, or&#xD;
      other ROTEM test related to the particular pathology. Investigators will use a standardized&#xD;
      method of fluid management to affect dilutional coagulopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard perioperative patient's monitoring - temperature sensor monitoring of body&#xD;
      temperature, ECG, noninvasive blood pressure, oxygen saturation, EtCO2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temperature management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - the anaesthetist decides if some warming tools are needed and notes the used ones, which&#xD;
      involve: warmed infusion, heating blanked, air warming system, infusion pipe heater,&#xD;
      increasing of temperature in the operating theatre, covering the patient or another method of&#xD;
      temperature management&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitored parameters in the first phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body temperature before the intervention (measured in the office previously), operating&#xD;
           theatre's temperature at the beginning of anaesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body temperature during the intervention including the way of measuring, marked each 15&#xD;
           minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body temperature at the end of the entire intervention, including signs of the patient's&#xD;
           heat discomfort&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body temperature during resting time in the after-surgery resting room&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitored parameters in the second phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  monitored parameters in the first phase + following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood sampling for standard coagulation tests (following initial of general anaesthesia)&#xD;
           + EXTEM, FIBTEM, NATEM. In case of any pathology found here, more relevant test are run.&#xD;
           The test is analysed by anaesthetist or ICU doctor, where the ROTEM machine is.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood sampling for standard coagulation tests (prior to the end of the surgical&#xD;
           intervention) + EXTEM, FIBTEM, NATEM. In case of any pathology found here, more relevant&#xD;
           test are run. The test is analysed by anaesthetist or ICU doctor, where the ROTEM&#xD;
           machine is.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if body temperature is below 34°C, two sets of ROTEM tests are run: one at patient's&#xD;
           body temperature, following by another one at a standard temperature (37°C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistic evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  demographic - age, sex, type of surgery, duration of surgery, type of anaesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  changes of core temperature during the perioperative care and influence of used warming&#xD;
           tools, side effects of changes of core temperature&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  laboratory tests - standard coagulation tests and ROTEM - EXTEM, FIBTEM, NATEM test&#xD;
