      This study seeks to enroll patients receiving a Survivorship Care Plan following curative&#xD;
      therapy for cancer. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive usual care or to be&#xD;
      followed by a Patient Navigator as part of their Survivorship Care Plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participation for all participants will be for up to 9 months, with study visits&#xD;
      approximately every 3 months, based on standard clinical follow-up. All participants will be&#xD;
      administered quality of life surveys by a Clinical Research Associate at study entry,&#xD;
      mid-study (approximately 3-6 months) and at study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following factors will be compared between arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Missed/kept appointments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of urgent/emergent care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of Life in relation to survivorship care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants lost to care&#xD;

    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The research team will document the number of cancer care appointments scheduled and of those, how many appointments were missed (obtained by medical record and by patient report in case a visit was outside of study institution).</description>

    <measure>Urgent/emergent care</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The research team will document the number of urgent/emergent care visits attended within the study period of 9 months (obtained by medical record and by patient report in case a visit was outside of study institution).</description>

    <measure>Cancer Needs Distress</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will rate their feelings about 39 specific cancer needs on a 5 point scale from &quot;Not a Problem&quot; to &quot;Very Severe Problem&quot; using the Cancer Needs Distress Inventory (CaNDI) tool. Total scores can range from 39 to 195. Lower scores are associated with less cancer related distress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>New Survivor Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will rate their understanding about 16 specific aspects of survivorship care on a 4 point scale from &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; to &quot;Strongly Agree&quot; using the Preparing for Life as a New Survivor (PLANS) Scale. Total scores can range from 16 to 48. Lower scores are associated with less understanding of the survivorship care process.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lost to Care</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The research team will document the number of participants lost to care, based on consecutive missed cancer care visits.</description>
