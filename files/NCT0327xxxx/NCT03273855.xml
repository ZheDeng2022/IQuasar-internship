      This is a randomized, double-blinded and placebo controlled prospective trial with sixty&#xD;
      patients to investigate the effect of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on body weight&#xD;
      in patients with severe obesity. We will also collect data that possibly could give a better&#xD;
      understanding of mechanisms of this correlation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a main threat to public health in western countries. This condition increases the&#xD;
      risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, physical stress disorders,&#xD;
      dispose for cancer and contributes to increased overall morbidity and mortality. However&#xD;
      sustained weight loss lead to the reduction of risk factors and improvement of several&#xD;
      obesity related co-morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there are mainly two established treatments for severe obesity: a conservative&#xD;
      approach through lifestyle intervention and a surgical approach with bariatric surgery. The&#xD;
      gut microbiota is recognized as an environmental modulator of nutritional uptake and body&#xD;
      weight. This has led to the hypothesis that the gut microbiota could be a therapeutic target&#xD;
      fighting obesity. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been applied for more than 50&#xD;
      years, and is a established treatment for refractory recurrent infection with Clostridium&#xD;
      Difficile (CDI). Recent scientific studies have also applied FMT as treatment for other&#xD;
      diseases like inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel disease and even metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      and the results are promising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is determined based on data from the outpatient clinic at UNN Harstad medical&#xD;
      department. Patients here have an average weight loss of 2,5 % with conservative treatment.&#xD;
      This will therefore be the expected result in the control group (receiving placebo). A weight&#xD;
      reduction of 5-10% leads to significant improvement of health and quality of life, and a&#xD;
      weight change of this magnitude is therefore the hypothesis. The difference between the two&#xD;
      groups is estimated to 7,5 %. With these historical results, the sample size is estimated to&#xD;
      be 19 patients in each group. Extreme values will be eliminated; more than 3 SD out of the&#xD;
      average in the group. In this patient group, we must also be prepared to high degree loss of&#xD;
      follow-up near one third, which is also the experience from the clinic. We will include&#xD;
      totally 60 patients, 30 in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are planning a randomized, double-blinded and placebo controlled&#xD;
      prospective trial with sixty patients to investigate the effect of fecal microbiota&#xD;
      transplantation (FMT) on body weight in patients with severe obesity. In the trial there will&#xD;
      also be collected data that possibly could give a better understanding of mechanisms of this&#xD;
      correlation; with insulin resistance, blood pressure, complete body scan, inflammation and&#xD;
      biochemical parameters of hepatic steatosis, changes in the patients microbiota and the&#xD;
      development in quality of life as secondary outcome measures.&#xD;

    <description>Participants which had undergone intervention and were in the follow up period, had all their appointments at the obesity clinic at UNN Harstad canceled, due to the covid-19 outbreak in the period march-20 to juli-20. This might have impacted their weight loss motivation and life style changes. We therefore asked them five questions, which we hope will shed light on the challenges they might encountered during the period of restrictions implemented by the Norwegian government.</description>

We will encourage the participant to keep the solution in the colon as long as possible and give them four pills of loperamide before the procedure in order to reduce bowel motility.</description>
