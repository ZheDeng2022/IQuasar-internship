  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic intervention with REACT is intended to delay the need for renal replacement&#xD;
      therapy (dialysis or transplant) which, based on the current standard of care, is inevitable&#xD;
      for patients with end stage CKD. The purpose of the present study is to assess the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of up to 2 injections of REACT given 6 months (+4 weeks) apart (maximum).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      REACT is made from expanded autologous selected renal cells obtained from each individual&#xD;
      subject's kidney biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects enrolled will receive REACT. Subjects will receive their first REACT injection&#xD;
      as soon as the REACT product is manufactured and shipped to the clinical site. After 6 months&#xD;
      (+4 weeks), a second injection will be given, as appropriate. Each subject's baseline rate of&#xD;
      renal decline, based on adequate historical clinical data obtained 24 months prior to&#xD;
      screening visit, will serve as a comparator for monitoring the rate of progression of renal&#xD;
      insufficiency over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of progression of renal insufficiency (assessed via serial measurements of eGFR&#xD;
      through 24 months after the last REACT injection) will be compared against the individual&#xD;
      subject's rate of eGFR decline through 24 months following the final REACT treatment. The&#xD;
      rate of progression of renal insufficiency from subjects (if any) who received a single REACT&#xD;
      injection may be compared against that from subjects who received two REACT injections.&#xD;

             as having an eGFR between 14 and 20 mL/min/1.73m2 inclusive at the Screening Visit and&#xD;
             prior to NKA injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject has blood pressure less than 150/90 at the Screening Visit, prior to renal&#xD;
             biopsy, and prior to NKA injection(s). Note BP should not be significantly below the&#xD;
             previously recorded stable pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The subject has stable blood pressure or has ongoing and stable treatment with an&#xD;
             angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin receptor blocker&#xD;
             (ARB) initiated at least 8 weeks prior to renal biopsy. Treatment must be stable&#xD;
             during the 6 week period immediately prior to NKA injection. Stable treatment is&#xD;
             defined as dose adjustment no less than one half of the current dosage and no more&#xD;
             than 2 times the current dosage. Dose interruptions up to 7 days due to medical&#xD;
             necessity are allowed.&#xD;

          7. A minimum of 3 measurements of eGFR or sCr should be obtained at least 3 months apart&#xD;
             prior to the Screening Visit or within the previous 24 months to define the rate of&#xD;
             progression of CKD. The subject should have adequate, historical clinical data to&#xD;
             provide a reasonable estimate of the rate of progression of CKD. The Medical Monitor&#xD;
             may be consulted to ensure there is sufficient data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The subject is willing and able to refrain from NSAID consumption (including aspirin)&#xD;
             as well as clopidogrel, prasugrel, or other platelet inhibitors during the period&#xD;
             beginning 7 days before through 7 days after both the renal biopsy and NKA&#xD;
             injection(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The subject is willing and able to refrain from consumption of fish oil and platelet&#xD;
             aggregation inhibitors, such as dipryridamole (ie, Persantine®), during the period&#xD;

             assessed by ultrasound and/or MRI prior to renal biopsy, unless earlier radiology&#xD;

             function during the last 3 months prior to NKA injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. The subject has any of the following conditions prior to NKA injection: renal tumors,&#xD;

         18. The subject has clinically significant hepatic disease (ALT or AST greater than 3&#xD;
             times the upper limit of normal) as assessed at the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. The subject is positive for active infection with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), or&#xD;
             Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), and/or Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) as assessed at the&#xD;

         21. The subject is immunocompromised or is receiving immunosuppressive agents, including&#xD;
             individuals treated for chronic glomerulonephritis within 3 months of NKA injection.&#xD;
             Note: inhaled corticosteroids and chronic low-dose corticosteroids (less than or equal&#xD;
             to 7.5 mg per day) are permitted as are brief pulsed corticosteroids for intermittent&#xD;
             symptoms (eg, asthma).&#xD;
&#xD;

             during the course of the study. Or, the female subject is of child-bearing potential&#xD;
             and is not using a highly effective method(s) of birth control, including sexual&#xD;
             abstinence. Or, the female subject is unwilling to continue using a highly-effective&#xD;
             method of birth control throughout the duration of the study. Note: A highly effective&#xD;
             method of birth control is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (ie, less&#xD;
             than one percent per year) when used consistently and correctly, such as implants,&#xD;
             injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices IUDs, sexual&#xD;

             by participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
