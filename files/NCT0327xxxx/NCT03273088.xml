  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to demonstrate pharmacokinetic (PK) similarity of biosimilar candidate&#xD;
      Altebrel relative to etanercept reference product (Enbrel®) and evaluate safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of Altebrel, in a crossover fashion in healthy male volunteers after&#xD;
      administration of a single dose (25 mg) of etanercept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that the PK of Altebrel is similar to&#xD;
      its originator, Enbrel®, as assessed by the area under the serum concentration time curve&#xD;
      (AUC) from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUCinf) and the Cmax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further compare the PK of Altebrel and Enbrel®. To assess the safety of Altebrel.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-dose trial with one administration of each product (Altebrel and Enbrel®).&#xD;
      Each subject participates in two treatment period, and are randomised to receive Altebrel or&#xD;
      Enbrel® in a crossover fashion. The subjects are closely monitored during the following 24&#xD;
      hours (h), and are allowed to leave the site in the next morning post evaluation and blood&#xD;
      samples are collected prior to and at the following time points after the dose: 6, 12 and 24&#xD;
      hours post-dose (on day 2). The subjects are requested to visit the trial site 36, 48, 60,&#xD;
      72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 216, 312 and 480 h after dose administration for blood sampling and&#xD;
      evaluation of safety variable and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before initiation, the trial is reviewed by food and drug administration of Iran. The&#xD;
      protocol, electronic case report form (eCRF), information for subjects and informed consent&#xD;
      form are submitted to the ethics committees responsible for review and approval purposes,&#xD;
      according to national regulatory guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, no subject is recruited without an informed consent. All the informed consent&#xD;
      forms which are signed by the subjects have two copies so that subjects could receive a copy&#xD;
      of it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a crossover trial with a single dose of Altebrel and Enbrel®, separated by 28 days.&#xD;
      34 (group A=17, group B=17) eligible subjects have been planned to enter to the study. All of&#xD;
      whom are aged between 18 and 55 years. Subjects' randomization is done, using permuted block&#xD;
      and subjects are assigned to treatment sequences AB or BA. Both groups receive 25 mg of&#xD;
      either of the drugs as a single subcutaneous injection. The injection method and prefilled&#xD;
      syringes are totally the same in both groups. The primary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      demonstrate that the PK of Altebrel is similar to its originator, Enbrel®, as assessed by the&#xD;
      area under the serum concentration time curve (AUC) from time 0 extrapolated to infinity&#xD;
      (AUCinf) and the Cmax. Secondary objectives include assessment of the time to Cmax (tmax),&#xD;
      AUC from time 0 to the last quantifiable concentration (AUClast) of Altebrel compared with&#xD;
      Enbrel®, as well as evaluation of safety and tolerability. The safety endpoints of the trial&#xD;
      are to evaluate the incidence of reported adverse effects, detecting changes in vital signs,&#xD;
      clinical laboratory tests (hematologic, biochemistry, urine analysis and urine culture tests)&#xD;
      and ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an equivalence test of means using two one-sided tests on data from a two-period&#xD;
      cross-over design, a total sample size of 34 achieves 81% power at a 10% significance level&#xD;
      when the true ratio of the means is 1/0000, the coefficient of variation on the original,&#xD;
      unlogged scale is 0/3600, and the equivalence limits of the mean ratio are 0/8000 and 1/2500.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AryoGen pharmed Company conducts clinical trials according to procedures that incorporate the&#xD;
      ethical principles of GCP. Accurate and reliable data collection was assured by verification&#xD;
      and cross-check of the eCRFs against the subject's records by clinical monitors (source&#xD;
      document verification was performed), and the maintenance of a drug-dispensing log by the&#xD;
      center. A comprehensive validation check program was used to verify the data, and discrepancy&#xD;
      reports were generated accordingly for resolution by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double-blind trial. During the clinical phase of the trial, neither the subjects&#xD;
      nor the site personnel are aware of the identity (Altebrel and Enbrel®) of the treatments&#xD;
      administered. However, there is an unblinded person who receives the randomisation list and&#xD;
      dispenses the trial drugs according to the list. The unblinded person is not otherwise&#xD;
      participate in the execution of the trial. The randomisation list determines the dispensing&#xD;
      order of the trial products for each subject and only the randomisation number appear on the&#xD;
      sample collection logs, as well as, on the sample aliquots delivered to the bioanalytical&#xD;
      laboratory. Thus, the personnel responsible for analysing the PK samples are also be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation envelopes are stored in the ISF, in a locked cabinet. In a case of emergency,&#xD;
      the code of an individual subject may be opened and the reasons for opening will be&#xD;
      documented and the subject will be discontinued from the trial&#xD;
