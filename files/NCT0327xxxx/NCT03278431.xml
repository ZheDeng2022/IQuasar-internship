  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than one billion people are infected with soil-transmitted helminths (STH, A.&#xD;
      lumbricoides, hookworm or Trichuris trichiura). Preventive chemotherapy - i.e. annual or&#xD;
      biannual treatment of at-risk populations with albendazole or mebendazole is the current&#xD;
      strategy against STH. However, the efficacy of both drugs is only moderate against hookworm&#xD;
      and low against T. trichiura. For increasing the efficacy and to avoid drug resistance, new&#xD;
      drugs or the combination of different drugs is the way forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomised controlled trial, we assess the efficacy (based on cure rates) of&#xD;
      different drug combinations in school-aged children in Lao. 420 hookworm positive children&#xD;
      will be treated: 140 with albendazole-oxantel pamoate, 140 with albendazole-pyrantel&#xD;
      pamoate-oxantel pamoate treatment arms, 70 with pyrantel pamoate-oxantel pamoate and 70 with&#xD;
      mebendazole-pyrantel pamoate-oxantel pamoate. Two stool samples will be collected at baseline&#xD;
      and follow-up (14-21 days after treatment) and analysed with Kato-Katz.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      More than one billion people are infected with A. lumbricoides, hookworm or Trichuris&#xD;
      trichiura, the so-called soil-transmitted helminths (STH). Preventive chemotherapy - i.e.&#xD;
      annual or biannual treatment of at-risk populations, is the current strategy against STH&#xD;
      advocated by the World Health Organization. However, the currently used drugs albendazole and&#xD;
      mebendazole have only moderate efficacy against hookworm and low against T. trichiura. The&#xD;
      main challenge is their temporal decrease in efficacy, which might be associated with drug&#xD;
      resistance, as it was shown in veterinary medicine. For increasing the efficacy and to avoid&#xD;
      drug resistance, new drugs or the combination of different drugs is the way forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy (based on cure rates [CR]) of&#xD;
      the three combinations, i.e. albendazole-oxantel pamoate, pyrantel pamoate-oxantel pamoate&#xD;
      and albendazole-pyrantel pamoate-oxantel pamoate in school-aged children infected with&#xD;
      hookworms in Laos. Secondary objectives include; i) a proof of concept, investigating the&#xD;
      difference between the two triple combinations albendazole-pyrantel pamoate-oxantel pamoate&#xD;
      versus mebendazole-pyrantel pamoate-oxantel pamoate (based on CRs), ii) egg reduction rates&#xD;
      (ERR) against hookworm and ERRs/CRs against A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura and iii)&#xD;
      tolerability of the 4 combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two stool samples will be collected from school-aged children (age 6-15) at baseline. 420&#xD;
      hookworm positive children will be treated: 140 with albendazole-oxantel pamoate, 140 with&#xD;
      albendazole-pyrantel pamoate-oxantel pamoate, 70 with pyrantel pamoate-oxantel pamoate and 70&#xD;
      with mebendazole-pyrantel pamoate-oxantel pamoate treatment arms The medical history of the&#xD;
      participating children will be assessed with a standardized questionnaire, in addition to a&#xD;
      clinical examination carried out by the study physician on the treatment day. Children will&#xD;
      be interviewed before treatment for clinical symptoms and 3 and 24 hours after treatment&#xD;
      about the occurrence of adverse events. The efficacy of the treatment will be determined&#xD;
      14-21 days post-treatment by collecting another two stool samples. All stool samples will be&#xD;
      examined with duplicated Kato-Katz thick smears.&#xD;
