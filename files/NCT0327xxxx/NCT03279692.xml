  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug as a possible treatment for High Grade Meningioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug involved in this study is an immunotherapy drug called pembrolizumab&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved pembrolizumab for this&#xD;
      specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are studying pembrolizumab in participants with&#xD;
      meningioma. Research studies have shown that meningioma tumor cells express a gene called&#xD;
      PD-L1. The investigators will be looking to determine whether the study drug may may stop&#xD;
      meningioma tumors from growing.&#xD;

             scans separated by no more than 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Residual measurable disease: For Grade II or III meningioma, residual measurable&#xD;
             disease immediately after surgery without requirement for progression. Residual&#xD;

             progressive disease outside of the radiation field do not need to wait 24 weeks from&#xD;
             completion of radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Measurable Disease: Measurable disease is defined by a bidimensionally measurable&#xD;

             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years&#xD;
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;

             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with pembrolizumab. In addition,&#xD;
             these participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;

             [qualitative] is detected).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:&#xD;
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and&#xD;
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-MistÂ®) are live&#xD;
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.&#xD;
