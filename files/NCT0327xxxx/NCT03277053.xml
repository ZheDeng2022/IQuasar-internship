      A randomized control trial on patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal resection in an&#xD;
      Enhanced Recovery Program (ERP). The intervention is delivered via an electronic application&#xD;
      containing guidelines, information, and tailored feedback. The hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      application will improve adherence to the ERP.&#xD;

      Introduction: Enhanced Recovery Programs (ERP) in colorectal surgery reduce postoperative&#xD;
      morbidity and shorten length of hospital stay with no increase in readmission rates. However,&#xD;
      poor adherence to ERP elements remains a challenge. Recent studies suggest that the use of&#xD;
      mobile device applications has the potential to improve patient compliance with treatment&#xD;
      guidelines. We recently developed and pilot tested a mobile app to support an ERP for&#xD;
      colorectal surgery which collects patient-reported recovery information and engages patients&#xD;
      as stakeholders in their recovery process. The overall aim of this study is to estimate the&#xD;
      extent to which the use of this mobile device app impacts adherence to postoperative ERP&#xD;
      elements in comparison to standard preoperative education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. The proposal is for a two-group, assessor-blind, randomized trial including adult&#xD;
      patients with colorectal diseases planned for surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned into one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. usual perioperative education and audit, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a mobile device application for postoperative education and self-audit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be delivered through a tablet present at the bedside with an&#xD;
      application which links education, recovery planning, and daily self-assessment to a plan of&#xD;
      care. It educates patients about daily recovery milestones and track their adherence. The&#xD;
      primary outcome will be patient adherence to postoperative enhanced recovery elements. Other&#xD;
      targeted outcomes include self-reported recovery, satisfaction and patient activation.&#xD;
      According to an a priori power analysis, a sample of 104 patients (52 per group) is targeted&#xD;
      for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: This study will contribute evidence regarding the use of mobile device&#xD;
      technology for education and the direct involvement of patients as stakeholders in&#xD;
      postoperative recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study findings have the potential to increase patient engagement in the care pathway,&#xD;
      which has the potential to increase compliance to pathway elements and improve postoperative&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
