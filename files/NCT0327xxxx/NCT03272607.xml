      Reducing medications and associated side effects in older adults: an electronic&#xD;
      hospital-based intervention&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polypharmacy, or the concomitant use of 5 drugs or more, is a serious health concern and&#xD;
      affects more than half of Canadians aged 65 years and older. It is the number one&#xD;
      identifiable risk factor for adverse drug events (ADEs), which are responsible for 27,000&#xD;
      hospital admissions annually in Canada and up to 20% of return visits to the hospital within&#xD;
      30 days of discharge. Many ADEs are preventable or ameliorable through interventions to&#xD;
      reduce inappropriate prescribing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MedSafer, the intervention software, applies an electronic set of criteria, previously&#xD;
      designed and piloted on one thousand (1000) hospitalized patients by a group of Quebec and&#xD;
      Ontario internists, geriatricians, palliative care doctors and pharmacists, to identify&#xD;
      potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) in the hospitalized elderly and generate&#xD;
      instructions for the patient and physician for safe discontinuation. The current study seeks&#xD;
      to partially automate the deprescribing process and to demonstrate the efficacy of this type&#xD;
      of intervention on adverse drug events at 30-days post hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of hospitalization, the patient's medications, co-morbidities, and a measure of&#xD;
      frailty will be entered into the MedSafer software which will output an individualized and&#xD;
      prioritized deprescription plan for the most responsible physician's consideration. Any&#xD;
      subsequent medication changes will be transmitted to relevant community physicians. The study&#xD;
      will evaluate the impact of stopping PIMs on the occurrence of ADEs within 30 days of&#xD;
      discharge, as compared to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place on the clinical teaching units (CTUs) at 11 hospitals from seven&#xD;
      university hospital centres across Canada. Based on historical data, the investigators&#xD;
      estimate a combined 5200 eligible patients per year with nearly 50% taking ten or more&#xD;
      medications. Many will have multiple medical co-morbidities such as diabetes, heart disease,&#xD;
      and renal insufficiency. A large portion will meet criteria for geriatric syndromes such as&#xD;
      frailty and will be at high risk for the development of delirium, falls and functional&#xD;
      decline. This population is ideal for a generalizable deprescribing study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients aged 65 or older who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled. A&#xD;
      trained research assistant will identify eligible patients and medications will be screened&#xD;
      using MedSafer. A deprescribing plan will be generated for the CTU team containing the&#xD;
      rationale for suggested medication changes and strategies for safe and successful&#xD;
      deprescription. The CTU team will then decide, in conjunction with the patient/proxy and&#xD;
      relevant consultants, whether to apply the suggested modifications.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The duration of the project will be a total of (approx.) 96 weeks. This is a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial study design (see PDF attachment entitled &quot;MedSafer, Figure 1&quot; - note start date will be August 2017 not July 2016). The intervention component will be administered sequentially to six (6) clusters (by city). A randomly selected single cluster will move from control data collection to intervention data collection every 200 patients or roughly every 12 weeks (96 total weeks), which will be followed by 12 weeks to complete follow up and another 36 to analyze data.&#xD;
Please see PDF attachment entitled &quot;MedSafer, Figure 2&quot; which refers to both parts of the study (quality improvement and follow up components). It describes the follow up component of the study (a 30-day telephone follow-up to ascertain adverse drug events- please note the gray-shaded boxes refer to the Quality Improvement Project-Part 1).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Post-discharge telephone interview performed by trained personnel using a modification of the Australian two-step adverse reaction and drug event report.&#xD;
Two trained and blinded clinician reviewers will independently use the Leape and Bates approach to assess whether an ADE was present (yes/no) and if so what was the nature of the injury resulting from it using a four-point Likert scale (definitely preventable, probably preventable, probably not preventable, and definitely not preventable), and assess the probability that an event was attributable to a specific drug that was newly started, changed or continued during hospitalization. In cases of disagreement, a third trained and blinded clinician will review and determine the final assessment.</description>
