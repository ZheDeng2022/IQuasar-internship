      This is a prospective, multi-center, research study designed to evaluate the acute&#xD;
      achievement of pulmonary vein (PV) isolation with ThermoCool SmartTouch (ST) and ThermoCool&#xD;
      SmartTouch SF (STSF) catheter using the Ablation Index Module.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) will undergo catheter&#xD;
      ablation using commercially approved devices (mapping system and catheters).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up for 12 months to measure the recurrence of AF. This study is&#xD;
      expected to start in September 2017 and to continue for approximately 26 months. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that this study will require approximately 12 months for subject enrollment.&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up for at least 12 months. Data analysis is expected to require&#xD;
      approximately 2 months. At least 320 consecutive patients will be enrolled in the study&#xD;
      centers. Patients will be divided in 4 groups and enrollment will stop when at least 80&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in each group. The investigators evaluate two ablation catheters&#xD;
      (ST and STSF) and two different ablation index settings (380 posterior - 500 anterior and 330&#xD;
      posterior - 450 anterior). Given that the rate of PV isolation with a standard wide antral&#xD;
      circumferential ablation technique (WACA) is about 70%, the investigators want to test if one&#xD;
      of two catheters or one of ablation index settings can increase the PV isolation rate of at&#xD;
      least 10% (from 70% to 80%, 95% CI 75-85%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint The primary objective of this study is to evaluate which ablation strategy&#xD;
      increase the rate of WACA PV isolation, validated by mean of LASSO catheter, after first&#xD;
      encirclement, from 70% to 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints Incidence of early PV reconnection 30 minutes after acute PV isolation.&#xD;
      Difference in procedural and fluoroscopy time between the two groups. Incidence of AF&#xD;
      recurrence during the blanking period (3-months after ablation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety of the ablation procedure. At least 320 patients undergoing catheter ablation for&#xD;
      paroxysmal or persistent AF will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria The following criteria must be met for subjects to be eligible for&#xD;
      inclusion into the study Subject is indicated for catheter ablation for paroxysmal AF Subject&#xD;
      is &gt; 18 years old Subject is &lt; 80 years old Subject is on adequate anticoagulation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria The following criteria are exclusions for study participation Patients who&#xD;
      had already undergo an AF ablation procedure Patients with left ventricular ejection fraction&#xD;
      &lt; 35% Women of childbearing potential who are or might be pregnant Hematological&#xD;
      contraindications to ionizing radiation exposure Presence of complex congenital heart&#xD;
      disease, and cardiac surgery within 1 month from enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened in ambulatory and scheduled for AF ablation according to current&#xD;
      guide lines. Ablation will be usually performed under effective oral anticoagulation.&#xD;
      Anticoagulation could be withdrawn before admission, so as antiarrhythmic drugs will be&#xD;
      removed before scheduled procedure. Patients in AF or with a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 1 will&#xD;
      undergo transesophageal echocardiography within 48 hours prior to the ablation. For all other&#xD;
      patients transesophageal echocardiography is optional. Cardiac MRI or Cardiac CT scan could&#xD;
      be executed as a reference for volume estimations obtained with the mapping system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ablation will be carried out under mild or conscious sedation, at least 2 femoral vein access&#xD;
      will be obtained and in some patients 1 subclavian vein. One diagnostic catheter will be&#xD;
      positioned in the coronary sinus. One or two transseptal accesses to the left atrium will be&#xD;
      achieved using a standard approach. Then, the LASSO catheter and the ablation catheter (ST&#xD;
      and STSF) will be placed in the left atrium. Heparin will be administered before the&#xD;
      transseptal punctures to maintain an activated clotting time ≥ 300 seconds for the duration&#xD;
      of the procedure. Left atrium mapping will be performed in sinus rhythm. Patients with atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation at the beginning of the index procedure will undergo electrical cardioversion.&#xD;
      After left atrium reconstruction the effective PV-left atrium electrical connection will be&#xD;
      checked with LASSO. In all groups a wide antrum circumferential ablation aimed at PV&#xD;
      isolation will be performed using contact force threshold range between 5-40 g (14), and the&#xD;
      Ablation Index Module, with the following preset: respiration adjustment; stability range 3&#xD;
      mm, stability time 3 sec, force over time 25% of time, 3 g and ablation index thresholds: 500&#xD;
      for anterior wall and 380 for posterior wall or 450 for anterior wall and 330 for posterior&#xD;
      wall; contiguity lesion 5-6 mm (15-16). The default power setting will be 30 W, with ranges&#xD;
      of 20-40 W. At the end of the ablation effective PV isolation (entry and exit block), will be&#xD;
      checked with LASSO catheter. After PV isolation will be achieved, the reconnection of the&#xD;
      same vein will be evaluated after a 30 minute period from the initial isolation or after&#xD;
      adenosine infusion or isoproterenol. If the vein reconnects to the atrium, the ablation will&#xD;
      be directed to the gaps identified by the LASSO catheter. All patients will undergo a&#xD;
      post-procedural ECG and, optional, an echocardiogram to exclude pericardial effusion or other&#xD;
      acute complications. After ablation, patients will undertake regular follow-up assessments&#xD;
      (scheduled at 3 months) including a detailed history, physical examination, 12-lead standard&#xD;
      electrocardiography, and 24-h Holter monitoring. Patients who will not report any symptoms&#xD;
      related to the previous arrhythmia during a supplementary detailed follow up (6-12 months&#xD;
      subsequent to catheter ablation) will be considered free of arrhythmia recurrence&#xD;
