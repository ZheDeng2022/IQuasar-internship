  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cesarean section is one of the most common surgeries performed with the intention of&#xD;
      optimizing maternal and fetal/neonatal outcomes. One of the major indications for cesarean&#xD;
      delivery is &quot;non-reassuring fetal status&quot; (NRFS). Electronic fetal monitoring is used to&#xD;
      evaluate and manage women while they are in labor. A fetal heart rate tracing is recorded on&#xD;
      paper or electronically and produces a pattern to allow physicians to visually identify&#xD;
      fetuses that are at risk for hypoxia and/or acidemia. This practice allows for prompt&#xD;
      intervention via intrauterine resuscitation and expedited delivery if deemed necessary.&#xD;
      National and international guidelines published by the International Federation of Gynecology&#xD;
      and Obstetrics and American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology describe how fetal heart&#xD;
      rate patterns obtained with electronic fetal monitoring should be interpreted and managed. In&#xD;
      order to interpret fetal heart rate patterns, the ability to visualize a pattern is&#xD;
      necessary. This is made possible either by using paper on which the fetal heart rate is&#xD;
      recorded or electronic screens with recording systems. In hospitals where continuous fetal&#xD;
      heart rate monitoring is available, but paper resources are depleted and electronic screens&#xD;
      are not available, an image of the fetal heart rate pattern cannot be produced nor&#xD;
      interpreted. Thus, electronic fetal monitoring is used as an incomplete tool has become&#xD;
      standard of care for laboring patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historical Western data revealed that implementation of continuous fetal monitoring with&#xD;
      pattern interpretation increased rates of cesarean delivery in comparison to intermittent&#xD;
      auscultation. However, it is not clear if the inability to interpret a pattern (because of a&#xD;
      lack of paper or electronic recording) results in increased or decreased cesarean rates in&#xD;
      comparison to pattern interpretation. It is possible that the implementation of pattern&#xD;
      interpretation could decrease cesarean delivery rates allowing increased or earlier&#xD;
      opportunity for fetal resuscitation for patients with tracing abnormalities which may avert&#xD;
      cesarean delivery. The investigators' aim is to assess cesarean delivery rates using&#xD;
      electronic fetal monitoring with versus without pattern interpretation in a hospital in a&#xD;
      low-middle income country where resources are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a decrease in cesarean delivery rate is observed and/or neonatal outcomes are improved,&#xD;
      this study may serve as an impetus to encourage electronic fetal monitoring paper-producing&#xD;
      companies to subsidize or donate supplies to hospitals in developing countries. Ensuring that&#xD;
      fetal status is in fact non-reassuring by fetal heart rate pattern interpretation prior to&#xD;
      proceeding with cesarean delivery may decrease the cesarean delivery rate while not&#xD;
      compromising fetal outcomes.&#xD;

      &quot;Intrapartum electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) also known as cardiotocography (CTG) is used&#xD;
      for most women who give birth in the United States,&quot; as per American College of Obstetrics&#xD;
      and Gynecology (ACOG) Practice Bulletin 116 - Management of Intrapartum Fetal Heart Rate&#xD;
      Tracings. This document regarding recommendations of intrapartum management functions on the&#xD;
      assumption that electronic fetal monitoring is being recorded, either on paper or&#xD;
      electronically, to allow for interpretation of the pattern of the fetal heart rate over time.&#xD;
      In the US, the widespread availability of electronic medical record systems allows continuous&#xD;
      visualization of fetal heart tracings. In hospitals that have not transitioned to electronic&#xD;
      recording of fetal heart rate tracings, these tracings are continuously recorded on paper.&#xD;
      The guidelines put forth by ACOG in Practice Bulletin 116 define how to interpret patterns of&#xD;
      fetal heart rates, and furthermore, how to manage patients based on these interpretations by&#xD;
      categorizing features of tracings that are concerning vs. reassuring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), of which ACOG is a member,&#xD;
      produced several documents in 2015 to address Consensus Guidelines for Intrapartum Fetal&#xD;
      Monitoring. The document addressing CTG for an international audience provides the same&#xD;
      guidelines for interpretation of fetal heart tracing patterns as ACOG, and very similar&#xD;
      recommendations for management based on slightly different categorization terminology. Both&#xD;
      the ACOG Practice Bulletin and the FIGO Consensus Guideline addressing intrapartum fetal&#xD;
      monitoring describe fetal heart rate patterns including baseline rate, variability,&#xD;
      accelerations, and decelerations. Specifically, they address the various types of&#xD;
      decelerations, some of which are benign, and others which are ominous for fetal well-being,&#xD;
      as well as the importance of variability in assessing fetal well-being. For example, moderate&#xD;
      baseline variability reflects the oxygenation of the central nervous system and reliably&#xD;
      predicts the absence of ongoing hypoxic injury and metabolic acidemia at the time it is&#xD;
      observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative method for intrapartum fetal monitoring is via intermittent auscultation (IA).&#xD;
      IA is a technique by which the fetal heart rate is appreciated by a stethoscope, fetoscope,&#xD;
      or handheld Doppler to assess the fetal heart rate over established periods of time during&#xD;
      different stages of labor, but does not produce a continuous numerical output of the fetal&#xD;
      heart rate. As such, certain features of a fetal heart rate pattern cannot be evaluated by&#xD;
      IA, including fetal heart rate variability or the different types of decelerations. According&#xD;
      to the FIGO Guidelines on Intermittent Auscultation, &quot;Based on expert opinion, IA should be&#xD;
      recommended in all labors in settings where there is no access to CTG monitors or to the&#xD;
      resources necessary for using them. When the resources for CTG monitoring are available,&#xD;
      intermittent auscultation may be used for routine intrapartum monitoring in low-risk cases.&#xD;
      However, approximately half of the panel members believe that continuous CTG should be the&#xD;
      option during the second stage of labor, although there is no direct scientific evidence to&#xD;
      support this.&quot; In settings where CTG is available, the conditions required to use IA are&#xD;
      stringent and even preclude patients who don't deliver within 1 hour of pushing. Furthermore,&#xD;
      management of abnormal findings on IA includes proceeding to CTG if it is available. These&#xD;
      provisions to using IA convey the implication that it is preferred to have CTG available for&#xD;
      use, if possible. It is important to note that electronic fetal monitoring without paper or&#xD;
      the ability to interpret a pattern, is not the same as IA or electronic fetal monitoring as&#xD;
      described above. Therefore, there is no set of guidelines to interpret and manage patients&#xD;
      monitored with continuous monitoring without pattern interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In many developing countries, hospitals have the ability to provide intrapartum electronic&#xD;
      fetal monitoring. At Ayder Referral Hospital, a teaching hospital for Mekelle University,&#xD;
      labor and delivery is equipped with electronic CTG monitors that display fetal heart rate in&#xD;
      real time, and potentially have the ability to record on paper. Secondary to limited number&#xD;
      of CTG monitors, EFM is reserved for use for patients who are considered &quot;high risk,&quot; and IA&#xD;
      is used to monitor patients who are &quot;low risk.&quot; &quot;High risk&quot; patients are those who have&#xD;
      maternal conditions or fetal conditions that prompt higher level of fetal monitoring, such as&#xD;
      pre-eclampsia, history of prior cesarean delivery, or concerns regarding fetal well-being.&#xD;
      However, at this hospital, as in many other hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa, paper strip&#xD;
      supplies were depleted and have not been replenished. Thus, patients are currently monitored&#xD;
      intrapartum with a live feedback of fetal heart rate, but with no ability to interpret fetal&#xD;
      heart rate pattern. Management of patients in this setting is based on real-time fetal heart&#xD;
      rates that are continuously observed, which is an intermediate entity of fetal monitoring for&#xD;
      which there are no established recommendations for management. Neither the ACOG Bulletin nor&#xD;
      the FIGO Consensus Guidelines address CTG/EFM without pattern interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a setting such as Ayder Referral Hospital in Mekelle, making efforts to minimize the&#xD;
      cesarean delivery rate while optimizing neonatal outcomes is paramount for many reasons. In&#xD;
      Mekelle, personal and socioeconomic implications of a major surgery such as cesarean delivery&#xD;
      are considered seriously, and refusal of cesarean delivery is higher in many developing&#xD;
      countries in comparison to resource-rich countries. Furthermore, performance of a cesarean&#xD;
      delivery in a patient population that has a high aversion to cesarean delivery puts these&#xD;
      patients at risk of avoiding a subsequent delivery in a hospital to avoid a repeat cesarean&#xD;
      section, which can have dire consequences. Preventing adverse fetal outcome is equally as&#xD;
      important as preventing unnecessary cesarean section, as resources available for neonatal&#xD;
      resuscitation are limited in comparison to developed countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there is a lack of data regarding the use of EFM without pattern interpretation, the&#xD;
      investigators' hypothesis is that the implementation of EFM with pattern interpretation will&#xD;
      result in a decrease in cesarean delivery rates without altering neonatal outcomes. This&#xD;
      hypothesis arises from anecdotal experience. Providers at Ayder Referral Hospital and the&#xD;
      principal investigator's observation of the intrapartum management on Labor and Delivery&#xD;
      noted that several of the cesarean deliveries that occurred may have been averted given the&#xD;
      opportunity for intrauterine resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective cohort study comparing current standard of care at Ayder Referral Hospital&#xD;
      (EFM without pattern interpretation for high risk obstetric patients) with EFM as per ACOG&#xD;
      and FIGO recommendations (with pattern evaluation) may reveal a change in cesarean delivery&#xD;
      rate and/or neonatal outcomes.&#xD;
