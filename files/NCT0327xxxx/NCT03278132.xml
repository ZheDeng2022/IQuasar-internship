      This study is an open-labelled, single-centered, stratified-randomized, phase IV clinical&#xD;
      trial. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of EV71 vaccine&#xD;
      (developed by Sinovac Biotech Co., Ltd.) in infants aged 6 to 35 months old, by detecting the&#xD;
      dynamic changes of neutralizing antibody at different times after vaccination. The enrolled&#xD;
      subjects in this study receive two doses of EV71 vaccine with 1-month interval between doses.&#xD;
      To evaluate safety of the vaccine, subjects will be observed for 30 days after the injection&#xD;
      for the potential adverse events. To evaluate the immunogenicity of the vaccine, venous blood&#xD;
      will be collected for the neutralizing antibody detection prior to vaccination, 10/20/30 days&#xD;
      after the 1st dose and 30 days after the 2nd dose vaccination. All subjects will receive&#xD;
      blood sampling for three times. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive blood sampling&#xD;
      at 10/20/30 days after 1st dose injection, with a ratio of 1: 1: 1.&#xD;
