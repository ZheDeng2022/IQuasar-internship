    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating the safety and effectiveness of 2 immunotherapy drugs in&#xD;
      combination with radiation therapy as a possible treatment for recurrent or metastatic&#xD;
      gynecologic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the immunotherapy drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Durvalumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tremelimumab&#xD;

      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      drug or drugs and also tries to define the appropriate dose and combination of the&#xD;
      investigational drugs to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drugs are&#xD;
      being studied but have not been approved by the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab is considered to be&#xD;
      investigational and as such has not been approved for this or any cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -- Durvalumab and tremelimumab are immunotherapy drugs that may stop cancer cells from&#xD;
      growing by activating the immune system. The immune system is one of the body's natural&#xD;
      defenses against the growth of cancer cells. AstraZeneca has evaluated the effectiveness and&#xD;
      side effects of both durvalumab and tremelimumab individually for many cancer types,&#xD;
      including lung, head and neck cancer, and melanoma. These types of immunotherapy drugs are&#xD;
      also being studied in ovarian, endometrial and cervical cancer. In addition, AstraZeneca has&#xD;
      studied the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab in participants with lung and&#xD;
      pancreatic cancers. Based on these studies, AstraZeneca has determined the dosing, schedule&#xD;
      and expected side effects for the 2 study drugs when delivered together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In women with recurrent or metastatic gynecologic cancer, radiation therapy is often used to&#xD;
      help with symptoms, such as bleeding, pain or swelling. Clinical reports have shown that&#xD;
      radiation treatment can increase the body's response to an immunotherapy drug against tumors&#xD;
      both within and outside the radiation field. This study is the first in which the combination&#xD;
      of durvalumab, tremelimumab and abdominal or pelvic radiation is given to humans. The&#xD;
      investigators hope that this combination with radiation will lead to a better treatment&#xD;
      response to the immunotherapy drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also look to see if participants whose tumors contain a particular&#xD;
      genetic make-up have a better response to immunotherapy and radiation treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
             Subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study&#xD;
             including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow&#xD;
             up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed endometrial, ovarian&#xD;
             (including ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal), cervical, vaginal,&#xD;
             or vulvar cancer that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or&#xD;
             palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have measurable disease, defined as at least 1 lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for&#xD;
             non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as ≥20 mm with conventional&#xD;
             techniques or as ≥20 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. See&#xD;
             Section 11 for the evaluation of measurable disease. See also 3.1.10 as all&#xD;
             measurable/target lesions must not be located within the planned radiation field for&#xD;
             the expansion cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have progressive disease following prior therapy. Specifically, patients&#xD;
             must have progressed on platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 21 days must have elapsed from prior therapy (chemotherapy or radiation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age of 18 years or older. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently&#xD;
             available on the use of durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab and radiation in&#xD;
             patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤1 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight of greater than 30 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hgb &gt;=9g/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets ≥100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin &lt;=1.5 x normal institutional limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  --- This last criterion will not apply to patients with confirmed Gilbert's&#xD;
                  syndrome (persistent or recurrent hyperbilirubinemia [predominantly unconjugated&#xD;
                  bilirubin] in the absence of evidence of hemolysis or hepatic pathology), who&#xD;
                  will be allowed in consultation with their physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤3 × institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
                  --- OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine clearance &gt;40 mL/min by the Cockcroft-Gault formula (Cockcroft and&#xD;
                  Gault 1976) or by 24-hour urine collection for determination of creatinine&#xD;
                  clearance:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Males:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Creatinine CL (mL/min) = Weight (kg) x (140 - Age)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Females:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Creatinine CL (mL/min) = Weight (kg) x (140 - Age) x 0.85&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have at least one lesion not previously irradiated (and not within a&#xD;
             previously irradiated field) for which palliative radiation to the abdomen and/or&#xD;
             pelvis is potentially indicated and could be safely delivered at the radiation doses&#xD;
             specified in this protocol. This lesion must not be within the CNS (brain or spinal&#xD;
             cord), bone or liver, and must not require urgent or emergent palliative radiation&#xD;
             given the timing of radiation specified on this protocol. Furthermore, this lesion&#xD;
             must be located in the abdomen or pelvis and measure at least 2 cm (minimum dimension)&#xD;
             and no greater than 6 cm (maximum dimension). Palliative radiotherapy would entail&#xD;
             involved-field radiotherapy to a single lesion or region to encompass gross disease;&#xD;
             whole-abdomen radiotherapy would not be permitted. Patients who received prior vaginal&#xD;
             brachytherapy would be permitted to receive palliative pelvic radiation. In the&#xD;
             expansion cohort at the MTD, this lesion must not be the only measurable lesion (as&#xD;
             defined in 3.1.3) so that it is possible to determine the response rate outside of the&#xD;
             radiation treatment field.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of durvalumab and tremelimumab on the developing human fetus are unknown.&#xD;
             For this reason and because radiation is known to be teratogenic, evidence of&#xD;
             post-menopausal status or negative urinary or serum pregnancy test for pre-menopausal&#xD;
             patients is required. Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have been&#xD;
             amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following&#xD;
             age-specific requirements apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women &lt;50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been&#xD;
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal&#xD;
                  treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone&#xD;
                  levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical&#xD;
                  sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women ≥50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been&#xD;
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal&#xD;
                  treatments, had radiation-induced oophorectomy with last menses &gt;1 year ago, had&#xD;
                  chemotherapy-induced menopause with &gt;1-year interval since last menses, or&#xD;
                  underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy&#xD;
                  or hysterectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women of child-bearing potential who are sexually active with a non-sterilized&#xD;
                  male partner must agree to use at least 1 method of highly effective&#xD;
                  contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to&#xD;
                  study entry and for the duration of study participation and for 180 days after&#xD;
                  the last dose of therapy. Highly effective methods of contraception, defined as&#xD;
                  those that result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used&#xD;
                  consistently and correctly, are described in section 5.5. Should a woman become&#xD;
                  pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she&#xD;
                  should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior exposure to immune-mediated therapy, including anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1 (including&#xD;
             durvalumab) or anti-CTLA-4 directed therapy (including tremelimumab). Therapeutic&#xD;
             anticancer vaccines are not included in this category. Exposure to other&#xD;
             investigational agents may be permitted after discussion with the Study PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy, targeted therapy, biologic or hormonal agents within 3 weeks prior to&#xD;
             entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiation therapy within 3 weeks prior to entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current receipt of any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any unresolved toxicity of NCI CTCAE Grade ≥2, including electrolyte abnormalities,&#xD;
             from previous anticancer therapy, with the exception of alopecia, vitiligo, and the&#xD;
             laboratory values defined in the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with Grade ≥2 neuropathy will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis after&#xD;
                  consultation with the Study Physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with irreversible toxicity not reasonably expected to be exacerbated by&#xD;
                  treatment with durvalumab or tremelimumab may be included only after consultation&#xD;
                  with the Study Physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with untreated brain metastases, spinal cord compression, or leptomeningeal&#xD;
             carcinomatosis are excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis,&#xD;
             because of symptoms that may arise from inflammatory reactions, and because they often&#xD;
             develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of&#xD;
             neurologic and other adverse events. Patients with brain metastases or spinal cord&#xD;
             compression previously treated with radiation and/or surgery are allowed if local&#xD;
             treatment was &gt;30 days ago, most recent MRI demonstrates stability or decrease in size&#xD;
             of all lesions, and the patient has no current neurologic symptoms related to the&#xD;
             metastases and treatment and no requirement for corticosteroids related to the prior&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to tremelimumab and durvalumab or previous toxicity attributed to&#xD;
             durvalumab or other PD-1 or PD-L1 directed therapy that led to drug discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, uncontrolled hypertension, interstitial lung disease, pneumonitis, active&#xD;
             peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, active bleeding diatheses, or serious chronic&#xD;
             gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because durvalumab and tremelimumab are&#xD;
             immune checkpoint inhibitors with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient&#xD;
             effects, as is radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A nursing mother unwilling to discontinue breastfeeding. Because there is an unknown&#xD;
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with durvalumab, tremelimumab and radiation, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with durvalumab, tremelimumab and radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding or female patients of reproductive&#xD;
             potential who are not willing to employ effective birth control from screening to 180&#xD;
             days after the last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy or 90 days&#xD;
             after the last dose of durvalumab monotherapy, whichever is the longer time period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients are ineligible due to the risks associated with immune&#xD;
             checkpoint blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first&#xD;
             dose of durvalumab and tremelimumab. The following are exceptions to this criterion:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injections (e.g.,&#xD;
                  intra-articular injection)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed 10 mg/day of&#xD;
                  prednisone or its equivalent&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Steroids as pre-medication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT scan&#xD;
                  pre-medication)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgical procedure (as defined by the Investigator) within 28 days prior to the&#xD;
             first dose of immunotherapy. Note: Local surgery of isolated lesions for palliative&#xD;
             intent is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allogeneic organ transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders. Patients without&#xD;

                  before the first dose of study drug and of low potential risk for recurrence&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence&#xD;
                  of disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adequately treated carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease (e.g., cervical&#xD;
                  cancer in situ)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mean QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) ≥470 ms calculated from 3 consecutive&#xD;
             electrocardiograms (EKGs) using Fridericia's Correction at baseline or before dosing.&#xD;
             Thereafter, only 1 EKG is required during visits unless an abnormality is found and in&#xD;
             which case, confirmation by triplicate EKGs will be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of active primary immunodeficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of previous clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active infection including hepatitis B (known positive HBV surface antigen [HBsAg]&#xD;
             result) or hepatitis C. Patients with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the&#xD;
             presence of hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible.&#xD;
             Patients positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain&#xD;
             reaction is negative for HCV RNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             investigational treatment. Note: patients, if enrolled, should not receive live&#xD;
             vaccine during the study and up to 30 days after the last dose of investigational&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
