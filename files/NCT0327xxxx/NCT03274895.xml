      Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 0.08% PHMB ophthalmic&#xD;
      solution in subjects affected by Acanthamoeba keratitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 130 subjects will be assigned to one of the following 2 treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: 0.08% PHMB + placebo Group 2: 0.02% PHMB + 0.1% propamidine combination therapy&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, assessor-masked, active-controlled, multiple center, parallel-group&#xD;
      Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 0.08% PHMB ophthalmic&#xD;
      solution compared to the conventional 0.02% PHMB + 0.1% propamidine combination therapy in&#xD;
      male and female subjects affected by Acanthamoeba keratitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a superiority study with the possibility to test for non-inferiority&#xD;
      if the superiority hypothesis is not met, according to the requirements of the guidance from&#xD;
      the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMA) (CPMP/EWP/482/99).The&#xD;
      study consists of an eligibility screening visit, a treatment period including short ambulant&#xD;
      visits, and follow-up visits. A total of approximately 130 subjects affected by Acanthamoeba&#xD;
      keratitis will be assigned to one of the following 2 treatment groups in a ratio of 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: 0.08% PHMB + placebo Group 2: 0.02% PHMB + 0.1% propamidine combination therapy&#xD;
