  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients at risk of developing life-threatening heart rhythms may require the implantation of&#xD;
      a small device called a cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), which constantly monitors the heart&#xD;
      rhythm and delivers an electrical shock to the heart when indicated, in order to return the&#xD;
      heart back to a normal rhythm. Many thousands of these devices have been implanted and are&#xD;
      electrically active in patients who collapse and need resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a patient with an ICD collapses, the device may discharge without warning while a&#xD;
      rescuer is performing external chest compressions (cardiac massage). Conventional ICDs placed&#xD;
      below the left collar bone typically deliver 35-50 J energy when they discharge, but newer&#xD;
      ICDs placed under the skin (S-ICD) alongside the breastbone deliver a larger energy when&#xD;
      discharging; typically 50-80J energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescuers performing external chest compressions on a patient during conventional ICD&#xD;
      discharge have reported the sensation of a painful electrical shock and permanent nerve&#xD;
      damage. In these situations, rescuers appear to have been exposed to electrical current from&#xD;
      the ICD considerably in excess of that which is considered a safe threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies of surface current resulting from discharge of conventional ICDs have been reported&#xD;
      in excess of 100 mA which is far in excess of the safe 1 mA limit, and puts the rescuer at&#xD;
      considerable risk of tissue damage and possible dangerous heart rhythms. The newer S-ICDs&#xD;
      deliver approximately 50% more energy and have the potential to result in exposure of a&#xD;
      rescuer to even higher currents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With increasing numbers of the S-ICDs being implanted, and the inevitability that rescuers&#xD;
      will soon find themselves exposed to leakage current from these devices, there is a need to&#xD;
      examine the leakage currents arising from these devices and assess any subsequent risk to a&#xD;
      rescuer performing external chest compressions.&#xD;

      Rationale for Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When patients undergo elective implantation of an ICD, the device is tested by inducing&#xD;
      ventricular fibrillation (VF) in the patient and allowing the ICD to sense, charge and&#xD;
      discharge in an attempt to shock the patient back into a normal rhythm. This provides a&#xD;
      controlled, elective situation in which to measure the cutaneous current on the patient's&#xD;
      skin which is the current to which a rescuer could potentially be exposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By understanding the leakage currents from these devices, the investigators will be able to&#xD;
      better understand the safety of rescuers in contact with patients fitted with an ICD and make&#xD;
      specific recommendations to enable to safe undertaking of uninterrupted external chest&#xD;
      compressions while the ICD may be discharging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure cutaneous leakage current on the chest wall during conventional and S-ICD&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To make recommendations based on this data regarding the safety of rescuers in contact with a&#xD;
      patient during ICD discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENDPOINTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum cutaneous current measured at multiple sites on the chest wall during ICD discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN This is a prospective cohort study, aiming to study sequential patients&#xD;
      undergoing elective ICD implantation and testing over a 12 month period at University&#xD;
      Hospital Southampton.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will undergo elective ICD implantation according to normal protocol. There will&#xD;
      be no change in their treatment. After induction of general anaesthesia, an array of small&#xD;
      self-adhesive electrodes (similar to ECG 'dots') will be placed on the patient's chest wall,&#xD;
      and connected to a multichannel recording device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After implantation of the ICD, the device will be tested as per normal protocol. VF is&#xD;
      induced in the patient. The ICD senses this arrhythmia, charges and immediately delivers a&#xD;
      shock to the myocardium. As this shock is delivered, the investigators will record the&#xD;
      current reaching the surface electrode array using the multichannel recorder. Most patients&#xD;
      only require one shock as defibrillation rates with ICDs are &gt;90%. If a second shock is&#xD;
      required, the ICD will charge automatically and discharge once again. If this occurs, the&#xD;
      investigators will also measure the cutaneous current at this second, higher energy level.&#xD;
      The study is then concluded. Any subsequent shocks are delivered through external paddles and&#xD;
      the investigators would not require any data from this stage of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION Number of Participants The investigators aim to assess 20 patients&#xD;
      undergoing conventional ICD implantation and a further 20 patients undergoing S-ICD&#xD;
      implantation.&#xD;
