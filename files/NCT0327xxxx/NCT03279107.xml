  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to describe the glycemic, insulinemic and appetitive responses to&#xD;
      liquid and solid foods where either soluble fiber or maltodextrin are used as the&#xD;
      carbohydrate substrate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asia has the unenviable reputation as being the epicenter for type 2 diabetes. The Asian&#xD;
      phenotype has been shown to be most susceptible to diabetes than Caucasians. More&#xD;
      importantly, the transition from prediabetes to diabetes is more drastic and severe in&#xD;
      Asians. The glycemic index (GI) was first introduced in 1981 as a classification of the blood&#xD;
      glucose raising potential of carbohydrate foods. There is substantial evidence suggesting&#xD;
      that consumption of low glycemic index (GI) foods minimize blood glucose fluctuations, and&#xD;
      help in the prevention and management of diabetes and prediabetes. Given the rising incidence&#xD;
      of prediabetes and diabetes in Asia, dietary interventions to complement pharmacological&#xD;
      management of diabetes are increasingly being encouraged. The majority of studies on GI and&#xD;
      Glycemic Response (GR) have been conducted on Caucasian populations. Asians have been shown&#xD;
      to have a greater GR to the same food compared to Caucasians. Simple dietary modification&#xD;
      such as increasing dietary fiber in a food has been shown to reduce GR. However, it is&#xD;
      unclear if a palatable, low-viscous, soluble fiber and maltodextrin have comparable effect.&#xD;
      Although viscous insoluble fiber has been shown to also suppress appetite, it was unclear if&#xD;
      similar effects could be obtained when it is replaced with soluble fiber. Using the&#xD;
      continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS), Henry and his colleagues have demonstrated that&#xD;
      exchanging high-GI bread with a low-GI bread could improve the 24h glucose profile. More&#xD;
      recently investigators have shown, using the CGMS, that the consumption of a low GI breakfast&#xD;
      and afternoon snack was capable of attenuating 24-hour blood glucose profiles, minimizing&#xD;
      glycemic excursions and reducing food intake in healthy Asian males. These simple dietary&#xD;
      interventions appear to be an acceptable approach in improving overall glycemia and energy&#xD;
      balance in Asians.&#xD;
