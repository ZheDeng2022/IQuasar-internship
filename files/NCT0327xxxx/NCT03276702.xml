  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown that the genomic landscape of tumors can dramatically change at the time of&#xD;
      disease progression. This suggests that therapies aimed at treating the tumor at diagnosis&#xD;
      may not be relevant at the time of relapse. Obtaining fresh tissue at the time of relapse&#xD;
      could facilitate the identification of potential targets that have developed through&#xD;
      mutational evolution of the primary tumor and would provide an unprecedented opportunity to&#xD;
      expand the library of patient derived xenografts (PDX) that are available for comprehensive&#xD;
      preclinical testing in the setting of relapsed disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this observational study is to prospectively collect fresh tumor tissue from&#xD;
      pediatric patients with solid tumors who have recurrent or progressive disease and submit&#xD;
      this tissue for comprehensive genomic analysis using clinically available CLIA-certified&#xD;
      platforms that include WGS, WES and RNAseq, and to assess the reasons for a patient and/or a&#xD;
      parent for making a decision to proceed with or refuse a re-biopsy procedure in the presence&#xD;
      of a recurrent or progressive solid tumor. The data obtained will be used to develop new&#xD;
      novel therapies that incorporate new pharmacological agents in pediatric solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To prospectively collect fresh tumor tissue from pediatric patients with solid tumors&#xD;
           who have recurrent or progressive disease and submit this tissue for comprehensive&#xD;
           genomic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the reasons a patient and/or a parent make the decision to proceed with or&#xD;
           refuse a re-biopsy procedure in the presence of a recurrent or progressive solid tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate refusal and acceptance rates for re-biopsy and the parental/patient&#xD;
           attitudes towards a re-biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the incidence of complications associated with biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the percentage of procedures that fail to obtain adequate tissue for genomic&#xD;
           analysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-therapeutic study with two components: biopsy of tumor for genomic&#xD;
      studies and prospective assessment of parental factors related to participation. All patients&#xD;
      at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) who meet the eligibility criteria will be&#xD;
      approached for study participation. The re-biopsy is not mandatory and will only be performed&#xD;
      after the patient and family have consented. A questionnaire to assess the impact and&#xD;
      perception of an optional/research only biopsy will be administered following the decision&#xD;
      regarding re-biopsy. For those consenting to the re-biopsy, approximately 4-8 weeks after&#xD;
      biopsy, the family and patient will be asked to complete a second questionnaire to assess&#xD;
      decisional regret.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may repeat participation in this trial with subsequent relapses, provided&#xD;
      informed consent is obtained prior to each re-biopsy procedure. For those participants who&#xD;
      consent to repeat participation, all protocol procedures will be repeated.&#xD;

      DNA will be extracted from the patient's peripheral blood and tumor samples and RNA will be&#xD;
      extracted from the tumor sample and whole genome sequencing (WGS), whole exome sequencing&#xD;
      (WES) and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) will be performed on Illumina Next Generation&#xD;
      Sequencers. Both somatic and germline variants (single nucleotide variants, structural&#xD;
      variants, insertions/deletions, and copy number variants) will be identified using a&#xD;
      bioinformatics pipeline developed and validated at SJCRH. Separate reports will be generated&#xD;
      for the somatic lesions and germline lesions. In the event that there is not enough fresh&#xD;
      tissue to perform WGS, WES and RNAseq will be performed in FFPE material if available.&#xD;
