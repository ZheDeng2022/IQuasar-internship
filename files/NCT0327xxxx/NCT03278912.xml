      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PIDD stands for primary immune dysregulation. It is a general term that includes many&#xD;
      different inherited immune system disorders. The immune system is the part of the body that&#xD;
      helps fight disease and infection. People with PIDDs can develop many kinds of health&#xD;
      problems. One of these is inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which causes diarrhea and&#xD;
      cramping. Researchers want to learn more about these disorders to develop possible&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about when and why IBD may develop in some people with PIDDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 3 and older who have PIDD or IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers in this age group are also needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Participants will be screened with physical exam, medical history, and blood and&#xD;
      urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have more physical exams and blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Answer questions about quality of life and food history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide a stool sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have nasal and rectal skin swabs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have saliva collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 1 follow-up visit per year. They will repeat visit 2 procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted by phone or email in between yearly visits. They will be asked&#xD;
      about their health. They will complete a quality-of-life questionnaire and send a stool&#xD;
      sample that is collected at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants experience a sudden change in symptoms or undergo a new treatment, they may&#xD;
      be asked to complete visit 2 procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants are not able to come to NIH, study data and samples can be collected without&#xD;
      an in-person visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a final study visit about 10 years after Visit 1. They will repeat&#xD;
      visit 2 procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 1 million people suffer from IBD in the United States. Although the exact pathogenesis&#xD;
      is unclear, IBD results from an inappropriate inflammatory response to intestinal microbes&#xD;
      which is influenced by the environment in a genetically susceptible host. IBDs can be&#xD;
      classified as conventional (Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)) and unclassified&#xD;
      (early onset, difficult to treat, associated with monogenic disorders and PIDDs). Among the&#xD;
      200 IBD susceptibility loci identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), overlap&#xD;
      with aberrations identified in PIDDs has been observed, thereby supporting the study of PIDDs&#xD;
      to better understand conventional IBD pathogenesis, while recognizing PIDD-associated IBDs as&#xD;
      distinct disease entities requiring specialized management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of PIDDs worldwide is estimated at 1 in 2000 live births and encompasses a&#xD;
      growing list of over 300 PIDDs. Despite the fact that GI disease is the second most common&#xD;
      complication in patients with PIDDs (rates ranging from 5-50%), little is known about&#xD;
      PIDDspecific&#xD;
&#xD;
      IBD pathogenesis and even less is understood about the role of the microbiota both as a&#xD;
      consequence and modulator of immune response in these inherited disorders. Moreover, there&#xD;
      may be a time-limited period (&quot;immunological window of opportunity&quot;), coinciding with the&#xD;
      maturation of the host s microbiome, during which early immune education may have long-term&#xD;
      effects on predisposition to aberrant immune responses and inflammatory dysregulation. The&#xD;
      primary objective of this study is to determine if PIDDs result in intestinal dysbioses,&#xD;
      which alter local and systemic immune responses. Our long-term goal is to comprehensively&#xD;
      investigate the immunological window of opportunity as it relates to PIDD-associated IBDs to&#xD;
      define time-sensitive immunoregulatory targets for therapeutic intervention. We will pursue&#xD;
      this goal through a prospective, longitudinal study of pediatric and adult patients with&#xD;
      PIDDs (with and without IBD) before and after treatment and/or diagnostic interventions,&#xD;
      including but not limited to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Findings from&#xD;
      subjects with PIDDs will be compared to those from subjects with IBD as well as healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. This multifaceted study will complement primary patient protocols while allowing&#xD;
      for the direct interrogation of specific arms of innate and adaptive immunity in the context&#xD;
      of host-microbiome interactions. Patients will be studied over time through the collection of&#xD;
      clinical metadata, blood, stool, urine, saliva, skin swabs, and biopsies obtained from&#xD;
      clinically-indicated endoscopies in age-appropriate patients. PIDDs of interest include but&#xD;
      are not limited to: CGD, CTLA4 and LRBA protein deficiency, hypomorphic RAG deficiency, and&#xD;
      IPEX syndrome.&#xD;
