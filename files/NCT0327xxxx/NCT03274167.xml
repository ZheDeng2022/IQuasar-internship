  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to study the effect of gabapentin on the number of alcohol drinking days and&#xD;
      heavy drinking days in the Thai clinical alcohol-dependent population by using the&#xD;
      double-blinded randomized controlled approach. One-hundred and twelve individuals with&#xD;
      alcohol dependence were randomly assigned equally into two groups including treatment with&#xD;
      gabapentin and placebo. Thirty-four patients (30.3%) completed the study protocol, i.e.&#xD;
      treatment with gabapentin at least 300 mg per day or placebo orally once a day for twelve&#xD;
      weeks. Pattern of alcohol drinking were obtained from the timelime followback. Drinking&#xD;
      behaviors were compared between the two groups by poisson repeated measures model.&#xD;
