  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MRI elastography detects the movement of tissues in the human body and monitors their&#xD;
      response to mechanical stress in order to reveal their mechanical properties, like palpation.&#xD;
      These depend on the structure of the tissues, their biological conditions and possible&#xD;
      conditions. This non-invasive technique allows exploration of deep organs such as the brain&#xD;
      that the doctor's hand can not reach. MRI elastography may prove to be an essential tool for&#xD;
      study, diagnosis, staging and therapeutic monitoring of brain diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Creutzfeldt-Jakobes) and cancers&#xD;
      largely modify the mechanical properties of the affected tissues. For a first evaluation of&#xD;
      the technique, we are interested in glial tumors representing half of the intracranial tumors&#xD;
      in adults (incidence: 5 cases per 100 000 inhabitants), the second cancer in children and the&#xD;
      third cause of death in l Young adult.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Initiated in 1996, magnetic resonance elastography detects the movement of tissues in the&#xD;
      human body and monitors their response to mechanical stress in order to reveal their&#xD;
      mechanical properties. These depend on the structure of the tissues, their biological&#xD;
      conditions and the possible affections affecting them,. This technique, with recognized&#xD;
      safety, allows us to replace the doctor's usual palpation of peripheral organs, such as the&#xD;
      liver, or the breast, and to consider the exploration of deeper organs such as the heart or&#xD;
      the brain ,. At the Bicêtre Inter-Establishment Center, under the direction of Ralph Sinkus&#xD;
      of the Beaujon Hospital, the elastography of breast7 (for the exploration of tumors) and of&#xD;
      the heart9 is already being studied . At the Hôpital de Beaujon, elastography was developed&#xD;
      to study tumors, fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver5. Through a vibrating bar, Mayo&#xD;
      Clinic11, in the United States, then, in an oscillating cradle, Charity12, Germany, induced&#xD;
      waves in the human brain and early measurements of the brain's elastography showed a&#xD;
      Significant difference in the modulus of elasticity and viscosity of the white matter and the&#xD;
      gray matter. The dependence of these modules on age and gender was discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The elasticity measured by MRI of tumors of 38 to 75 mm in diameter could also be correlated&#xD;
      with the tissue consistency of the samples obtained during a surgical reduction. Finally, in&#xD;
      a patient with a temporal glioma, the mean modulus of elasticity in the tumor region was&#xD;
      measured by elastography close to 30% greater than in the corresponding region of the healthy&#xD;
      hemisphere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But the difficulty of introducing a mechanical wave into the brain through the cranial&#xD;
      chamber and the surrounding cerebro-spinal fluid limits the scope of the advanced results,&#xD;
      which are essentially qualitative at the moment. The median amplitude of the displacements&#xD;
      measured in the brain during these studies is only 7.33 μm at 40 Hz and drops to 2.70 μm at&#xD;
      120 Hz while it is more than 21 μm in the Liver and breast at 75 and 90 Hz respectively4.&#xD;
      Recently, the IR4M has developed an original excitation device that allows to circumvent this&#xD;
      limit. Displacements of cerebral tissues of several tens of micrometers have been reported by&#xD;
      MRI and the inversion of the problem leading to the viscoelastic modules could be carried out&#xD;
      on the whole of the human brain&#xD;
