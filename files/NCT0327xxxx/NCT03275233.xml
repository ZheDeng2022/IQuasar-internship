      Psychiatric comorbidities in patient with Painful Peripheral neuropathy&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuropathic pain has been redefined by the International Association for the Study of Pain,&#xD;
      as'' pain caused by a lesion or disease of somatosensory system''.Diabetic peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy is the result of nerve damage in the toes, feet, and hands . Approximately 50% of&#xD;
      those diabetic peripheral neuropathy have neuropathic pain .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with persistent neuropathic pain experience work disability and activity limitation,&#xD;
      with a substantial impact on their social functioning. As any chronic pain state comorbid&#xD;
      depression, anxiety and sleep disturbance are common occurring in up to one half of those&#xD;
      with painful neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between chronic pain and cognitive function has not been adequately studied&#xD;
      and little is known about cognitive functioning in neuropathic conditions. This may be&#xD;
      because the clinicians pay more attention to psychiatric comorbidities, such as depression&#xD;
      and anxiety.Although chronic pain associated with cognitive deficits may impact on everyday&#xD;
      behaviour and interfere with emotional decision-making tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a cross-sectional survey at the Mayo clinic, the prevalence of clinician-diagnosed&#xD;
      symptomatic or painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy was 13-15% out of 78% of those with any&#xD;
      type of diabetic peripheral neuropathy . Many patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy&#xD;
      experience neuropathic pain, typically characterized as burning, electric, sharp and shooting&#xD;
      which initially starts in both feet and may progress to involve calves, fingers, and hands&#xD;
      (stocking and glove pattern) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently it has been demonstrated an association between diabetes , diabetes complication and&#xD;
      impairment of mental health and particular emphasis has been placed on the association&#xD;
      between painful diabetic sensory neuropathy with depression .&#xD;
