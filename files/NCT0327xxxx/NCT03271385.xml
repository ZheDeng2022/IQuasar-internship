      Differentiating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) from hypertensive heart disease (HHD)&#xD;
      unavoidably encounters diagnostic challenges especially in patient of suspected HCM with&#xD;
      history of hypertension. Diverse and overlapping forms of HCM can often lead to ambiguity&#xD;
      when diagnosis is based on a single genetic or morphological index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have deduced a integrated formula based on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)&#xD;
      imaging and established a differentiating flow-chart between HCM and HHD, the investigators&#xD;
      aim to identify their method in the current multi-center trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and hypertensive heart disease (HHD) present left&#xD;
      ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), but the prognosis varies. Nevertheless, the feasibility of&#xD;
      distinguishing these two conditions is limited by the fact that overlapping LVH and diverse&#xD;
      forms of HCM can often lead to diagnostic ambiguity when diagnosis is based on a single&#xD;
      morphological index. Diagnosis is more difficult in a patient with a history of hypertension&#xD;
      and with left ventricular wall thickness between 11 and 15 mm. It also puzzles the situation&#xD;
      when hypertrophy without outflow-track obstruction was found in hypertensive subjects which&#xD;
      might not be explained solely by the history of hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have deduced an integrated formula based on cardiac magnetic resonance&#xD;
      (CMR) imaging and established a differentiating flow-chart between HCM and HHD. In this&#xD;
      study, the investigators aim to explore the applicability of the quantifying scheme for&#xD;
      distinguishing HCM from HHD in the multi-center trial.&#xD;

    <description>The hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was diagnosed by left ventricular hypertrophy via echocardiography (wall thickness &gt;15 mm) with either genetic determination of a pathogenic mutation or ) left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (end-diastolic wall thickness &gt;15 mm) with resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction or hypertrophy in a recognisable pattern, i.e., ventricular bulge in apical-variant HCM. And then patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were evaluated by the predetermined differentiating formula.</description>

    <description>The diagnosis of hypertensive heart disease was based on medical history and conventional echocardiography. Long durations of uncontrolled hypertension for at least 5 years with systolic blood pressure [BP] ≥150 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg or both in the absence of other cardiac or systemic diseases were used as criteria. And then patients with hypertensive heart disease were evaluated by the predetermined differentiating formula.</description>
