  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Canada, approximately 68 women are diagnosed with breast cancer every day.&#xD;
      Chemotherapy-related cognitive changes (CRCC) are reported by up to 75% of breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors during treatment and symptoms persist in 35% of survivors after treatment. Women&#xD;
      report that CRCC negatively impacts their everyday functioning and substantially reduces&#xD;
      their overall quality of life. Effective clinical interventions to manage CRCC are elusive.&#xD;
      As a result, breast cancer survivors typically receive little to no advice on how to prevent&#xD;
      or manage CRCC. Aerobic exercise is a type of physical activity that uses large muscle&#xD;
      groups, is rhythmic in nature, and can be sustained for at least 10 minutes (e.g., walking,&#xD;
      jogging, indoor cycling). It has been associated with improved quality of life in breast&#xD;
      cancer survivors. It also holds great promise as an intervention to prevent or mitigate CRCC.&#xD;
      However, there is limited evidence from experimental studies to confirm this. Therefore, the&#xD;
      primary aim of this trial is to evaluate the impact of a supervised aerobic exercise&#xD;
      intervention on CRCC in women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. Recruited women will&#xD;
      be randomized into one of two groups: (1) aerobic exercise during chemotherapy, or (2) usual&#xD;
      care during chemotherapy and the aerobic exercise post-chemotherapy (i.e., wait-list control&#xD;
      group). This study will test several novel hypotheses, including whether exercise during&#xD;
      chemotherapy can prevent and/or mitigate CRCC and its negative impact on quality of life&#xD;
      among women with breast cancer, and whether the timing of the exercise intervention matters&#xD;
      (i.e., exercise during versus after chemotherapy). The results of this study aim to address&#xD;
      the concerns of women affected by CRCC who are currently lacking available evidence-based&#xD;
      treatment options, as well as oncology care providers' need to have options to recommend to&#xD;
      their patients to prevent or manage CRCC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of an aerobic exercise intervention on&#xD;
      CRCC in women diagnosed with breast cancer who undergo chemotherapy. The specific objectives&#xD;
      are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test the effect of aerobic exercise during chemotherapy (EX) compared to a usual care&#xD;
           wait-list control group (exercise after chemotherapy; UC) on CRCC as assessed by&#xD;
           neuropsychological tests and self-report;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test the effect of EX compared to UC on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Global measures of brain structure and functioning including brain volume in&#xD;
                regions associated with working memory and response inhibition, white matter&#xD;
                integrity (i.e., fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity), and neural functioning&#xD;
                using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Overall global brain network organization and improved regional brain network&#xD;
                organization and neural functioning in areas underlying attention and working&#xD;
                memory (i.e., dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex, superior temporal region and&#xD;
                posterior parietal cortex) using electroencephalography (EEG; Vancouver site only;&#xD;
                see Methods).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess if the timing of the exercise intervention (i.e., during chemotherapy versus&#xD;
           after chemotherapy) moderates the effects on CRCC by examining the effects of the&#xD;
           intervention at 1-year post start of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At the end of chemotherapy, EX group will perform better than UC group on&#xD;
           neuropsychological tests and will self-report better cognitive functioning;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. At the end of chemotherapy, EX group will have maintained measures of brain structure&#xD;
           and functioning as assessed by MRI scans and EEG (Vancouver site only) compared to UC&#xD;
           group who will have significant changes in both;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At 1-year post the start of chemotherapy, EX group will have better outcomes compared to&#xD;
           the UC group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a two-arm, two-centre RCT. The two arms are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Aerobic exercise intervention during chemotherapy (EX);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Usual care during chemotherapy and aerobic exercise after chemotherapy (i.e., usual care&#xD;
           wait-list control group; UC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      84 women diagnosed with breast cancer will be recruited across the two sites. The primary&#xD;
      method of recruitment will be through printed postings and oncologist referral at the two&#xD;
      main clinical sites: British Columbia Cancer Agency-Vancouver (BCCA) and The Ottawa Hospital&#xD;
      (TOH). We anticipate our target of 84 patients will be reached in 30 months (combined site&#xD;
      rate of 2-3 participants per month).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be assessed at:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre-chemotherapy (baseline, week 0);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mid-chemotherapy (approximately 6-9 weeks post-baseline);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. End of chemotherapy (approximately 12-18 weeks post-baseline);&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Follow-up and post-usual care wait-list control group receiving the intervention&#xD;
           (approximately 24-34 weeks post-baseline);&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 1-year follow-up (52 weeks post-baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional neuroimaging and EEG will be completed in a sub-set of participants at each site who&#xD;
      are interested, eligible, and consent to additional assessments at these time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre-chemotherapy (baseline, week 0);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. End of chemotherapy (approximately 12-18 weeks post-baseline);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 1-year follow-up (52 weeks post-baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent, each participant will be scheduled for a baseline&#xD;
      assessment (week 0). After baseline assessments, participants will be randomized. For the EX&#xD;
      group, the intervention will be delivered concurrent with participants' chemotherapy regimen&#xD;
      (lasting approximately 12-18 weeks). The intervention will be progressive aerobic exercise.&#xD;
      The intervention is based on prior protocols used by the study team among women during&#xD;
      treatment or who have completed treatment. Participants will complete three supervised 20-40&#xD;
      minute aerobic exercise sessions each week. Home-based exercise will be introduced in week 3.&#xD;
      For the home-based sessions, participants will be asked to complete at least 1 session per&#xD;
      week of 30 minutes of aerobic exercise (an activity of their choosing; e.g., walking).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in objective and self-reported cognitive functioning will be analyzed based on&#xD;
      repeated measures analysis of variance with fixed terms for treatment, time, and a treatment&#xD;
      by time interaction. Clinically important baseline differences between the study arms will be&#xD;
      included as covariates in all analyses. Correlation in repeated measures on the same&#xD;
      individual over time will be accounted for by explicitly modeling the covariance matrix, with&#xD;
      the best-fitting covariance structure decided using likelihood ratio tests and information&#xD;
      criteria. The difference between the experimental and control arms at end of chemotherapy&#xD;
      (primary comparison) will be calculated as adjusted least square mean difference in change&#xD;
      from baseline, together with 95% confidence intervals. All tests will be evaluated at the&#xD;
      two-sided 5% level of significance. SAS v.9.3 will be used for all analyses. Additional&#xD;
      adjusted analyses will be carried out using potential covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore changes in brain structure and functioning, data will be analyzed with SPM12 (VBM&#xD;
      and CONN toolboxes) and FSL (FMRIB Software Library v5.0). Following respective&#xD;
      post-processing procedures, pre- and post- intervention measurement comparisons will be&#xD;
      conducted using voxel-wise statistical repeated-measures analyses, appropriate to each MRI&#xD;
      technique (for example, FA, MD for the DTI data, seed-to-voxel functional connectivity for&#xD;
      the fMRI data, as well as both whole brain and region of interest analyses of each fMRI&#xD;
      task). Statistical maps will be inspected at p &lt; 0.05 levels, corrected for multiple&#xD;
      comparisons. To test the effect of aerobic exercise during chemotherapy compared to&#xD;
      post-chemotherapy on outcomes 1-year after enrolment, the models as described above will&#xD;
      additionally include the response at 1-year follow-up and the contrast of interest will be&#xD;
      the difference in change from baseline (week 0) to 1-year post start of chemotherapy (week&#xD;
      52).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sustainability of the intervention will be examined in each arm by testing the change in&#xD;
      response from immediately post-intervention to week 52, together with a 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG signal processing will be completed using EEG time series from 27 locations to construct&#xD;
      the brain connectivity networks. The network graphs will be computed for each subject using&#xD;
      the false discovery rate controlled PC (PCFDR) algorithm, which is a statistical model that&#xD;
      tests the conditional dependence/independence between any two regions based on all other&#xD;
      brain regions. Partial correlation will be used to evaluate the conditional independence,&#xD;
      which estimates the directed interactions between any two brain regions after removing the&#xD;
      effects of all other brain areas. The FDR threshold will be set at a 5% level. Graph Theory&#xD;
      Analysis will use the &quot;Brain Connectivity Toolbox&quot; running Matlab (Natick, MA) to carry out&#xD;
      the graph theoretical based analysis. Traditional graph theoretical calculations will be used&#xD;
      to characterize different features of the network of interest such as density, global&#xD;
      efficiency, modularity and small-worldness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRCC, or &quot;chemo brain&quot;, is common among women diagnosed with breast cancer, significantly&#xD;
      impacts everyday life, and diminishes quality of life. Women with breast cancer described&#xD;
      their chemo brain symptoms as &quot;frustrating&quot;, &quot;upsetting&quot; and for some &quot;frightening&quot;. In&#xD;
      addition, women with breast cancer may be unable to return to their previous occupational,&#xD;
      family and social activities, or do so only with significant additional mental effort. As a&#xD;
      result the high prevalence of chemo brain in women with breast cancer has a large economic&#xD;
      burden due to demand of health care resources and lost work-force productivity. Women with&#xD;
      breast cancer also report a general frustration in the response of the medical community,&#xD;
      either due to lack of acknowledgement of their symptoms or the fact that intervention&#xD;
      strategies are limited. Furthermore, there is limited information to guide health care&#xD;
      professionals with regards to clinical guidelines for the management of chemo brain and&#xD;
      health care professionals report that they do not consider themselves adequately&#xD;
      knowledgeable to address chemo brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test if exercise during chemotherapy can mitigate chemo brain and its&#xD;
      negative impact on quality of life among women diagnosed with breast cancer, which if shown&#xD;
      to be effective, will have profound effects on the lives of those with chemo brain as well as&#xD;
      their family members and clinicians who currently have a lack of treatment options available.&#xD;
