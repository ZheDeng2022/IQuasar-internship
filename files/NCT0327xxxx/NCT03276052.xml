    <textblock>
      A Phase I, single centre, open-label study to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of single and multiple twice daily doses of inhaled Aclidinium Bromide in&#xD;
      healthy Chinese male and female subjects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Screening will be performed within 21 days of dosing on Day 1. Eligible participants will be&#xD;
      admitted to the trial center on Day -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive single dose on Day 1, twice daily regimen is from D5 to D8, and only&#xD;
      morning dose will be given on Day 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment period, from Day 1 through Day 11 at Visit 2, safety measurements (blood&#xD;
      pressure, 12-lead ECG; and AE/SAE monitoring) and blood samples for PK assessments will be&#xD;
      collected at predetermined time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical laboratory tests (haematology, serum biochemistry and urinalysis) will be performed&#xD;
      under fasting conditions at Day -1 at Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up visit will be performed on Day 15.&#xD;
