      Efficacy and Tolerance Evaluation of an Anti-age Food Supplement: a Randomized, Controlled&#xD;
      Clinical Study Versus Untreated Group&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the study was to evaluate the anti-age activity of &quot;Pre-Hyaluron 465 Innēov&quot; a food&#xD;
      supplement, composed with a precursor of HA (glucosamine) and an enzymatic co-factor of HA&#xD;
      synthesis (manganese), taken for 4 consecutive months by female subjects aged 35-60 years&#xD;
      (with preference for subjects over 45 years), with moderate-severe skin aging/photoaging&#xD;
      according to a reference photographic scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study foresaw the evaluation of the study product activity versus a control group,&#xD;
      untreated.&#xD;
