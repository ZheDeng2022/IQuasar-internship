      Aim: To evaluate and compare the outcome of primary endodontic treatment following use of&#xD;
      different instrumentation techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods: Study subjects were recruited from the pool of patients referred for&#xD;
      the non-surgical root canal treatment in the Department of Conservative Dentistry &amp;&#xD;
      Endodontics at PGIDS, Rohtak (Haryana).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population comprised of patients requiring primary root canal treatment following&#xD;
      the diagnosis of pulpal necrosis with chronic apical periodontitis in mature mandibular first&#xD;
      and second molars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were allocated to one of the three study groups: manual instrumentation, ProTaper&#xD;
      instrumentation and Hybrid instrumentation.&#xD;

      AIMS AND OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study has been designed with the following aims and objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of manual / rotary/hybrid instrumentation techniques on success&#xD;
           of primary non surgical root canal treatment in teeth with apical periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the incidence of postoperative pain in teeth treated with and without rotary&#xD;
           instrumentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare manual, rotary and hybrid instrumentation techniques in terms of periapical&#xD;
           healing in teeth with apical periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to treatment a thorough clinical and radiological examination was carried out. A&#xD;
      thorough history was taken from each patient. Prior informed consent was taken after&#xD;
      explaining the procedure, risks and benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical procedure: A total of 90 patients (n=30 in each group) were included in the study.&#xD;
      Mature mandibular permanent molar with diagnosis of apical periodontitis (as confirmed&#xD;
      clinically &amp; by periapical radiograph) were chosen for the study. Patients were randomly&#xD;
      allocated into three groups :Group I- manual instrumentation, Group II -rotary&#xD;
      instrumentation (ProTaper) and Group III -Rotary instrumentation (Hybrid ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After administration of local anesthesia, rubber dam isolation of the involved tooth was&#xD;
      done. Caries excavation was done and access cavity was prepared using carbide burs in high&#xD;
      speed handpiece with copious irrigation.Debridement of the pulp chamber was done and all&#xD;
      canal orifices were identified. Negotiation of canals was done. Working length was determined&#xD;
      using root ZX apex locator and verified radiographically. Instrumentation was done as&#xD;
      follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP A: Manual instrumentation: Hand instrumentation with the stainless steel K files was&#xD;
      performed using step back technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP B: Rotary instrumentation (ProTaper files): The cleaning and shaping of the canals was&#xD;
      completed in accordance with a crown down technique recommended by the manufacturer, using&#xD;
      the following operative sequence. Canals were instrumented with ProTaper rotary instruments.&#xD;
      Recapitulation was carried out with size 10 k file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP C: rotary instrumentation (Hybrid): Roots canals were shaped with a combination of two&#xD;
      NiTi rotary systems: ProTaper Universal instruments were used to shape the coronal and middle&#xD;
      thirds and Hyflex CM files to prepare the apical third.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of canal instrumentation in all the groups, canals were irrigated with 5.0&#xD;
      mL of 17% ethylene-diamine-tetra acetic acid for 1 minute followed by a final irrigation with&#xD;
      5.0 mL of 5.25% sodium hypochlorite. Canals were then be dried with sterile paper points. A&#xD;
      lentulo-spiral was used to fill all canals with a Calcium hydroxide paste and the access&#xD;
      cavity to be restored with intermediate restorative material. The patient were recalled after&#xD;
      1 week. At the second appointment, the calcium hydroxide paste were removed by using&#xD;
      circumferential filing with Hedstrom files and copious irrigation with 5.25% sodium&#xD;
      hypochlorite followed by 5.0 mL of 17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and a final rinse of&#xD;
      5.0 mL 5.25% sodium hypochlorite. Canals were dried with the help of absorbent paper points&#xD;
      and obturated. After obturation, the cavity was permanently restored. Immediate&#xD;
      post-operative radiograph was then taken using preset exposure parameters and processed&#xD;
      manually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW UP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up and clinical and radiographic examination was carried out at 3, 6, 9 &amp; 12 month&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome variables&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary outcome variables observed for the study was long term clinical and&#xD;
           radiographic success rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The secondary outcome measure was the incidence of postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic success: Radiographic success (change in Periapical Index score) of the root&#xD;
      canal therapy was drawn by comparing the pre-operative; 3 month, 6month, 9 month &amp; 12-month&#xD;
      follow up radiographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical success: it was determined by&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of inter appointment flare ups and pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of tenderness to palpation /percussion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of sinus or any associated soft tissue swelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tooth mobility of grade I or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No deterioration in periodontal pocket depth.&#xD;
