  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pharmacist, as a specialist of medications, occupies a strategic position: he&#xD;
      participates in a global care of their patients. Dispensation is the pharmaceutical act which&#xD;
      associates with the dispensing of medications &quot;the pharmaceutical analysis of the medical&#xD;
      prescription if it exists, the possible preparation of the doses to be administered and the&#xD;
      provisions of the information and advices necessary for the proper use of medications&quot;. The&#xD;
      pharmacist ensures that the quality and safety of the dispensation is guaranteed at all times&#xD;
      by limiting as far as possible the risks associated with an error in delivery, prescription,&#xD;
      drug interactions or undetected contraindications, inadequate dosages or non-compliance with&#xD;
      treatment. The longer the patient feels satisfied with the stage of delivery of his&#xD;
      treatment, the better his adherence to treatment is, and the less he will encounter poor&#xD;
      compliance. Oncology has particularly benefited in recent years from the introduction of&#xD;
      numerous drugs with the aim of extending the duration of response in a growing number of&#xD;
      indications. Traditionally in oncology, chemotherapy treatments are administered&#xD;
      intravenously by trained personnel and rarely managed by the patient at home. Recently, there&#xD;
      has been a growing choice of oral formulations, whether for conventional hormonal, anticancer&#xD;
      therapies or targeted therapies. These specialties are now widely available in community&#xD;
      pharmacies. Oral administration puts the patient at the center of his therapeutic management.&#xD;
      He must take his medication alone. Adherence and compliance are therefore particularly&#xD;
      important here for an optimal risk-benefit ratio. This study project is designed to evaluate&#xD;
      the satisfaction of patients undergoing oral chemotherapy treated for a cancer pathology and&#xD;
      whose treatment is provided by their community pharmacies. It also needs to provide&#xD;
      information about the reasons for their poor adherence to treatment (personal factors,&#xD;
      factors attributable to treatment, factors attributable to the care system). Patients will be&#xD;
      recruited and interviewed by contacting several departments of the Clermont-Ferrand&#xD;
      University Hospital (CHU de Clermont-Ferrand), who are used to caring for patients with&#xD;
      cancerous diseases (hematology, urology, respiratory, gastro-enterology). The data collected&#xD;
      in this study may be used for subsequent studies evaluating new management strategies or&#xD;
      therapeutic education to improve adherence to patient treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This observational and transversal study will be conducted as a survey by contacting each&#xD;
      eligible patients after complete information by the oncologist. After acceptance, the&#xD;
      patients will received a postal mail with the questionnaire and a stamped envelope for the&#xD;
      return of completed questionnaire. All the completed questionnaires will be recorded in a&#xD;
      specific REDCap database for analysis.&#xD;
