    <textblock>
      In this multi-institution phase I/II trial, the investigators have chosen paclitaxel and&#xD;
      carboplatin using a schedule and doses identical to those used in the CROSS trial. Following&#xD;
      a run-in with nivolumab alone at 240 mg IVPB every 2 weeks for 2 doses, nivolumab at 240 mg&#xD;
      every 2 weeks will be added to paclitaxel and carboplatin, which will be dosed according to&#xD;
      the standard of care established by the CROSS trial: paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 weekly for 6 weeks&#xD;
      and carboplatin AUC 2 weekly for 6 weeks. Concurrent radiation will be administered with&#xD;
      chemotherapy at 1.8 Gy/fraction × 28 fractions to a total dose of 50.4 Gy, the standard&#xD;
      radiation dose administered in the United States for trimodality therapy that includes&#xD;
      concurrent therapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel. A decrease in dose to 41.4 Gy per the&#xD;
      protocol established by van Hagen, et al. will be permitted before discontinuing therapy due&#xD;
      to unacceptable toxicity. While the CROSS study administered only 5 weekly doses of&#xD;
      chemotherapy during the 5 weeks of radiation, the higher dose of 50.4 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction ×28&#xD;
      fractions over 5½ weeks) utilized in this study permits for a sixth dose during the&#xD;
      additional week of radiation.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  As there is potential for hepatic toxicity with nivolumab or nivolumab non-drugs with&#xD;
