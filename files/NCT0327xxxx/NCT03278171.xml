  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric pathology noticed in the DSM-5, in&#xD;
      troubles due to a traumatism or a stress factor and appearing at least 1 month after&#xD;
      confrontation with trauma. This trouble can become chronic, and be the source of psychiatric&#xD;
      and somatic comorbidities, which themselves have personal, professional and economic&#xD;
      consequences at the level of the individual and society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies looked at the psychological effects induced by a stay in intensive care unit&#xD;
      (ICU) since few years. The emergence of PTSD in these patients has been described, with an&#xD;
      incidence varying from 4% to 60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The literature is contradictory about identified risk factors for PTSD. It's not possible to&#xD;
      design a screening of these patients actually, only focused on the risk factors. It has been&#xD;
      shown that the presence of acute stress trouble (presence of symptoms during the first month&#xD;
      after the traumatism) was a risk factor for PTSD. Early detection of acute stress disorder&#xD;
      could be a way to screen risk of emergence of a post-intensive care PTSD. Post-intensive care&#xD;
      consultations have been done at 6 months, but not systematically. Only few symptoms are&#xD;
      looked for and a sizable part of this population were not being followed probably due to a&#xD;
      non-diagnosed-PTSD. In case of the emergence of a post-intensive care PTSD, those patients&#xD;
      will never be diagnosed and treated, favoring all complications linked to this trouble.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Associated with other factors, IES-R (Impact Event Scale Revisited) at the ICU exit would&#xD;
      permit an exhaustive screening of patients at risk for PTSD and could permit to propose them&#xD;
      an adapted care and then limit the emergence of PTSD and its consequences..&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will screen acute stress symptoms within 8 days following&#xD;
      the ICU's exit, using the IES-R, in order to evaluate his ability to predict the emergence of&#xD;
      a PTSD at three months. IES-R is an auto-questionnaire, easy and fast with good psychometrics&#xD;
      capacities for PTSD.&#xD;
