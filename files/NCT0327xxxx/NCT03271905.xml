  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aerosol therapy is widely used in intensive care in critically ill patients that use&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation (MV). However, there is a lack of standardization about aerosol&#xD;
      performance in this group of patients. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      nebulization performed in different ventilatory modes on lung function and regional pulmonary&#xD;
      distribution of critical patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is a&#xD;
      clinical trial, crossover, randomized, controlled and blind. Three interventions with&#xD;
      bronchodilators will be performed: in the Pressure Controlled Ventilation mode (PCV) with&#xD;
      positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) = 85% of autoPEEP, in the PCV mode with PEEP = 15&#xD;
      cmH2Oand in the Pressure Support Mode (PSV). Pulmonary function data will be evaluated&#xD;
      through Electrical Impedance Tomography to evaluate the efficacy of the bronchodilator in&#xD;
      different ventilatory modes.&#xD;

      • To evaluate the influence of mechanical ventilation modes in the efficacy of nebulized&#xD;
      bronchodilator in ventilator dependent patients with obstructive pulmonary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare regional ventilation distribution through Ventilation Surface Area (VSA) and&#xD;
           Tidal Impedance Variation (TIV or ∆Z) by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) before,&#xD;
           immediately after, after 1hour (h), 2h and 3h of nebulized bronchodilator in pressure&#xD;
           controlled ventilation (PCV) with and without sedative drugs, and during pressure&#xD;
           support ventilation (PSV).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the peak expiratory flow (PEF), change in End-Expiratory Lung Volume (dEELV),&#xD;
           Respiratory Compliance (Crs) and Resistance (R), before, immediately after, after 1h, 2h&#xD;
           and 3h of nebulized bronchodilator by monitoring airway pressure and EIT in ventilator&#xD;
           modes PCV, with and without sedative drugs and PSV .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the ventilator modes on the VSA, ∆Z, PEF, dEELV and Crs after nebulized&#xD;
           bronchodilator and the duration of its effects during mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare two different level of PEEP during nebulized bronchodilator on PCV mode while&#xD;
           the patient stay with sedative drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3. METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Study design This is a randomized crossover, blinded clinical trial. The randomization&#xD;
      procedure will be a simple randomization by random number table. In order to improve&#xD;
      reliability, not transparent sealed envelopes for blind allocation will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Local and study period This is a multicenter study that involve the following hospitals:&#xD;
      Hospital Miguel Arraes - PE and Real Hospital Português de Beneficência em Pernambuco- PE.&#xD;
      All hospitals are located in the metropolitan region of Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil and the&#xD;
      study will be conducted from February 2016 to December 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Sample The study population consist of patients with obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      admitted to intensive care unit for MV support who meet the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Sample size Patients will be identified by a daily telephone calls to the ICUs each&#xD;
      morning for data collection. Potential candidate patients will be screened for inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusinon criteria, after the identification of eligible patients. After consent is&#xD;
      obtained, the research team goes to the ICU to start collecting data. The sample size will be&#xD;
      calculated by statistical procedures after conducting a pilot study of 10 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5 Technical procedures and tools for data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to starting the intervention, clinical and demographic data will be collected according&#xD;
      to the evaluation form, ( Appendix 2). After that, patients will be receive each of 4&#xD;
      interventions, with a minimum of 4 hours between bronchodilator administration to allow for&#xD;
      washout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5.1. Intervention Protocol 3.5.1.1. Step 1: Nebulization during Pressure Controlled&#xD;
      Ventilation (PCV) Mode Initially the patient will be accessed when he still sedated. Two&#xD;
      intervention will be done with a PCV mode in two different ways and the order of the&#xD;
      procedures will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One nebulization will be done with a standard PCV mode and parameters will be setted as&#xD;
      follows: sufficient Δ pressure to maintain the patient's tidal volume (vt) at 6 / kg ideal&#xD;
      weight, respiratory rate (RR) at 12 bpm, inspiratory time (Ti) up to 1 second, maintain Ti /&#xD;
      Ttot 0.3 - 0.4 without causing dynamic AutoPEEP, decreasing waveform flow and PEEP level of&#xD;
      85% from static autoPEEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other nebulization will be done also in PCV mode with same parameters, but the level of PEEP&#xD;
      will be increased to 15 cmH2O. Between this two interventions will be given 4 hours for&#xD;
      washout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this, we will talk to the medical staff to interrupt sedation, will be given 3 hour for&#xD;
      wash out to start de Step 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5.1.2. Step 2: Nebulization During Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV) With a clinical&#xD;
      progression of the patient, a 4th evaluation will be done on the first day when the patient&#xD;
      achieve PSV mode. In this ventilation mode the patient will control the Ti, Ttot, RR and&#xD;
      inspiratory flow so it will be set only one Δ pressure for the patient to support a Vt of 6&#xD;
      ml/kg. The lowest minimum value of Δ P is 10 cmH2O and the end of inspiratory phase will be&#xD;
      determined by a decrease at 25% of the patient peak inspiratory flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5.2 Nebulization Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nebulized bronchodilator drugs will be Salbutamol Sulfate (aerolin nebulis) and ipratropium&#xD;
      bromide (atrovent) diluted in a saline solution (saline 0.9%) in 3 ml. The vibrating Mesh&#xD;
      nebulizer (Aeroneb Pro-X, Galway, Ireland) will be placed in the inspiratory circuit of the&#xD;
      MV immediately before 'Y' piece using a 22 mm T adapter. The nebulizer is operated by an&#xD;
      electric controller connected mains power. The vibrating Mesh produces aerosol with an&#xD;
      average particle size of 5 μm and will remain on continuously until the end of nebulization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a heat moisture exchanger (HME) is used during mechanical ventilation, it must be removed&#xD;
      from between the nebulizer and airway before nebulization so that it does not filter out and&#xD;
      reduce aerosol delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5.3 Evaluation by Electrical Impedance Tomography. TIE is a tool of obtaining transverse&#xD;
      plane image of any section of the human body by means of low-power electric current. The&#xD;
      image is obtained from the electric current or potential detected on the surface of the&#xD;
      evaluated area, where each &quot;pixel&quot; image is its impedance or resistivity. Thus, when used in&#xD;
      thoracic follow-up, the EIT is able to evaluate the aeration and ventilation of the patient&#xD;
      through the following variables: distribution of regional lung ventilation by Tidal Impedance&#xD;
      Variation (ΔZ), Ventilation Surface Area (VSA), Percentage of Recruitable Lung (PRLV), Change&#xD;
      in End-Expiratory Lung Volume (dEELV) and Respiratory Compliance (Crs) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, to evaluate the acute pulmonary impact of nebulizer bronchodilator on different&#xD;
      ventilatory modes, EIT will be be performed before and immediately after the aerosol&#xD;
      administration and repeated with each ventilation mode. Furthermore, the duration of&#xD;
      nebulization effect will be evaluated by performing EIT after 1, 2 and 3h in each ventilation&#xD;
      mode. There will be a &gt; 4 hour washout between bronchodilator administrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An impedance tomography (ENLIGHTER, Timpel, Brazil) will be used with the patient in supine&#xD;
      position with a bed elevation of 45◦, so a belt with 32 electrodes will be applied to the&#xD;
      chest, in the position corresponding to the 4th - 5th intercostal space on a shaved skin.&#xD;
      Electrodes have to be positioned for reading electrocardiograms and a flow sensor that should&#xD;
      be attached to the endotracheal tube. After this procedures recording data starts for 3&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For image acquisition, harmless electrical currents (5-8 nA, 125 KHz) will be injectates&#xD;
      through electrode pairs in rotating sequence, and the potential differences Will be captured&#xD;
      in other non injetantes electrode. Variations in thoracic impedance will be evaluated through&#xD;
      a LabView software (National Instruments, USA) and the data is recorded in separate files for&#xD;
      patients for further analysis.&#xD;
