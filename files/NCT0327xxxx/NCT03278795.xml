  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a common, preventable and treatable disease&#xD;
      that is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation that is due&#xD;
      to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities usually caused by significant exposure to noxious&#xD;
      particles or gases. Acute exacerbations may occur during the management of stable COPD which&#xD;
      can negatively impact health status, rates of hospitalization and re-admission. During&#xD;
      exacerbation, some patients need immediate admission to the respiratory intensive care unit&#xD;
      (RICU) for ventilatory support. As prolonged mechanical ventilation has unfavourable impacts,&#xD;
      it is Important to minimize the duration of mechanical ventilation and perform extubation as&#xD;
      soon as possible. In recent years, development of numerous models of artificial respiration,&#xD;
      which could support spontaneous breathing, has made it possible to gradually decrease the&#xD;
      mechanical ventilatory support. From these new modes, PSV which is a well known weaning mode&#xD;
      will be compared in our study to a new weaning mode which is a volume support ventilation&#xD;
      (VSV).&#xD;

      Acute exacerbations may occur during the management of stable COPD which can negatively&#xD;
      impact health status, rates of hospitalization and re-admission. During exacerbation, some&#xD;
      patients need immediate admission to the respiratory intensive care unit (RICU). Ventilatory&#xD;
      support in an exacerbation can be provided by either noninvasive (nasal or facial mask) or&#xD;
      invasive (oro-tracheal tube or tracheostomy) ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical ventilation may be complicated by barotrauma, volutrauma, and also unfavourable&#xD;
      impacts on cardiovascular system and organ perfusion. Moreover, prolonged mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation enhances the risk of nosocomial pneumonia. So it is Important to minimize the&#xD;
      duration of mechanical ventilation and perform extubation as soon as possible. In recent&#xD;
      years, development of numerous models of artificial respiration, which could support&#xD;
      spontaneous breathing, has made it possible to gradually decrease the mechanical ventilatory&#xD;
      support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From these new modes, PSV (pressure-support ventilation) which is a well known weaning mode&#xD;
      will be compared in our study to a new weaning mode which is a volume support ventilation&#xD;
      (VSV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VSV could be viewed as &quot;PRVC for spontaneous breathing&quot; as it delivers a variable pressure to&#xD;
      meet a target VT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ventilator gives a test breath with an inspiratory pressure of 10 cmH2O above PEEP&#xD;
           (5 cmH2O in earlier software versions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It measures the volume delivered and calculates system Compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For each subsequent breath, the ventilator calculates compliance of the previous breath&#xD;
           and adjusts the inspiratory pressure level (pressure level) to achieve the set VT on the&#xD;
           next breath&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ventilator will not change the inspiratory pressure by more than 3 cm H2O from one&#xD;
           breath to the next&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximum available inspiratory pressure level is 5 cm H2O below the preset upper pressure&#xD;
           limit (alarm will sound at this point and the breath will switch into exhalation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The minimum pressure limit is the baseline setting (PEEP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If apnea occurs, back up pressure control is activated and an alarm sounds&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If Auto mode is on and patient becomes apneic, the mode will automatically switch to&#xD;
           PRVC(pressure regulated volume control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In PSV patients in whom a 8 cm H2O pressure support level could be achieved,a 2-h trial of&#xD;
      spontaneous breathing with this pressure support level will performed before extubation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the VSV group, VT(tidal volume) will be adjusted at 6 ml/ Kg and If the patients showed&#xD;
      good tolerance with an acceptable ABG (arterial blood gas)analysis (pH o7.35, PaO2(partial&#xD;
      pressure of arterial oxygen)/FIO2 .150 with an FIO2(fraction of inspired oxygen) f 40%, RR&#xD;
      (respiratory rate) f 35 breaths/min), they will ventilated for 2-h trial of spontaneous&#xD;
      breathing and then extubated&#xD;

After fulfillment of ERS weaning criteria patients will be consequently divided into two equal groups: 1. 25 patients will be assigned to PSV weaning mode.&#xD;
2. 25 patients will be assigned to VSV weaning mode. In PSV weaning group , PS will be adjusted 8 cm H2O. In VSV weaning group ,VT will be adjusted 6 ml/ Kg. Extubation will be done after successful spontaneous breathing trial according to ERS guidelines .</intervention_model_description>
