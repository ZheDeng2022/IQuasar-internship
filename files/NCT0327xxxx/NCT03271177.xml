      The purpose of this study is to determine if the routine use of a sheathless 7F guide&#xD;
      catheter for transradial percutaneous coronary intervention (TR PCI) is non-inferior to a 6F&#xD;
      sheath/guide combination with regards to radial artery injury (radial artery&#xD;
      intimal-medial-adventitial thickening). To evaluate the radial artery, ultrahigh resolution&#xD;
      ultrasonography (55 mHz) will be used to accurately quantify radial artery&#xD;
      intimal-medial-adventitial thickness (IMT) at baseline and 90 days. A non-inferiority&#xD;
      analysis will be performed to compare the degree of radial artery IMT at 90 days between the&#xD;
      7F sheathless guide approach and the 6F sheath/guide combination.&#xD;

      The purpose of the PRAGMATIC study (A Prospective Randomized Trial comparing Radial Artery&#xD;
      Intimal Hyperplasia resulting from a 7F Transradial Sheathless Guide [Mach 1] vs. a 6F&#xD;
      Transradial Sheath/Guide Combination in Coronary Intervention) is 3 fold: (1) to determine if&#xD;
      the routine use of a simple inexpensive &quot;home-made&quot; 7F sheathless guide catheter approach for&#xD;
      TRA-PCI was associated with comparable degrees of radial artery access site injury and&#xD;
      intimal-medial thickening (IMT) as the routine use of a 6F standard sheath/guide catheter&#xD;
      combination; (2) to determine if the 7F sheathless approach was associated with comparable&#xD;
      procedural success rates, procedure times, number of guides and crossover rates to a femoral&#xD;
      approach compared to a 6F sheath/guide combination; and (3) to use ultrahigh resolution&#xD;
      ultrasound to characterize the degree of RA injury and intimal-medial hyperplasia (IMT) that&#xD;
      routinely occurs following transradial percutaneous coronary intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and Study Design The study enrolled 41 consecutive patients undergoing elective&#xD;
      non-emergent TRA-PCI at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital (TMH) from June 2016 to December 2016.&#xD;
      The study protocol was approved by the TMH institutional review board. Informed consent was&#xD;
      obtained prior to diagnostic coronary arteriography. Patients aged 21 years and over who were&#xD;
      undergoing planned non-emergent PCI and willing to undergo a 24 hour and 90day post PCI RA&#xD;
      ultrasound were eligible. Patients were excluded if they had undergone a prior ipsilateral&#xD;
      TRA heart catheterization or PCI. There were no angiographic exclusions. Baseline clinical,&#xD;
      demographic and angiographic characteristics were collected prospectively. Patients were&#xD;
      randomly assigned to undergo TRA-PCI using a 7F sheathless Mach 1TM (Boston Scientific,&#xD;
      Marlborough, MA) guide catheter or using our catheterization lab's standard 6F CordisTM&#xD;
      (Johnson and Johnson, Inc.) sheath/6F Mach1TM guide combination. In order to minimize radial&#xD;
      artery size bias, randomization was stratified according to patient sex. PCI with a&#xD;
      drug-eluting stent was performed according to routine local practice and physician&#xD;
      discretion. Patients were preferentially treated with a SYNERGYTM (Boston Scientific,&#xD;
      Marlborough, MA) drug-eluting stent as the primary stent choice, however, other stents were&#xD;
      allowed according to physician discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients received dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) prior to TRA-PCI with an oral aspirin&#xD;
      (325 mg) and a p2Y12 platelet inhibitor (either 600mg clopidogrel or 180mg ticagrelor) bolus.&#xD;
      Intravenous heparin was administered to achieve an activated clotting time (ACT) of at least&#xD;
      300 seconds. Immediately following TRA-PCI, the sheath and/or guide was removed and RA&#xD;
      hemostasis was achieved using a standardized and previously validated patent hemostasis&#xD;
      protocol that incorporates the Terumo TR Band Radial Compression DeviceTM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique used for the sheathless introduction of the 7F guide catheter was as follows:&#xD;
      following diagnostic coronary angiography, a 6F 100 cm length multipurpose catheter (MP) was&#xD;
      telescoped through the inner lumen of a 90 cm 7F Mach 1TM guide catheter. The MP was then&#xD;
      used as an obturator to facilitate insertion of the 7F guide through the skin and into the RA&#xD;
      arteriotomy site over a 0.035 J wire. Only after the 7F guide/6F MP combination was&#xD;
      introduced into the RA and advanced together back to the aortic root, were the inner 6F MP&#xD;
      catheter and 0.035 wire removed and the 7F guide engaged into the coronary ostium for&#xD;
      TRA-PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrahigh Resolution Ultrasound Assessment Using the FDA approved FUJIFILM VisualSonics 55&#xD;
      mHz probe and previously established methods,16,17 ultrahigh resolution duplex ultrasound of&#xD;
      the RA access site was performed at 24 hours (pre-discharge) and 90 days post TRA-PCI. This&#xD;
      technique has been well validated as a means to accurately depict and quantify the individual&#xD;
      layers of muscular and elastic arteries. To prevent RA vasospasm, sublingual nitroglycerin&#xD;
      (0.4 mg) was administered within 3-5 minutes prior to performing the ultrasound studies.&#xD;
      M-mode, 2-dimensional and color doppler images were obtained. The RA diameter was recorded&#xD;
      and then the individual borders of the layers of the artery delineated with M-mode&#xD;
      ultrasound. To determine the mean IMT, we started off with the center of the probe centered&#xD;
      over the RA puncture site and recorded the thickest IMT measurements noted just proximal to&#xD;
      the site, at the center of the site (center of probe) and just distal to the site. We then&#xD;
      repositioned the probe more proximally, placing its distal leading edge at the puncture site&#xD;
      and obtained another proximal and mid probe measurement of IMT. The final recorded IMT was&#xD;
      the average of these 5 measurements. Using this technique, we ensured sampling over an&#xD;
      adequate length of the RA proximal to, at and slightly distal to the point of arterial&#xD;
      access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RA access site was also assessed for other signs of trauma, including small focal intimal&#xD;
      tears, frank arterial dissections, pseudoaneurysms, arteriovenous fistulae, and vessel&#xD;
      occlusion. Given high resolution imaging, we were forced to distinguish between limited focal&#xD;
      intimal tears that were now easily visualized and simply a result of access site entry from&#xD;
      more frank dissections. For this, we defined a limited access site intimal tear (LASIT) as a&#xD;
      focal tear in the intima that was restricted to and not beyond the access site itself which&#xD;
      did not encroach on the lumen or cause any flow abnormality. Tears or dissections beyond this&#xD;
      were deemed true dissections. All studies and measurements were performed by 2 experienced&#xD;
      vascular technicians who were blinded to treatment allocation with additional independent&#xD;
      review by a reading physician who was also blinded to treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Clinical Endpoints Assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedural success rates (successful implantation of the stent with residual stenosis of &lt;&#xD;
      30% and no other complications), fluoroscopy time, the number of guide catheters used, and&#xD;
      the frequency of cross-over from radial access to femoral access were also recorded. Routine&#xD;
      clinical and interventional outcomes, including PCI success, in-hospital death, MI, coronary&#xD;
      dissection, urgent revascularization were also prospectively collected. Ultrahigh frequency&#xD;
      ultrasound parameters related&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis For comparisons between groups, two-sided Student t-tests were used for&#xD;
      continuous variables and chi-square or Fisher exact tests for discrete variables. The primary&#xD;
      outcome of the study was a comparison of radial artery IMT thickness at 90 days between the&#xD;
      7F sheathless guide catheter group and the standard 6F sheath/guide combination group. The&#xD;
      primary statistical analysis was based on a non-inferiority analysis and an intention to&#xD;
      treat design. The null hypothesis was that the 7F sheathless Mach 1TM guide would be&#xD;
      associated with at least a 0.08mm increase in IMT at 90 days compared with the 6F&#xD;
      sheath/guide combination. A non-inferiority margin of 0.08 mm was selected as this&#xD;
      represented a relatively small change compared to baseline IMT and RA diameter (~25% of&#xD;
      baseline IMT and only ~3% of RA diameter). It was therefore deemed unlikely that this small&#xD;
      difference would be clinically significant. Based on our own pilot data and a prior study, a&#xD;
      standard deviation of 0.08mm was assumed for IMT measurements. Assuming a one-sided 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval, at least 36 evaluated patients (~18 per group) were needed to have 90%&#xD;
      power to detect if the lower limit of the one-sided confidence interval lies above the 0.08&#xD;
      limit. If the 95% confidence interval lies below this 0.08mm boundary, then the null&#xD;
      hypothesis was to be rejected and non-inferiority declared. Superiority testing was also&#xD;
      applied using a p&lt;0.05 for a level of significance for intergroup comparisons.&#xD;
