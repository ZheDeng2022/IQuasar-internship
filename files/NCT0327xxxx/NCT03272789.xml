  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sometimes, certain patients, while the treatment comes to an end and while a remission is&#xD;
      possible, present psychological and emotional difficulties. The return in a &quot; new life &quot; is&#xD;
      lived as a factor of often unexpected stress which force the patients, from the end of the&#xD;
      treatment, to reconsider their future orientation, their roles and social identities, their&#xD;
      interpersonal relations, and the quality of their life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Often, they feel a strong feeling of isolation and a shape of social marginalization stressed&#xD;
      by the fact that forgiveness lead automatically to a spacing of the stays to the hospital,&#xD;
      which were for them a source of social interactions. Often incapable to deal with these&#xD;
      negative emotional situations, they live profound depressive episodes known to be associated&#xD;
      to a lesser survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators think that a support of type onco-coaching of sport- inspirated could allow&#xD;
      these survivors to find a certain quality of life to see certain well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study, It was analyzed the leadership &quot; which works &quot; in the high-level sport in&#xD;
      France. Five selectors of national teams of team sports were questioned about their&#xD;
      conceptions on the best practices of management and management of the people. They grant a&#xD;
      quite particular attention on the individual consideration of the athlete and the&#xD;
      implementation of a relationship of trust, to the delegation of the power and the sharing&#xD;
      regulated by the decision-making which strengthen the sportsman in a feeling of autonomy and&#xD;
      skill, catalysts of an intrinsic motivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These needs were satisfied, they give meaning to the share and get a psychological&#xD;
      well-being. The satisfaction of these needs is generally made through the realization of&#xD;
      purposes, results wished by an action, which can sometimes enter in contradiction with the&#xD;
      satisfaction of the fundamental needs and thus damage the well-being. The role of the coach&#xD;
      is to help the coached to target its purposes, to decide on a strategy to affect him and keep&#xD;
      an intact motivation throughout the process. Without being therapeutic, the questioning and&#xD;
      the action of the coach would allow the coached to reach gradually the satisfaction of its&#xD;
      fundamental psychological needs and thus a real well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intention is to make them benefit knowledge and expertise in the field of the coaching&#xD;
      and by a logic of research inter disciplinary to set up steps of support individualized to&#xD;
      propose adapted answers and assist them at best in their company on returning to the life by&#xD;
      making a significant contribution with the patients to help them to find of the autonomy in&#xD;
      their own decision-making, to find their social identity (refusal and discharge of positive&#xD;
      or negative discrimination), to accompany the therapeutic education of the patient towards a&#xD;
      stake in social reeducation and finally, to highlight and to strengthen its interests and&#xD;
      social concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of public health, this approach, facilitating the transition of the treatment in the&#xD;
      complete remission, could be subjected and so improve the quality of the services of support&#xD;
      proposed until then.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the hypotheses of research see each other confirmed, this device coaching of&#xD;
      sport-inspired of the patients in remission could then be transferable in other oncologic&#xD;
      fields.&#xD;
