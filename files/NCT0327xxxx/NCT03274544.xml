      This open label clinical study will be conducted in School of Chinese Medicine Clinics at The&#xD;
      University of Hong Kong (HKU) to preliminarily determine whether treatment with the herbal&#xD;
      formula PROLUNG could improve Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) symptoms, respiratory&#xD;
      function and the quality of life of patients with IPF compared with pretreatment baseline. We&#xD;
      propose to recruit 30 participants. The diagnosis and screening will be conducted by&#xD;
      respiratory physicians. Those who meet the inclusion criteria will be referred by the expert&#xD;
      to the PI. The PI will prescribe the formula in granule form to the participants in&#xD;
      Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) Clinics as usual. Patients will receive 6 months of the&#xD;
      herbal treatment and 7 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Annual rate of change in forced expiratory vital capacity (FVC) will serve the primary&#xD;
      outcome. The St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) will be used to additionally&#xD;
      assess respiratory functions. A standard questionnaire will be administered to obtain&#xD;
      information on age, sex, marital status, education, social class, smoking behaviour and&#xD;
      respiratory diseases. Other outcome measures include the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36)&#xD;
      and the World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment instrument (WHOQOLBREF) by each&#xD;
      participant after enrollment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a dreadful disease characterized by&#xD;
      progressive impairment in quality of life, increasingly limited physical function, and an&#xD;
      early death from respiratory failure. IPF is the most common and predominantly lethal form of&#xD;
      the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, with an associated median survival of only 2 to 3&#xD;
      years. The etiology of this chronic and progressive fibrotic lung disease is unknown,&#xD;
      although potential risk factors such as cigarette smoking and other environmental exposures&#xD;
      have been described. In a study published in 2006 based on a United States healthcare claims&#xD;
      database, the prevalence of IPF was between 14-42.7 per 100,000, depending on whether narrow&#xD;
      or broad case-finding criteria was used. IPF is more commonly seen in patients between 40 to&#xD;
      70 years of age. The risk of death as a result of IPF also increases with age, with a hazard&#xD;
      ratio of 0.25 for patients younger than 50 years and a longer median survival amongst those&#xD;
      younger than 50 (116.4 months compared to 62.8 months). IPF occurs more commonly in men than&#xD;
      in women and also progress faster and result in worse survival in men. The IPF mortality rate&#xD;
      in the United States was found to be 61.2 deaths per 1,000,000 in men and 54.5 per 1,000,000&#xD;
      in women, nevertheless, the death rate in women is increasing at a faster rate than in men.&#xD;
      Age-adjusted mortality has been found to be greater among whites than blacks and is&#xD;
      increasing at a higher rate among whites when compared to other racial and ethnic groups.&#xD;
      There is no effective treatment for IPF, although pirfenidone and nintedanib have been&#xD;
      approved for treatment of IPF, with benefit in slowing down lung function decline. At&#xD;
      present, the only intervention that improves survival in select patients with IPF is lung&#xD;
      transplantation. With this to look forward to, it is no surprise that patients and their&#xD;
      physicians are desperate for treatment options that might change the outcome. Traditional&#xD;
      Chinese herbal medicine has been an important source to treat this ailment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has dealt with IPF for long time. A condition similar to&#xD;
      pulmonary fibrosis can be found in Chinese literature thousands years ago. A disease termed&#xD;
      &quot;Fei Wei&quot; was described and is similar to IPF in definition, pathophysiology, and treatment.&#xD;
      It was reported that the disease was extremely difficult to treat. Other TCM terms of&#xD;
      respiratory disease similar to IPF were &quot;short breath&quot;, &quot;cough&quot;, &quot;lung inflation&quot;, and &quot;Fei&#xD;
      Bi&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, TCM has renewed its focus on pulmonary fibrosis and other respiratory&#xD;
      illnesses because of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), a viral infection which spread&#xD;
      in China in late 2002 and 2003. SARS infection resulted in pulmonary fibrosis in a number of&#xD;
      individuals who contracted SARS, although the pathophysiology of pulmonary fibrosis resulting&#xD;
      from SARS may differ from that of IPF, the fibrosis can be reversible. In TCM, the&#xD;
      pathophysiology for IPF is a complex of group of terms: Feng (Wind-external factor), Re&#xD;
      (Heat-inflammation), Tan (Phlegm), Yu (Congestion). Treatment may vary according to the&#xD;
      phases of the disease, symptoms, and individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IPF causes pulmonary interstitial chronic inflammation, immune complex deposition in the lung&#xD;
      interstitium into fibroblasts and collagen eventually leads to the destruction of lung&#xD;
      tissue. In TCM terms, this represents Blockage of Heat in the lung. With Heat in the&#xD;
      pulmonary mass, the Lung loses the function of controlling Qi, hence the patients suffers&#xD;
      difficulty in breathing, has no air suction, has shortness of breath, dry cough, wheezing,&#xD;
      and other symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In China, herbal medicine is the main treatment for IPF. Research has shown the effectiveness&#xD;
      of traditional Chinese herbs formulations developed to treat IPF. The Individual herbs of the&#xD;
      formula have been widely used to improve pulmonary function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current evidence Chinese herbal medicine formula used in the proposed study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our empirical evidence suggests that one Chinese herbal medicine formula PROLUNG has&#xD;
      considerable benefit in the treatment of IPF. Individual herbs of the formula are listed as&#xD;
      follows (weight in granule preparation):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Huang Qi (Radix Astragali Membranaceus): 2 g Dan Shen (Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae): 1 g&#xD;
      Jiang Huang (Rhizoma Curcumae Longae): 1 g Yin Xing (Semen Gingko Bilobae): 1 g Mai Men Dong&#xD;
      (Tuber Ophiopogonis Japonoci): 1 g Bai He (Bulbus Lilii): 1g Jin Yin Hua (Flos Lonicerae&#xD;
      Japonicae): 1 g Zi Su Ye (Folium Perillae Frutescentis): 1 g Yin Yang Huo (Herba Epimedii):&#xD;
      1g&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapeutic effects in treating IPF: One study in animal model of IPF has shown that&#xD;
      treatment with an herbal formula including Ginseng, Mai Men Dong, Tao Ren, Chi Shao, Neu Xi,&#xD;
      Jie Geng, Dang Gui, Di Hung, Ban Xia, Gan Cao, Zhi Ke, and Hong Hua inhibited B cell&#xD;
      hyperactivity, which may be related to fibrosis. IPF patients treated with a combination of&#xD;
      traditional Chinese herbs and drugs improve faster and remain free of IPF longer than&#xD;
      patients treated with drugs alone. One 2-month study was performed in 12 patients with IPF to&#xD;
      find out the effect of a combination of Dang Shen, Huang Qi, Sha Shen, Mai Men Dong, Dang&#xD;
      Gui, Dan Shen, Chuan Xiong, Sang Bei Pi, Xing Ren, Bai Guo, Huang Qin, Ban Xia, Ma Huang, and&#xD;
      Gan Cao. The patients were exclusively provided with the Chinese herb formulation except when&#xD;
      the illness worsened. The results have shown an improvement in dyspnea and cyanosis and an&#xD;
      increase in PO2 (partial pressure of oxygen) in 5 of the 12 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dan Shen (Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae): Dan Shen and its purified active component IH764-3,&#xD;
      have been shown to prevent pulmonary fibrosis induced with bleomycin. The Chinese herb&#xD;
      formulation blocks the expression of TGF-alpha1 and inhibits the activity of fibroblast&#xD;
      growth factor when administered 24 hours after bleomycin-induction. Dan Shen has also been&#xD;
      used successfully in the treatment of allergic rhinitis by bilateral injection into the&#xD;
      inferior nasal choncha.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Huang Qi (Radix Astragali Membranaceus): Astragaloside is the main ingredient in Huang Qi,&#xD;
      and is known to have antiinflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and immunoregulatory properties. It was&#xD;
      reported to improve lung functions in mice experimentally induced chronic asthma by reducing&#xD;
      the amount of hydroxyproline, an indicator of pulmonary fibrotic activity. The administration&#xD;
      of Huang Qi in a population with history of bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, and chronic&#xD;
      bronchitis, Huang Qi prevents against pulmonary tract infections. Among 30 patients with IPF&#xD;
      treated with Huang Qi in combination with other Chinese herb formulations, 3.87% showed&#xD;
      larger increase in diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) as compared with&#xD;
      patients treated with prednisone in a clinical study. A combination of Huang Qi, Dan Shen and&#xD;
      prednisone was given to 19 patients who had a 3.75% greater improvement in total lung&#xD;
      capacity, a 4.01% greater improvement in vital capacity, and a 3.78% greater increase in DLCO&#xD;
      than 19 other patients who exclusively received prednisone. Dan Shen and Huang Qi were&#xD;
      components in an herbal combination that resulted in 3- and 5- year survival rates in&#xD;
      subjects with IPF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Jiang Huang (Rhizoma Curcumae Longae): Jiang Huang's anti-inflammatory properties have been&#xD;
      established in rats. Curcumin, which is derived from Jiang Huang, also has anti-carcinogenic&#xD;
      and antioxidant characteristics. Curcumin can limit the expression of tumor growth factor- β&#xD;
      (TGF-β). It can also reduce TGF-β signaling in renal fibroblasts in vitro. It has been shown&#xD;
      to limit hydroxyproline levels in the lungs of mice exposed to bleomycin and to prevent&#xD;
      alveolitis in mice with bleomycin-induced IPF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yin Xing (Semen Gingko Bilobae): Yin Xing is recommended to treat chronic cough, asthma,&#xD;
      chronic wheezing, phlegm, and chronic voice loss. The bronchodilation and expectorant&#xD;
      properties of Yin Xing have been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mai Men Dong (Tuber Ophiopogonis Japonoci): For chronic dry cough and sore throat, Mai Men&#xD;
      Dong is a recommended treatment. Mai Men Dong in combination with other traditional Chinese&#xD;
      herbs was shown to be effective in the treatment of allergic asthma in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bai He (Bulbus Lilii): Bai He is recommended to be used in combination with other herbs, in&#xD;
      the treatment of dry cough, bronchiectasis, and hemoptysis and alone in the treatment of lung&#xD;
      abcesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Jin Yin Hua (Flos Lonicerae Japonicae): Jin Yin Hua is recommended to treat pneumonia,&#xD;
      bronchitis, and upper respiratory tract infections in general in combination with other&#xD;
      herbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zi Su Ye (Folium Perillae Frutescentis): Zi Su Ye improves bronchodilation, decreases&#xD;
      bronchioli excretions and relieves bronchiospasms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yin Yang Huo (Herba Epimedii): Yin Yang Huo has expectorant, antiasthmatic, and antitussive&#xD;
      actions. Yin Yang Huo has shown effectiveness to treat chronic bronchitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxic profiles and herb interactions: Individual herbs used in the formula are in general&#xD;
      safe and well tolerated within therapeutic doses. Dan Shen increased the effect of warfarin&#xD;
      when the two medications are taken together. Dan Shen also increased the activity of liver&#xD;
      enzymes involved in drug metabolism, thereby increasing drug metabolism rates. Jiang Huang&#xD;
      may also exacerbate the effects of warfarin.&#xD;
