    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-center Phase I dose escalation study designed to determine the&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 225Ac-J591 in a single&#xD;
      dose regimen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is for men with advanced prostate cancer. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      find the highest dose level of the study drug, 225Ac-J591 that can be given without severe&#xD;
      side effects. The research study is being done because the standard treatments for prostate&#xD;
      cancer that has spread beyond the prostate gland are intended to minimize the adverse effects&#xD;
      of the disease. These treatments, however, are not curative. Patients who choose to&#xD;
      participate in this study will have a screening visit to determine whether or not they are&#xD;
      eligible to participate in the study. The treatment phase is comprised of 8 visits over&#xD;
      approximately 12 weeks. The study medication is called 225Ac-J591, and participants will&#xD;
      receive an infusion of the study drug on the Treatment visit of the study. Upon completion of&#xD;
      investigational treatment with single dose of 225Ac-J591, subjects will undergo&#xD;
      68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC injection and same day PET/CT at the end of study visit to document&#xD;
      treatment response. Subsequently survival data and additional treatment(s) information will&#xD;
      be captured from their routine Standard of care (SOC) visits.During the other study visits,&#xD;
      participants will undergo routine tests and procedures, such as physical examinations, and&#xD;
      routine blood tests. Some blood tests will be done for research purposes only. After&#xD;
      completion of therapy, participants may be contacted on a periodic basis to see how they are&#xD;
      doing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Open to men age 18 and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis of progressive metastatic prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have been previously treated for their disease with particular types of therapy.&#xD;
