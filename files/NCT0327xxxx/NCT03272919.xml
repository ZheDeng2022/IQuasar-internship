  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common side effect of many forms of&#xD;
      chemotherapy having a negative impact on the quality of life for cancer survivors due to&#xD;
      numbness, decreased sensation, pain (of various intensities in the extremities), gait/balance&#xD;
      problems, and difficulty with fine motor skills of the hands and fingers.To date, there are&#xD;
      no preventive modalities to mitigate CIPN development.When CIPN becomes intolerable, optimal&#xD;
      doses of chemotherapy have to be reduced or discontinued, which may affect a patient's&#xD;
      overall survival. Intraneural facilitation (INF) is a technique developed by physical&#xD;
      therapists at Loma Linda University after careful study of the structure, pathophysiology and&#xD;
      biomechanics of peripheral nerves. The focus of INF is restoration of circulation to an&#xD;
      ischemic nerve. INF has been offered to subjects receiving treatment at LLUCC with anecdotal&#xD;
      success. The purpose of this study is to evaluate INF as a treatment modality under the rigor&#xD;
      of scientific inquiry to determine its effectiveness as a viable treatment option for breast&#xD;
      cancer patients with CIPN.&#xD;

      STUDY OUTLINE: This is a single institution study. Patients with newly diagnosed breast&#xD;
      cancer stages I to III with any biomarker status (ER, PR and HER), without preexisting&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy planning to receive treatment with platinum-based compounds&#xD;
      (Carboplatin and Cisplatin) and/or taxanes (Docetaxel and Paclitaxel) and chemotherapy naive&#xD;
      patients with gynecologic cancers including ovarian, uterine, and cervical cancer planning to&#xD;
      receive definitive number of platinum-based compounds (carboplatin or cisplatin) and/or&#xD;
      taxanes (docetaxel and paclitaxel) chemotherapy are potential study patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized into one of two treatment arms within 3 weeks of starting the&#xD;
      offending chemotherapy agents after fulfilling the other study eligibility requirements. Arm&#xD;
      1 (investigational) will receive INF twice a week for six weeks by the same treating physical&#xD;
      therapist (physical therapist #1). Arm 2 (control) will receive a standardized program of&#xD;
      muscle stretching and strengthening exercises twice a week for 6 weeks under the supervision&#xD;
      of treating physical therapist #1. Actual treatment time for both modalities is approximately&#xD;
      45 minutes. Measurements used to detect the presence and degree of peripheral neuropathy will&#xD;
      be administered by the same assessment physical therapist (physical therapist #2) at baseline&#xD;
      and at the end of weeks 3, 6, and 3 months post last physical therapy treatment. Assessment&#xD;
      tools are: ultrasound imaging on the popliteal and posterior tibia artery, the 20-item Pain&#xD;
      Quality Assessment Scale (PQAS, specifically addresses neuropathological symptomatology), the&#xD;
      National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Distress thermometer (DT), and the Michigan&#xD;
      Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI) will be assessed and recorded along with treatment&#xD;
      adherence. Treating physician will be recording National Cancer Institute Common Terminology&#xD;
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) neuropathy score and performance status at routine&#xD;
      intervals during and after chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ To compare the degree of neuropathy and distress between Arm 1 receiving INF therapy&#xD;
      compared to Arm 2 receiving usual care of muscle stretching and strengthening exercises based&#xD;
      on standardized measurements (PQAS, MNSI, NCCN DT, and AE assessment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the Ultrasound measurements of peak systolic velocity, volume flow and&#xD;
           pulsatility of popliteal and posterior tibia artery between the two treatment arms for&#xD;
           assessing differences in vascular perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the rate of any dose reductions and premature chemotherapy discontinuation&#xD;
           rates due to peripheral neuropathy between Arm 1 receiving INF therapy compared to Arm 2&#xD;
           receiving standardized program of muscle stretching and strengthening exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare subject acceptability, burden and satisfaction with the assigned physical&#xD;
           therapy modality between the two arms based on patient satisfaction questionnaire&#xD;
           administered at the end of treatment.&#xD;
