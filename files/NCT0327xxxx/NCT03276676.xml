  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this exploratory clinical trial in patients with high-grade a primary brain&#xD;
      tumor who receive chemoradiation is that the PET imaging agents [18F]Fluciclovine and/or&#xD;
      [18F]FLT will be a better predictor of tumor response than standard MRI based brain tumor&#xD;
      response criteria. When used in conjunction, the two PET agents may be better able to predict&#xD;
      tumor aggressiveness and thus overall survival than the use of individual-tracer PET&#xD;
      biomarkers. This may eventually lead to improved assessment of response (including time to&#xD;
      progression and overall survival) and differentiation of tumor recurrence/progression from&#xD;
      treatment effect (pseudoprogression).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment approach for patients with high-grade primary brain tumors includes&#xD;
      maximum feasible surgical resection, followed by 6 weeks of concurrent cranial irradiation,&#xD;
      and daily low-dose temozolomide chemotherapy; followed by 12 cycles of high-dose temozolomide&#xD;
      administered for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks (Stupp et al., 2005). Contrast-enhanced MRI&#xD;
      is the current standard for evaluating the success of therapy and monitoring for tumor&#xD;
      recurrence. MRI is typically obtained prior to initial surgery, within 24 hours after&#xD;
      surgery, at the conclusions of cranial irradiation, and then every 8 weeks during&#xD;
      temozolomide chemotherapy until evidence of recurrence. Despite this careful clinical and&#xD;
      radiographic surveillance, and despite decades of research into the histologic and molecular&#xD;
      classification of primary brain tumors, our ability to predict tumor behavior remains very&#xD;
      limited. Some gliomas will result in overall survival times of only months, whereas other&#xD;
      histologically-identical gliomas may yield survivals of years to decades (Curran et al.,&#xD;
      1993, Carson et al., 2007). Current assessment of tumor response to therapy is also poor.&#xD;
      Patients with complete radiographic response after cranial irradiation often progress rapidly&#xD;
      post-irradiation. In contrast, some patients with enhancing masses at the end of&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy may respond dramatically to further chemotherapy alone; or the masses may&#xD;
      even disappear in the absence of further therapy, so called &quot;tumor pseudoprogression&quot;&#xD;
      (Chamberlain et al., 2007). This confounding situation demonstrates a need for better&#xD;
      assessment of tumor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvements in the ability to predict tumor behavior prior to the start of therapy would&#xD;
      allow more efficient and effective tumor surveillance; better prognostication; and more&#xD;
      appropriate assignment of patients to conventional, aggressive, or investigational therapies&#xD;
      early in their clinical courses. This would provide huge economic and social benefits, and&#xD;
      could afford decisive insights into brain tumor physiology and biology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, the ability to identify, earlier and more accurately, whether individual patients&#xD;
      were responding to therapy would allow prompt discontinuation of ineffectual treatments and&#xD;
      institution of potentially more effective therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous efforts using imaging for such tasks have generally been limited to a single&#xD;
      modality (e.g. MRI) and/or single-tracer (e.g. FDG-PET). However, there is a significant and&#xD;
      growing body of evidence that complementary imaging of multiple aspects of tumor physiology&#xD;
      (i.e. using multiple PET tracers) can provide greatly enhanced information over imaging with&#xD;
      a single modality or tracer alone. In solid tumors, complex interactions exist between blood&#xD;
      flow, metabolic activity, and oxygen status which affect metastatic and proliferative&#xD;
      activity. Heterogeneous tumors may contain both slow-growing and fast-growing regions that&#xD;
      present different profiles of proliferation rates and amino acid uptake.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Two adult patient groups will be eligible for inclusion in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group A: Patients where there is compelling evidence, based on the MRI and/or CT imaging,&#xD;
        that a high-grade primary brain tumor is present. Pathologic confirmation will occur with&#xD;
        biopsy or surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients whose tumor is felt to be inoperable and a biopsy is performed but no surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a newly diagnosed primary malignant brain tumor (WHO Grade III or IV) who&#xD;
        will be receiving chemoradiation and who either did not undergo surgical resection or&#xD;
        underwent incomplete resection with residual tumor &gt; 1.0 cm in greatest diameter by&#xD;
        contrast MRI postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group B: Patients with pathologically proven malignant brain tumor (WHO Grade III or IV&#xD;
        glial-based tumors) who have undergone chemoradiation and have MRI-documented possible&#xD;
        recurrence/progression versus treatment effect (pseudoprogression) within 6 months from the&#xD;
        time of completion of chemoradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be 18 years or older for inclusion in this study. There is little&#xD;
             experience with the safety of [18F]FLT or [18F]Fluciclovine in children, and the risks&#xD;
             associated with radiation exposure may be increased for children under 18 years old as&#xD;
             well.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must document their willingness to be followed for at least 24 months after&#xD;
             recruitment by signing informed consent documenting their agreement to have clinical&#xD;
             endpoints and the results of histopathologic tissue analysis (when tissue becomes&#xD;
             available from routine care) entered into a research database.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients, or their legal guardians, must sign a written informed consent and HIPAA&#xD;
             authorization in accordance with institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Determination of pregnancy status: Female patients who are not postmenopausal or&#xD;
             surgically sterile will undergo a serum pregnancy test prior to each set of [18F]FLT&#xD;
             and [18F]Fluciclovine PET scans. A negative test will be necessary for such patients&#xD;
             to undergo research PET imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-imaging laboratory tests must be performed within 28 days prior to the [18F]FLT&#xD;
             imaging procedure. These must be less than 4.0 times below or above the upper or lower&#xD;
             limit range for the respective laboratory test for entry into the study (unless&#xD;
             clinically not relevant). In those instances where a laboratory value is outside of&#xD;
             this range, then such a patient will be ineligible for enrollment unless at the&#xD;
             discretion of the PI the abnormal lab value is of no clinical significance to the&#xD;
             safety or integrity of the study results. . For follow-up scanning sessions after&#xD;
             therapy has been instituted, laboratory testing will also be required due to the use&#xD;
             of [18F]FLT. The patients have brain tumors and will have received chemoradiation;&#xD;
             therefore, many routine laboratory tests may not be within the typical normal range.&#xD;
             As such, a factor of 4.0 times above or below the upper or lower value for the normal&#xD;
             range for any laboratory test will also be used to determine the acceptable range for&#xD;
             the 2nd and possibly 3rd imaging time points (unless clinically not relevant as&#xD;
             explained above). The baseline laboratory testing will include liver enzymes (ALT,&#xD;
             AST), bilirubin (total), serum electrolytes, CBC with platelets, prothrombin time,&#xD;
             partial thromboplastin time, BUN, and creatinine. For those patients receiving&#xD;
             coumadin or another anticoagulant the upper limit for prothrombin time or partial&#xD;
             thromboplastin time must not exceed 6 times the upper limit of the normal range.&#xD;
             (Appendix E, Laboratory Study Results).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically significant signs of uncal herniation, such as acute&#xD;
             pupillary enlargement, rapidly developing motor changes (over hours), or rapidly&#xD;
             decreasing level of consciousness, are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known allergic or hypersensitivity reactions to previously administered&#xD;
             radiopharmaceuticals. Patients with significant drug or other allergies or autoimmune&#xD;
             diseases may be enrolled at the Investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant or lactating or who suspect they might be pregnant. Serum&#xD;
             pregnancy tests will be obtained prior to each set of multi-tracer PET scans in female&#xD;
             patients that are not postmenopausal or surgically sterile.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult patients who require monitored anesthesia for PET scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are too claustrophobic to undergo PET scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV positive patients due to the previous toxicity noted with [18F]FLT in this&#xD;
             patient group.&#xD;
