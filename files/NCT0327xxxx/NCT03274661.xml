      Phase II trial in which patients with metastatic solid tumors experiencing progression after&#xD;
      first line standard chemotherapy or for which there is no standard chemotherapy, and for&#xD;
      which pembrolizumab does not have an FDA or compendia listing approved indication, will&#xD;
      receive pembrolizumab intravenously at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with metastatic or recurrent solid malignancy who have progressed on first line&#xD;
      standard of care treatment or for which defined standard of care does not exist or is not&#xD;
      readily available are eligible to participate on this trial. Patients for which pembrolizumab&#xD;
      has an FDA approved indication and for whom pembrolizumab is covered by their insurance&#xD;
      should receive standard commercial pembrolizumab and will not be eligible for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the Immune-Related Objective Response Rate&#xD;
      (IR-ORR) achieved with pembrolizumab in patients with Fanconi Anemia Repair Pathway&#xD;
      functionally competent and functionally deficient tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial treatment should be administered on Day 1 of each cycle after all&#xD;
      procedures/assessments have been completed. Trial treatment may be administered up to 3 days&#xD;
      before or after the scheduled Day 1 of each cycle due to administrative reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All trial treatments will be administered on an outpatient basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion every 3 weeks. Target&#xD;
      infusion timing is 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expansion Cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten (10) additional subjects with the diagnosis of metastatic or recurrent endometrial&#xD;
      carcinoma will be enrolled in the trial at the conclusion of regular enrollment.&#xD;
