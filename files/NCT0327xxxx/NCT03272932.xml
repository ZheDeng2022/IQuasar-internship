  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to assess the prevalence of Asthma COPD Overlap in subjects with diagnosed&#xD;
      asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The subsequent morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality of subjects will be followed up for 3 years.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Around 15 to 20% of COPD patients have features of asthma. These patients have more frequent&#xD;
      and more severe exacerbations, and higher medical utilization. The Global Initiative for&#xD;
      Asthma (GINA) and Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines&#xD;
      have given joint recommendations on the identification, diagnosis and treatment of these&#xD;
      patients having Asthma-COPD Overlap (ACO). These are at present expert opinions and further&#xD;
      studies are needed to establish the optimal definitions and treatment options. The&#xD;
      recommendations proposed by the guidelines have been adapted for use in the Asia area&#xD;
      countries. Nonetheless, the application to clinical practice has not been well established&#xD;
      and there are no prevalence data available on the COPD with asthma symptom population or&#xD;
      asthma with COPD symptoms population based on the recommended features for identification.&#xD;
      This is the current data gap in Asia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the proportion and clinical characteristics of patients with ACO as defined by&#xD;
      the joint GINA and GOLD recommendation amongst diagnosed COPD and asthma patients seen at the&#xD;
      out-patient clinics&#xD;

      Blood will be stored for future genetic studies. As there is currently no good biomarker or&#xD;
      genetic tests that can identify the cause or suggest the diagnosis of Asthma COPD overlap,&#xD;
      this study would like to explore into this.&#xD;
