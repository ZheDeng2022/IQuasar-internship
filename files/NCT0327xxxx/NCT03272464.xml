    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of drugs as a possible treatment for&#xD;
      BRAF-mutant melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Itacitinib (INCB039110)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dabrafenib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trametinib&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of the&#xD;
      investigational drugs and also tries to define the appropriate doses of the investigational&#xD;
      drugs to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drugs are being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved itacitinib as a treatment&#xD;
      for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has approved dabrafenib and trametinib as a treatment option for Melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are studying the combination of itacitinib,&#xD;
      dabrafenib, and trametinib. The investigators believe this combination of study drugs may&#xD;
      stop the participant's cancer cells from growing and spreading. All three of the study drugs&#xD;
      are inhibitors. Trametinib may work by binding to the participant's cancer cells to inhibit&#xD;
      the cancer cells' signals to decrease cell growth, dabrafenib may work by stopping the&#xD;
      participant's cancer cells from duplicating, and itacitinib may work by stopping the&#xD;
      participant's tumor cells from living and growing.&#xD;

             assay must be provided to the Overall Principal Investigator (PI) for approval. (FDA&#xD;
             approved tests for BRAF V600 mutations in melanoma include: THxID BRAF Detection Kit&#xD;
             and Cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease by RECIST, defined as at least one lesion that&#xD;
             can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded&#xD;
             for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as ≥20 mm with conventional&#xD;
             techniques or as ≥10 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. See&#xD;
             Section 11 for the evaluation of measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received any number of prior lines of therapy. All prior systemic&#xD;
             anti-cancer treatment-related toxicities must be less than or equal to Grade 1&#xD;
             according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 (CTCAE&#xD;
             version 4.0; NCI, 2009) at the time of enrollment. This does not include alopecia and&#xD;
             Grade 2 or less peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the&#xD;
             use of INCB039110 in combination with dabrafenib and trametinib in patients &lt;18 years&#xD;
             of age, children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future&#xD;
             pediatric trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤1 (Karnofsky ≥70%, see Appendix A).&#xD;

                  institutional upper limit of normal allowed if direct bilirubin is within normal&#xD;
                  range.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  PT/INR and PTT &lt; 1.3 x ULN1&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL OR creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min/1.73 m2&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Potassium &gt;3 and &lt;5.5mmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Magnesium &gt;1.2 and &lt;2.5 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1Therapeutic levels of anti-coagulation are permitted if clinically indicated, as per&#xD;
             section 3.2.15. Thus PT/INR may be &gt;1.3 if therapeutically anti-coagulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of INCB039110, dabrafenib, and trametinib on the developing human fetus&#xD;
             are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential must have a negative&#xD;
             serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to registration and agree to use effective&#xD;
             contraception (barrier method of birth control, or abstinence; hormonal contraception&#xD;
             is not allowed due to drug-drug interactions which can render hormonal contraceptives&#xD;
             ineffective) from 14 days prior to registration, throughout the treatment period, and&#xD;
             for 4 months after the last dose of study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform&#xD;
             her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Based on studies in animals, it is also known that dabrafenib may cause damage to the&#xD;
             tissue that makes sperm. This may cause sperm to be abnormal in shape and size and&#xD;
             could lead to infertility, which may be irreversible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men with a female partner of childbearing potential must have either had a prior&#xD;
             vasectomy or agree to use effective contraception. Additionally, male subjects&#xD;
             (including those who are vasectomized) whose partners are pregnant or might be&#xD;
             pregnant must agree to use condoms for the duration of the study and for 4 months&#xD;
             following completion of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to swallow and retain oral medication, and must not have any clinically&#xD;
             significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may alter absorption such as&#xD;
             malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or bowels&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy (chemotherapy with delayed&#xD;
             toxicity, extensive radiotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, or vaccine therapy)&#xD;
             within the last 3 weeks prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1. Patients are permitted to be on&#xD;
             dabrafenib and trametinib at start of therapy without wash-out period prior to Day 1&#xD;
             of Cycle 1. Dosing will change to protocol determined dose levels on Day 1 of Cycle 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have received prior JAK1 inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents. Patients who have taken&#xD;
             an investigational drug within 28 days or 5 half-lives (minimum 14 days), whichever is&#xD;
             shorter, prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of RAS mutation-positive tumors are not eligible regardless of&#xD;
             interval from the current study. Prospective RAS testing is not required. However, if&#xD;
             the results of previous RAS testing are known, they must be used in assessing&#xD;
             eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have no clinical evidence of leptomeningeal or brain metastasis causing&#xD;
             spinal cord compression that are symptomatic, untreated, not stable for ≥ 4 weeks&#xD;
             prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1 (must be documented by imaging), or requiring&#xD;
             corticosteroids to manage metastasis-related symptoms. Subjects who have been off of&#xD;
             corticosteroids for at least 2 weeks prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1 or are on a stable dose&#xD;
             of ≤10 mg per day of a prednisone equivalent for &gt;1 month prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1&#xD;
             can be enrolled. Subjects must also be off of enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants for &gt;4&#xD;
             weeks prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reactions attributed to&#xD;
             compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to INCB039110, dabrafenib, or&#xD;
             trametinib, or excipients or to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             serious infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmia, uncontrolled diabetes, or psychiatric illness/social situations&#xD;
             that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because INCB039110, dabrafenib, and&#xD;
             trametinib may have teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown&#xD;
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with the study drugs, breastfeeding should be discontinued prior to the mother&#xD;
             being treated with the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients known to be HIV-positive patients and on combination antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
             are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with the&#xD;
             study drugs. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections&#xD;
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken&#xD;
             in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of another malignancy other than the study indication under this trial within&#xD;
             5 years of study enrollment. Does not apply to subjects who underwent successful&#xD;
             definitive resection of basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, superficial&#xD;
             bladder cancer, in situ cervical cancer, in situ breast cancer, or other in situ&#xD;
             cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or current evidence/risk of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) or retinal pigment&#xD;
             epithelial detachment (RPED):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of RVO or RPED, or predisposing factors to RVO or RPED (e.g.,&#xD;
                  uncontrolled glaucoma or ocular hypertension, uncontrolled systemic disease such&#xD;
                  as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or history of hyperviscosity or&#xD;
                  hypercoagulability syndromes).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Visible retinal pathology as assessed by ophthalmic exam that is considered a&#xD;
                  risk factor for RVO or RPED such as evidence of new optic disc cupping, evidence&#xD;
                  of new visual field defects, and intraocular pressure &gt;21 mm Hg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or evidence of cardiovascular risk including any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A QT interval corrected for heart rate using the Bazett's formula QTcB ≥460 msec&#xD;
                  on the pre-study baseline single 12 lead EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History or evidence of current clinically significant uncontrolled arrhythmias&#xD;
                  (exception: patients with controlled atrial fibrillation for &gt;30 days prior to&#xD;
                  registration are eligible).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of acute coronary syndromes (including myocardial infarction and unstable&#xD;
                  angina), coronary angioplasty, or stenting within 6 months prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History or evidence of current ≥ Class II congestive heart failure as defined by&#xD;
                  the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification system&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Treatment-refractory hypertension defined as a blood pressure of systolic &gt;140&#xD;
                  mmHg and/or diastolic &gt;90 mmHg which cannot be controlled by anti-hypertensive&#xD;
                  therapy. In patients with no history of hypertension and a pre-study baseline&#xD;
                  blood pressure of systolic &gt;140 mmHg and/or diastolic &gt;90 mmHg, a second reading&#xD;
                  should be taken at least 1 minute later, with the two readings averaged to obtain&#xD;
                  a final BP measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Abnormal cardiac valve morphology (≥grade 2) documented by echocardiogram&#xD;
                  (subjects with grade 1 abnormalities [i.e., mild regurgitation/stenosis] can be&#xD;
                  entered on study). Subjects with moderate valvular thickening should not be&#xD;
                  entered on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prior placement of an implantable defibrillator&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of or identification on screening imaging of intracardiac metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No known active infection with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), or Hepatitis C Virus (HCV).&#xD;
             Patients with chronic or cleared HBV infection and HCV infection are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients requiring anti-coagulation with vitamin K antagonists, therapeutic level&#xD;
             dosing of warfarin can be used with close monitoring of PT/INR by the site. Exposure&#xD;
             may be decreased due to enzyme induction when on treatment, thus warfarin dosing may&#xD;
             need to be adjusted based upon PT/INR. Consequently, when discontinuing dabrafenib,&#xD;
             warfarin exposure may be increased and thus close monitoring via PT/INR and warfarin&#xD;
             dose adjustments must be made as clinically appropriate. If clinically indicated,&#xD;
             prophylactic low dose warfarin may be given to maintain central catheter patency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of a prohibited medication. The following medications or non-drug&#xD;
             therapies are prohibited&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Other anti-cancer therapy while on study treatment. (note: megestrol [Megace] if&#xD;
                  used as an appetite stimulant is allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Concurrent treatment with bisphosphonates is permitted; however, treatment must&#xD;
