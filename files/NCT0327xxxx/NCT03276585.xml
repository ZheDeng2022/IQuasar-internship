      The investigators hypothesized that depression is associated with home sleep EEG, subjective&#xD;
      sleepiness and insomnia symptoms. To test this, the investigators plan to perform sleep&#xD;
      examination with single channel EEG, in combination with questionnaire survey for insomnia,&#xD;
      sleepiness, depression and job stress to Koka city government employees.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a major global public health problem and is projected to carry an even greater&#xD;
      burden of disease worldwide in the coming decades. Both insomnia and excessive daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness (EDS) are sleep disturbance that commonly occur as a principal component of&#xD;
      depression. However, studies analyzing objective measurements of EDS or insomnia were very&#xD;
      limited. Multiple sleep latency test (MSLT, four nap studies under polytrophic recordings in&#xD;
      sleep labs) in psychiatric diseases demonstrated highly heterogeneous results. This may come&#xD;
      from most studies had small sample size, which is frequently associated with both depressive&#xD;
      symptoms and sleepiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full polysomnography (full-PSG) provides comprehensive information about sleep duration and&#xD;
      architecture, but it is too expensive and too cumbersome for large-scale or repeated-measures&#xD;
      evaluations (¥96,380/case by Diagnosis Procedure Combination/Per-Diem Payment System in&#xD;
      Japan). Using in-laboratory full-PSG as the gold standard has limitations in validity, partly&#xD;
      because participants tend to sleep more poorly in the laboratory than at home. Thus, full-PSG&#xD;
      may be unsuitable for screening large populations or for repeated evaluations. Actigraphy is&#xD;
      a simple method for monitoring locomotor activity and can be used to estimate sleep/wake time&#xD;
      but cannot access sleep architecture and sleep staging. Recent advances in electronic&#xD;
      technologies and sensor interfaces have enabled small sleep portable monitors. The&#xD;
      investigators compared a newly developed single-channel EEG monitoring system (SleepWell Co.&#xD;
      Ltd., Osaka, Japan) with simultaneously recorded polysomnography. Single-channel EEG showed&#xD;
      reasonable agreement with full-PSG (percent agreement and kappa coefficient of sleep stages&#xD;
      were 86.9% ± 4.42 and 0.75 ± 0.081, respectively). This single channel EEG may be suitable to&#xD;
      monitor daily sleep more easily in epidemiological settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective sleep monitoring is important. In measuring excessive daytime sleepiness, for&#xD;
      example, subjective evaluation (Epworth sleepiness scale) failed to show much correlation&#xD;
      with objective measurements with polygraph recordings. Individuals at high risk for&#xD;
      depression have been found to have negative biases in processing information. They may answer&#xD;
      subjective insomnia measurements more severely. Previous studies on depression and insomnia&#xD;
      came mainly from subjective measures, which may be influenced by such negative evaluation&#xD;
      bias. Objective sleep EEG measurements may be useful in overcoming such biases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep epidemiological study is limited in Japan. For example, sound estimates of prevalence&#xD;
      of sleep apnea syndrome in Japan were lacking: previous Japanese studies have been limited by&#xD;
      use of nonprobability samples, low response rates, small samples, and other methodologic&#xD;
      problems. The investigators have performed sleep epidemiological study in a male working&#xD;
      population in Japan. In the study, sleep apnea syndrome (apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) or&#xD;
      respiratory event index (REI) ≥15) in males was estimated as 22.3%, which was similar to&#xD;
      those in other studies including Sleep Heart Health Study. However, its target population&#xD;
      included only Japanese &quot;males&quot;. Studies in Japanese females are still missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Japan, employers have to perform annual medical check-ups to their employees including&#xD;
      detailed blood biochemical examination. Adding sleep survey to such annual examination, the&#xD;
      investigators can analyze detailed physical effects of sleep with minimal costs. Even after&#xD;
      the survey, with these annual examinations, the investigators can analyze incidences of&#xD;
      lifestyle-related diseases (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, etc.) in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies suggest that Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is important in emotional memory&#xD;
      consolidation. REM sleep may be the key between emotional distress and mental disorders: such&#xD;
      as insomnia, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. To elucidate these interactions,&#xD;
      it is essential to perform epidemiological study with sleep EEG monitoring. Without EEG, the&#xD;
      investigators cannot analyze REM sleep at all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators plan to analyze around 1,000 participants and analyze sleep&#xD;
      EEG at home. This will make a big difference, because participants usually sleep poorer in&#xD;
      sleep laboratory than at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have performed questionnaire surveys on insomnia and depression among local&#xD;
      government employees in Koka, Shiga prefecture, Japan since 2014. The investigators have good&#xD;
      relationship with Koka city government and participation rate to the surveys were as high as&#xD;
      93%, whose mean age was 42.0±10.3 years (range: 18-61 years) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that depression is associated with home sleep EEG, subjective&#xD;
      sleepiness and insomnia symptoms. To test this, the investigators plan to perform sleep&#xD;
      examination with single channel EEG, in combination with questionnaire survey for insomnia,&#xD;
      sleepiness, depression and job stress to Koka city government employees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The database, constructed during this project, will serve as fundamentals in the future&#xD;
      studies in analyzing mental stress, insomnia, depression, lifestyle-related diseases and&#xD;
      social costs in the general population. In the follow-up studies in the future, the&#xD;
      investigators will also analyze cardio-vascular attach events, cerebrovascular attach events,&#xD;
      sick leaves, incidents of depression and/or insomnia in the subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to get funding from Japanese ministry of education science and culture&#xD;
      to perform home sleep apnea testing. Because sleep apnea is a very prevalent sleep disorder&#xD;
      (over 20% of males have moderate-to-severe sleep apnea with 15 times per hour or more of&#xD;
      apnea/hypopnea events). Participants usually wake up for a short period (arousal) after each&#xD;
      apnea/hypopnea event, which cause sleep fragmentation in PSG/EEG. Sleep apnea syndrome is a&#xD;
      risk factor for depressive symptoms and sleepiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When some part of this population (for example, 50% of participants with depression and&#xD;
      similar number of those without) undergo clinical diagnostic interviews by psychiatrists, the&#xD;
      investigators can use this data to develop diagnostic tool for depression in the future.&#xD;
