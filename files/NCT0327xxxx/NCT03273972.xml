  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The INTENSITY-LOW study aims to answer if there are any limits to LDL reduction in relation&#xD;
      to benefitting vascular health from a mechanistic viewpoint, and therefore potentially&#xD;
      limitations to primary prevention in healthy volunteers by lowering LDL cholesterol using&#xD;
      PCSK9 therapies. This research is being carried out because it is unclear what the lowest&#xD;
      threshold of LDL cholesterol should be to attain significant reductions in CV risk in healthy&#xD;
      individuals. It is also unknown whether there is a true limit of LDL cholesterol below which&#xD;
      there is no further improvement in endothelial function in healthy people, and, whether this&#xD;
      is associated with a reduction in markers of both systemic and vascular inflammation. This&#xD;
      study will hope to provide evidence that the so-called pleiotropic effects of statins are&#xD;
      actually mediated by a mechanism of LDL-cholesterol lowering per se and not necessarily a&#xD;
      special therapeutic effect of statins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Defining this may help identify individuals from the general population who may benefit from&#xD;
      more aggressive lipid-lowering treatment than standard statin treatment in terms of CV&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in healthy volunteers only, where participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to either the Alirocumab arm (which is a therapy designed to lower cholesterol) or&#xD;
      comparator arm. Both Alirocumab and comparator arms will be combined with Atorvastatin&#xD;
      (another therapy designed to lower cholesterol) at the second dosing visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, thirty healthy individuals will be recruited to this single centre, randomized,&#xD;
      single blind, parallel group, mechanistic physiological study which will be conducted at&#xD;
      Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust/University of Cambridge. This study will&#xD;
      be open to recruitment for one year and the total study duration for each participant will be&#xD;
      approximately 10 weeks. There will be 4 study visits in total with a telephone follow up at&#xD;
      the end of the study. Of these visits, two will be dosing visits and the total duration of&#xD;
      treatment is approx. 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A series of non-invasive haemodynamic assessments and minimally invasive procedures including&#xD;
      blood tests and forearm blood flow measurements will be conducted prior, during and post&#xD;
      dosing to determine if there is an improvement of endothelia vascular function (as measured&#xD;
      by nitric oxide bioavailability) and reduced systemic inflammation. This study is funded by&#xD;
      JP Moulton Charitable Foundation.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Independent CRF research nurse to perform the drug administration. CRF nurse will be unblinded whilst the rest of the study team (including the CI/PI) are blinded. This will involve the ACRC nurse bringing the injection in a sealed box to the room, preparing a shield (so the volunteer is blinded), administering the injection (via alirocumab pen or placebo - saline in insulin syringe) and then putting the syringe back in the sealed box and removing the screen. They have to ensure none of the study team are aware of the Rx as well as the patient.&#xD;
CRF nurses will also have to collect and store medication in their building. Statin can be stored in a locked cupboard (open label).</masking_description>
