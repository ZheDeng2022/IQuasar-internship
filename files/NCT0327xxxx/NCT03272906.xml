      Study Design: This is a within-subjects crossover design. Subjects will participate in the&#xD;
      procedures twice, once under each condition (active vs. sham stimulation). The order of&#xD;
      conditions will be counter-balanced across subjects. Stimulation will target ventral inferior&#xD;
      frontal gyrus (IFG) and will be paired with standard speech-language therapy. Outcome&#xD;
      measures will be acquired at the beginning and end of a semester of standard speech-language&#xD;
      therapy, and at follow-up.&#xD;

      Baseline Behavioral Assessment: Medical and neurological history will be taken. Western&#xD;
      Aphasia Battery-Revised, Communication Activities of Daily Living-2, and Philadelphia Naming&#xD;
      Test (short form) will be administered. Narrative will be elicited (Cinderella story). Some&#xD;
      of these procedures will be videorecorded for later transcription. Subjects will also&#xD;
      complete a pre-tDCS safety screening questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      tDCS: Participants will undergo placement of 2 tDCS electrodes. For all subjects, the anodal&#xD;
      electrode will be placed at the following locations (EEG 10-20 system):&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) over the left inferior frontal gyrus (crossing point between T3-Fz and F7-Cz)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cathodal electrode will be placed at the second site:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) over right frontal pole (Fp2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two types of stimulation will be given, an active condition and a sham condition. In the sham&#xD;
      condition, stimulation is ramped up over the first 30 seconds (as in the active condition),&#xD;
      but then discontinued. This gives the physical perception of stimulation without the&#xD;
      modulatory effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulation will be delivered by a tDCS device with the following parameters for intensity&#xD;
      and duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intensity: 2 mA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration: 20 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
      tDCS will be provided for the first 20 minutes of each aphasia therapy session provided at&#xD;
      the LSU Speech-Language-Hearing Clinic. The therapy sessions last for one hour and are&#xD;
      provided twice weekly for 12 weeks over the course of an academic semester (fall and spring).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Therapy/Stimulation Assessment: Western Aphasia Battery-Revised, Communication&#xD;
      Activities of Daily Living-2, and Philadelphia Naming Test (short form) will be administered&#xD;
      as before therapy. Cinderella narrative will again be elicited. Some of these procedures will&#xD;
      again be videorecorded for later transcription. A tDCS sensations survey will also be&#xD;
      completed at the final assessment to determine the effectiveness of blinding.&#xD;

    <description>Therapy tasks will be determined by the clinician on an individualized basis and will not be affected by this research protocol. The only difference between the clinical therapy that is normally provided in the clinic and this research paradigm is the application of tDCS electrodes during therapy. Therapist is blinded to stimulation type.</description>
