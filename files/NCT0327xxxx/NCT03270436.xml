  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a comparative effectiveness cluster-randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (cRCT) of two Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) lifestyle interventions: a faith-based&#xD;
      intervention (Wholeness, Oneness, Righteousness, Deliverance [WORD] DPP); and a Pacific&#xD;
      Islander adapted intervention (Partnership for Improving Lifestyle Interventions [PILI] DPP.&#xD;
      Each intervention lasted 24 weeks and focused on the importance of healthy eating, being&#xD;
      physically active, and maintaining a healthy weight. Eligible participants included&#xD;
      overweight and obese Marshallese adults living in Arkansas and Oklahoma. The unit of&#xD;
      randomization is at the church level. The primary outcome measure is body weight loss (from&#xD;
      baseline weight). As selected by stakeholders, HbA1c, blood pressure, physical activity, and&#xD;
      dietary intake will be evaluated as secondary outcome measures. Data collection will take&#xD;
      place at baseline (pre-intervention), immediate post-intervention (6 months post-initiation&#xD;
      of the intervention), and 6 months post-intervention (12 months post-initiation of the&#xD;
      intervention).&#xD;

      Background and Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disparities in type 2 diabetes, pre-diabetes, and obesity among the Marshallese and Pacific&#xD;
      Islanders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Marshallese are a Pacific Islander population experiencing significant health&#xD;
      disparities, with some of the highest documented rates of type 2 diabetes of any population&#xD;
      group in the world. Our review of local, national, and international data sources found&#xD;
      estimates of diabetes in the Marshallese population (those living in the US and in the&#xD;
      Republic of the Marshall Islands) ranging from 20% to 50%, compared to 8.3% for the US&#xD;
      population and 4% worldwide. While national prevalence data are limited, 23.7% of Pacific&#xD;
      Islanders surveyed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2010 reported a&#xD;
      diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, more than all other racial/ethnic groups. Our pilot research,&#xD;
      which includes health screenings with the Marshallese community in northwest Arkansas&#xD;
      (n=398), documented extremely high incidence of diabetes (38.4%) and pre-diabetes (32.6%).&#xD;
      Our pilot data also revealed similar disparities in one of the strongest risk factors for&#xD;
      diabetes-obesity-with 90% of Marshallese participants classified as overweight or obese.&#xD;
      Thirty-two percent of those who had pre-diabetes were also overweight or obese. Further&#xD;
      compounding these significant disparities in diabetes prevalence and related risk factors,&#xD;
      research indicates that Pacific Islanders living in the US are less likely than other&#xD;
      racial/ethnic groups to receive preventative or diagnostic treatment, or diabetes education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reducing disparities by reducing weight. Overweight/obesity is considered the strongest&#xD;
      modifiable risk factor for type 2 diabetes, and even a modest reduction in weight (5-10%) can&#xD;
      be clinically meaningful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim. Our aim is to compare the effectiveness of achieving weight loss between two&#xD;
      Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) Lifestyle Interventions - the faith-based Wholeness,&#xD;
      Oneness, Righteousness, Deliverance (WORD) DPP, and the Pacific Islander culturally-adapted&#xD;
      Partnership for Improving Lifestyle Interventions (PILI) DPP - in the Marshallese population&#xD;
      using a cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design. The study design is a comparative effectiveness cRCT conducted in church&#xD;
      settings or other community setting convenient to the participant group. Churches were&#xD;
      selected as the primary setting based on Marshallese stakeholder input.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized participant assignment. Randomization will occur at the church cluster level, with&#xD;
      1:1 assignment of churches to each arm. Churches and community based participant groups will&#xD;
      be blocked (i.e., grouped into similar units) according to geographic region and approximate&#xD;
      number of adult church members. Randomization will be conducted by a biostatistician or&#xD;
      designated investigator, who will have no interactions with potential participants and has no&#xD;
      supervisory role with study staff responsible for recruiting, consent, and intervention&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Church-based recruitment is specified by stakeholders as culturally appropriate and the&#xD;
      community's preferred recruitment method. During recruitment, Marshallese study staff will&#xD;
      give presentations and distribute study information in English and Marshallese. Those who&#xD;
      express interest will complete an eligibility screener, to determine eligibility. All study&#xD;
      information and consent materials will be provided in English and/or Marshallese based upon&#xD;
      the participants' preferences. Eligible participants will be provided a copy of the consent&#xD;
      to review, and participants will have the opportunity to ask questions, consent, and enroll&#xD;
      in the study. The consent process will include providing information to the potential&#xD;
      participants and the opportunity to have bilingual Marshallese staff answer questions&#xD;
      regarding study participation. The consent document will be given to the participant, and the&#xD;
      informed consent process will be documented in the participant's research record.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sugar-sweetened Beverage Consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediate post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Change in participants' sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption from baseline to immediate post-intervention and 6 months post-intervention. This self-report measure assessed participants' SSB consumption over the past 30 days using two questions from 'Module 14: Sugar Sweetened Beverages' of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Participants could respond in number of times per day, per week, or per month. Responses for each question were converted to number of times per day (i.e., self-reported times per week divided by 7 or self-reported times per month divided by 30), resulting in two measures: number times soda was consumed per day and number of times sugar-sweetened fruit drinks, sweet tea, and sports drinks were consumed per day. Per BRFSS guidelines, these two measures were added together to create a total daily SSB consumption rate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Fruit and Vegetable Consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediate post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Change in participants' fruit and vegetable consumption from baseline to immediate post-intervention and 6 months post-intervention. This self-report measure assessed participants' fruit and vegetable consumption over the past three months using three items adapted from: Shannon J, Kristal AR, Curry SJ, Beresford SA. Application of a behavioral approach to measuring dietary change: the fat- and fiber-related diet behavior questionnaire. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 1997;6(5):355-361. Each of the three items was scored as Often=2; Sometimes=1; Never=0. Items were summed to create a scale score, giving a possible range of scores of 0-6, with higher scores indicating more frequent consumption of fruits and vegetables.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Proportion of Participants Engaging in Sufficient Levels of Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediate post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Change in proportion of participants engaging in sufficient levels of physical activity (PA) from baseline to immediate post-intervention and 6 months post-intervention. This measure assessed participants' frequency of engaging in both moderate and vigorous PA over the past month (&gt;4 times a week, 2-4 times a week, about once a week, etc.). This measure was adapted to include relevant cultural examples of PA from the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension 2 Brief Physical Activity Questionnaire (https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/media/studies/dashsodium/Forms_Manual.pdf?link_time=2018-11-13_18:06:05.776099). Both items used a 4-point response scale: 1) Rarely or Never; 2) Once a week; 3) 2-4 times a week; and 4) More than 4 times a week. Each 4-point scale for moderate PA and vigorous PA was weighted: 0=Rarely or Never; 1=Once a week; 2=2-4 times a week; and 4=More than 4 times a week. The weights were then summed and dichotomized as follows: ≥4 = sufficient PA and &lt;4 = insufficient PA.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Eating Habits Self-efficacy Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Immediate post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Change in eating habits self-efficacy from baseline to immediate post-intervention and 6 months post-intervention (12 months post-initiation of the intervention). This self-report measure assessed participants' self-efficacy related to their ability to make healthy eating decisions in the face of real or perceived barriers (e.g. while at social events, while watching television, etc.). This 7-item measure was adapted from items in the original Weight Efficacy Life-Style (WEL) Questionnaire (Clark MM, Abrams DB, Niaura RS, et al. Self-efficacy in weight management. J Consult Clin Psychol. 1991;59(5):739-744). Each of the 7 items are measured via 3 response options (&quot;Yes/Completely Sure&quot;=2; &quot;Maybe/Not Sure&quot;=1; and &quot;No/Not Sure at All&quot;=0), giving a possible range of scores of 0-14, with higher scores indicating higher self-efficacy for making healthy eating decisions in spite of barriers.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Physical Activity Self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Immediate post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Change in physical activity self-efficacy from baseline to immediate post-intervention and 6 months post-intervention (12 months post-initiation of the intervention). This self-report measure assessed participants' self-efficacy for exercising in the face of real or perceived barriers (e.g., bad weather, exercising alone, etc.). This 9-item measure was adapted from the Self-Efficacy for Exercise (SEE) Scale (Resnick B, Jenkins LS. Testing the reliability and validity of the Self-Efficacy for Exercise scale. Nurs Res. 2000;49(3):154-159. &amp; Resnick B, Luisi D, Vogel A, Junaleepa P. Reliability and validity of the Self-Efficacy for Exercise and Outcome Expectations for Exercise Scales with minority older adults. J Nurs Measurement. 2004; 12(3):235-247.) Each of the 9 items are measured via 3 response options (&quot;Yes/Completely Sure&quot;=2; &quot;Maybe/Not Sure&quot;=1; and &quot;No/Not Sure at All&quot;=0), giving a possible range of scores of 0-18, with higher scores indicating higher self-efficacy.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Perceived Family Support for Exercise and Dietary Habits</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Immediate post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Change in perceived family support for exercise and dietary habits from baseline to immediate post-intervention and 6 months post-intervention. This self-report measure was adapted to examine changes in perceived family support for engaging in healthy exercise and dietary habits. This measure consists of a 6-item scale adapted from: Gruber KJ. Social support for exercise and dietary habits among college students. Adolescence. 2008;43(171):557-575. Each of the 6 items are measured via 3 response options (&quot;Often&quot;=2; &quot;Sometimes&quot;=1; and &quot;Never&quot;=0), giving a possible range of scores of 0-12, with higher scores indicating higher perceived family support for exercising and eating healthier.</description>

        <title>Change in Sugar-sweetened Beverage Consumption</title>
        <description>Change in participants' sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption from baseline to immediate post-intervention and 6 months post-intervention. This self-report measure assessed participants' SSB consumption over the past 30 days using two questions from 'Module 14: Sugar Sweetened Beverages' of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Participants could respond in number of times per day, per week, or per month. Responses for each question were converted to number of times per day (i.e., self-reported times per week divided by 7 or self-reported times per month divided by 30), resulting in two measures: number times soda was consumed per day and number of times sugar-sweetened fruit drinks, sweet tea, and sports drinks were consumed per day. Per BRFSS guidelines, these two measures were added together to create a total daily SSB consumption rate.</description>

          <title>Change in Sugar-sweetened Beverage Consumption</title>
          <description>Change in participants' sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption from baseline to immediate post-intervention and 6 months post-intervention. This self-report measure assessed participants' SSB consumption over the past 30 days using two questions from 'Module 14: Sugar Sweetened Beverages' of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Participants could respond in number of times per day, per week, or per month. Responses for each question were converted to number of times per day (i.e., self-reported times per week divided by 7 or self-reported times per month divided by 30), resulting in two measures: number times soda was consumed per day and number of times sugar-sweetened fruit drinks, sweet tea, and sports drinks were consumed per day. Per BRFSS guidelines, these two measures were added together to create a total daily SSB consumption rate.</description>

        <description>Change in proportion of participants engaging in sufficient levels of physical activity (PA) from baseline to immediate post-intervention and 6 months post-intervention. This measure assessed participants' frequency of engaging in both moderate and vigorous PA over the past month (&gt;4 times a week, 2-4 times a week, about once a week, etc.). This measure was adapted to include relevant cultural examples of PA from the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension 2 Brief Physical Activity Questionnaire (https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/media/studies/dashsodium/Forms_Manual.pdf?link_time=2018-11-13_18:06:05.776099). Both items used a 4-point response scale: 1) Rarely or Never; 2) Once a week; 3) 2-4 times a week; and 4) More than 4 times a week. Each 4-point scale for moderate PA and vigorous PA was weighted: 0=Rarely or Never; 1=Once a week; 2=2-4 times a week; and 4=More than 4 times a week. The weights were then summed and dichotomized as follows: ≥4 = sufficient PA and &lt;4 = insufficient PA.</description>

        <description>Change in eating habits self-efficacy from baseline to immediate post-intervention and 6 months post-intervention (12 months post-initiation of the intervention). This self-report measure assessed participants' self-efficacy related to their ability to make healthy eating decisions in the face of real or perceived barriers (e.g. while at social events, while watching television, etc.). This 7-item measure was adapted from items in the original Weight Efficacy Life-Style (WEL) Questionnaire (Clark MM, Abrams DB, Niaura RS, et al. Self-efficacy in weight management. J Consult Clin Psychol. 1991;59(5):739-744). Each of the 7 items are measured via 3 response options (&quot;Yes/Completely Sure&quot;=2; &quot;Maybe/Not Sure&quot;=1; and &quot;No/Not Sure at All&quot;=0), giving a possible range of scores of 0-14, with higher scores indicating higher self-efficacy for making healthy eating decisions in spite of barriers.</description>

          <title>Change in Perceived Family Support for Exercise and Dietary Habits</title>
          <description>Change in perceived family support for exercise and dietary habits from baseline to immediate post-intervention and 6 months post-intervention. This self-report measure was adapted to examine changes in perceived family support for engaging in healthy exercise and dietary habits. This measure consists of a 6-item scale adapted from: Gruber KJ. Social support for exercise and dietary habits among college students. Adolescence. 2008;43(171):557-575. Each of the 6 items are measured via 3 response options (&quot;Often&quot;=2; &quot;Sometimes&quot;=1; and &quot;Never&quot;=0), giving a possible range of scores of 0-12, with higher scores indicating higher perceived family support for exercising and eating healthier.</description>
