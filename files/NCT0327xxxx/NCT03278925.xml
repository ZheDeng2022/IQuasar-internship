    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of defined green tea catechin&#xD;
      extract and to see how well it works in preventing liver cancer in patients with cirrhosis.&#xD;
      Higher levels of the molecule gamma-OHPdG may be found in patients with cirrhosis, which may&#xD;
      mean a higher risk of the development of liver cancer. Defined green tea catechin extract may&#xD;
      work better to lower levels of gamma-OHPdG and prevent the development of liver cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to collect safety data of defined green tea&#xD;
      catechin extract (Polyphenon E/epigallocatechin gallate [EGCG]) treatment in patients with&#xD;
      cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the effects of Polyphenon E/EGCG treatment on the suppression of&#xD;
      gamma-hydroxy-1,N(2)-propanodeoxyguanosine (gamma-OHPdG) levels in cirrhotic liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To collect Polyphenon E/EGCG pharmacokinetic data in patients with cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To study the correlation between gamma-OHPdG levels and mutation frequency and&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage spectrum in the p53 and beta-catenin genes in cirrhotic&#xD;
      liver tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate the fraction of patients with liver cirrhosis that have high levels of&#xD;
      gamma-OHPdG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the effects of Polyphenon E/EGCG on the grade of cirrhosis as measured by&#xD;
      FibroScan and Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To develop a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and/or enzyme-linked&#xD;
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based method for detecting urinary and blood gamma-OHPdG, to&#xD;
      correlate with liver gamma-OHPdG levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate any hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development during the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive defined green tea catechin extract orally (PO) once daily (QD) or twice&#xD;
      daily (BID) for 24 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 28 days.&#xD;

          -  Green tea has been consumed by humans for thousands of years and teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects have not been reported; however, subjects in this study will&#xD;
             take high doses of Polyphenon E; the teratogenic or abortifacient effects of high dose&#xD;
             Polyphenon E is unknown; therefore pregnant women are excluded from this study;&#xD;
             because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events (AEs) in nursing&#xD;
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with Polyphenon E, breastfeeding should&#xD;
             be discontinued if the mother is treated with this study agent&#xD;
