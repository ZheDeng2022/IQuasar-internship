  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are several data suggesting that pembrolizumab and bevacizumab may be synergistic.&#xD;
      Enhanced tumor angiogenesis is commonly associated with absence of tumor-infiltrating T cells&#xD;
      in patients. There is evidence in OC that tumor expression of VEGF is negatively correlated&#xD;
      to the density of CD3+TILs and this phenotype is associated with early recurrence, consistent&#xD;
      with prior studies showing a correlation of VEGF to early recurrence and short survival.&#xD;
      Furthermore, in ascites, high levels of VEGF correlate to low numbers of NK T-like CD3+CD56+&#xD;
      cells&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized phase II study aims to evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab in combina-tion&#xD;
      with the standard neo adjuvant chemotherapy followed by IDS and the safety of this strategy&#xD;
      in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. We assume that its administration in the neo&#xD;
      adjuvant setting combination with standard of care (4 cycles of standard chemotherapy) would&#xD;
      improve the response rate and consequently will help to achieve optimal debulking rate at&#xD;
      IDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, patients will continue to be treated with standard of care (chemotherapy for 2&#xD;
      to 5 cycles plus or less bevacizumab) or the same combination plus pembrolizumab (keytruda).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The standard procedure for initial diagnosis recommends the realization of laparoscopy first&#xD;
      for all suspicious advanced ovarian carcinoma. This procedure should able to confirm&#xD;
      histo-logical diagnosis and to describe the all abdominal extension of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For advanced stages, complete primary cyto-reductive surgery followed by 6 cycles of&#xD;
      chemotherapy based remains the standard of care as first treatment in ovarian cancer. It is&#xD;
      part of a large surgery including total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy,&#xD;
      omentectomy, appendectomy, lymphadenectomy and removal of all peritoneal carcinomatosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, complete resection of all macroscopic disease at primary debulking surgery has&#xD;
      been shown to be the single most important independent prognostic factor in advanced ovarian&#xD;
      carcinoma , and this was confirmed for interval debulking surgery (IDS) after neo adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy in the EORTC-GCG study . These results suggest that neo-adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      followed by surgical cytoreduction is an acceptable management strategy for patients with&#xD;
      advanced ovarian cancer and is more and more frequently used in Europe in advanced ovarian&#xD;
      cancer patients with high burden of tumor . Due to these confirmed results, the rate of&#xD;
      patients receiving neo adjuvant chemotherapy increased over time compared to up front surgery&#xD;
      Hence, we hypothesize that improving the response rate to neo adjuvant chemotherapy would&#xD;
      improve the optimal debulking rate at IDS and ultimately the survival. This change of medical&#xD;
      practices over time opened the possibility to explore new agent in combination with&#xD;
      chemotherapy. For patients whose extent of disease is not amenable to complete or optimal&#xD;
      upfront debulking surgery, neo adjuvant treatment with carboplatin plus paclitaxel should be&#xD;
      considered, followed by an interval debulking surgery. A minimum of 3 cycles of&#xD;
      carboplatin/paclitaxel must be administered before to propose interval surgery. After&#xD;
      interval surgery, completion of the chemotherapy with 3 or 4 more chemotherapy regimen is&#xD;
      proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with macroscopic residual disease or when disease remains unresectable,&#xD;
      combination with bevacizumab to adjuvant chemotherapy then a maintenance phase of bevacizumab&#xD;
      alone can be proposed as a standard of care Given that facts, there is a strong rationale to&#xD;
      introduce additional neo adjuvant therapies that would strengthen the tumor shrinkage and&#xD;
      improve the resectability rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, immune surveillance plays an important role in tumor outcome of ovarian cancer&#xD;
      patients. Indeed, clinical data in ovarian cancer patients have demonstrated that an&#xD;
      antitumor immune response and immune evasion mechanisms are correlated, respectively, with a&#xD;
      better and lower survival). Thus, immunotherapies are emerging as potential strategies to&#xD;
      enhance classical EOC treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, they also have demonstrated significant efficacy in aggressive cancers of&#xD;
      other histology such as metastatic Lung Cancer , metastatic Renal Cell Cancer or metastatic&#xD;
      Bladder Cancer .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately half of OC patients display a spontaneous antitumor immune response by&#xD;
      antibodies and oligoclonal T-cells which recognize autologous tumor-associated antigens&#xD;
      (TAAs). OC exhibits an extreme degree of heterogeneity of TAAs with an average of 60 private&#xD;
      nonsynonymous mutations per tumor which are rarely shared among different tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though data remains scarce, high IHC PD-L1 expression (score 2 &amp; 3) has been detected in 68%&#xD;
      of ovarian cancer patients (n=70) and that expression of PD-L1 had a strong prognostic value&#xD;
      . The authors found also that the density of intraepithelial CD8+ T cells was inversely&#xD;
      correlated to expression of PD-L1 by tumors, suggesting that the expres-sion of PD-L1 on&#xD;
      tumor cells may inhibit invasion of tumor epithelium by CD8+ T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, PD-1 expression at the surface of intra-tumoral CD4+ FOXP3+ Tregs was found to&#xD;
      show the highest levels in ovarian cancer (around 20% of the cells) compared to other tumor&#xD;
      types, including melanoma, renal cell cancer or hepatoma . Thus targeting PD-1/PD-L1 pathway&#xD;
      may inhibit Treg expression, one of the major component of ovarian cancer immunosuppression.&#xD;
      Also Curiel et al showed that myeloid dendritic cells (MDCs) from ovarian cancer express PD-1&#xD;
      and that blockade of PD-1 enhanced MDC-mediated T-cell activation, including upregulation of&#xD;
      IL-2 and interferon-gamma, and down regulation of IL-10, which resulted in enhanced T-cell&#xD;
      immunity against autologous ovarian human tumors into NOD-SCID mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Together with the aforementioned data on immune infiltration, these data provide the&#xD;
      rationale for a therapeutic PD-1/PD-L1 pathway blockade in ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In ovarian carcinoma patients, the anti-PD1 compound nivolumab has been reported to achieve 3&#xD;
      objectives responses out of 13 (23%) heavily pre-treated patients. Response was prolonged&#xD;
      over 1 year in 2 out of the 3 responders. Similarly, the anti-PD1 pembrozilumab achieved 3&#xD;
      confirmed responses (11.5% [(95% CI, 2.4-30.2]) in 26 patients treated in a phase IB study&#xD;
      and 3 additional patients had a tumor reduction of at least 30%. Most common AEs were fatigue&#xD;
      (42.3%), anemia (30.8%), and decreased appetite (30.8%). Drug-related AEs occurred in 69.2%&#xD;
      of pts (grade ≥ 3, 1/26 pts).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anti-PD-L1 avelumab has reported a 10.7% objective response and a 44% stabilization rate&#xD;
      in 75 patients with ovarian cancer in relapse. In this study, con-firmed or unconfirmed&#xD;
      responses (n=11) tend to be more frequently observed in patients with low burden of tumor,&#xD;
      limited number of prior lines of chemotherapy and in the setting of platinum-sensitivity.&#xD;
      Toxicity was minimal. Considering all grades, fatigue was observed in 16% of the patients,&#xD;
      chills in 12%, nausea in 10.7%, diarrhea in 10.7%, rash in 8% and hypothyroidism in 5.3%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for combining pembrolizumab and standard chemotherapy Kryczek et al compared the&#xD;
      PD-1 expression level at the surface of intra-tumoral CD4+ FOXP3+ Tregs among many cancer&#xD;
      types. Interestingly, the higher level of PD-1 expression (around 20%) was found on Tregs of&#xD;
      ovarian cancers whereas it was much lower (&lt;10%) in other cancer types (Colon cancer, Hepatic&#xD;
      cancer, Melanoma, Pancreatic carcinoma, Renal cell carcinoma). PD-L1 expression has also been&#xD;
      detected in ovarian cancer tissue analysis by Immunohistochemistry staining and its level of&#xD;
      expression has been correlated to a bad outcome of patients (59). Together with the&#xD;
      aforementioned data on immune infiltration, these results provide rationale for a therapeutic&#xD;
      PD-1/PD-L1 pathway blockade in ovarian cancer. In the published trials on such compounds,&#xD;
      addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy or using alone has been shown to improve the&#xD;
      response rates with a median time to response at 8 weeks (60,61).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for combining pembrolizumab and bevacizumab There are several data suggesting that&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and bevacizumab may be synergistic. Enhanced tumor angiogenesis is commonly&#xD;
      associated with absence of tumor-infiltrating T cells in patients. There is evidence in OC&#xD;
      that tumor expression of VEGF is negatively correlated to the density of CD3+TILs and this&#xD;
      phenotype is associated with early recurrence, consistent with prior studies showing a&#xD;
      correlation of VEGF to early recurrence and short survival. Furthermore, in ascites, high&#xD;
      levels of VEGF correlate to low numbers of NK T-like CD3+CD56+ cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized phase II study aims to evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab in combina-tion&#xD;
      with the standard neo adjuvant chemotherapy followed by IDS and the safety of this strategy&#xD;
      in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. We assume that its administration in the neo&#xD;
      adjuvant setting combination with standard of care (4 cycles of standard chemotherapy) would&#xD;
      improve the response rate and consequently will help to achieve optimal debulking rate at&#xD;
      IDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, patients will continue to be treated with standard of care (chemotherapy for 2&#xD;
      to 5 cycles plus or less bevacizumab) or the same combination plus pembrolizumab (keytruda).&#xD;

             or infectious disease, active ulcers (gastrointestinal tract, skin) or a laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that may Increase the risk associated with study participation or study&#xD;
             drug administration and in the judgment of the investigator would make the patient&#xD;
             inappropriate for entry into the study,&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any contraindications for therapy with paclitaxel or carboplatin, e.g. a history of&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.&#xD;
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.&#xD;

&#xD;
             Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines&#xD;
             and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live&#xD;
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. History of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;

             might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation&#xD;
             for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to&#xD;
             participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Psychological, familial, sociological or geographical factors potentially hampering&#xD;
