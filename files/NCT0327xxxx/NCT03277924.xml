      Phase I-II, single-arm, non-randomized, open-label, multicenter, international clinical&#xD;
      trial, with eight cohorts (DDCS, EMC, VS, SFT, CCS, ASPS, UPS, LMS and OS). Nine sites in&#xD;
      Spain, 3 sites in Italy and 1 site in the United Kingdom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C1 to 6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of the sunitinib plus nivolumab combination as measured&#xD;
      by PFSR at 6 months (CS/DDCS, EMC, VS, SFT, CCS cohorts) and at 12 months (ASPS cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: Adult patients will receive an initial induction phase (IP) from day 1 to day 14&#xD;
      of sunitinib 37.5 mg/day followed by a maintenance phase (MP) of sunitinib 25mg/day&#xD;
      continuously + nivolumab 240mg every 2 weeks. Pediatric patients will receive an initial IP&#xD;
      from day 1 to day 14 of (&lt;18 years) sunitinib at 25 mg/day unless the body surface area (BSA)&#xD;
      of the patient is &gt;1.7. If BSA is &gt;1.7, then sunitinib 37.5 mg/day will be given followed by&#xD;
      a MP of sunitinib 25 mg/day continuously + nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks regimen (if weight&#xD;
      ≥40 kg) or sunitinib 25 mg/day continuously + nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks regimen (if&#xD;
      weight &lt;40kg). Treatment will continue until disease progression, development of unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, non-compliance, withdrawal of consent by the patient or investigator decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C 7&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine the MTD of the epirubicin + ifosfamide + nivolumab combination in&#xD;
      undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and of the doxorubicin + dacarbazine + nivolumab&#xD;
      combination in leiomyosarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 7a dose level 0: Patients will receive epirubicin dose of 60 mg/m2/d, d1 and d2 IV 20&#xD;
      minutes; followed by ifosfamide 3 g/m2/d d1-3, IV 3h with MESNA protection (40% of total dose&#xD;
      of ifosfamide in each administration at 0, 3 and 6 h from ifosfamide initiation). Once&#xD;
      finished Ifosfamide infusion of day 3, nivolumab is administered during 30 minutes, at dose&#xD;
      of 360 mg IV, Q3W. GCSF support is mandatory. One-year maintenance of nivolumab is foreseen&#xD;
      in the absence of progressive disease. If three or more DLTs occur nivolumab dose will be&#xD;
      lowered to dose level -1 where patients will receive epirubicin dose of 60 mg/m2/d, d1 and d2&#xD;
      IV 20 minutes; followed by ifosfamide 3 g/m2/d d1-3, IV 3h with MESNA protection (40% of&#xD;
      total dose of ifosfamide in each administration at 0, 3 and 6 h from ifosfamide initiation).&#xD;
      Once finished Ifosfamide infusion of day 3, nivolumab is administered during 30 minutes, at&#xD;
      dose of 240 mg IV, Q3W. GCSF support is mandatory. One-year maintenance of nivolumab is&#xD;
      foreseen in the absence of progressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 7b dose level 0: Patients will receive doxorubicin at dose of 75 mg/m2/d, d1 IV 20&#xD;
      minutes; followed by dacarbazine 400 mg//m2/d IV 60 minutes. Dacarbazine is administered also&#xD;
      on day 2 of cycle. Once finished Dacarbazine infusion of day 2, nivolumab is administered for&#xD;
      30 minutes, at dose of 360 mg IV, Q3W. GCSF support is mandatory. One-year maintenance of&#xD;
      nivolumab is foreseen in the absence of progressive disease. If three or more DLTs occur&#xD;
      nivolumab dose will be lowered to dose level -1 where patients will receive doxorubicin at&#xD;
      dose of 75 mg/m2/d, d1 IV 20 minutes; followed by dacarbazine 400 mg//m2/d IV 60 minutes.&#xD;
      Dacarbazine is administered also on day 2 of cycle. Once finished dacarbazine infusion of day&#xD;
      2, nivolumab is administered for 30 minutes, at dose of 240 mg IV, Q3W. GCSF support is&#xD;
      mandatory. One-year maintenance of nivolumab is foreseen in the absence of progressive&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C 8&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:To determine the MTD of the MAP + nivolumab combination (phase I). Proportion of&#xD;
      patients achieving good pathological response (phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment dose level 0: In the IP, patients will receive CDDP 120 mg/m2 in 48h IV infusion&#xD;
      (days 1-2) followed by doxorubicin 75 mg/m2 in 48h IV infusion (days 3-4). CDDP and&#xD;
      doxorubicin will be given on days 1-4 and 36-39. Nivolumab administration will start on day 4&#xD;
      at flat dose 240 mg (after the end of doxorubicin), being the following doses administered on&#xD;
      days 18, 39, and 53 (240 mg). HD methotrexate at 12 g/m2 in 2-h infusion will be administered&#xD;
      on days 22, 29, 57, and 64. Surgery will be performed after finishing IP. Adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy will be administered after surgery. During the MP patients will receive&#xD;
      nivolumab on day 210, every two weeks up to day 364. If three or more DLTs occur, then&#xD;
      nivolumab dose level -1 will be activated where patients will receive MAP during the IP (same&#xD;
      as described for level 0), but the dose of nivolumab will be 360 mg on days 4 and 36. Surgery&#xD;
      will be performed after finishing IP. Adjuvant chemotherapy will be administered after&#xD;
      surgery. During the MP patients will receive nivolumab on day 210, every three weeks up to&#xD;
      day 364.&#xD;

      Cohorts 1-6:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 1 - Dedifferentiated Chondrosarcoma (DDCS): For DDCS sample size is obtained for the&#xD;
      primary endpoint of 6-month progression-free survival rate, estimated accrual 24 months. A&#xD;
      6-m PFSR of 40% will be considered not promising whereas of 70% will be considered promising&#xD;
      in this population. With a type I error α of 0.05 and a power of 0.90, 23 patients were&#xD;
      estimated in this cohort. With one arm survival design based on survival probability a&#xD;
      Brookmeyer-Crowley like test is assumed (Brookmeyer, 1982) [65]. If at least 14 cases over&#xD;
      the 23 patients have a 6-m PFSR, then further investigation of the experimental treatment is&#xD;
      warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 2 - Extraskeletal Myxoid Chondrosarcoma (EMC): For EMC sample size is obtained for the&#xD;
      primary endpoint of 6-month progression-free survival rate, and estimated accrual 24 months.&#xD;
      A 6-m PFSR of 50% will be considered not promising whereas of 80% will be considered&#xD;
      promising in this population. With a type I error α of 0.05 and a power of 0.90, 22 patients&#xD;
      were estimated in this cohort. With Simon's two-stage Minimax design, at least 13 cases over&#xD;
      the 20 first patients (stage 1) should have a 6-m PFSR. Then additional 2 patients would be&#xD;
      accrued up to 22 patients. If at least 15 patients had a 6-m PFSR, further investigation of&#xD;
      the drug is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 3 - Vascular sarcomas (VS) (including angiosarcoma, hemangioendothelioma and intimal&#xD;
      sarcomas): For VS sample size is obtained for the primary endpoint of 6-month&#xD;
      progression-free survival rate, and estimated accrual 24 months. A 6-m PFSR of 30% will be&#xD;
      considered not promising whereas of 60% will be considered promising in this population. With&#xD;
      a type I error α of 0.05 and a power of 0.90, 23 patients were estimated in this cohort. With&#xD;
      Simon's two-stage Minimax design, at least 8 cases over the 18 first patients (stage 1)&#xD;
      should have a 6-m PFSR. Then additional 5 patients would be accrued up to 23 patients. If at&#xD;
      least 11 patients had a 6-m PFSR, further investigation of the drug is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 4 - Solitary Fibrous Tumor (SFT): For SFT cohort sample size is obtained for the&#xD;
      primary endpoint of 6-month progression-free survival rate by Choi criteria, and estimated&#xD;
      accrual of 24 months. A 6-m PFSR of 35% will be considered not promising whereas of 65% will&#xD;
      be considered promising in this population. With a type I error α of 0.05 and a power of&#xD;
      0.90, 24 patients were estimated in this cohort. With Simon's two-stage Minimax design, at&#xD;
      least 6 cases over the 14 first patients (stage 1) should have a 6-m PFSR. Then additional 10&#xD;
      patients would be accrued up to 24 patients. If at least 13 patients had a 6-m PFSR, further&#xD;
      investigation of the drug is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 5 - Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (ASPS): For ASPS cohort sample size is obtained for the&#xD;
      primary endpoint of 12-month progression-free survival rate by RECIST criteria, and estimated&#xD;
      accrual 24 months. A 12-m PFSR of 40% will be considered not promising whereas of 75% will be&#xD;
      considered promising in this population. With a type I error α of 0.05 and a power of 0.90,&#xD;
      18 patients were estimated in this cohort. With Simon's two stage Minimax design, at least 7&#xD;
      cases over the 12 first patients (stage 1) should have a 12-m PFSR. Then additional 6&#xD;
      patients would be accrued up to 18 patients. If at least 11 patients had a 12-m PFSR, further&#xD;
      investigation of the drug is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 6 - Clear Cell Sarcoma (CCS): For CCS cohort sample size is obtained for the primary&#xD;
      endpoint of 6-month progression-free survival rate by RECIST criteria, and estimated accrual&#xD;
      24 months. A 6-m PFSR of 25% will be considered not promising whereas of 55% will be&#xD;
      considered promising in this population. With a type I error α of 0.05 and a power of 0.90,&#xD;
      23 patients were estimated in this cohort. With Simon's two-stage Minimax design, at least 4&#xD;
      cases over the 13 first patients (stage 1) should have a 6-m PFSR. Then additional 10&#xD;
      patients would be accrued up to 23 patients. If at least 10 patients had a 6-m PFSR, further&#xD;
      investigation of the drug is warranted. An additional 5-7% of patients may be recruited to&#xD;
      compensate for potential unevaluable participants.For the variables that follow binomial&#xD;
      distributions, like the PFS rate and for the categorical variables, frequencies and&#xD;
      percentages will be calculated as well as their confidence interval. If needed, to compare&#xD;
      categorical variables both Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test will be performed.&#xD;
      Besides, Kaplan-Meier estimations will be used for PFS. Where possible, exploratory analysis&#xD;
      will include Cox models to estimate the impact of several factors on PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 7: This cohort includes a phase 1b study (3+3 design plus expansion cohorts) and&#xD;
      therefore no formal sample size has been calculated. Each subcohort (7a: UPS and 7b: LMS)&#xD;
      will include between 10 and 20 patients respectively (including the expansions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 8: A phase I/II is planned for this cohort. For the phase I part, the safety of the&#xD;
      MAP + nivolumab combination will be assessed using a 3+3 design including 6 patients treated&#xD;
      at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). This phase I could include up to 12 patients&#xD;
      approximately. Regarding the phase II part, for osteosarcoma with metastasis at presentation&#xD;
      and resectable primary tumor, in patients with less than 40 years, sample size is obtained&#xD;
      for the primary endpoint of histological response after 2 MAPs of induction. A proportion of&#xD;
      45% of good histological response (≥90% necrosis) will be considered not promising, whereas&#xD;
      68% will be considered promising in this population. With a type I error α of 0.05 and a&#xD;
      power of 0.80, 31 patients were estimated in this cohort. With Simon's two-stage Minimax&#xD;
      design, at least 7 cases over the 13 first patients (initial part) should have good&#xD;
      histological response. Then, additional 18 eligible patients will be accrued up to 31&#xD;
      patients. If at least 19 patients had good histological response, further investigation of&#xD;
      the drug is warranted.&#xD;
