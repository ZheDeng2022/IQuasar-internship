      Objective: The present study was to evaluate the effects of dexmedetomidine alone, lidocaine&#xD;
      alone and their combined infusion on postoperative inflammation cytokines after Laparoscopic&#xD;
      hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Investigators enrolled 160 women with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)&#xD;
      physical status I and II, aged 40-65 years, and scheduled for elective laparoscopic&#xD;
      hysterectomy with general anesthesia from October 2017 to August 2018. The participants were&#xD;
      randomly assigned into four groups(n=40 each group): group CON received normal saline&#xD;
      infusion, group LIDO received lidocaine infusion (1.5 mg/kg loading, 1.5 mg/kg/h infusion),&#xD;
      group DEX received dexmedetomidine infusion (0.5 µg/kg loading, 0.4 µg/kg/h infusion) and&#xD;
      group LIDO+DEX received lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg loading, 1.5 mg/kg/h infusion) and&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine infusions (0.5 µg/kg loading, 0.4 µg/kg/h infusion). The four groups received&#xD;
      an IV bolus infusion of normal saline, lidocaine, dexmedetomidine and lidocaine combined with&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine respectively, over 10 minutes before induction of anesthesia, followed by a&#xD;
      continuous IV infusion of normal saline, lidocaine, dexmedetomidine and lidocaine combined&#xD;
      with dexmedetomidine until abdominal wound closure, respectively. Interleukin-6 and tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor-α levels in serum were measured at different time points: before&#xD;
      administration of drugs (T1), the end of surgery (T2), postoperative 2 hour (T3) and&#xD;
      postoperative 24 hour (T4).&#xD;
