  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Part B: Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first occurrence of objective response until disease progression or death from any cause or switch to a new systemic therapy or end of study (Up to 2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response is defined as any partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) recorded from the start of study treatment until disease progression/recurrence is documented, a new systemic therapy is started or analysis cut-off, whichever occurs first. It is assessed by using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.1. RECIST v1.1 criteria- CR: disappearance of all target lesions, any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 millimeter (mm). PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameter.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part A and B: Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 90 days after the last dose of study drug (up to 2.5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that results in death; is life-threatening; requires hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability or in congenital anomaly/birth defect. Severity will be graded by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 4.03.</description>

    <description>Change in tumor size is the maximum reduction or, in case of no reduction, the minimum increase in tumor size from the start of study treatment until disease progression/recurrence, the start of a new systemic therapy or analysis cut-off, whichever occurs first.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part A and B: Objective Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of Cycle 6 (168 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response is defined as any PR or CR recorded from the start of study treatment until disease progression/recurrence is documented, a new systemic therapy is started or analysis cut-off, whichever occurs first. It is assessed by using RECIST criteria. CR: disappearance of all target lesions, any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameter.</description>

    <description>Best overall response (BOR) is defined as the best response (CR, PR, stable disease or disease progression) recorded from the start of study treatment until disease progression/recurrence is documented, a new systemic therapy is started or analysis cut-off, whichever occurs first. It is assessed by using RECIST criteria version 1.1. CR: disappearance of all target lesions, any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 millimeter (mm). PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameter. Disease progression: At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). Stable Disease: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, nor sufficient increase to qualify for disease progression, taking as reference the smallest sum diameter while on study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part A and B: Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Cycle 26 (2 years) or until disease progression/EOT</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response is the time from documentation of tumor response to disease progression was observed in participants with CR or PR. RECIST v1.1 criteria- CR: disappearance of all target lesions, any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 millimeter (mm). PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameter. Disease progression: At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).</description>

    <description>Disease control is derived as CR, PR or stable disease lasting at least 16 weeks reported during the study. RECIST v1.1 criteria- CR: Disappearance of all target lesions, any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameter.</description>

    <measure>Part A and B: Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months, 1 and 2 years of treatment initiation</time_frame>
    <description>PFS duration is defined as the time elapsed between treatment initiation and tumor progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. RECIST v1.1 criteria- CR: disappearance of all target lesions, any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameter.
