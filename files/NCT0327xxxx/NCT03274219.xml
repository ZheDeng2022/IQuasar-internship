    <textblock>
      Study CRB-402 is a 2-part, non-randomized, open label, multi-site Phase 1 study of bb21217 in&#xD;
      adults with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part A of the study will be Dose Escalation followed by Part B, an expansion cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following consent, enrolled subjects will undergo a leukapheresis procedure to collect&#xD;
      autologous mononuclear cells for manufacture of investigational drug product (bb21217).&#xD;
      Following manufacture of the drug product, subjects will receive lymphodepletion prior to&#xD;
      bb21217 infusion. All subjects will then be followed for up to 60 months in Study CRB-402.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects who complete the study, as well as those who withdraw from the study after&#xD;
      receiving bb21217 for reasons other than death or meeting the early termination criteria,&#xD;
      will be asked to continue to undergo long-term follow-up in a companion study.&#xD;
