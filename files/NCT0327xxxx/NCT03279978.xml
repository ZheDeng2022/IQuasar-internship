        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the Investigator, based on a&#xD;
             complete medical history, physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse&#xD;
             rate), 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a partner who is a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be&#xD;
             willing to use male contraception (condom or sexual abstinence) from the first&#xD;
             administration of trial medication until 30 days after last administration of trial&#xD;
             medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age of 18 to 45 years (incl.) at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.) at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in&#xD;

        Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including blood pressure, pulse rate or&#xD;
             Electrocardiogram (ECG)) deviating from normal and judged as clinically relevant by&#xD;
             the Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,&#xD;
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the&#xD;
             range of 50 to 90 beats per minute (bpm)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the Investigator considers to be&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as clinically relevant by the&#xD;
             Investigator&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of relevant allergy or hypersensitivity (including allergy to the trial&#xD;
             medication or its excipients)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of drugs within 30 days prior to administration of trial medication if that might&#xD;
             reasonably influence the results of the trial (incl. QT/QTc interval prolongation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in another trial where an investigational drug has been administered&#xD;
             within 60 days prior to planned administration of trial medication, or current&#xD;
             participation in another trial involving administration of investigational drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tobacco usage (more than 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes per day)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alcohol abuse (consumption of more than 30 g per day)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Drug abuse or positive drug screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood donation of more than 100 mL within 30 days prior to administration of trial&#xD;
             medication or intended donation during the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intention to perform excessive physical activities within one week prior to&#xD;
             administration of trial medication or during the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (such as heart failure,&#xD;
             hypokalemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the Investigator; for instance, is&#xD;
             considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or has a&#xD;
             condition that would not allow safe participation in the study&#xD;
