    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the capability of Raman spectroscopy as a non-invasive method for&#xD;
      monitoring concentrations of glucose by illuminating a small spot on the skin, collecting and&#xD;
      analyzing the return light. The glucose measurements obtained by Raman Spectroscopy are&#xD;
      correlated with those obtained using YSI glucose analyzer and ACCUCHECK instruments.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (DM), caused by impairment in the glucose metabolism is a worldwide&#xD;
      epidemic. It is projected that by the year 2035 there will be approximately 592 million&#xD;
      diabetic patients. Blood glucose (BG) levels are finely regulated by insulin secretion and&#xD;
      any defects in the secretion or function can lead to DM. As no well-established medical&#xD;
      intervention for DM has been known till date, continuous monitoring of BG is the only way to&#xD;
      avoid secondary metabolic complications such as strokes, heart attacks, high blood pressure,&#xD;
      blindness and coma. Diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of diabetes requires direct&#xD;
      measurement of plasma (or blood) glucose. Measurement of the fasting glucose level is the&#xD;
      preferred test for diagnosis of diabetes in children and non-pregnant adults, while the oral&#xD;
      glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is the preferred method of diagnosis for gestational diabetes.&#xD;
      In addition, patients with an established diagnosis of insulin-dependent diabetes (all type-I&#xD;
      and many type-II) require frequent glucose measurements for therapeutic monitoring. Emergence&#xD;
      of hand-held glucose sensors have enabled patients with the ability to self-monitor the BG&#xD;
      level. The frequent monitoring requires small blood sample (&lt;1 ÂµL) obtained by a&#xD;
      &quot;finger-pricking&quot; and electrochemical sensing using a portable 'glucometer'. However the&#xD;
      procedure is inconvenient, results in poor patient compliance and lacks in providing real&#xD;
      time information about concentration changes. Regardless of the clinical test performed,&#xD;
      withdrawal of blood or interstitial fluid is currently required for measurement of BG levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is based on preliminary research supported by the MIT Laser Biomedical&#xD;
      Research Center (LBRC), and promising results obtained with spectroscopic measurement of&#xD;
      blood glucose in the laboratory, in an experimental animal model, and in a small cohort of&#xD;
      human subject volunteers. In order to make non-invasive glucose measurement a viable clinical&#xD;
      technology, however, a methodological implementation and validation from bench to bedside is&#xD;
      required. In the application, we propose to accomplish this goal by means of a&#xD;
      carefully-designed translational research study employing specifically-designed&#xD;
      instrumentation and methods for pre-clinical validation and early clinical studies in human&#xD;
      subjects. These studies will incrementally increase in data complexity, culminating in a&#xD;
      clinical study in human subjects, as well as a non-invasive, spectroscopic glucose tolerance&#xD;
      test as an alternative to OGTT.&#xD;
