  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Robotic minimally invasive surgery has been rapidly adopted for a wide variety of surgical&#xD;
      procedures in adult patients across a broad spectrum of surgical specialties. This has&#xD;
      occurred despite the high costs and uncertain benefits of surgical robots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, Children's Hospitals and pediatric surgical disciplines have been much slower to&#xD;
      embrace the surgical robot. Many children's hospitals do not even possess a surgical robot,&#xD;
      and many of those that do borrow them from the adult operating room within the same medical&#xD;
      facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the first case of robotic minimally invasive surgery in children in 2000, robotic&#xD;
      procedures have been slowly adopted by select pediatric surgical specialists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advocates of robotic minimally invasive surgical systems add many useful features that&#xD;
      include improved dexterity, motion scaling, tremor filtration, greater optical magnification&#xD;
      (up to 10x), stereoscopic vision, operator-controlled camera movement, and the elimination of&#xD;
      the fulcrum effect when compared to conventional laparoscopy. The wristed laparoscopic&#xD;
      instruments used in robotic surgery provide seven degrees of freedom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the surgeon, these features may allow for more precise dissection with increased&#xD;
      magnification and visibility. The intuitive controls of the robot are purported as providing&#xD;
      the ability to perform laparoscopic procedures in an &quot;open&quot; fashion. In pediatric surgical&#xD;
      procedures, these technical abilities may have the potential to surpass the physical&#xD;
      capabilities of human performance in the tight operative fields encountered in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the clinical safety and efficacy in a dedicated multidisciplinary&#xD;
      pediatric program and to evaluate the relative cost of robotic surgery&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Laparoscopy has been adopted for advantages that include decreased adhesion formation,&#xD;
      improved cosmesis, decreased post-operative pain, and shorter recovery times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient benefits of robotic surgery are thought to be essentially the same as&#xD;
      conventional laparoscopy: decreased length of stay, decreased blood loss, decreased pain,&#xD;
      quicker return to work, and improved cosmetic result through smaller incisions. In pediatric&#xD;
      urology, there is evidence that robot-assisted pyeloplasty may be superior to open and&#xD;
      laparoscopic approach with decreased length of stay, decreased narcotic use, and decreased&#xD;
      operative times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall reported conversion-to-open-procedure rate is low, comparable to the conversion&#xD;
      rate in conventional pediatric minimally invasive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Robotic surgical technology may have a role in pediatric minimal access surgery. Design&#xD;
      features of robotic surgical platforms include motion scaling, greater optical magnification,&#xD;
      stereoscopic vision, increased instrument tip dexterity, tremor filtration, instrument&#xD;
      indexing, operator controlled camera movement, and elimination of the fulcrum effect. These&#xD;
      robotic enhancements offer improvements to conventional minimal access surgery, permitting&#xD;
      technical capabilities beyond existing threshold limits of human performance for surgery&#xD;
      within the spatially constrained operative workspaces in children. There is evidence that a&#xD;
      learning curve is encountered when adopting robotic surgery as demonstrated by decreasing&#xD;
      operative times as case volumes increased&#xD;
&#xD;
      At a stand-alone pediatric hospital, a robotic platform is often not available. Only a&#xD;
      minority of pediatric hospitals have robotic systems given the limited number of procedures&#xD;
      performed nationally. This is probably due to the costs of acquiring and maintaining a&#xD;
      surgical robot coupled with the tendency for pediatric hospitals to have less income and&#xD;
      fewer eligible patients to defray the fixed costs of the platform. A unique situation exists&#xD;
      for pediatric surgeons in hospitals affiliated with adult care as robots may be available&#xD;
      that are primarily used for adult subspecialties, most often urology. In this setup, the&#xD;
      logistics may be difficult and the pediatric team must be flexible and mobile to accommodate&#xD;
      the robot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Robotic surgery has higher costs than open and laparoscopic procedures. This is due to the&#xD;
      high costs of purchasing and maintaining a robot, increased operative time, and costs of&#xD;
      disposable surgical supplies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specificity of this study is to evaluate the clinical safety and efficacy in a dedicated&#xD;
      multidisciplinary pediatric program (gastrointestinal surgery, genitourinary surgery,&#xD;
      thoracic surgery, ENT, cardiac surgery and microsurgery) and to evaluate the relative cost of&#xD;
      robotic surgery.&#xD;
