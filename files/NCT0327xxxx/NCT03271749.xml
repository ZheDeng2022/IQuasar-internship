      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aiming at reducing costs and optimizing the use of these financial resources, several&#xD;
      postoperative recovery protocols have emerged that aim to reduce the length of hospital stay&#xD;
      by accelerating surgical recovery.1,2 In view of the current Brazilian political and economic&#xD;
      scenario allied to the existing scientific knowledge on the subject , the investigators&#xD;
      developed a protocol that aims to meet this need using resources already available and&#xD;
      offered in brazilian public health system. The investigators called this protocol as Protocol&#xD;
      of Operative Recovery Santa Marcelina (PROSM) that had as inspiration the protocols of&#xD;
      accelerated postoperative recovery already used in several European health services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the impact of PROSM on the length of hospitalization in days and&#xD;
           postoperative pain (visual analog pain scale - VAS) in patients submitted to surgical&#xD;
           procedures performed by the thoracic surgery team of the Hospital Santa Marcelina de&#xD;
           Itaquera.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the impacts of PROSM in reducing the costs (US dollars) of surgical treatment&#xD;
           and hospitalization of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of 200 patients with elective pulmonary resections (segmentectomies, lobectomies or&#xD;
      pneumonectomies) to treat neoplastic lung diseases will be selected by the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be randomized into two groups (rate of randomization 1/1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group will be submitted to the standard surgical treatment that is currently used&#xD;
      in Santa Marcelina - Itaquera hospital. The second group will be submitted to treatment with&#xD;
      the adoption of the PROSM guidelines, which will be detailed later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will evaluate in the two groups: surgical time in minutes, intraoperative&#xD;
      complications: intraoperative bleeding in mililiters, need for transfusion of blood products,&#xD;
      intraoperative clinical complications. Investigators will also evaluate the need for&#xD;
      postoperative recovery in Intensive Care Unit (ICU), medications used to maintain the&#xD;
      anesthetic plane during the procedure (amount of drugs in milligrams), medications used for&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia, length of hospital stay in days, postoperative clinical&#xD;
      complications, need for surgical re-boarding, immediate postoperative pain (VAS),&#xD;
      postoperative pain at the time of discharge and the first outpatient return (VAS), the need&#xD;
      for opioid analgesics at home after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the data collection, the investigators will analyze them and make a comparative study&#xD;
      of the costs of surgical treatment and hospitalization between the two groups. This data will&#xD;
      be obtained from the billing department of the Hospital Santa Marcelina de Itaquera.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients submitted to surgical procedures for the treatment of thoracic diseases, whether&#xD;
      benign or neoplastic, are exposed to potential complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main complications related to these procedures are primarily lung infections, followed by&#xD;
      thrombotic events, cardiovascular events, and complications due to previous chronic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Faced with the occurrence of complications, these patients require a longer hospitalization&#xD;
      period, using high cost medications, generating additional unexpected costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aiming at reducing costs and optimizing the use of these financial resources, several&#xD;
      postoperative recovery protocols have emerged that aim to reduce the length of hospital stay&#xD;
      by accelerating surgical recovery.1,2 In view of the current Brazilian political and economic&#xD;
      scenario allied to the existing scientific knowledge on the subject , the investigators&#xD;
      developed a protocol that aims to meet this need using resources already available and&#xD;
      offered in brazilian public health system. The investigators called this protocol as Protocol&#xD;
      of Operative Recovery Santa Marcelina (PROSM) that had as inspiration the protocols of&#xD;
      accelerated postoperative recovery already used in several European health services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the impact of PROSM on the length of hospitalization in days and&#xD;
           postoperative pain (visual analog pain scale - VAS) in patients submitted to surgical&#xD;
           procedures performed by the thoracic surgery team of the Hospital Santa Marcelina de&#xD;
           Itaquera.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the impacts of PROSM in reducing the costs (US dollars) of surgical treatment&#xD;
           and hospitalization of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of 200 patients with elective pulmonary resections (segmentectomies, lobectomies or&#xD;
      pneumonectomies) to treat neoplastic lung diseases will be selected by the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients under the age of eighteen years old, unable to read, understand and sign informed&#xD;
      consent, patients with compromised performance status (ECOG greater than 2), patients with a&#xD;
      body mass below 60 kilograms or greater than 120 kilograms , patients with allergy to latex,&#xD;
      patients with a history of allergy to any of the drugs used in anesthesia for PROSM, patients&#xD;
      with renal dysfunction, liver dysfunction and severe cardiac dysfunction (cardiac failure),&#xD;
      will be excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be randomized into two groups (rate of randomization 1/1). The first&#xD;
      group will be submitted to the standard surgical treatment that is currently used in Santa&#xD;
      Marcelina - Itaquera hospital. The second group will be submitted to treatment with the&#xD;
      adoption of the PROSM guidelines, which will be detailed later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will evaluate in the two groups: surgical time in minutes, intraoperative&#xD;
      complications: intraoperative bleeding in mililiters, need for transfusion of blood products,&#xD;
      intraoperative clinical complications. Investigators will also evaluate the need for&#xD;
      postoperative recovery in Intensive Care Unit (ICU), medications used to maintain the&#xD;
      anesthetic plane during the procedure (amount of drugs in milligrams), medications used for&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia, length of hospital stay in days, postoperative clinical&#xD;
      complications, need for surgical re-boarding, immediate postoperative pain (VAS),&#xD;
      postoperative pain at the time of discharge and the first outpatient return (VAS), the need&#xD;
      for opioid analgesics at home after discharge. The follow-up time of these patients for the&#xD;
      purpose of collecting data for this study will be started with their agreement to participate&#xD;
      in the project and with the signing of the free and informed consent term and will extend&#xD;
      until the third postoperative return. After this period, the participants will be followed&#xD;
      for assistance purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the data collection, this will be analyzed and a comparative study of the costs of&#xD;
      surgical treatment and hospitalization between the two groups will be made. This data will be&#xD;
      obtained from the billing department of the Santa Marcelina - Itaquera hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be expressed as medians with deviations. Categorical variables will&#xD;
      be represented by absolute numbers and percentages. The Gaussian distribution of the&#xD;
      variables will be tested using Kolmogorov - Smirnov test. The comparison between medians will&#xD;
      be evaluated through the use of Student's T test. The comparison between categorical&#xD;
      variables will be carried out using Chi-square test. Possible risk factors that contribute to&#xD;
      an increase in the length of hospital stay and an increase in postoperative pain will be&#xD;
      traced through the use of logistic regressions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of the data will be carried out using the software Statistical Package for the&#xD;
      Social Sciences (SPSS) 17.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROSM Guidelines Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selected patients who agree to participate in the present project and whose randomization&#xD;
      assign them to the intervention PROSM group will be submitted to the following guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative care: In addition to conventional preoperative care including cessation of&#xD;
      smoking and use of medications for comorbidities treatment, guidelines for preoperative&#xD;
      fasting, verification of preoperative exams and cardiovascular and pre-anesthetic&#xD;
      evaluations, the patient will receive guidelines for home exercises to perform daily walks&#xD;
      with thirty minutes duration until the day of surgery. This measure aims to create in the&#xD;
      patient the habit of moving daily. This will facilitate adherence to the proposed exercises&#xD;
      for postoperative recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of surgery, immediately before the patient is taken to the operating room, we will&#xD;
      administer 8 drops of chlorpromazine solution and 750 milligrams of paracetamol or 500&#xD;
      milligrams of dipyrone. The goal is to generate preemptive analgesia. Patients who admitted&#xD;
      to the surgical procedure exhibit evidence of abandonment of the preoperative guidelines will&#xD;
      be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia: The participant will be adequately monitored with pulse oximetry, cardioscopy,&#xD;
      capnography, noninvasive blood pressure, temperature monitoring, anesthetic depth monitoring&#xD;
      through the BIS method (bispectral index), delayed bladder catheter. The necessity or not of&#xD;
      central venous access and invasive blood pressure will be evaluated according to the&#xD;
      cardiovascular risks and the size of the surgery. For pulmonary resection operations we will&#xD;
      use selective orotracheal intubation as already agreed in the institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic induction will be performed using short duration opioid (remifentanil), hypnotic&#xD;
      (propofol) and neuromuscular blocker with dose adjusted according to the patient's body&#xD;
      mass.3 Intraoperative analgesia will be obtained through paravertebral and incisional&#xD;
      intercostal block through the infiltration of a drug solution containing 500mililiters of&#xD;
      saline, 1 vial of 5milligrams / 20milliliters bupivacaine, 20milliliters of lidocaine 2%&#xD;
      without vasoconstrictor, 10milligrams of dexamethasone , 500milligrams of hydrocortisone,&#xD;
      75milligrams of clonidine, 5milligrams of ketamine and 40milliliters of sodium bicarbonate&#xD;
      8.4% solution). Investigators will use only the volume of solution sufficient to generate the&#xD;
      intercostal blocks of the spaces pertaining to the incision and the orifice of the pleural&#xD;
      drain and completely infiltrate the surgical wound. The surplus drug solution will be&#xD;
      discarded.4 The participants will not be submitted to epidural anesthesia, only to the block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intercostal block and infiltration of the surgical wound will be performed by the surgical&#xD;
      team while the other anesthetic procedures will be performed and accompanied by the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist. At any time during the procedure, the anesthesiologist may administer&#xD;
      additional anesthetic drugs or any other type of drug deemed necessary to ensure adequate&#xD;
      pain control and hemodynamic stability of the patient. Throughout the procedure there should&#xD;
      be dialogue and exchange of information between the surgical and anesthetic teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic recovery: Post anesthetic recovery will commence immediately after the surgical&#xD;
      dressing. The participants will be placed in horizontal dorsal decubitus, the anesthetic&#xD;
      drugs will be switched off, the patient will receive intravenous antiemetic (ondansetron) and&#xD;
      intravenous non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (ketoprofen) before extubation to avoid&#xD;
      nausea and decrease postoperative pain. The patient will be extubated as soon as he is&#xD;
      recovering his consciousness and is able to maintain an effective spontaneous breath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after the extubation, the surgeon will elevate the decubitus of the surgical&#xD;
      table to 45 degrees maintaining the constant observation of the blood pressure, heart rate&#xD;
      and pulse oximetry. It will remain elevated until the patient is well awake. If the patient&#xD;
      is unable to maintain a sufficient level of consciousness to understand and respond to verbal&#xD;
      commands within 50 minutes of extubation or if during awakening the patient develops postural&#xD;
      hypotension surgical team will abort the protocol and resume recovery by conventional&#xD;
      measures.5 These cases will be counted as failure to execute the method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patient is conscious and able to understand sentences and respond to verbal&#xD;
      commands, investigators will begin the postoperative exercise program. Initially participant&#xD;
      will do breathing exercises with inspirations and forced exhalations followed by elevation&#xD;
      and lowering of the upper limbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the participant is in the operating room, sequences of 10 exercises with a 1-minute&#xD;
      interval between sequences will be performed.5 From the moment the anesthesiologist&#xD;
      authorizes, the patient will be referred for anesthetic recovery room Upon reaching&#xD;
      anesthetic recovery room, the patient will receive water and diet. After feeding, will be&#xD;
      placed in an armchair, maintaining monitoring where will continue to do breathing exercises,&#xD;
      lifting and lowering exercises of the upper limbs and extension and flexion of lower limbs.&#xD;
      At this moment the participant will be accompanied by a doctor of the surgical team and a&#xD;
      physiotherapist who will guide him in relation to the movements. A family escort will be&#xD;
      allowed to remain with the patient helping to do the exercises. This phase of recovery will&#xD;
      last 2 hours.5, 6 After this period of time, the physician representing the surgical team&#xD;
      will put the patient on stand and watch the patient for 4 minutes in order to evaluate&#xD;
      possible postural hypotension and assess the patient's ability to support his or her own&#xD;
      weight. If the patient does not tolerate standing, participant will be placed back in the&#xD;
      armchair and will continue with the exercises. Otherwise, the physician and physiotherapist&#xD;
      will walk with the patient into the anesthetic recovery room for a period of 30 minutes with&#xD;
      rest breaks as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Referral to the hospitalization unit: After anesthesia recovery, the participants will be&#xD;
      referred to the hospitalization units. In the hospitalization units the patient will do a 15&#xD;
      minute walk in the hallway every 60 minutes interval. During the intervals the patient will&#xD;
      be resting in an armchair doing the movements previously described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients at risk of postoperative cardiac arrhythmias who received intraoperative blood&#xD;
      products with a risk for hemorrhagic events using some type of vasoactive drug requiring&#xD;
      ventilatory support will be referred to the ICU where they will remain for at least 24 hours&#xD;
      , maintaining the same lines of proposed postoperative exercises. Indication or not of ICU&#xD;
      postoperatively should be a consensus between surgical team and anesthetic team.7&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative Prescription: The postoperative prescription should contain a general voluntary&#xD;
      diet, medications that the patient already use, prophylactic antibiotics in the first 24&#xD;
      hours of the postoperative period, dipyrone or paracetamol of schedule, ketoprofen of&#xD;
      schedule or toragesic, methadon 5milligrams per mouth if pain, antiemetics (ondansetron)&#xD;
      schedule, laxative once a day, chlorpromazine solution drops (from 8 to 10 drops) at nigth.&#xD;
      Investigators should not prescribe anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents until the patient&#xD;
      has 7 days postoperative. There is no need for prophylactic enoxaheparin because the patient&#xD;
      will be in continuous movement. Daily radiographs will be performed while the patient has a&#xD;
      thoracic drainage. Laboratory tests will be requested only if the patient shows some type of&#xD;
      abnormality on the physical examination that raises some suspicion of organic dysfunction or&#xD;
      if there is any indication for it based on the preoperative cardiovascular and anesthetic&#xD;
      evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discharge: When the patient is in conditions for hospital discharge, this will be done&#xD;
      through some guidelines:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Return to the outpatient thoracic surgery in 7 days to continue postoperative follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prescription of analgesics for home use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Guidance on possible postoperative complications, making it very clear in which&#xD;
           circumstances the patient should return to the emergency room (fever, dyspnea, bleeding&#xD;
           or chest pain refractory to the use of medication).&#xD;
