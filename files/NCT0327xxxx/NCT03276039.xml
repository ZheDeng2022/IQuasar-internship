  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study included 70 subjects divided into 3 groups. Group I included 25 patients with&#xD;
      NAFLD. Group II included 25 patients with NAFLD and chronic HCV. Group III: included 20&#xD;
      controls. Abdominal ultrasound was done to patients and controls. Plasma pentraxin-3 (PTX3)&#xD;
      was measured using ELISA. Comparison between three groups was done regarding plasma&#xD;
      pentraxin-3. Higher levels of plasma PTX3 were detected in NAFLD patients irrespective of&#xD;
      presence or absence of chronic HCV infection. Plasma PTX3 could be used as a non-invasive&#xD;
      test for prediction of metabolic syndrome in the high-risk population with high sensitivity&#xD;
      and moderate specificity.&#xD;

        50 adult Egyptian patients collected from Gastroenterology Unit, Internal Medicine, and&#xD;
        Tropical Medicine Departments, were included. Additionally, 20 apparently healthy subjects&#xD;
        were included as the control group. They were classified into three groups: Group I:&#xD;
        included 25 patients with NAFLD diagnosed by radiological features and by exclusion of&#xD;
        other causes of fatty liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group II: included 25 patients with radiological features of NAFLD and laboratory evidence&#xD;
        of chronic hepatitis C viral infection (positive PCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group III: included 20 apparently healthy control subjects with negative medical history,&#xD;
        normal physical examination, and normal laboratory and radiological examination.&#xD;
