      Three dimensional gait analysis is widely accepted as a general measure of functional ability&#xD;
      among individuals as it is related to health, well-being and quality of life. To diagnose&#xD;
      subtle changes/deviations in gait and to correctly interpret gait, a reference gait database&#xD;
      of healthy subjects is required. Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment (Caren) is a&#xD;
      new gait analysis system which combines the 3D motion captures system with a split belt force&#xD;
      plate instrumented treadmill and a virtual reality environment. This system enables to&#xD;
      analyses several successive steps, which is impossible in the standard overground&#xD;
      laboratories. Until now, no reference gait database has been created using the Caren system.&#xD;
      The aim of this descriptive study is to create a reference database of gait in healthy adults&#xD;
      with varying subject characteristics using Caren. This study is a single center descriptive&#xD;
      study to build a reference database on gait of healthy adults of different ages. Six age&#xD;
      groups are composed existing of 20 males and 20 females. Taken into account that 10% of the&#xD;
      volunteers (especially elderly) may drop out due to e.g. disability, a total of 264 subjects&#xD;
      will be recruited to ensure that database will include 240 subjects. Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
      ambulatory, ability to walk without aid for 30 minutes, age older than 18 years and willing&#xD;
      to participate. Exclusion criteria: muscular skeletal, cardiopulmonary disorders or other&#xD;
      diseases significantly influencing gait. Medical interventions, such as surgical treatment or&#xD;
      botulinium toxin 6 months, which significantly influence gait. Subjects will walk at&#xD;
      different walking speeds at Caren while gait is measured. Subjects always wear a safety&#xD;
      harness to avoid falling. In addition adults wear standard shoes (gymnastic booties) provided&#xD;
      by the lab to avoid shoes effects. All subjects undergo measurement of leg length, body&#xD;
      length and body weight in order to retrieve anthropometric parameters. In addition a standard&#xD;
      physical examination is performed to get information about a subjects' muscle strength,&#xD;
      balance and articular mobility of the hip, knee and ankle. Gait kinematic, kinetic,&#xD;
      spatio-temporal and balance parameters are measured.&#xD;

      Gait is one of the most important activity of daily life for humans. In clinical and research&#xD;
      settings, gait performance is widely accepted as a general measure of functional ability&#xD;
      among individuals. Computer Assisted Rehabilitation ENvironment (CAREN; Motek Medical,&#xD;
      Amsterdam, The Netherlands) is a relatively novel system to analyze gait in a safe and&#xD;
      accurate way. CAREN consists of an instrumented split-belt treadmill mounted onto a&#xD;
      6-degree-of-freedom motion platform in combination with a Virtual Environment projected on a&#xD;
      180Â° semi-cylindrical screen. Two force plates underneath each belt and 12 3D motion capture&#xD;
      cameras (VICON system) allow an accurate analysis of gait which is expressed by kinematic,&#xD;
      kinetic, spatiotemporal en dynamic balance parameters. Currently at the MUMC+, CAREN-based&#xD;
      gait analysis is used for clinical purposes and is increasingly more applied to contribute in&#xD;
      clinical diagnostics and decision-making and to evaluate interventions and rehabilitation&#xD;
      programs. Besides, the CAREN system is applied in gait analysis laboratory settings as an&#xD;
      alternative or an additive to over ground gait analysis. However, due to its novelty, size,&#xD;
      high costs, and complexity, the CAREN system is not a widely accessible technology.&#xD;
      Literature is limited and research is still in progress. From these experiences, it is known&#xD;
      that CAREN is safe in use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An individuals' walking pattern is variable and can change due to several factors such as&#xD;
      advancing age. Furthermore gait is influenced by body characteristics such sex, body height&#xD;
      and mass. Gait also changes as a result of health-related factors such as pain and diseases.&#xD;
      Moreover gait can change through rehabilitation and training. This all suggests that human&#xD;
      gait analysis is useful for clinical purposes, for example for diagnostics or to evaluate&#xD;
      rehabilitation programs. However to apply human gait analysis in clinical practice, it is&#xD;
      crucial to have insight into the normal walking pattern of individuals. A gait database of&#xD;
      healthy subjects with varying subject characteristics (e.g. age) is required to ensures that&#xD;
      gait is correctly interpreted. This database will give further insight in the dynamics of&#xD;
      walking, clarifying the level and proportion in which gait is affected by subject&#xD;
      characteristics and walking speed. This insight will improve the interpretation of gait, and&#xD;
      thus contribute to improved clinical diagnostics and follow up capabilities. In addition the&#xD;
      database will be relevant in clinical practice as it quickly puts into perspective gait of&#xD;
      patients. Moreover it enables the detection of subtle changes in gait (e.g. after&#xD;
      intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective and hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is a single center descriptive study to create a reference database of gait of&#xD;
      healthy adults of different ages. Six age groups are composed (18-29yrs, 30-39yrs, 40-49yrs,&#xD;
      50-59yrs, 60-69yrs, &gt;70yrs), existing of 20 males and 20 females.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This descriptive study aims to build a reference gait database for healthy subjects based on&#xD;
      CAREN including kinematic, kinetic, spatio-temporal and balance parameters. Values for gait&#xD;
      parameters of healthy adults will be created for varying age groups and sex. In addition,&#xD;
      knowing the impact of walking speed on various gait parameters, gait parameters of healthy&#xD;
      subjects will be clustered per walking speed, taking sex and age into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A descriptive study to collect a Caren-based reference database for healthy gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate effects of subject characteristics such as age, sex and leg length on&#xD;
           gait kinematic, kinetic, temporal-spatial and balance parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the relation between walking speed and gait kinematic, kinetic,&#xD;
           temporal-spatial and balance parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center descriptive study performed at the department Physiotherapy of the&#xD;
      Maastricht University Medical Center (MUMC+) in which gait of healthy adult volunteers of&#xD;
      varying ages is obtained by the new Computer Assisted Rehabilitation ENvironment (Caren)&#xD;
      system. The collected data will be used to create a database for gait parameters of healthy&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      120 healthy men and 120 healthy women, equally divided over the six age groups (18-29j,&#xD;
      30-39j, 40-49j, 50-59j, 60-69j, &gt;70j) are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The healthy adult volunteers will walk at different walking speeds at the Caren system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, the comfortable walking speed of the subject is determined using a ramp protocol. This&#xD;
      includes that subject starts walking at 0.5m/s and that the speed is increased every second&#xD;
      by 0.01m/s until the subject reached the comfortable walking speed. This is repeated 3 times.&#xD;
      The average of these 3 walking speeds is used as comfortable walking speed. Afterward, the&#xD;
      subject walks for 5 minutes at the fixed comfortable speed to get familiarized to the system.&#xD;
      After familiarization, the measurement starts. The volunteers will walk at comfortable speed,&#xD;
      at a slow speed (comfortable speed - 30%), a fast speed (comfortable speed + 30%) and at a&#xD;
      slower speed (fixed at 0.5km/h). These four conditions are randomly applied to eliminate a&#xD;
      possible effect of sequence of performed walking speed (and thus familiarization) on gait.&#xD;
      Every measurement is proceeded by a 2 minute habituation period at that specific walking&#xD;
      speed. Subjects will wear a safety harness to avoid falling. In addition adults wear standard&#xD;
      shoes (gymnastic booties) provided by the lab to avoid shoes effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait kinematics (joint angles), kinetics (joint moments and power), spatio-temporal&#xD;
      parameters (e.g. stride length) and dynamic balance parameters (e.g. margins of stability)&#xD;
      will be determined. Values for gait parameters of healthy adults will be created and&#xD;
      clustered for varying age groups, sex and walking speeds.&#xD;

        The aim of the study is to create a reference database consisting of 240 healthy (120 men,&#xD;
        120 women), ranging from 18 years to &gt; 70yrs. For each of the six age categories (18-29yrs,&#xD;
        30-39yrs, 40-49yrs, 50-59yrs, 60-69yrs, &gt;70yrs), 20 men and 20 women will be included.&#xD;
        Assuming that 10% of the volunteers (especially elderly) may drop out because subjects&#xD;
        cannot complete the protocol due to fatigue, impaired condition, fear etc., an additional&#xD;
        10% will be recruited to ensure that 240 subjects will be included at the end. This results&#xD;
        in a total of 264 subjects that will be recruited. When subjects do not want to continue&#xD;
        participating in the study and want to stop the procedure, the subjects can stop at any&#xD;
        time and withdraw without any reason.&#xD;
