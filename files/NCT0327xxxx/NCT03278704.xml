  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is recommended that individuals perform a combination of resistance exercise (RE) and&#xD;
      endurance exercise. Lack of time is often cited as a reason for being unable to meet current&#xD;
      exercise guidelines. Therefore, combining both forms in one session may be beneficial.&#xD;
      However, research continues to elucidate whether interference of adaptive outcomes occurs&#xD;
      when RE and endurance exercise are performed concurrently. A proposed interference effect&#xD;
      suggests that concurrent training may dampen RE-induced adaptations (e.g., muscle strength&#xD;
      and growth) compared to RE only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The propose of this investigation is to determine the effects of concurrent RE and&#xD;
      high-intensity interval training (HIIT), compared to RE only, on muscle health and&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk in sedentary, middle-aged (40-65 years) who are overweight/obese with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The investigators will measure the effects on muscle&#xD;
      strength, muscle growth, cardiovascular fitness, glycaemic control and markers of&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk before and after an 8-week training program. Data will be obtained&#xD;
      through the analysis of skeletal muscle samples, blood samples, magnetic resonance imaging,&#xD;
      questionnaires and exercise performance tests.It is hypothesized that concurrent RE + HIIT&#xD;
      will amplify the exercise-induced muscle growth response, which will result in greater&#xD;
      satellite cell content, compared to RE alone. As a result, this will lead to greater skeletal&#xD;
      muscle mass and strength after RE + HIIT compared to RE in isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A finding that concurrent resistance training and HIIT does not impede muscle adaptations&#xD;
      could offer future strategies to minimize exercise time commitment whilst still maximizing&#xD;
      the physiological benefits of both resistance and endurance exercise through a single&#xD;
      training session. This may therefore provide an effective exercise strategy in the prevention&#xD;
      and/or treatment of T2DM.&#xD;

      Data analysis will be performed using IBM SPSS statistical software (IBM Corp., Armonk, New&#xD;
      York, USA). All data will be checked for normality and appropriate log transformations&#xD;
      applied prior to analysis of variance (ANOVA) for primary and secondary outcomes. Satellite&#xD;
      cell content will be compared using a two-way, mixed-model ANOVA with one within (2 levels;&#xD;
      pre- and post-training) and one between factor (2 level; exercise group) with significance&#xD;
      set at P &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on a mixed ANOVA with between- and within-participant factors, and previously published&#xD;
      data (Babcock et al. 2012), a sample size of 24 participants (12 per group) will provide a&#xD;
      power of 84%. This sample size will allow detection of a mean change in satellite cell&#xD;
      content of 2.35, assuming standard deviations of the change from pre- to post-training as&#xD;
      2.266 and 1.331 in the two exercise groups. Sample size calculation was performed with an&#xD;
      alpha error of 0.05. SamplePower 2.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA) software was used to&#xD;
      determine sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will combine data collected at the University of Birmingham with previously&#xD;
      collected data from an identical study design performed by a co-investigator (Dr Pugh) in&#xD;
      Rome, Italy. The previous study has collected data from 10 participants across both exercise&#xD;
      groups (RE, N = 7; RE + HIIT, N = 3). Therefore, it is necessary for the present study to&#xD;
      recruit a further 14 participants (RE, N = 5, RE + HIIT, N = 9) in order to achieve a sample&#xD;
      size of 24 participants (12 per group). However, based on an assumption of a 25% drop-out&#xD;
      rate, the total minimal sample necessary will be 19 participants (RE, N = 7; RE + HIIT, N =&#xD;
      12).&#xD;
