      Objective: To determine the extent to which high-dose (30mg) oral montelukast, added to&#xD;
      standard treatment in children with moderate and severe acute exacerbations improves&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central Hypothesis: High-dose oral montelukast, added to standard treatment in children aged&#xD;
      5 to 17 years with moderate and severe acute asthma exacerbations, rapidly improves lung&#xD;
      function, clinical severity, hospitalization rate and 72-hour symptom burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There are greater effects of high-dose oral montelukast on lung function and on the&#xD;
           secondary outcomes in the presence of respiratory viral detection or&#xD;
           leukotriene-mediated inflammation; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There is an interaction between viral detection and urinary leukotriene 4 level with&#xD;
           treatment-response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A two-arm, parallel randomized controlled trial of high-dose oral montelukast versus&#xD;
      identical placebo, as add-on to standard treatment of systemic corticosteroid (SCS) and&#xD;
      inhaled short-acting Beta-2-agonist (SABA), in children aged 5 to 17 years with moderate and&#xD;
      severe acute asthma exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: High-dose oral montelukast added to standard treatment as one&#xD;
      treatment-allocation arm, in comparison with standard treatment as the 2nd&#xD;
      treatment-allocation arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and Important Secondary Endpoints: For the Primary Aim, the primary outcome measure&#xD;
      to be compared between arms will be change of %-predicted airway resistance by impulse&#xD;
      oscillometry (IOS) at 5Hz (%R5) at 2 hours after treatment initiation. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will include improvement of %-predicted FEV1 (%FEV1), clinical severity measured using the&#xD;
      validated Acute Asthma Intensity Research Score (AAIRS), hospitalization rate, and 72 hour&#xD;
      symptom burden using the Pediatric Asthma Caregiver Diary (PACD). For the Secondary Aim, the&#xD;
      investigators will determine (1) The effects of high-dose oral montelukast on lung function&#xD;
      and on our secondary outcomes in the presence of nasal viruses and of greater&#xD;
      leukotriene-mediated inflammation; and (2) The degree of interaction between viral detection&#xD;
      and urinary leukotriene E4 (LTE4) level with treatment-response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory evaluations: The primary outcome (change of %R5) and select secondary outcomes&#xD;
      (%FEV1, AAIRS, LTE4) will be measured before and again at 2 hours after treatment initiation.&#xD;
      The other secondary outcomes will be measured at the time of hospitalization decision-making&#xD;
      by the clinical team (hospitalization rate) or at 72-hours after treatment initiation (PACD).&#xD;

      Study overview: The approach to testing the central hypothesis will be to conduct a two-arm,&#xD;
      parallel randomized controlled trial of high-dose (30mg) montelukast versus identical&#xD;
      placebo, as add-on to standard treatment of SCS and inhaled SABA, in children aged 5 to 17&#xD;
      years with moderate and severe acute asthma exacerbations. Although this aim will enable us&#xD;
      to test each hypothesis, the ability to test each hypothesis is independent of the others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: The investigators will use randomly-permuted blocks of 4 to 8 to minimize&#xD;
      seasonal bias of exacerbation precipitants that may have independent associations with&#xD;
      treatment-response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Masking of treatment-allocation and outcome-ascertainment: Investigator or clinical team&#xD;
      knowledge of treatment allocation may influence assessment of outcomes. Allocation&#xD;
      concealment will minimize this bias. The investigators will adhere to established procedures&#xD;
      to maintain masking of participants, CTAs, and data analysts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Testing the primary hypothesis The investigators will measure lung function before and&#xD;
      after 2-hours of treatment using airway resistance by impulse oscillometry at 5Hz (%R5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes of the primary aim: The investigators expect that high-dose montelukast&#xD;
      will result in a minimum 15% greater improvement in %R5 and a 10% improvement of %FEV1&#xD;
      between pre-treatment and 2-hours after dosing in comparison with standard treatment. The&#xD;
      investigators base this expectation on (1) The known contribution of leukotrienes to airway&#xD;
      inflammation during acute asthma exacerbations;8-11 (2) Knowledge that corticosteroids do not&#xD;
      inhibit leukotriene synthesis in vivo;7 (3) High-quality trials of IV montelukast in patients&#xD;
      with moderate and severe acute asthma exacerbations by Camargo and colleagues that&#xD;
      demonstrated rapid and sustained improvement of lung function and decreased need for&#xD;
      SCS;25,26 and (4) The pharmacokinetics of IV and oral montelukast indicating that serum&#xD;
      levels after high-dose oral montelukast are comparable to the IV doses used in the Camargo&#xD;
      trials.29,69-72 The investigators expect that high-dose montelukast will result in meaningful&#xD;
      improvement of clinical severity, hospitalization rate, and 72-hour symptom burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim and testing the secondary hypothesis: Respiratory viral detection Specimen&#xD;
      processing. The investigators will obtain a nasal swab from each participant before&#xD;
      treatment. PCR testing for respiratory viruses will be conducted in the laboratory of Dr.&#xD;
      Natasha Halasa (Co-I). Nasal and throat swabs combined in 3 ml sterile M4RT transport medium&#xD;
      (Remel) will undergo immediate refrigeration at 2-8oC, followed by transportation within 24&#xD;
      hours on ice to the Halasa Lab for processing. Five aliquots in 2-ml screw-cap cyrovials will&#xD;
      be prepared three ~0.85-ml volumes in original transport medium and two ~0.2-ml volumes in&#xD;
      commercial lysis buffer compatible with extraction methods employed in the Halasa Lab.&#xD;
      Aliquots will be flash-frozen prior to storage at -80oC to maximize viral stability and&#xD;
      specimen quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCR detection of respiratory viruses: Testing for influenza A, B, and C; RSV; adenovirus;&#xD;
      enterovirus; human metapneumovirus; human rhinovirus; parainfluenza 1-4; coronavirus 229E,&#xD;
      NL63, OC43, and HKU1; and human bocavirus can be performed according to established protocols&#xD;
      using optimized target-specific primers and FAM/BHQ1-congugated hydrolysis probes, AgPath-ID&#xD;
      One Step RT-PCR chemistry (Applied Biosystems), and StepOnePlus Real Time PCR System. Total&#xD;
      nucleic acid extraction will be performed using the Roche MagNA Pure LC automated extraction&#xD;
      system capable of high-throughput specimen processing to yield exceedingly pure RNA. Based on&#xD;
      an assay cutoff of Ct equal to 40, specimens demonstrating Ct values less than or equal to 40&#xD;
      for viral sequence signatures will be considered positive for the targets in question.&#xD;
      Specimens negative (Ct greater than 40) for RNAseP will be retested using the same&#xD;
      preparation of nucleic acid and further tested using a fresh extract if the original extract&#xD;
      repeatedly produces a negative result. Specimens persistently demonstrating RNAseP Ct values&#xD;
      greater than 40 will be deemed indeterminate for negative viral targets. Viral target&#xD;
      detection in RNAseP-negative specimens will be considered true-positive assuming processing&#xD;
      and plate controls produce expected patterns of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinary LTE4 measurement will be by the Vanderbilt Eicosanoid Core Laboratory. Expected&#xD;
      outcomes of the secondary aim: First, the investigators expect that there will be a high&#xD;
      incidence of viral respiratory detection in the cohort, based on reports from Johnston,&#xD;
      Khetsuriani and others. Respiratory viral detection does not imply viral respiratory&#xD;
      infection (VRI). Nonetheless, the investigators anticipate that there will be (1) Greater&#xD;
      effects of montelukast on lung function in participants with respiratory virus detected in&#xD;
      comparison with those who do not have virus detected; (2) Greater effects of montelukast on&#xD;
      lung function in proportion to urinary LTE4 levels; and (3) An interaction between viral&#xD;
      detection and urinary LTE4 level on treatment-response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Calculation and Statistical Approach: Power calculation for this research is based on&#xD;
      the primary outcome measure, %R5 by IOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be %R5 because this IOS parameter measures total airway&#xD;
      resistance. The data from 192 children aged 5 to 17 years with acute asthma exacerbations&#xD;
      include an SD for pre-treatment %R5 of 71.7% and a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.52&#xD;
      between pre-treatment and 2-hour %R5. For residual variance the investigators considered a&#xD;
      linear regression model with the 2-hour value as the outcome and the pre-treatment value as&#xD;
      an adjustment variable. With 125 participants having complete IOS data in each of the two&#xD;
      treatment-allocations arms, the investigators will have 90% power to detect a minimal&#xD;
      difference of %R5 of 14% between montelukast and placebo with one interim data analysis&#xD;
      conducted when 50% of the subjects have accrued. In order to account for missing IOS data in&#xD;
      up to 15% of participants, dropouts and missing data the investigators propose to enroll 330&#xD;
      participants with 165 randomized to each RCT arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also examine additional IOS parameters as outcomes, including those&#xD;
      representing large (R20) and small airway function (R5 to R20, X5 and XA), as well as change&#xD;
      of %-predicted FEV1 (%FEV1) and of the AAIRS bedside severity score between pre-treatment and&#xD;
      2-hours. Because the investigators anticipate that approximately 50% of the cohort with&#xD;
      moderate and severe exacerbations will be able to provide spirometry meeting ATS quality and&#xD;
      reproducibility criteria, there may be insufficient power to detect meaningful differences&#xD;
      for this outcome. However, the investigators will be able to score the AAIRS in all&#xD;
      participants and thus anticipate sufficient power to detect a minimum 2 point difference of&#xD;
      this 17 point severity score between montelukast and placebo arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical approach Primary statistical inferential test: Outcomes are measured on a&#xD;
      continuous scale and will be analyzed using linear regression and include treatment indicator&#xD;
      and baseline value as covariates. The investigators will estimate the bias corrected mean&#xD;
      effect of treatment with corresponding 95% confidence intervals that taken into account one&#xD;
      planned interim analyses. The investigators will ascertain that the assumptions of&#xD;
      inferential tests are satisfied for all analyses. If assumptions are violated, alternatively&#xD;
      the investigators will use the proportional odds ordinal logistic regression model which&#xD;
      generalizes the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test to a regression setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary tests for effect modification by viral detection and urinary LTE4 level: As noted&#xD;
      above, the investigators anticipate an interaction of viral detection and urinary LTE4 level&#xD;
      on montelukast treatment-response. Additional subgroup analyses by age groups, pretreatment&#xD;
      severity (moderate versus severe) and exclusion of participants with rapid response (10&#xD;
      minute) to albuterol are also of interest. To test secondary hypotheses that the treatment&#xD;
      effect is modified by covariates, the investigators will fit separate models that also&#xD;
      include the interaction of the covariate with the treatment effect. Using the sample size&#xD;
      assumptions above and additionally anticipating that 60% to 80% of subjects will have viral&#xD;
      detection at baseline, the investigators will have 80% power to detect a 25% to 31%&#xD;
      modification of the treatment effect. The investigators will report the results of all&#xD;
      subgroup analyses conducted regardless of statistical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intention-to-treat-analysis and inferential test assumptions. Analyses will conform to the&#xD;
      principle of intention-to-treat. All randomized participants will be included in the primary&#xD;
      and secondary analyses in their assigned treatment allocation groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping rules for use by the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee Stopping boundaries and&#xD;
      design operating characteristics were investigated using the RCT-design R package. This&#xD;
      package provides a comprehensive suite of functions for evaluating, monitoring, analyzing,&#xD;
      and reporting clinical trial designs. While finalized stopping rules will be developed and&#xD;
      agreed on by investigators during the R61 startup phase, the investigators summarize some&#xD;
      current results. Using the Emerson and Flemming (1989) symmetric test125 with an assumed&#xD;
      treatment effect of 14% and standard deviation of 34%, the investigators would stop the trial&#xD;
      early at the interim analysis for futility if estimated treatment effect is 0.0% or lower and&#xD;
      stop early for efficacy if the treatment effect is 17.0% or greater. If the true treatment&#xD;
      effect is 14%, there is an estimated 32% chance of stopping early. Should the trial continue&#xD;
      to full enrollment, the bias adjusted treatment effect will be significant for efficacy if it&#xD;
      is estimated to be 8.5% or larger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data will be handled by joint modeling of the treatment effect and informative&#xD;
      missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that outcome data on some subjects will be missing, and this data&#xD;
      will not be missing (completely) at random. In particular, FEV1 measurements will be more&#xD;
      difficult to obtain on subjects with more severe exacerbations. Failing to account for the&#xD;
      informative missingness could bias the estimate of the treatment effect, so the investigators&#xD;
      will consider joint models for the missing data and estimated treatment effect.126,127&#xD;
      Sensitivity analyses in which the treatment is estimated using different models for the&#xD;
      missing data will be conducted to determine the robustness of the treatment effect estimate.&#xD;
      Detailed analyses will specify that the missing data models will be created before data&#xD;
      collection, during the R61 startup phase.&#xD;
