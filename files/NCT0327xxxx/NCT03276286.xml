      This feasibility study will assess the effects of the Nativis Voyager therapy in patients&#xD;
      newly diagnosed with GBM. The study will enroll and treat up to 32 subjects and will be&#xD;
      combined with standard of care radiotherapy and temozolomide.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There is pathological evidence of GBM using World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
             classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject received maximal debulking surgery. Patients may enroll in the study if&#xD;
             received Gliadel wafers before entering the trial. Any additional treatments received&#xD;
             prior to enrollment will be considered an exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must have at least one measurable lesion per RANO.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) ≥ 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has life expectancy &gt; 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has adequate organ and marrow function; see note 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject able to start treatment at least 28 days from tumor resection surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has provided signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has progressive disease per RANO. If pseudoprogression is suspected,&#xD;
             additional imaging studies must be performed to rule out true progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of increased intracranial pressure (midline shift &gt; 5mm, clinically&#xD;
             significant papilledema, vomiting and nausea or reduced level of consciousness)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is currently being treated with Optune.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is currently being treated with other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has not sufficiently recovered from prior surgery in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has significant co-morbidities at baseline which would prevent radiotherapy&#xD;
             and/or temozolomide treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has history of hypersensitivity reaction to temozolomide or a history of&#xD;
             hypersensitivity to dacarbazine (DTIC).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a clinically significant electrolyte abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has an active implantable (e.g., neurostimulator, pacemaker) or other&#xD;
             electromagnetic device that is incompatible with MRI. Subjects with programmable shunt&#xD;
             are excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a metal implant, including a stent, in the head or neck that is&#xD;
             incompatible with MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is known to be HIV positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is pregnant, nursing or intends to become pregnant during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is participating in other potentially confounding investigational research.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has any condition that at the discretion of the investigator would preclude&#xD;
             participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is unable or unwilling to comply with the protocol-required follow-up&#xD;
             schedule.&#xD;
