  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to contrast the degree to which increased consumption of dietary&#xD;
      fiber vs. fermented food can decrease inflammation, increase microbiota diversity and can&#xD;
      impact microbiota production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), potential normalizers of&#xD;
      metabolic and immune dysfunction, in obese and non-obese adults.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The gut microbiota is central to human health, and the modern, industrialized gut microbiota&#xD;
      has been linked to numerous chronic diseases that are driven by inflammation. It is likely&#xD;
      dietary changes in the last half-century consistent with adoption of the Western diet have&#xD;
      had an adverse impact on the gut microbiota. A critically important next step in this field&#xD;
      of research is to identify how different dietary interventions can potentially restore&#xD;
      healthy features of the gut microbiota in alignment with the optimization of human health.&#xD;
      Dietary interventions that target the microbiota and reduce inflammation may reverse or&#xD;
      prevent chronic diseases including obesity, metabolic syndrome, and inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      disease. This study is designed to elicit and contrast inflammatory markers in blood with the&#xD;
      amount of increase in microbiota diversity and related metabolic output achievable by two&#xD;
      dietary approaches commonly available to the general population. The results could contribute&#xD;
      to dietary recommendations for reversing the chronic disease epidemics of Westernization.&#xD;
