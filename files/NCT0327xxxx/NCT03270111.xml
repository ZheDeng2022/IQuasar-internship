      The purpose of this second pilot study is to extend the feasibility demonstrated in&#xD;
      NCT02963740 that the intervention achieves high levels of moderate to vigorous physical&#xD;
      activity (MVI PA) and modulates risk biomarkers for breast cancer and cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      in older, obese sedentary breast cancer survivors who are undergoing moderate calorie&#xD;
      restriction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      All subjects participate in same intervention. Intervention consists of a 6-month structured&#xD;
      weight loss program utilizing portion controlled meals and a prescribed level of graduated&#xD;
      physical activity with an eventual goal of 200 minutes or more per week. The program will&#xD;
      include twice weekly sessions with a trainer at a local YMCA, and weekly phone group sessions&#xD;
      the first 3 months with transition to unsupervised exercise and less frequent group phone&#xD;
      sessions the second 3 months.&#xD;
