  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Raised blood cholesterol (also referred to as blood LDL-cholesterol) is a major risk factor&#xD;
      for developing heart disease. Dietary saturated fat is recognised as the main dietary&#xD;
      component responsible for raising blood LDL-cholesterol, and reducing its intake has been the&#xD;
      mainstay of dietary guidelines for the prevention of heart disease for over 30 years.&#xD;
      However, there is very little evidence for a direct link between the intake of saturated fat&#xD;
      and risk of dying from heart disease. One explanation for this, is that the link between&#xD;
      saturated fat intake and heart disease is not a direct one, but relies heavily on the ability&#xD;
      of saturated fat to raise blood LDL-cholesterol levels. This LDL cholesterol-raising effect&#xD;
      of saturated fat is complex, and highly variable between individuals because of differences&#xD;
      in the metabolism of dietary fat and cholesterol between people. The main aim of this study&#xD;
      is to measure the amount of variation in blood LDL-cholesterol in healthy volunteers at the&#xD;
      Universities of Surrey and Reading in response to lowering the amount of saturated fat in the&#xD;
      diet to the level recommended by the government for the prevention of heart disease. This&#xD;
      collaborative project between the Universities of Reading, Surrey and Imperial ('RISSCI-1'&#xD;
      Blood Cholesterol Response Study') will permit identification of two subgroups of men who&#xD;
      show either a high or low LDL-cholesterol response to a reduction in dietary saturated&#xD;
      intake. These two groups of participants will be provided with an opportunity to participate&#xD;
      in a similar follow-up study ('RISSCI-2') that will also take place at the University of&#xD;
      Surrey and Reading. In this follow-up study, the participants will be asked to repeat a&#xD;
      similar study protocol as for RISSCI-1, but undergo more detailed measurements to investigate&#xD;
      the metabolic and genetic origins of how saturated fat is metabolised in the body and&#xD;
      influences blood LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The LDL cholesterol-raising effect of saturated fatty acids (SFA) is complex, and highly&#xD;
      variable between individuals because of differences in the metabolism of dietary fat and&#xD;
      blood cholesterol between people. While these differences in metabolism make it difficult to&#xD;
      study how dietary SFA influences LDL-cholesterol in large numbers of people, they can be&#xD;
      measured in the laboratory and used as biological markers to distinguish between people who&#xD;
      respond well from those who will respond less well to moderate-fat diets, which are lower in&#xD;
      SFA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study is to measure the amount of variation in blood LDL-cholesterol in&#xD;
      healthy male volunteers in response to the replacement of SFA with unsaturated fats, and to&#xD;
      select LDL-C responders from non-responders for a subsequent metabolic study ('RISSC-2').&#xD;
      Estimate of statistical power and sample size for 'RISSCI-1': A decrease of 0.16 mmol/L (SD&#xD;
      0.54) in our primary outcome of fasting plasma LDL-C between the high- and low-SFA diets, as&#xD;
      observed in a previous randomly controlled trial, will require a sample size of 92&#xD;
      participants, at 80% power and 5% significance level. An estimated attrition rate of 15% will&#xD;
      increase this sample size to 106 participants. To recruit this sample of participants, we&#xD;
      anticipate having to screen 150 volunteers (75 at each site).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Undertake a dietary intervention study to examine the effects of two, 4 week diets that&#xD;
           differ in their composition of fatty acids. The first diet ('Diet 1') will contain ~18%&#xD;
           of its total energy as saturated fatty acids (SFA), while the second diet ('Diet 2')&#xD;
           will contain ~10% of its total energy as SFA. Blood, urine and stool samples taken at&#xD;
           the beginning (week 0) and end of Diet 1 (week 4), and end of Diet 2 (week 8), will be&#xD;
           analysed to measure blood LDL-cholesterol and other relevant blood, urine and faecal&#xD;
           metabolites. The white blood cell buffy coat will also be isolated from the blood&#xD;
           samples collected at the baseline visit to enable genotyping of relevant genes involved&#xD;
           in the absorption and metabolism of dietary fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the data for evidence of associations between the changes in blood LDL-&#xD;
           cholesterol, and the physical and biochemical characteristics of the participants as&#xD;
           possible determinants of the variation in serum cholesterol response. This will include&#xD;
           measurement of a common genetic polymorphism in APOLIPOPROTEIN E, as an established&#xD;
           determinant of variation in blood cholesterol in response to dietary SFA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To identify two subgroups of individuals whose blood LDL-cholesterol either responds&#xD;
           ('Responders') or show little or no response ('Non-responders') on changing from Diet 1&#xD;
           to Diet 2, for participation in the follow-up study ('RISSCI-2'), which will be&#xD;
           conducted at the Universities of Surrey, Reading and Imperial College London. In this&#xD;
           follow-up study, the participants will be asked to repeat a similar study protocol as&#xD;
           for RISSCI-1, and undergo more detailed measurements to determine how saturated fat is&#xD;
           metabolised in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance with the variation in blood LDL-cholesterol response, that many studies have&#xD;
      reported previously following substitution of dietary saturated with unsaturated fats, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesise that consuming Diet 1 (a high saturated fat diet) for 4 weeks&#xD;
      followed by diet 2 (a low saturated fat/high unsaturated fat diet) for a further 4 weeks,&#xD;
      will: 1) produce a variable distribution of responses in LDL-cholesterol that will enable the&#xD;
      study of associations between the participants' baseline characteristics as possible&#xD;
      determinants of the observed variation in blood LDL-cholesterol response, and 2) identify two&#xD;
      distinct subgroups of individuals who either respond or show little or no response in their&#xD;
      blood LDL- cholesterol. These distinct groups will be defined by the top and bottom ~10% of&#xD;
      change in the concentration of blood LDL-cholesterol.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will undergo, sequentially, a high SFA diet (Diet 1) followed by a low SFA diet (Diet 2) for 4 weeks each. Study visits will occur before and after each dietary intervention period. To comply with current UK dietary recommendations, Diets 1 and 2 will both contain ~35% energy from total fat. These diets will be consumed within the homes of free-living participants, by the substitution of ~40g of habitual fat, with either SFA-rich or mono/poly-unsaturated fatty acid-rich (MUFA/PUFA) cooking oils, spreads and snack foods, while maintaining their habitual diet (consistent intake of protein and carbohydrates, including dietary fibre). This will be achieved using a dietary exchange model developed and peer-reviewed for a previous dietary intervention study ('DIVAS') at the University of Reading, U.K.</description>
