      Controlled, randomized, double blind study, for the evaluation of tolerance and trichological&#xD;
      efficacy of a food supplement: Bioscalin® new formulation versus reference formulation&#xD;
      currently on the market and placebo&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the study was to evaluate clinically and by non-invasive instrumental measurements the&#xD;
      trichological activity of a food supplement taken for 3 months by subjects of both sexes,&#xD;
      aged between 18-60 years, affected by telogen effluvium, with a percentage of hair in anagen&#xD;
      phase &lt; 75%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular the study foresaw the evaluation of the trichological activity of the&#xD;
      Bioscalin® new formulation with Galeopsis Segetum in comparison to a reference product&#xD;
      currently on the market and to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was also aim of this study to evaluate treatment tolerance.&#xD;
