  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design trial tested the&#xD;
      effect of lacosamide on alcohol self-administration and craving following a priming dose of&#xD;
      alcohol. The specific objective of this study was to determine whether lacosamide, a novel&#xD;
      anticonvulsant that is FDA-approved for treating partial seizures, has effects on alcohol&#xD;
      craving and consumption.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present proposal was intended to answer the call for accelerating drug development by&#xD;
      exploring the potential of a novel anticonvulsant, lacosamide, as a candidate medication for&#xD;
      the treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD). This drug, which is approved for the treatment&#xD;
      of seizure disorders, has unique pharmacological actions that include enhancement of slow&#xD;
      sodium channel inactivation and inhibition of collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2).&#xD;
      Alcohol consumption in mice that had knockdown of CRMP-2 within the nucleus accumbens was&#xD;
      decreased from levels seen in control animals. In rodent studies, lacosamide administration&#xD;
      has produced reductions in 'excessive' drinking and has experimentally-induced decreased&#xD;
      expression of the CRMP-2 protein. These findings implicate CRMP-2 as playing a role in the&#xD;
      regulation of alcohol consumption. None of the FDA-approved AUD medications or medications&#xD;
      commonly used off-label to treat AUD target this CRMP-2 pathway, making lacosamide a&#xD;
      promising compound for AUD drug development. The aims of this study were to: 1) test the&#xD;
      effects of lacosamide on alcohol self-administration and craving, 2) test the effects of 7&#xD;
      days of lacosamide administration on cognitive function, and 3) test the effects of&#xD;
      lacosamide on alcohol consumption and craving during a 7-day period of exposure. The effects&#xD;
      of 7 days of lacosamide (300mg) or placebo were evaluated in a human laboratory using an&#xD;
      alcohol self-administration methodology. In this within-subjects crossover design, heavy&#xD;
      drinkers (N=27) were randomized to the order of exposure (lacosamide or placebo) prior to&#xD;
      completing two alcohol self-administration trials. Subjects received a priming drink of&#xD;
      alcohol and had access to 8 alcoholic drinks over a 2-hour period. The investigators&#xD;
      anticipated that subjects would consume less alcohol during an alcohol self-administration&#xD;
      trial when receiving lacosamide compared to when they are receiving placebo. Significant&#xD;
      lacosamide-induced reductions in the quantity of alcohol self-administered are considered to&#xD;
      be an indication that this drug may have value as an AUD medication. This study may provide a&#xD;
      rationale for phase II clinical studies testing lacosamide with a treatment-seeking AUD&#xD;
      population. These results should also help to spur further pre-clinical investigation into&#xD;
      the role play by CRMP-2 in regulating both alcohol consumption and alcohol seeking behaviors.&#xD;

    <measure>Verbal Fluency: Controlled Word Association (COWAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Controlled Word Association (COWAT) is a verbal fluency test that measures the spontaneous production of words beginning with some designated letter. The participant is asked to name words beginning with a given letter, excluding proper nouns, for one minute and this procedure is repeated three times with a different letter each time. A different set of letters was used in each of the two alcohol self-administration trials: C-F-L and P-R-W. The examiner writes down the words provided by the participant on a piece of paper. This test is scored by counting the number of words generated by the subject for each letter, then adding the scores for each of the three letters to calculate a total test score. The lowest possible score is 0 and there is no upper limit to the score range. A higher score is indicative of better outcomes (I.e. better verbal fluency).</description>

        <title>Verbal Fluency: Controlled Word Association (COWAT)</title>
        <description>The Controlled Word Association (COWAT) is a verbal fluency test that measures the spontaneous production of words beginning with some designated letter. The participant is asked to name words beginning with a given letter, excluding proper nouns, for one minute and this procedure is repeated three times with a different letter each time. A different set of letters was used in each of the two alcohol self-administration trials: C-F-L and P-R-W. The examiner writes down the words provided by the participant on a piece of paper. This test is scored by counting the number of words generated by the subject for each letter, then adding the scores for each of the three letters to calculate a total test score. The lowest possible score is 0 and there is no upper limit to the score range. A higher score is indicative of better outcomes (I.e. better verbal fluency).</description>

          <title>Cognitive Function: Digit Span Forward</title>
          <description>The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV) Digit Span test will be used to assess subjects' working memory. Subjects will be read and asked to repeat back an increasing number of digits in the same order. Each of the 16 items on this test is scored 0 (incorrect answer) or 1 (correct answer). The total score is calculated by adding the scores for each of the 16 items. The total score range is 0-16. Higher scores are indicative of higher levels of working memory (better outcome) and lower scores are indicative of lesser working memory function (worse outcome).</description>

        <description>The Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUQ) is an 8-item self report that measures the participant's urge for an alcoholic drink at the time the questionnaire is completed. Questions are in the form of a 7-point Likert scale (from strongly disagree to strongly agree) and the participant selects the extent to which they disagree or agree with the 8 statements relating to desire to drink, expectation of a desired outcome from drinking, and inability to avoid drinking if alcohol was available. Each of the 8 items is scored 1-7. The total score is calculated by adding the scores for each of the items. The total score range is 8-56. Lower scores indicate less urge for alcohol and higher scores indicate more urge for alcohol.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>This study was terminated early at the discretion of the Principal Investigator due to COVID-19 restrictions on human subject research recruitment, leading to a smaller number of subjects analyzed than planned. At the time of termination, 19 subjects had completed the study compared to the target sample size of 28. Three subjects that completed the study were omitted from statistical analysis due to not consuming any alcohol during either alcohol self-administration session.</limitations_and_caveats>
