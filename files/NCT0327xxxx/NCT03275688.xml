      This study will evaluate exhaled volatile organic compounds (VOC's) in the breath of&#xD;
      participants with stage 1 lung cancer, their house-mates, and matched controls. The goal of&#xD;
      the study is to identify VOC fingerprints that are only detectable in those with stage 1 lung&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is by far the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. More people die&#xD;
      annually of lung cancer than of colon, breast, and prostate cancers combined. Worldwide it is&#xD;
      already the leading cause of cancer death among males, and with smoking rates substantially&#xD;
      higher in developing countries relative to the United States the worldwide burden of lung&#xD;
      cancer is projected to increase considerably in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For lung cancer, as for many cancers, early diagnosis allowing for full resection offers the&#xD;
      greatest chance for long-term survival, but unfortunately these individuals currently&#xD;
      constitute only a minority of the lung-cancer population. Screening technologies that allow&#xD;
      for the earliest detection of lung cancer would therefore have tremendous potential to&#xD;
      substantially improve outcomes. Recently, and for the first time, a screening test for lung&#xD;
      cancer of high risk individuals has been recommended by the US Preventive Services Task&#xD;
      Force, as well as others, for the reduction of lung cancer mortality. This recommendation was&#xD;
      based primarily on the results of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) that randomized&#xD;
      over 53,000 individuals considered at high risk for lung cancer to 3 annual screenings with&#xD;
      either low-dose CT (LDCT) or a chest x-ray and then followed for a median of 6.5 years. In&#xD;
      this study LDCT scanning was associated with a statistically significant 20% relative&#xD;
      decrease in lung cancer mortality, and a smaller, but still significant 6.7% decrease in&#xD;
      overall mortality. Despite these encouraging results of LDCT, as a screening tool it has&#xD;
      substantial limitations. Beyond the costs, inconvenience and radiation exposure associated&#xD;
      with LDCT, its performance characteristics are far from optimal. For example, nearly a&#xD;
      quarter of the LDCT population had a positive screening test, with the vast majority - 96.4%&#xD;
      - proving to be false-positive. With a positive predictive value of &lt;4% LDCT screening will&#xD;
      lead to a great number of unnecessary diagnostic procedures as well as substantial anxiety in&#xD;
      the screened population and their family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breath analytics is a new and very promising tool for diagnosing lung cancer, as well as&#xD;
      multiple other conditions. Previous studies identified that dog's heightened olfactory senses&#xD;
      were able to detect cancer in an individual's breath with an accuracy of nearly 100%. Since&#xD;
      then attempts have been made to mimic canine capabilities with &quot;electronic noses&quot; to detect&#xD;
      and quantitate the nearly 3000 compounds, many in the parts per billion or even parts per&#xD;
      trillion ranges, in exhaled breath. Early studies of these technologies support great&#xD;
      potential as a diagnostic and screening tool. As a screening tool it could be ideal as it is&#xD;
      noninvasive, painless and free of any undesirable side effects. In addition, new advances in&#xD;
      nanotechnology have allowed these extremely sensitive detection technologies to be&#xD;
      miniaturized to the point that they can be linked to a smartphone, providing future&#xD;
      possibilities to almost continuously surveil individuals for the development of lung cancer&#xD;
      and other life-threatening conditions. This study is concerned with comparing the&#xD;
      concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the breath of lung cancer patients&#xD;
      (cases) and lung-cancer-free individuals (controls).&#xD;

        The study population will consist of three groups. Our cases will be those who have been&#xD;
        diagnosed with stage 1 lung cancer. Our type 1 controls will consist of participants who do&#xD;
        not have lung cancer, but otherwise have similar clinical characteristics of our cases. the&#xD;
        type 2 controls will be people who live in the same house as our stage 1 lung cancer&#xD;
        patients (cases).&#xD;
