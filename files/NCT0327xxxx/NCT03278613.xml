  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, randomized clinical trial of women with refractory accidental&#xD;
      bowel leakage (ABL) symptoms who have failed to achieve satisfactory symptom control from 2&#xD;
      first-line treatments for ABL: supervised pelvic muscle training (PMT) and constipating&#xD;
      medication. The purpose of this study is to compare percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation&#xD;
      (PTNS) to a validated sham to determine if PTNS is effective for the treatment of fecal&#xD;
      incontinence (FI) in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test the null hypothesis that change from baseline in St. Mark's&#xD;
      (Vaizey) score after 12 weeks of stimulation is not significantly different in women with&#xD;
      symptomatic ABL receiving PTNS treatments compared to women receiving sham PTNS treatments.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this randomized clinical trial is to determine if PTNS is more&#xD;
      effective than sham PTNS for the treatment of FI in women after 12 weeks of treatment and 1&#xD;
      year after initiating treatment. This is a two-part trial with a Run-In Phase prior to&#xD;
      randomization. The trial has the following primary aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether the change from baseline in St. Mark's (Vaizey) score in women with&#xD;
      symptomatic ABL undergoing PTNS differs from sham after 12 weeks of stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional secondary aims include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare changes from baseline in self-reported functional outcomes after 12 weekly&#xD;
           stimulation sessions in both PTNS and sham groups in Part 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether symptom relief amongst study &quot;responders&quot; can be sustained for one&#xD;
           year with maintenance treatments in Part II.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the impact of completing a bowel diary and receiving education on FI on&#xD;
           symptom severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the ability of the PFDN ABL phone app bowel diary to detect changes from&#xD;
           baseline in fecal incontinence episodes recorded to after 12 weeks of stimulation&#xD;
           sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine the association between St. Mark's score and both fat and fiber intake&#xD;
           alone and in combination.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Participants will remain masked to subject treatment assignment throughout the trial. To maintain masking of participants, the duration of treatment sessions for both the PTNS and sham groups will be 30 minutes and will be conducted with subjects in a supine position with the knees comfortably abducted and flexed. The leg and foot involved in treatment will be obscured from the subject's view with a portable anesthesia drape frame to which an exam sheet will be secured.</masking_description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline St. Mark's (Vaizey) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>4, 8, and 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure is the change from baseline in St. Mark's (Vaizey) Score 12 weeks after treatment initiation to compare the outcomes of post-tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) versus sham stimulation. The St. Mark's (Vaizey) score, published in 1999, is commonly used in clinical studies and reports and was based on the Jorge-Wexner score but added two further items for assessment: the use of constipating medication and the presence of fecal urgency. Minimum score is 0 = perfect continence; maximum score is 24 = totally incontinent. Change from baseline is calculated as Week [4, 8, or 12] Score minus the score at baseline.</description>

          <title>PTNS</title>
          <description>PTNS treatment entails insertion of a 36 gauge needle electrode at a 60 degree angle 3-4 cm deep towards the tibial nerve, approximately 5 cm or 3 finger breadths cephalad to the medial malleolus and posterior to the tibia. The PTNS grounding electrode, placed near the calcaneus and the needle electrode will be connected to the ES-130 device pulse generator.&#xD;
ES-130: The ES-130 device will be used for the indication of &quot;Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation for the treatment of fecal incontinence&quot; using the FDA-approved protocol for treatment of urge urinary incontinence (UUI) in the PFDN NOTABLe study. There is no PTNS device cleared by the FDA for the indication of FI treatment; therefore, this is considered an investigational device.</description>

          <title>Sham</title>
          <description>Sham treatment will use the Streitberger acupuncture placebo needle in the same location as the needle electrode for PTNS. The sham uses an active gel surface electrode pad placed on the bottom of the foot just below the fifth (smallest) toe. This location is not part of the acupuncture nerve pathway connected to the bladder, pelvis or any major organs. Electrical current is delivered to this pad via a TENS unit resulting in sensory stimulation.&#xD;
ES-130: The ES-130 device will be used for the indication of &quot;Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation for the treatment of fecal incontinence&quot; using the FDA-approved protocol for treatment of urge urinary incontinence (UUI) in the PFDN NOTABLe study. There is no PTNS device cleared by the FDA for the indication of FI treatment; therefore, this is considered an investigational device.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline St. Mark's (Vaizey) Score</title>
        <description>The primary outcome measure is the change from baseline in St. Mark's (Vaizey) Score 12 weeks after treatment initiation to compare the outcomes of post-tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) versus sham stimulation. The St. Mark's (Vaizey) score, published in 1999, is commonly used in clinical studies and reports and was based on the Jorge-Wexner score but added two further items for assessment: the use of constipating medication and the presence of fecal urgency. Minimum score is 0 = perfect continence; maximum score is 24 = totally incontinent. Change from baseline is calculated as Week [4, 8, or 12] Score minus the score at baseline.</description>

        <description>The ABLE Liquid Score is a subscale of the validated Accidental Bowel Leakage Evaluation (ABLE) questionnaire which assesses the impact and severity of the leakage of liquid stool. Minimum score is 0 = no problem with liquid stool leakage; maximum score is 4 = frequent, bothersome leakage of large amounts of liquid stool. Change from baseline is calculated as Week [8 or 12] Score minus the score at baseline.</description>

The PTNS grounding electrode, placed near the calcaneus and the needle electrode will be connected to the ES-130 device pulse generator.&#xD;
ES-130: The ES-130 device will be used for the indication of &quot;Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation for the treatment of fecal incontinence&quot; using the FDA-approved protocol for treatment of urge urinary incontinence (UUI) in the PFDN NOTABLe study.

          <description>The ABLE Mucus Score is a subscale of the validated Accidental Bowel Leakage Evaluation (ABLE) questionnaire which assesses the impact and severity of the leakage of mucus from the rectum. Minimum score is 0 = no problem with mucus leakage from the rectum; maximum score is 4 = frequent, bothersome leakage of large amounts of mucus from the rectum. Change from baseline is calculated as Week [8 or 12] Score minus the score at baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline FIQL Lifestyle Score</title>
        <description>The FIQL Lifestyle Score is a subscale of the validated Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life (FIQL) questionnaire which assesses the impact of accidental bowel leakage on quality of life. Minimum score is 1 = lower functional quality of life; maximum score is 5 = higher functional quality of life. Change from baseline is calculated as Week [8 or 12] Score minus the score at baseline.</description>

            <title>PTNS</title>
            <description>PTNS treatment entails insertion of a 36 gauge needle electrode at a 60 degree angle 3-4 cm deep towards the tibial nerve, approximately 5 cm or 3 finger breadths cephalad to the medial malleolus and posterior to the tibia. The PTNS grounding electrode, placed near the calcaneus and the needle electrode will be connected to the ES-130 device pulse generator.&#xD;
ES-130: The ES-130 device will be used for the indication of &quot;Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation for the treatment of fecal incontinence&quot; using the FDA-approved protocol for treatment of urge urinary incontinence (UUI) in the PFDN NOTABLe study. There is no PTNS device cleared by the FDA for the indication of FI treatment; therefore, this is considered an investigational device.</description>

            <title>Sham</title>
            <description>Sham treatment will use the Streitberger acupuncture placebo needle in the same location as the needle electrode for PTNS. The sham uses an active gel surface electrode pad placed on the bottom of the foot just below the fifth (smallest) toe. This location is not part of the acupuncture nerve pathway connected to the bladder, pelvis or any major organs. Electrical current is delivered to this pad via a TENS unit resulting in sensory stimulation.&#xD;

        <title>Change From Baseline FIQL Embarrassment Score</title>
        <description>The FIQL Embarrassment Score is a subscale of the validated Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life (FIQL) questionnaire which assesses the impact of accidental bowel leakage on quality of life. Minimum score is 1 = lower functional quality of life; maximum score is 5 = higher functional quality of life. Change from baseline is calculated as Week [8 or 12] Score minus the score at baseline.</description>

This location is not part of the acupuncture nerve pathway connected to the bladder, pelvis or any major organs. Electrical current is delivered to this pad via a TENS unit resulting in sensory stimulation.&#xD;
ES-130: The ES-130 device will be used for the indication of &quot;Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation for the treatment of fecal incontinence&quot; using the FDA-approved protocol for treatment of urge urinary incontinence (UUI) in the PFDN NOTABLe study. There is no PTNS device cleared by the FDA for the indication of FI treatment; therefore, this is considered an investigational device.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline MMHQ Severity Measures Score</title>
          <description>The MMHQ Severity Measures Score is a subscale of the validated Modified-Manchester Health questionnaire (MMHq) which provides a health-related quality of life rating. Minimum score is 0 = high quality of life; maximum score is 100 = low quality of life. Change from baseline is calculated as Week [8 or 12] Score minus the score at baseline.</description>

        <description>The Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire short form (PFIQ-7) measuring the impact of bladder, bowel, and vaginal symptoms on a woman's daily activities, relationships and emotions is composed of 3 scales of 7 questions each: the Urinary Impact Questionnaire (UIQ; range 0-100), the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Impact Questionnaire (POPIQ; range 0-100), and the Colorectal-Anal Impact Questionnaire (CRAIQ; range 0-100). Scores are calculated by multiplying the mean value of all answered questions for a scale by 100 divided by 3. The range of responses is: 0-100 with 0 (least negative impact) to 100 (most negative impact). Change = (Week [8, 12] Score - Baseline Score). Lower scores indicate better function / fewer symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline PFIQ Score</title>
        <description>The Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire short form (PFIQ-7) measuring the impact of bladder, bowel, and vaginal symptoms on a woman's daily activities, relationships and emotions is composed of 3 scales of 7 questions each: the Urinary Impact Questionnaire (UIQ; range 0-100), the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Impact Questionnaire (POPIQ; range 0-100), and the Colorectal-Anal Impact Questionnaire (CRAIQ; range 0-100). Scores are calculated by multiplying the mean value of all answered questions for a scale by 100 divided by 3. The range of responses is: 0-100 with 0 (least negative impact) to 100 (most negative impact). Change = (Week [8, 12] Score - Baseline Score). Lower scores indicate better function / fewer symptoms.</description>

          <description>The Patient Assessment of Constipation - Symptom (PAC-SYM) ia a validated form measuring the frequency and severity of chronic constipation. It consists of an overall score (range: 0-4) consisting of 3 subscales across 12 question: the Abdominal score (range 0-4), the Rectal Score (range 0-4), and the Stool Score (range 0-4). Scores are calculated as the mean of non-mising responses. The range of responses is: 0-4 with 0 (Absent) to 4 (Very sever). Change = (Week 12 Score - Baseline Score). Lower scores indicate less severe constipation.</description>

            <title>PTNS</title>
            <description>PTNS treatment entails insertion of a 36 gauge needle electrode at a 60 degree angle 3-4 cm deep towards the tibial nerve, approximately 5 cm or 3 finger breadths cephalad to the medial malleolus and posterior to the tibia. The PTNS grounding electrode, placed near the calcaneus and the needle electrode will be connected to the ES-130 device pulse generator.&#xD;
ES-130: The ES-130 device will be used for the indication of &quot;Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation for the treatment of fecal incontinence&quot; using the FDA-approved protocol for treatment of urge urinary incontinence (UUI) in the PFDN NOTABLe study. There is no PTNS device cleared by the FDA for the indication of FI treatment; therefore, this is considered an investigational device.</description>

            <description>Sham treatment will use the Streitberger acupuncture placebo needle in the same location as the needle electrode for PTNS. The sham uses an active gel surface electrode pad placed on the bottom of the foot just below the fifth (smallest) toe. This location is not part of the acupuncture nerve pathway connected to the bladder, pelvis or any major organs. Electrical current is delivered to this pad via a TENS unit resulting in sensory stimulation.&#xD;
