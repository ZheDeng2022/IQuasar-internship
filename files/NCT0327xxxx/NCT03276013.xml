      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial. The&#xD;
             subject may also provide consent/assent for Future Biomedical Research. However, the&#xD;
             subject may participate in the main trial without participating in Future Biomedical&#xD;
             Research&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Be &gt;18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have a histologically or cytologically-documented, advanced (metastatic and/or&#xD;
             unresectable) endometrial carcinoma that is incurable and for which prior&#xD;
             platinum-based chemotherapy for first-line treatment has failed. All epithelial&#xD;
             endometrial histologies are eligible including: endometrioid, serous, clear-cell&#xD;
             carcinoma, squamous or carcinosarcoma. Sarcomas and mesenchymal tumors are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Eligible subjects must have had only 1 prior line of systemic platinum-based&#xD;
             chemotherapy for advanced, recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer. Patients who&#xD;
             have had 2 or more prior chemotherapeutic regimens for advanced, recurrent, or&#xD;
             metastatic endometrial cancer are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy included in initial treatment may not&#xD;
             be considered first- or later-line treatment unless such treatments were completed&#xD;
             less than 6 months prior to the current tumor recurrence. Prior treatment may include&#xD;
             chemotherapy, chemotherapy/radiation therapy, and/or consolidation/maintenance&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Prior hormonal treatment is not considered a line of therapy in any setting. Prior&#xD;
             targeted therapy no directed against PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2 pathway or any other&#xD;
             immunemodulating mAb (including ipilimumab and any other antibody or drug specifically&#xD;
             targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways) are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1, defined as at least 1 lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (longest diameter to be recorded). Each&#xD;
             lesion must be ≥ 10 mm in long axis when measured by CT, MRI, or caliper measurement&#xD;
             by clinical exam. Lymph nodes must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or&#xD;
             MRI. Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable&#xD;
             if progression according to RECIST 1.1 criteria has been demonstrated in such lesions.&#xD;
             Patients must have radiographic evidence of disease progression following the most&#xD;
             recent line of treatment. Areas of previous radiation may not serve as measurable&#xD;
             disease unless there is evidence of progression post radiation according to RECIST 1.1&#xD;
             criteria. Patients with only one area of measureable disease that consent to have it&#xD;
             biopsied are still eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Availability of fresh or archival FFPE tumor specimens for analysis for biomarker&#xD;
             analysis from a tumor lesion not previously irradiated (exceptions may be considered&#xD;
             after Sponsor consultation). (See Procedure Manual for detailed instructions). Be&#xD;
             willing to provide tissue from a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor&#xD;
             lesion if archival specimen is not available. Newly-obtained is defined as a specimen&#xD;
             obtained up to 4 weeks (28 days) prior to initiation of treatment on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in Table 2, all screening labs should&#xD;
             be performed within 7 days of treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If&#xD;
             the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             will be required. Female subjects of childbearing potential (Section 5.7.3) must be&#xD;
             willing to use an adequate method of contraception as outlined in Section 5.7.2 -&#xD;
             Contraception, for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of&#xD;
             study medication.&#xD;

             baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent. Note: Subjects&#xD;
             with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the&#xD;
             study. Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately&#xD;
             from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting&#xD;
             therapy. Note: Palliative radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to study is allowed&#xD;
             provided that the site being treated is not subsequently used as a target lesions as&#xD;
             per RECIST v.1.1 for the purpose of assessing tumor response on trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.&#xD;

             prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned&#xD;
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using&#xD;
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include&#xD;
             carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years&#xD;
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive within the projected duration&#xD;
             of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 120 days&#xD;
             after the last dose of trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Has previously participated in any other pembrolizumab (MK-3475) trial, or received&#xD;
             prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, or any other immunemodulating&#xD;
             mAb (including ipilimumab and any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell&#xD;
             co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways)&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. No HIV testing is&#xD;
             required unless mandated by local health authority. Has a known history of or is&#xD;
             positive for hepatitis B (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] Note: Without known&#xD;
             history, testing needs to be performed to determine eligibility. Hepatitis C antibody&#xD;
             (Ab) testing is allowed for screening purposes in countries where HCV RNA is not part&#xD;
             of standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:&#xD;
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and&#xD;
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live&#xD;
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate the&#xD;
             patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance&#xD;
             with clinical study procedures, e.g., infection/inflammation, social/ psychological&#xD;
             issues.&#xD;
