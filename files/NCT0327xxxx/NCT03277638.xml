  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the side effects and efficacy of using Laser&#xD;
      Interstitial Thermotherapy (LITT) combined with Pembrolizumab. LITT is a minimally invasive&#xD;
      surgical technique that uses a laser to heat brain tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab is an investigational (experimental) drug that works by helping participants'&#xD;
      immune system work correctly to detect and fight cancer cells. Pembrolizumab is experimental&#xD;
      because it is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for this use, though it&#xD;
      is approved to treat other cancers.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Phase I: To determine the optimal timing for combining LITT and pembrolizumab in&#xD;
           patients with rGBM:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • To determine the feasibility, safety, tolerability and side effect profiles for&#xD;
           combining LITT and pembrolizumab at various time points pre-LITT vs. post-LITT (Phase&#xD;
           I).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Phase II: To estimate the response to pembrolizumab combined with LITT in patients with&#xD;
           rGBM;&#xD;
&#xD;
           • To estimate the response rate after treatment with LITT combined with pembrolizumab in&#xD;
           patients with rGBM (Phase II).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To collect and record the side effect profiles for combining LITT and pembrolizumab&#xD;
           (Phase I and Phase II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the effect of pembrolizumab on systemic immune microenvironment in patients&#xD;
           with rGBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the effect of pembrolizumab on the intra-tumoral immunosuppressive&#xD;
           microenvironment within rGBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Secondary for Phase II, to estimate progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival&#xD;
           (OS) after treatment with LITT combined with pembrolizumab in patients with rGBM (Phase&#xD;
           II).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Measure radiological response using both conventional RANO criterion, a modified RANO&#xD;
           (RANOi) designed specifically for immunotherapy response assessment, as well as MRI&#xD;
           fingerprinting (MRF), recently demonstrated by the PI and collaborators to accurately&#xD;
           and precisely distinguish recurrent GBM from radiation injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Correlate clinical and radiological response to known biomarkers of GBM such as&#xD;
           Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 (IDH-1) mutations, Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 2 (IDH-2)&#xD;
           mutations, Methyl-Guanine Methyl Transferase (MGMT) promoter methylation, Phosphatase&#xD;
           and tensin homologue (PTEN) loss and KI-67.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase I component will involve up to two of a possible 3 cohorts of 3-4 patients each for&#xD;
      a total of 6-8 evaluable patients. Each patient will undergo a stereotactic biopsy. If GBM or&#xD;
      Gliosarcoma is confirmed by frozen section, patients will undergo LITT then treatment with&#xD;
      200 mg pembrolizumab IV. Cohort I will receive pembrolizumab on post operative day 14 and&#xD;
      every 3 weeks thereafter. In the event that one patient suffers non-hematologic toxicity of&#xD;
      grade 3 or more, or if hematologic toxicity is grade 4 or higher, the investigators will&#xD;
      delay the 2nd dose of pembrolizumab by 3 weeks and a 4th patient will be accrued. If there&#xD;
      are two patients in the initial cohort with non-hematologic toxicities grade 3, or if&#xD;
      hematological toxicity in two patients is grade 4 or higher, the second cohort will delay&#xD;
      initiation of pembrolizumab until post operative day 35 after LITT. Conversely, if there are&#xD;
      no non-hematologic adverse events (AEs) of grade 3 or higher, the investigators will proceed&#xD;
      to cohort IB using the same dose of pembrolizumab given 7 days prior to surgery, then every 3&#xD;
      weeks. Similarly, feasibility and safety will be addressed as above in deciding whether or&#xD;
      not to proceed to the next cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase II component of the study will consist of additional patients receiving&#xD;
      pembrolizumab at the earliest tolerated time post LITT:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  14 days post-op&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  -7 days pre-op;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  35 days post-opto achieve a total of 23 evaluable patients at the earliest tolerated&#xD;
           dose.&#xD;

                  should be evaluated for the presence of target organ involvement and potential&#xD;
                  need for systemic treatment but should otherwise be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any other major medical illnesses or psychiatric impairments that in the&#xD;
                  investigator's opinion will prevent administration or completion of protocol&#xD;
                  therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active&#xD;
                  treatment. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell&#xD;
                  carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ&#xD;
                  cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous&#xD;
                  meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate&#xD;
                  provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least&#xD;
                  four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms&#xD;
                  have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain&#xD;
                  metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial&#xD;
                  treatment. This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is&#xD;
                  excluded regardless of clinical stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2&#xD;
                  years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or&#xD;
                  immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or&#xD;
                  physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary&#xD;
                  insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy?&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory&#xD;
                  abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the&#xD;
                  subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best&#xD;
                  interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating&#xD;
                  investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
                  cooperation with the requirements of the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within&#xD;
                  the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening&#xD;
                  visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-Programmed Death 1 (PD-1), anti-&#xD;
                  Programmed Death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), or anti- Programmed Death-ligand 1 (PD-L2)&#xD;
                  agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV ½ antibodies).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HbsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (eg, HCV RNA&#xD;
                  [qualitative] is detected).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. ---&#xD;
                  Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu&#xD;
                  vaccines and are allowed; however Intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®)&#xD;
                  are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have &lt; 1.0 cm midline shift pre-operative&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody including&#xD;
             pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who cannot safely undergo MRI due to non-MRI compatible pacemaker, or other&#xD;
             reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have tumors for which the Gd-enhancing mass appears to be covered ≤ 90%&#xD;
             using 2 catheters and assuming a 3.0 cm diameter based on pre-operative planning are&#xD;
             unlikely to have adequate LITT and thus ineligible for the study.&#xD;
