    <textblock>
      This project builds upon initial proof of concept work examining the optimal set of supports&#xD;
      for youth who have recently exited homelessness - an intervention comprised of mental health&#xD;
      and peer supports alongside transitional case management. This collaborative model will be&#xD;
      tested as a proof-of-concept in Thunder Bay with Indigenous youth and a trial will be&#xD;
      conducted in Toronto to optimize and determine the effectiveness of the existing model of&#xD;
      support.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In response to the challenges outlined above, and with the support of a grant from the&#xD;
      Ontario Ministry of Child and Youth Services, the investigators developed and tested a&#xD;
      tertiary prevention strategy called the Housing Outreach Program Collaborative (HOP-C) which&#xD;
      launched in the summer of 2015. In this approach the investigators focused on collaborations&#xD;
      and interventions that have the greatest potential to be effective with this population. The&#xD;
      investigators brought together partners from a number of sectors in the GTA and have tested a&#xD;
      3-pronged set of supports (intervention described in detail in the methods):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transitional Case Management&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mental Health Interventions: Group, individual, family&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peer Support This is an intensive, 6-month critical time intervention - one that jointly&#xD;
           addresses many points of vulnerability (mental health crises, housing instability,&#xD;
           justice involvement) while fostering resilience and connection with resources in&#xD;
           employment, education and training domains. It is unique in both content&#xD;
           comprehensiveness and integrated process of delivery. Also important was the development&#xD;
           of a collaborative and responsive partnering process, to facilitate effective&#xD;
           organizational interfaces and seamless service integration so participants can&#xD;
           experience a tailored and coherent set of supports. With CAMH, the Centre for&#xD;
           Mindfulness Studies, Covenant House, LOFT, and SKETCH at the service level and the&#xD;
           Wellesley Institute leading evaluation, the investigators have carefully attended to a&#xD;
           collective impact framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This initiative has proven feasible and is demonstrating good outcomes - with excellent youth&#xD;
      engagement, reports of lower social isolation, improved mental health, and engagement with&#xD;
      resources, and spin-off benefits of closer collaboration between organizations. The&#xD;
      investigators successfully met the target of youth engagement, with a total of 31 youth&#xD;
      participating, minimal attrition (n=2), and the investigators observed no indications that&#xD;
      HOP-C resulted in risk of any form, both with respect to the intervention itself and the&#xD;
      mixed methods research methodology. This promising feasibility work formed the foundation&#xD;
      from which the investigators were successful in obtaining a grant from the Local Poverty&#xD;
      Reduction Fund to support the study described in this proposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current Project Determine through a randomized trial in Toronto if the positive outcomes the&#xD;
      investigators are observing are due solely or primarily to transitional case management and&#xD;
      if the additional peer and mental health components are necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Engaging in intensive, tertiary prevention shows clear promise in disrupting a cycle of&#xD;
      poverty and marginalization at a critical time - if proven and scaled a key driver of chronic&#xD;
      homelessness would be addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions The objective of this two-part project is to examine the effectiveness and&#xD;
      transferability of the Housing Outreach Program-Collaboration (HOP-C) transitional&#xD;
      intervention. HOP-C has proven to be feasible with promising outcomes in the Toronto&#xD;
      proof-of-concept work currently underway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Are the benefits of the complex HOP-C intervention with all components in place greater&#xD;
      than transitional case management in isolation?&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ It is hypothesized that the full model will provide benefit in domains of housing&#xD;
      stability, mental health, and quality of life that are significantly greater than case&#xD;
      management alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have data in hand from their recent national work in the area which&#xD;
      provides data on 'treatment as usual' or the outcomes that attend typically available&#xD;
      supports. The proposed trial will unpack benefit and be essential in economic and viability&#xD;
      arguments to be made going forward.&#xD;

The measure contains 6 items scored on a 5 point scale ranging from, at minimum, &quot;always disagree&quot; (1) to, at maximum, &quot;always agree&quot; (5). Higher scores indicating better outcomes with an item mean range from 1-5 with mean pre-post differences reported.</description>
