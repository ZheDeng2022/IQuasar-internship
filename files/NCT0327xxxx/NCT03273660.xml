      Aim of the study is to evaluate the re-volumizing performance and the duration effect of the&#xD;
      product Aliaxin (new trademark) in women aged 40-65 years with midface volume defects due to&#xD;
      aging mechanism.&#xD;

Grade 3 (moderate): moderately deep nasolabial folds; clear facial feature visible at normal appearance but not when stretched.&#xD;
Grade 4 (severe): very long and deep nasolabial folds; prominent facial feature; &lt;2mm visible fold when stretched.&#xD;
