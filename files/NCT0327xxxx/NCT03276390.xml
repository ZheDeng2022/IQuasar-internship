  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hispanic/Latino patients with end-stage renal disease are disproportionately less likely to&#xD;
      get a kidney transplant, and specifically, a living donor kidney transplant (LDKT), compared&#xD;
      to non-Hispanic whites. Accordingly, without LDKTs, Hispanics experience longer transplant&#xD;
      waiting times, shorter patient and graft survival, and worse quality of life. Cultural&#xD;
      beliefs and linguistic barriers contribute to the disparity in LDKTs. The objective of the&#xD;
      proposed study is to implement and evaluate Northwestern Medicine's® Hispanic Kidney&#xD;
      Transplant Program, a culturally-competent transplant center-based intervention, at two&#xD;
      transplant centers serving large Hispanic populations. The proposed study will provide&#xD;
      valuable knowledge about the potential to rapidly disseminate the HKTP as a novel approach to&#xD;
      increase Hispanic LDKTs nationally.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The shortage of organs for kidney transplantation for patients with end-stage renal disease&#xD;
      (ESRD) is magnified in Hispanics/Latin Americans. Hispanics have a disproportionately higher&#xD;
      prevalence of ESRD, yet receive fewer kidney transplants compared to non-Hispanic whites.&#xD;
      Living donor kidney transplant (LDKT) is the treatment of choice for ESRD as it confers&#xD;
      better patient and graft survival, shorter waiting time, and better quality of life than&#xD;
      deceased donor kidney transplantation. However, compared to their representation on the&#xD;
      waiting list, fewer Hispanics received a LDKT than non-Hispanic whites in 2013: 4% versus&#xD;
      10%. Barriers to LDKT for Hispanics include: lack of knowledge, cultural concerns, and&#xD;
      language barriers. The disparity will likely worsen without intervention as Hispanics are the&#xD;
      largest and fastest growing minority group in the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few available culturally competent interventions have led to increased LDKT rates.&#xD;
      Interventions rarely address Hispanic cultural concerns, and there are no published models of&#xD;
      transplant center-based only programs. The Chicago Northwestern Medicine's® Hispanic Kidney&#xD;
      Transplant Program (HKTP), a culturally and linguistically competent program, has increased&#xD;
      Hispanic LDKTs. The mean annual ratio of Hispanic to non-Hispanic white LDKTs grew from 0.20&#xD;
      in 2001-2006 to 0.34 in 2008-2013, a 70% increase (p&lt;0.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to implement and evaluate the HKTP, a culturally-competent&#xD;
      transplant center-based intervention, at two transplant centers serving large Hispanic&#xD;
      populations (Dallas, TX, and Los Angeles, CA), with Northwestern University serving as the&#xD;
      Study Coordinating Center. The pre-post HKTP intervention study will evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      the HKTP's key culturally sensitive components (outreach, communication, education) on&#xD;
      Hispanic LDKT rates, compared to matched controls. The specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Implement the HKTP at two transplant centers by conducting a needs assessment of&#xD;
           barriers and using a &quot;learning collaborative&quot; model to deliver HKTP protocols, scripts,&#xD;
           and materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conduct a pre-post HKTP intervention evaluation with matched controls to assess if the&#xD;
           HKTP is associated with an increase in: a) the ratio of Hispanic to non-Hispanic white&#xD;
           LDKTs as a function of an absolute increase in Hispanic LDKTs, b) ESRD Hispanic patient&#xD;
           additions to the waiting list, c) Hispanic potential donors per potential recipient, and&#xD;
           d) Hispanic patients' satisfaction with care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Formatively evaluate the fidelity and innovative adaptations to HKTP's outreach,&#xD;
           communication, and education at both study sites to identify effective components of the&#xD;
           HTKP, using mixed methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an exploratory aim, a budget impact analysis will be conducted to construct a business&#xD;
      case for transplant centers and permit estimates of HKTP scalability. The proposed study will&#xD;
      provide valuable knowledge about the potential to rapidly disseminate the HKTP as a novel&#xD;
      approach to increase Hispanic LDKTs nationally, improve health outcomes for Hispanics, and&#xD;
      close the LDKT disparity gap.&#xD;
