      Introduction Treatment of neuropathic pain has been a goal of numerous research projects for&#xD;
      the last half century, with overall disappointing results. These poor achievements are in&#xD;
      contrast with substantial advancements in the understanding of pain mechanisms, and numerous&#xD;
      molecules developed to tackle them. The need to better identify patients likely to respond to&#xD;
      treatment comes from the neuropathic pain experts in regards to the pharmacological domain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basic assertion of this project is that the pain modulation profile is altered in pain&#xD;
      patients toward a pro-nociceptive mode, and that the specific single or multiple dysfunctions&#xD;
      of pain modulation that underlie this pro-nociceptivity should be targeted by therapeutic&#xD;
      lines that can reverse the modulation back toward eu-nociceptivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this amendment is to demonstrate that pain treatment efficacy for painful diabetic&#xD;
      neuropathy can be optimized by individualizing pharmacological treatment choice along 'fix&#xD;
      the dysfunction' concept&#xD;

&#xD;
      The basic assertion of this project is that the pain modulation profile is altered in pain&#xD;

      of pain modulation that underlie this pro-nociceptivity should be targeted by therapeutic&#xD;
      lines that can reverse the modulation back toward eu-nociceptivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this amendment is to demonstrate that pain treatment efficacy for painful diabetic&#xD;
      neuropathy can be optimized by individualizing pharmacological treatment choice along 'fix&#xD;
      the dysfunction' concept Methods Study design This is a longitudinal double blind non cross&#xD;
      over study with parallel groups. There will be three pharmacological treatment arms, one per&#xD;
      each treatment: SNRIs duloxetine, Ca++-channels blocker pregabaline and inactive placebo. All&#xD;
      treatments will be given to painful diabetic neuropathy patients. All patients will undergo&#xD;
      three lab sessions. A uniform assessment will be performed before starting (Session I), and&#xD;
      at the end of treatments (Session III). This psychophysical assessment of their pain&#xD;
      modulation, physiological assessment that will include resting-state EEG recording along with&#xD;
      contact-heat evoked potentials (CHEPs) and assessment of motor cortex excitability, and&#xD;
      psychological assessment with pain-related psychological questionnaires. In addition, Session&#xD;
      I will also include a clinical examination for the assessment of neuropathy characteristics&#xD;
      and symptoms severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After one months after the initial Session I, all the patients will undergo the lab session&#xD;
      for the assessment their responsiveness to experimental placebo manipulation (Session II),&#xD;
      including filling questioners associated with the prediction of placebo effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between sessions I and II the patients will fill an electronic diary in order to evaluate&#xD;
      their clinical pain intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of age- matched healthy subjects will undergo a psychophysical pain modulation&#xD;
      protocol along with the EEG recording, all performed in one session. These data will serve a&#xD;
      reference data for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients Three-hundred Painful Diabetic Neuropathy patients will be recruited. Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria: age of 18-80 yrs, both genders, non-pregnant or breast feeding, free of significant&#xD;
      chronic pain syndromes other than the neuropathy, free of major neurological or psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders such as dementia, psychosis and similar. Exclusion criteria: communication and&#xD;
      language difficulties that hinder their performance in the various tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One-hundred healthy subjects will be recruited. Inclusion criteria: age of 18-80 yrs, both&#xD;
      genders, non-pregnant or breast feeding, free of significant chronic pain syndromes, free of&#xD;
      major neurological or psychiatric disorders such as dementia, psychosis and similar.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: communication and language difficulties that hinder their performance in&#xD;
      the various tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of neuropathy and baseline pain Clinical evaluation will be based on a clinical&#xD;
      interview and examination, data will be collected using the Toronto scale. Assessment of pain&#xD;
      along four weeks will be recorded via a smart phone application on weekly basis, , or by&#xD;
      follow up phone calls to patients/ printed diary. Quantitative sensory testing (thermal&#xD;
      sensory thresholds assessment) and/or EMG assessment will be performed on the most affected&#xD;
      foot in order to evaluate neuropathy severity. QST-wise we will follow the DFNS for the&#xD;
      following items: Sensory and pain thresholds. tested with 3x3cm contact Peltier probe of the&#xD;
      Thermal Sensory Analyzer (TSA, Medoc, Israel) device. The baseline temperature will be set at&#xD;
      32oC; with stimulus change rate of 1 oC/sec for the assessment of sensory and pain threshold.&#xD;
      Thresholds for heat and cold pain will be measured using method of limits, based on the mean&#xD;
      of 3 responses. Mechanical sensory and pain threshold will be assessed with von Frey&#xD;
      filaments (Bioseb, France) applied in an ascending order at several repetitions. Five&#xD;
      threshold determinations will be made, each with a series of ascending and descending&#xD;
      stimulus intensities. The final threshold is the geometric mean of these five series of&#xD;
      supra- and subthreshold stimuli intensities. Dynamic mechanical allodynia using standard&#xD;
      brush. Vibration detection threshold (VDT). This test is performed with a standardized tuning&#xD;
      fork (64 Hz) that is placed on the toes and patella. The vibration detection threshold is&#xD;
      determined by three series of descending stimulus intensities determined from the &quot;wandering&quot;&#xD;
      tip of a triangle moved by means of the vibration and indicated on the tuning fork using the&#xD;
      arithmetic mean of the values when the participant just stopped perceiving vibration (in&#xD;
      x/8). Pressure pain threshold (PPT). Using a pressure algometer (contact area 1 cm2) the&#xD;
      threshold for pressure induced pain is measured above a foot muscle in 3 series of slowly&#xD;
      increasing stimulus intensities (0.5 kg/s, corresponding to 50 kPa/s). The threshold is then&#xD;
      determined as the arithmetic mean of the 3 series (in kPa).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychophysical pain modulation protocols CPM response will be assessed by two test-stimuli:&#xD;
      (i) contact heat, a 10&quot; contact heat stimulus (30x30 mm thermode, TSA-2001, Medoc, Israel)&#xD;
      delivered to the left forearm at the individually-predetermined temperature that evoked pain&#xD;
      intensity of 60 on a 0-100 NPS. (ii) mechanical stimuli, three application of pressure&#xD;
      algometer device, Algomed, Medoc Israel), for 1&quot; each delivered with the inter-stimulus&#xD;
      interval (ISI) of 5&quot; (to prevent summation). Conditioning stimulus will be cold water&#xD;
      immersion of the other hand in a water container of 8-10oC. Alternatively, the test- and&#xD;
      conditioning stimuli might be applied on upper or/and lower back. In addition, instead of&#xD;
      cold water we might use a contact heat stimuli or ice package. After short familiarization&#xD;
      with the various stimuli, each test-stimulus will be administered, and response measured. A&#xD;
      10' break will be taken, and then the conditioning stimulus will be given, during which the&#xD;
      three test stimuli will be repeated. The difference between conditioned test stimulus result&#xD;
      and the stand alone result will be the taken as the CPM effect. Please see&#xD;
      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL9GgdsyHtA for our detailed protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TS response will be measured on the left forearm using two tests: (i) mechanical stimuli;&#xD;
      application of a 180gr (# 6.45) von Frey filament. NPS will be obtained after a single&#xD;
      application, and after the last application in the series of 10 repetitive stimuli with a 1&quot;&#xD;
      inter-stimulus interval. (ii) electrical stimuli, a series of a single, and then of 10&#xD;
      electrical stimuli will be given at the intensity of Pain50 and ISI of 1&quot;, using the&#xD;
      stimulation parameters as described for NFR (iii) tonic heat stimulus of 50/100 for 30&quot; with&#xD;
      ratings along the stimulus. The difference between the last and the first scores for each&#xD;
      type of stimulus will be taken as the TS score. In addition, magnitude estimation of&#xD;
      supra-threshold pain with tonic stimuli of 45oC, 47oC and 49oC, 10&quot; each, and pain scores in&#xD;
      response to hand immersion will serve as the static pain parameters of pain sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG protocol Resting-state EEG and contact heat-evoked potentials (CHEPs) will be recorded&#xD;
      with 64 channels ActiChamp EEG system (Brain Products GmbH, Munich, Germany). The data will&#xD;
      be saved on hard disk for offline analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHEPs will be recorded for all of the following 'test stimuli'. These will be phasic stimuli&#xD;
      (PATHWAY system, Medoc, Israel), delivered to the forearm, rising at 70oC/sec with immediate&#xD;
      return to adaptation, with peak intensity at predetermined temperature evoking pain60. For&#xD;
      the neurophysiological assessment of CPM, there will be two blocks of stimuli; each&#xD;
      consisting of 30 stimuli, divided into two trains of 15 stimuli separated by 5', ISI is&#xD;
      8-12&quot;. Pain ratings will be obtained in parallel to the recording of CHEPs, after each&#xD;
      stimulus. The first block will be given as a stand-alone; the second one will be given in&#xD;
      parallel to immersion of the other hand in cold water of 8-10oC as the 'conditioning&#xD;
      stimulus'. Alternatively, a tonic contact heat or ice package application will serve a&#xD;
      conditioning stimulus. The CPM effect will be the difference between the current density maps&#xD;
      of the CHEPs in response to test-stimuli given before and during conditioning-stimuli. EEG&#xD;
      analysis: Source localization of brain generators will be pursued by sLORETA (free academic&#xD;
      software at: http://www.uzh.ch/keyinst/loreta.htm) to compute statistical non-parametric maps&#xD;
      from the contact heat and electrical pain evoked potentials aimed to identify the most active&#xD;
      cortical areas related to the CPM. After identifying the regions of interest (ROI's) based on&#xD;
      their putative role in pain inhibitory and facilitatory modulation processing, S-LORETA will&#xD;
      calculate the average current density value for the ROI or the voxel with maximal activity&#xD;
      for each patient, based on the individual electrode coordinates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG frequency analysis. Each 3-minute resting-state recording section will be divided into&#xD;
      segments of 1 second. Segments contaminated with eye movements, muscle activity or other&#xD;
      artifacts will be removed from further analysis. The remaining segments will be subject to&#xD;
      time frequency analysis using wavelet transform i.e. decomposition of the signal to different&#xD;
      wavelet templates each represent a combined time-frequency representation and each assigned a&#xD;
      coefficient according to its match with the original signal. We will use the coefficients&#xD;
      (averaged over time) to calculate the frequency content power and peak frequency for each of&#xD;
      the following frequency bands: delta (2-4Hz), theta (4-8Hz), alpha 1 (8-10Hz), alpha 2&#xD;
      (10-12Hz), beta (13-25Hz) and gamma (&gt;30Hz). The coefficients of the signal at different&#xD;
      scalp location can be used to calculate phase synchronization and the coherence of the&#xD;
      activity between different brain regions reflecting functional connectivity among related&#xD;
      brain regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments The patients will take 2 tab/d of either (i) duloxetine 60mg or (ii) pregabaline&#xD;
      150mg x 2/day or (iii) placebo for 8 weeks. In the first 7 days dose of duloxetine will be&#xD;
      30mg/day in order to lower side effects and improve compliance. In line, the initial 7-days&#xD;
      dose of pregabaline will 75mg x 2. For duloxetine, the morning dose will be a sham pill.&#xD;
      Study nurse will be available for the patients regarding any side effects or issues arising,&#xD;
      and communicate the relevant data to the PI. All personnel and patients will be blinded to&#xD;
      the given treatment (double-blind design). The person conducting the immediate and the long&#xD;
      term follow up will not know what the results were of the pre-treatment assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo-manipulation session During session II we will perform an evaluation of placebo&#xD;
      responsiveness as follows. First, the patient will be exposed to moderate noxious&#xD;
      individually-tailored heat stimulus (up to 1 min duration) given on the dominant forearm.&#xD;
      After topical application of a neutral hand cream (like Vaseline), which will be presented to&#xD;
      the participants in advance as a very powerful analgesic cream, 15 min break will be taken&#xD;
      after which the subject will told that the cream will be active for next 30-40 min during&#xD;
      which repeated assessment of pain perception will be performed. First, lower intensity of the&#xD;
      heat stimulus will be given (a conditioning procedure). Then, with a further 10 min break,&#xD;
      two stimuli of the initially chosen temperature will be delivered, and pain perception will&#xD;
      be assessed. The placebo response will be calculated as a pain reduction between post- vs.&#xD;
      pre-conditioning heat pain application. The participants also rate their expectation of the&#xD;
      painfulness before, and the actually perceived pain after each heat stimulus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this session all patients will also undergo the psychological assessment as follows:&#xD;
      Anxiety, pain-related catastrophizing and sleep quality will be assessed via the relevant&#xD;
      questioners of the set of psychological assessment developed for our undergoing Horizon 2020&#xD;
      study. In addition, all participants will fill the Multidimensional Iowa Suggestibility Scale&#xD;
      (MISS) questioner for the assessment of individual suggestibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the psychological evaluation, the patients will undergo cognitive /&#xD;
      attentional assessment of cognitive flexibility and working memory using the Trail-Making&#xD;
      Test A and B parts, and the Digit Symbol Submission Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Longitudinal assessment of clinical pain level will be reported every two weeks&#xD;
      along 8 weeks of the treatment, via a smart phone application that will be downloaded to&#xD;
      participating patient's devices, or by follow up phone calls to patients/ printed diary . In&#xD;
      addition - the full assessment lab protocol performed at baseline will be repeated at the end&#xD;
      of the treatment period.&#xD;
