    <textblock>
      Astragalus membranaceus (AM, Huang-Chi) is a Chinese herb used extensively in China as a&#xD;
      traditional treatment to treat stroke for a long time, and a number of studies have shown&#xD;
      that AM can reduce cerebral infarction area and has anti-oxidation activity. Our previous&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated enhanced recovery of neurologic function in patients with acute&#xD;
      hemorrhagic stroke who received AM. It is hypothesized that AM either reduces inflammatory&#xD;
      response or reduces perihematomal edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to rupture of a cerebral aneurysm is a medical condition&#xD;
      associated with a high morbidity and mortality; approximately 10-15% of patients die before&#xD;
      reaching medical care, and overall mortality is approximately 45%. Of those that survive, 30%&#xD;
      suffer permanent disability graded as moderate to severe, and two-thirds of survivors never&#xD;
      return to the same quality of life as they had prior to their hemorrhage. A large number of&#xD;
      patients (30-70%) who are able to make it to the hospital and have successful treatment of&#xD;
      their aneurysm will develop delayed cerebral vasospasm that is related to the blood clot from&#xD;
      their initial aneurysm rupture. Of patients that survive their initial aneurysm rupture,&#xD;
      vasospasm results in an additional 7% mortality and another 7% of severe disabilities&#xD;
      secondary to ischemic strokes from severe spasm of cerebral arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is trying to see if AM can enhance the clinical prognosis for spontaneous&#xD;
      aneurysm ruptured subarachnoid hemorrhage patients. All procedures done as a part of this&#xD;
      study are standard hospital care procedures done to treat aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&#xD;
      according to the AHA/ASA guideline.&#xD;
