    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases and stroke are the major causes of morbidity and death in Taiwan.&#xD;
      Patients with dyslipidemia are prone to atherosclerosis, which predispose to various&#xD;
      cardiovascular pathology including coronary artery disease (CAD), ischemic stroke and&#xD;
      peripheral artery occlusive disease (PAOD). There are, however, no reliable biomarkers to&#xD;
      detect atherosclerotic vascular diseases among dyslipidemic patients or to predict the risks&#xD;
      of cardiovascular morbidities and mortality among patients with atherosclerosis. There is a&#xD;
      clear need to identify novel mediators of atherosclerosis in dyslipidemic patients to provide&#xD;
      insights into the pathogenesis, to tailor clinical care based on cardiovascular risks, and to&#xD;
      develop new therapeutic strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has become increasingly clear that the transcription of the eukaryotic genome is far more&#xD;
      pervasive and complex than previously appreciated. While the expression of messenger RNAs&#xD;
      (mRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) account for only ~1% of all transcribed species, up to 90% of&#xD;
      the mammalian genome is transcribed as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a heterogeneous group&#xD;
      of non-coding transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides. LncRNAs have been shown to be&#xD;
      functional and involved in specific physiological and pathological processes through&#xD;
      epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. While the roles of lncRNAs&#xD;
      in human diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders are beginning to emerge,&#xD;
      it remains unclear how lncRNA regulation contributes to atherosclerotic vascular diseases in&#xD;
      patients with dyslipidemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposal, we seek to apply next-generation sequencing technology to investigate&#xD;
      circulating (plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMC]) lncRNA expression in&#xD;
      control subjects and in dyslipidemic patients with and without atherosclerotic vascular&#xD;
      diseases (CAD, ischemic stroke and PAOD). We will test the hypothesis that circulating lncRNA&#xD;
      expression signature can reflect the atherosclerotic disease states in patients with&#xD;
      dyslipidemia. A gene co-expression network analysis will be conducted to identify lncRNAs&#xD;
      that are functionally involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. With the experimental&#xD;
      results from an initial dyslipidemic cohort, we will establish an atherosclerosis scoring&#xD;
      model on the basis of circulating lncRNA expression signature to facilitate the detection of&#xD;
      atherosclerotic vascular diseases in patients with dyslipidemia. The accuracy, sensitivity&#xD;
      and specificity of the lncRNA-based atherosclerosis scoring system will then be tested in an&#xD;
      independent, large validation cohort. Next, we propose to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      circulating lncRNAs can be novel prognostic biomarkers to predict atherosclerosis progression&#xD;
      and cardiovascular outcomes in dyslipidemic patients. The results from these experiments will&#xD;
      lead to better understanding of how circulating lncRNAs contribute to atherosclerotic&#xD;
      cardiovascular complications. These studies will also establish a set of novel, lncRNA-based&#xD;
      diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in dyslipidemic patients to improve clinical preventive&#xD;
      and therapeutic care. In addition, the findings from these studies will help to develop novel&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies to treat or prevent atherosclerotic vascular diseases in patients with&#xD;
      dyslipidemia.&#xD;
