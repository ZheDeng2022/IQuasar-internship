  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MilSeq Project is a nonrandomized, prospective pilot study of whole exome sequencing&#xD;
      (WES) in the U.S. Air Force. The purpose of this study is to explore the implementation of&#xD;
      WES into clinical medical care in the military health system.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this effort is to investigate: (a) military healthcare providers' (HCPs')&#xD;
      genomic knowledge before and after receiving a genomic educational primer and after&#xD;
      disclosing whole exome sequencing (WES) results to begin to assess the genomic educational&#xD;
      needs of military HCPs; (b) active-duty Airmen's knowledge and perceptions of genomic&#xD;
      sequencing (GS); (c) reasons why active-duty Airmen choose to participate, or not to&#xD;
      participate, in research involving GS; (d) how WES study participants, including HCPs and&#xD;
      sequenced active-duty Airmen (patient-participants), respond to and use WES results; (e) the&#xD;
      collection of medical, behavioral, and healthcare utilization outcomes related to the&#xD;
      clinical integration of WES in the military; (f) how return of WES results and integration&#xD;
      into the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) do or do not impact perceptions of mission readiness&#xD;
      and duty assignments. Given the lack of prior research in this area in the Air Force and the&#xD;
      broad number of topics of interest, the aims of the study are predominantly exploratory and&#xD;
      results may be hypothesis generating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MilSeq Project will be conducted in two sequential phases. Phase I of the study will&#xD;
      recruit, consent, and enroll approximately 75 ostensibly healthy active-duty Airmen who&#xD;
      receive medical care in military Primary Care, Internal Medicine, and/or Family Practice&#xD;
      settings to take a baseline survey. This survey will be administered to explore active-duty&#xD;
      Airmen's perceptions of and preferences for GS, identify motivations and barriers to&#xD;
      active-duty Airmen participating in a WES study, and assess interest in taking part in the&#xD;
      WES study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II of the study will recruit, consent, and enroll 75 ostensibly healthy active-duty&#xD;
      Airmen who receive medical care in military Primary Care, Internal Medicine and/or Family&#xD;
      Practice settings who in their baseline survey expressed interest in receiving WES through a&#xD;
      research study. WES will be performed on each enrolled patient-participant. The result will&#xD;
      be disclosed by an HCP-participant and permanently integrated into the patient-participant's&#xD;
      EMR. Phase II will also recruit 10-20 military Primary Care, Internal Medicine, and/or Family&#xD;
      Practice HCPs and consent them to participate in the study. The HCPs will receive an&#xD;
      educational primer in genomics and will disclose WES results to Airmen participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a number of potential benefits and challenges to incorporating genomic medicine&#xD;
      into the military, some that are relevant to the broader civilian community, but some that&#xD;
      are unique to this population. Some of these challenges include: (a) how GS may or may not&#xD;
      affect the perception of fitness for duty; (b) how genomic discrimination may or may not&#xD;
      occur in the military setting; (c) how to best deal with unanticipated findings; and (d) how&#xD;
      genomic results can be practically integrated into a military setting. In this pilot study,&#xD;
      these potential opportunities and challenges will be explored, which will provide a basis for&#xD;
      future study and begin to inform decisions regarding clinical care of active-duty service&#xD;
      members.&#xD;

          <description>Whole exome sequencing (WES) will be performed on 75 ostensibly healthy, active-duty Airmen (patient-participants) who receive medical care in military Primary Care, Internal Medicine and/or Family Practice settings who in their baseline survey expressed interest in receiving WES.
