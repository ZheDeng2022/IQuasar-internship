  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A repetitive, non-invasive brain stimulation technique referred to as theta burst stimulation&#xD;
      can modulate corticomotor excitability and therefore has great rehabilitative potential for&#xD;
      individuals with neurologic deficits, including individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). In&#xD;
      particular, intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) can increase corticomotor&#xD;
      excitability and may be a useful adjunct to physical rehabilitation to promote motor&#xD;
      re-education after upper limb reconstruction in individuals with tetraplegia. Upper limb&#xD;
      reconstruction involves surgical transfer of a non-paralyzed tendon or nerve with a redundant&#xD;
      or less important function to perform a more critical function. Upper limb reconstruction is&#xD;
      intended to help individuals achieve their goals related to activities of daily living and&#xD;
      independence in the community. Outcomes after reconstruction are variable and depend largely&#xD;
      on the efficacy of motor re-education of the transferred muscle to perform a new function.&#xD;
      The long-term goal of our research is to determine whether iTBS combined with physical&#xD;
      rehabilitation can improve motor re-education after reconstruction. As a first step, the&#xD;
      purpose of this proposal is to determine the effect of iTBS on corticomotor excitability of&#xD;
      proximal muscles in nonimpaired individuals and two groups of individuals with tetraplegia:&#xD;
      individuals with and without upper limb reconstruction.&#xD;

    <description>Neurologically normal subjects (i.e., nonimpaired) will be recruited for participation in three sessions of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS), each consisting of sham iTBS applied to the hotspot of the target muscle and active iTBS; sham iTBS always be will administered first to minimize the potential for carry over effects. Sessions will be separated by at least 3 days to minimize the potential for carry over effects. Before and 10, 20 and 30 minutes after each iTBS session, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) will be recorded in order to quantify changes in corticomotor excitability.</description>
