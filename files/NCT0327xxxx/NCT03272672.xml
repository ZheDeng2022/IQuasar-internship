  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of a valgus unloader brace condition on&#xD;
      the acute change in medial femoral condyle cartilage morphology using Ultrasound following a&#xD;
      standardized walking protocol.&#xD;

      Participants will report to an initial screening session during which knee alignment will be&#xD;
      determined using a long-lever goniometer. For the assessment of baseline knee alignment, the&#xD;
      participant will stand with feet facing forward directly underneath corresponding acromion&#xD;
      processes and weight evenly distributed. The first axis will be measured from ASIS to&#xD;
      midpoint of the patella and the second axis will be measured from the midpoint of the patella&#xD;
      to the tibial tuberosity. The valgus angle will be used to determine eligibility for the&#xD;
      study. To be eligible for this study, participants must present with a valgus knee alignment&#xD;
      angle of ≥180° on the dominant limb defined as the limb the participant would use to kick a&#xD;
      ball. Weight and height measurements will also be measured and used to calculate BMI. Once&#xD;
      eligible, participants will determine a self-selected walking speed by walking between 2 sets&#xD;
      of infrared timing gates (TF100, TracTronix). Starting approximately 5 steps before the first&#xD;
      timing gate, participants will be instructed to walk at a speed described as &quot;comfortable&#xD;
      walking over a sidewalk&quot;. Each participant will complete 3 trials and the average walking&#xD;
      speed will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-loading Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will report to the laboratory at the same time of day (±2 hours) for both&#xD;
      sessions to account for diurnal variations within the cartilage. Upon arrival, participants&#xD;
      will sit on a treatment table in the long-sit position with knees fully extended for 45 mins&#xD;
      to allow time for cartilage reformation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasonographic Assessment of the Femoral Articular Cartilage While seated with their back&#xD;
      up against the wall, participants will flex their knee to 140° measured using a manual&#xD;
      goniometer while. A measuring tape will be secured to the length of the table so that the&#xD;
      position of the posterior calcaneus can be recorded to allow for consistent positioning&#xD;
      across trials 15. A LOGIQe US system (General Electric Co., Fairfield, CT) with a 12MHz&#xD;
      linear probe will be used to image both the medial and lateral femoral cartilage. The probe&#xD;
      will be placed transversely in line between the medial and lateral femoral condyles just&#xD;
      superior to the patella and rotated to maximize reflection off the articular cartilage. A&#xD;
      transparent grid will be placed over the US screen to improve reproducibility of the US&#xD;
      image. The midpoint of the intercondylar groove will be aligned with the center of the grid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of the cartilage-bone interface at the edge of the image on either side will be&#xD;
      recorded in order to ensure consistent positioning across US assessments. Three images will&#xD;
      be collected of each knee at each time point. Following each loading condition, the&#xD;
      participant will be placed in the same position as the pre-loading US assessment using the&#xD;
      tape measure. Three images of the femoral cartilage will be recorded from each knee. All&#xD;
      post-walking images will be captured within 5 minutes of the loading protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasonographic Image Analysis All US images will be analyzed with the ImageJ software&#xD;
      (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Values for all measurement types will be&#xD;
      obtained for each of the three images of the dominant limb at each time point (pre and&#xD;
      post-walking) and averaged for statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cartilage Thickness&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cartilage thickness (in millimeters) will be determined at the most inferior point of the&#xD;
      intercondylar groove, the midpoint of the medial condyle, and the midpoint of the lateral&#xD;
      condyle by drawing a line from the cartilage-bone interface to the synovial space-cartilage&#xD;
      interface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cartilage Area The femoral cartilage will be divided into medial and lateral sections by&#xD;
      identifying the midline at the most inferior point of the intercondylar groove. Each section&#xD;
      of the cartilage will be outlined with a polygon function (Figure 1). The area (in square&#xD;
      millimeters) of each section will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Average Cartilage Thickness The area (in square millimeters) of each section as determined in&#xD;
      the cartilage area measure will then be divided by the length (in millimeters) of the section&#xD;
      measured via a segmented line along the cartilage-bone interface (Figure 2). Average&#xD;
      cartilage thickness (in millimeters) measures will be determined for the medial and lateral&#xD;
      condyles. Values will be obtained for each of the three images per limb at each time point&#xD;
      (pre and post-walking) and averaged for statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cartilage Loading Protocol Immediately following pre-test ultrasound assessments,&#xD;
      participants will be transferred from the table to a wheelchair in order to minimize knee&#xD;
      loading not related to the walking condition. During the braced walking condition, a valgus&#xD;
      unloader brace (Össür Unloader One®, Össur Americas, Orange County, CA) will be fitted by a&#xD;
      certified athletic trainer per manufacturer instructions to the dominant limb while the&#xD;
      participant is seated with knee flexed to approximately 80°.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The brace will be maximally adjusted to unload the medial compartment. The participant will&#xD;
      take 30 steps to adjust to the brace. Adjustments will then be made as needed if the&#xD;
      participant determines the fit is uncomfortable or too loose. The participant will take 30&#xD;
      more steps. Any final adjustments can be made at that point. The participant will then be&#xD;
      transferred to and from the treadmill via wheelchair to control the amount of cartilage&#xD;
      loading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Protocol In the unbraced condition, the participant will repeat the brace protocol&#xD;
      except that the participant will not be fitted with an unloader brace while seated. The&#xD;
      participant will take 60 steps to keep the number of steps consistent across trials before&#xD;
      being transferred to the treadmill. The participant will remain unbraced for the entire&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Loading Protocol Participants will maintain the self-selected walking speed for 5000 steps on&#xD;
      a treadmill (4Front, WOODWAY, Waukesha, WI). Self-selected speed will be kept the same across&#xD;
      both conditions. Participant will walk for 1 minute to adjust to treadmill. Steps will then&#xD;
      be counted for 1 minute, and the time necessary to complete 5000 steps will be calculated&#xD;
      (5000 divided by number of steps per minute).&#xD;
