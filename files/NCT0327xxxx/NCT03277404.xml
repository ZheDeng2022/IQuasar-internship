      This study evaluated the effect of removal of smear layer on the success of primary root&#xD;
      canal treatment.Patients requiring primary root canal treatment in mature mandibular first&#xD;
      and second molars were allocated to either smear layer positive group and smear layer&#xD;
      negative group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients requiring primary root canal treatment following the diagnosis of pulp necrosis in&#xD;
      permanent mandibular first and second molars having radiographic evidence of periapical&#xD;
      radiolucency (minimum size ≥ 2.0 × 2.0 mm) were included in the study. All patients were over&#xD;
      18 years of age and diagnosis of pulpal necrosis was confirmed by negative response to cold&#xD;
      and electrical tests, and absence of bleeding on entering the pulp chamber. Patients with&#xD;
      systemic illness, history of analgesic intake within past 7 days, antibiotics in the last&#xD;
      3months and patients who were pregnant were excluded from the study. Periodontally&#xD;
      compromised teeth, previously accessed teeth, teeth that were not suitable for rubber dam&#xD;
      isolation were also excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were allocated to one of the two study groups: smear layer positive group (only&#xD;
      2.5%NaOCl was used) - SP and smear layer negative group (17% EDTA+2.5%NaOCl was used) - SN.&#xD;
      Using an equal proportion randomization allocation ratio, patients were assigned to the two&#xD;
      groups using envelopes containing concealed assignment codes. It was ensured that neither the&#xD;
      patient, nor the primary investigator was aware of the group till the time of final rinse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After administration of local anesthesia, rubber dam isolation of the involved tooth was&#xD;
      done. Caries was excavated and access cavity prepared using carbide burs in high speed&#xD;
      handpiece with copious irrigation.Debridement of the pulp chamber was done and all canal&#xD;
      orifices identified.Working length was obtained with the help of electronic apex locator and&#xD;
      confirmed radiographically.Hand files number 10, 15 and 20 were used till working length (WL)&#xD;
      to prepare a smooth reproducible glide path.Canal preparation was done with the help of&#xD;
      rotary NiTi files. In both groups, 2.5% sodium hypochlorite was used as irrigant after each&#xD;
      instrument. All the irrigation procedures were performed using a 27 gauge side vented needle.&#xD;
      After root canal instrumentation, 17% Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution was&#xD;
      also used to remove smear layer in smear layer negative group, while teeth in smear layer&#xD;
      positive group was simply rinsed with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite. In both the groups ultrasonic&#xD;
      activation of irrigant was done. An inter-appointment dressing of calcium hydroxide was&#xD;
      given. The access cavity was then restored with intermediate restorative material (Dental&#xD;
      Products of India).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were prescribed Ibuprofen 400mg with the instructions to take one tablet every 8&#xD;
      hours in the event of pain.Patients were asked to record the severity of pain using 10 cm VAS&#xD;
      scale with 0 depicting no pain and 10 depicting maximum pain imaginable. Patients were asked&#xD;
      to make a mark on the line that represented their level of perceived pain every 24hrs for 7&#xD;
      days following intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One week later, patients returned with the completed questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same appointment the intracanal dressing was removed with H-files and copious&#xD;
      irrigation with 2.5% NaOCl in both the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      17% EDTA solution was used to remove smear layer in smear layer negative group, followed by&#xD;
      2.5% NaOCl while teeth in smear layer positive group were simply rinsed with 2.5% sodium&#xD;
      hypochlorite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasonic activation of irrigant was done and canals were obturated with the GuttaPercha and&#xD;
      Zinc Oxide-Eugenol based sealer in both the groups. After obturation, the cavity was restored&#xD;
      permanently.Immediate post-operative radiograph was then taken using preset exposure&#xD;
      parameters.Follow up clinical and radiographic examination was carried out every 3 months,&#xD;
      till a 12 month period. The data gathered was analyzed using suitable statistical methods.&#xD;
