    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well gadolinium and ferumoxytol magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) work in diagnosing patients with abnormalities in the central nervous system.&#xD;
      Diagnostic procedures, such as gadolinium and ferumoxytol MRI, may help find and diagnose&#xD;
      abnormalities in the central nervous system.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To test if prior gadolinium administration affects vascular imaging using ferumoxytol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To test signal changes of T2*w multi-echo fast field echo (mFFE) scans before and after&#xD;
      contrast agent injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To test if ferumoxytol affects gadolinium enhanced MRI. II. To test if steady state&#xD;
      cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps are different at various magnetic field strengths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore late ferumoxytol enhancement (optional MRI) hours to days after ferumoxytol&#xD;
      administration in various pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the effects of ferumoxytol on malignant and non-malignant lesions in head &amp;&#xD;
      neck, and liver lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients receive gadolinium intravenously (IV) and then ferumoxytol IV and undergo&#xD;
      MRI over 60 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients receive ferumoxytol IV and then gadolinium IV and undergo MRI over 60&#xD;
      minutes on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 and 6 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Will assess the confidence in identifying the lesion corresponding areas on CBV maps as well as signal change (deltaR2*) and relative cerebral blood volume.
