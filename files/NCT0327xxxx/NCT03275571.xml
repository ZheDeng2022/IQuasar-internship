  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among people with HIV, the severity of depressive symptoms has repeatedly been associated&#xD;
      with the presence of self-reported cognitive difficulties, even in the absence of impairment&#xD;
      on neuropsychological testing. There is uncertainty about the clinical importance of these&#xD;
      self-reports, especially when neuropsychological testing is normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is growing evidence that these self-reports are clinically important. For&#xD;
      example, among patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), evidence suggests that&#xD;
      functional impairments is mediated by self-reported cognitive dysfunction, rather than&#xD;
      objective cognitive dysfunction. Treatment of depression with Cognitive-Behaviour Therapy&#xD;
      (CBT) has been shown to improve depressive symptoms and psychosocial functioning in patients&#xD;
      with recurrent major depressive disorder, but there are few studies of the impact of&#xD;
      psychotherapy on self-reported cognition and cognitive performance. Good Days Ahead (GDA) is&#xD;
      a computerized treatment program developed to address symptoms of depression and anxiety. It&#xD;
      teaches the basic principles of computerized behavioral therapy (CBT) in nine therapy&#xD;
      sessions, each typically taking 30 minutes to complete. GDA has been found to be as effective&#xD;
      as face-to-face CBT in decreasing symptoms of depression and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that people whose depressive symptoms are reduced following treatment with&#xD;
      cCBT will also report fewer cognitive difficulties than before treatment. A second hypothesis&#xD;
      is that changes in self-reported cognition will be concordant with changes in cognitive&#xD;
      performance, such that people who make no improvement in self-report cognition will also show&#xD;
      no improvement in cognitive performance and those who do improve on self-report will improve&#xD;
      on cognitive performance.&#xD;

      Among people with HIV, the severity of depressive symptoms has repeatedly been associated&#xD;
      with the presence of self-reported cognitive difficulties, even in the absence of impairment&#xD;
      on neuropsychological testing. There is uncertainty about the clinical importance of these&#xD;
      self-reports, especially when neuropsychological testing is normal, as they are thought to be&#xD;
      susceptible to patients' biases and insights into their illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is growing evidence that these self-reports are clinically important. Among&#xD;
      patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), evidence suggests that functional impairments&#xD;
      is mediated by self-reported cognitive dysfunction, rather than objective cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction. For example, Buist-Bouwman et al reported that more than one-quarter of the&#xD;
      impact of MDD on work loss was directly attributable to self-reported cognitive difficulties&#xD;
      and that cognition was a significant mediator of the association between MDD and work or role&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When depression is treated with antidepressant medication, some degree of improvement on&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests has been documented. However, many studies have evaluated cognitive&#xD;
      outcomes before and after treatment rather than comparing them with placebo, potentially&#xD;
      biasing the results by learning effects, which limits the strength of the conclusions that&#xD;
      can be drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of depression with Cognitive-Behaviour Therapy (CBT) has been shown to improve&#xD;
      depressive symptoms and psychosocial functioning in patients with recurrent major depressive&#xD;
      disorder, but there are few studies of the impact of psychotherapy on self-reported cognition&#xD;
      and cognitive performance. In a group of patients with highly recurrent depression (â‰¥4&#xD;
      episodes) over 2 years of follow-up, Conradi et al showed that those randomized to receive&#xD;
      psycho-education plus CBT reported the presence of cognitive symptoms significantly less of&#xD;
      the time compared to those receiving psycho-education only (15% of the time or 3.6 months&#xD;
      compared to 47% or 11.3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the HIV population, a single study has examined the effect of treatment of depression on&#xD;
      self-reported cognitive difficulties and performance on neuropsychological tests, as part of&#xD;
      a randomized controlled trial of antidepressant efficacy. Following 12 weeks of&#xD;
      antidepressant treatment, HIV+ individuals who reported a decrease in depressive symptoms&#xD;
      also reported significantly fewer cognitive difficulties, despite an absence of improvement&#xD;
      on neuropsychological testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context where the use of questionnaires eliciting cognitive difficulties is suggested&#xD;
      as a first-line screening for HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder, it is important to&#xD;
      document the clinical factors that influence these self-reports in order to inform their&#xD;
      clinical interpretation and develop interventions for individuals reporting cognitive&#xD;
      difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding and Optimizing Brain Health Now (BHN) cohort study: Cohort participants (N=840)&#xD;
      are studied prospectively over a 27-month period with visits every 9 months. Patients&#xD;
      complete questionnaires on mood (Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale-HADS), presence of&#xD;
      cognitive symptoms (Patient Deficit Questionnaire-PDQ), and a computer-based evaluation of&#xD;
      cognitive ability (B-CAM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computerized Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (cCBT): A number of computerized treatment programs&#xD;
      have been developed to address symptoms of depression and anxiety, and several meta-analyses&#xD;
      of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown evidence for their effectiveness. One such&#xD;
      program, Good Days Ahead, teaches the basic principles of CBT in nine therapy sessions, each&#xD;
      typically taking 30 minutes to complete. Good Days Ahead has been found to be as effective as&#xD;
      face-to-face CBT in decreasing symptoms of depression and anxiety. Patients receiving&#xD;
      treatment delivered by a computer can be provided with different levels of guidance and&#xD;
      support: self-guidance, guidance by a technician who sends reminders, or guidance by a&#xD;
      clinician. A recent meta-analysis of cCBT for depression and anxiety has shown that the&#xD;
      treatment delivered with no guidance or support yielded, on average, a smaller effect size&#xD;
      (Cohen's d = 0.17) than cCBT delivered with at least one hour of knowledgeable assistance&#xD;
      during the course of therapy (Cohen's d = 0.72). Offering some assistance thus appears to be&#xD;
      necessary for achieving better therapy outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design : This study is part of a larger project based upon a cohort multiple randomized&#xD;
      controlled design. Within a fully characterized cohort followed over time (n=840), people&#xD;
      meeting the specific criteria for one or more interventions (here cCBT) are identified and a&#xD;
      sample is randomly selected to receive the intervention. When the intervention is under&#xD;
      investigation, the remaining eligible persons who do not receive the intervention serve as&#xD;
      controls. In this study, we are not testing the effectiveness of cCBT as this has been&#xD;
      demonstrated. Rather the researchers are focusing on changes in cognition in relation to&#xD;
      depressive symptoms mediated by cCBT. This study is an exploration of a hypothesis using a&#xD;
      single cohort design with two repeated measures. For exploratory studies, an N of 30&#xD;
      optimizes an analysis based on means under the central limit theorem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Participants who are eligible will receive online access to the Good Days Ahead&#xD;
      cCBT program. Good Days Ahead is a learning module based on scientifically proven,&#xD;
      evidence-based techniques. The program's content follows the teachings of the basic&#xD;
      principles of CBT. The underlying platform generates customized learning experiences for each&#xD;
      individual user with content including videos, text, quizzes and interactive exercises. The&#xD;
      program comprises nine lessons of 30 minute each during which the user first learns the key&#xD;
      concepts; then applies them to the program's main character who suffers from depression; and&#xD;
      then applies those techniques to their own personal challenges&#xD;
      (http://www.empower-interactive.com/solutions/good-days-ahead). Participants are expected to&#xD;
      complete the nine sessions over 9-12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As patients complete the cCBT program, their progress will be monitored by the research&#xD;
      coordinator through a secure web site, using the program's dashboard feature that includes&#xD;
      tracking of mood ratings, exercises, comprehension and completion rates. Participants will&#xD;
      receive guidance during regular contacts by a trained research coordinator knowledgeable&#xD;
      about the program and the basics of CBT.&#xD;
