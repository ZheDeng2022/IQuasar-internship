  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nutrition support is critical to a vast number of patients who are hospitalized annually&#xD;
      because of critical illnesses or surgery. It is also necessary for patients with chronic&#xD;
      intestinal failure (CIF), who often require parenteral nutrition over periods of weeks or&#xD;
      months. While scoring systems that assess nutritional risks in patients exist, there are no&#xD;
      guidelines for continuous nutritional monitoring during supplementation and parenteral&#xD;
      feeding. Previous studies have hinted that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) may serve as&#xD;
      a biomarker for nutritional support efficiency; however, such studies were not statistically&#xD;
      definitive. Therefore, the investigators aimed to assess IGF-1 as a biomarker for both&#xD;
      diagnosing nutritional risk and malnutrition and for monitoring the efficiency of nutritional&#xD;
      support, particularly compared to other biomarkers such as BMI as well as albumin,&#xD;
      prealbumin, transferrin, and retinol-binding protein.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic intestinal failure (CIF) is one of the rarest of organ failures all over the world,&#xD;
      mainly caused by severe gastrointestinal or systemic benign diseases such as intestinal&#xD;
      ﬁstula, short bowel, and mechanical obstruction. Moreover, patients with end-stage&#xD;
      intra-abdominal or pelvic cancer can also develop into CIF. CIF is deﬁned as gut function&#xD;
      that is below the minimum necessary for the absorption of macronutrients and/or water and&#xD;
      electrolytes; in such cases, nutrition support, especially for parenteral nutrition, is&#xD;
      indispensable to maintain health and recovery for CIF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutrition support has successfully saved the lives of thousands of patients with CIF, as well&#xD;
      as those who have critical illnesses or underwent surgery. According to the guidelines,&#xD;
      patients with CIF require parenteral nutrition over periods of weeks or months and the&#xD;
      efficiency of nutrition support will influence the prognoses directly . The exact nutritional&#xD;
      assessment and close nutritional monitoring are key points to optimize nutritional therapy.&#xD;
      Firstly, the recommended scoring systems such as the Nutritional Risk Screening 2002&#xD;
      (NRS-2002) score or the 'nutrition risk in the critically ill' (NUTRIC) score can identify&#xD;
      patients who are at nutritional risk and who would benefit from nutritional support.&#xD;
      Secondly, nutritional support regimens should be individualized and adjusted over time based&#xD;
      on continuous monitoring; however, there are no guidelines regarding such nutritional&#xD;
      monitoring. The NRS-2002 and NUTRIC scores are recommended as initial nutritional assessment&#xD;
      indices, but are inappropriate for continuous evaluation. Moreover, validated biomarkers that&#xD;
      can be used for monitoring short-term nutritional status changes were still unclear.&#xD;
      Nowadays, common serum protein markers such like albumin, prealbumin, transferrin, and&#xD;
      retinol-binding protein (RBP) are used to monitor the efficiency of nutritional support in&#xD;
      clinical practice [5, 8]. However, all these biomarkers failed to reflect changes of&#xD;
      nutritional status with sufficient sensitivity in CIF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is an IGF family member that consists of 70 amino acid&#xD;
      residues. IGF-I was first reported as a nutritional marker in 1973 because its serum&#xD;
      concentrations are reduced during malnutrition; its serum levels also proved to be affected&#xD;
      by protein or/and energy deficiency. Several previous studies reported that IGF-1 is a more&#xD;
      sensitive and speciﬁc indicator of nutritional status than prealbumin, transferrin, or RBP&#xD;
      because of its shorter serum half-life and more accurate response to nutritional intake;&#xD;
      however, these studies had small cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In present study, the investigators compared IGF-1 to traditional serum biomarkers in terms&#xD;
      of diagnosing nutritional risk and malnutrition, as well as in monitoring the efficiency of&#xD;
      nutrition support in CIF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigators conducted a retrospective study of patients treated at a single clinical&#xD;
      nutrition center of a tertiary referral hospital in China to investigate whether the&#xD;
      measurement of IGF-1 is useful for monitoring the efficiency of nutritional support and to&#xD;
      explore the relationship between IGF-1 and lean body mass in CIF patients. The influence of&#xD;
      IGF-1 was also explored in this study. The data used were accumulated at the center between&#xD;
      September 2013 and January 2017. All adult CIF patients (age ≥18 years) receiving nutrition&#xD;
      support were included. The exclusion criteria were hepatic insufficiency (alanine&#xD;
      transaminase/aspartate transaminase ratio 200% above normal range or bilirubin &gt;3 mg/dL),&#xD;
      renal insufficiency (serum creatinine [Scr] &gt;1.5 mg/dL), acute or life-threatening diseases&#xD;
      (e.g., shock, collapse, stroke, coma of unknown etiology, or recent cardiac infarction), and&#xD;
      pregnant or breast-feeding women. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Jinling&#xD;
      Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malnutrition was defined as weight loss &gt;10% within 6 months, a body mass index (BMI) &lt;18.5,&#xD;
      a subjective global assessment (SGA) score of stage C, or albumin level &lt;30 g/L. Serum IGF-1,&#xD;
      albumin, pre-albumin, transferrin, RBP, creatinine, and hemoglobin were measured weekly in&#xD;
      patients receiving nutrition support after hospital admission. The resting energy&#xD;
      expenditure, predicted weekly by indirect calorimetry (Quark PFT ERGO , COSMED Srl - Italy),&#xD;
      was used to guide energy delivery. The target dose of protein intake was 1.2 g/kg/day, which&#xD;
      was adjusted according to the level of serum albumin. Patients were also subjected to strict&#xD;
      fluid intake management. The nutritional support schemes were recorded daily, and the body&#xD;
      composition was also measured weekly to estimate nutrition status (Inbody S10, Biospace).&#xD;
