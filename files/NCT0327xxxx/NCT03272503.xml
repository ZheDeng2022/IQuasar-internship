      This study will look at whether Pimozide may help to slow the progression of Amyotrophic&#xD;
      Lateral Sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 people from several Canadian centres with ALS who have provided their consent will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned into one of 2 groups. The first group will receive a dose of up to 2mg of&#xD;
      Pimozide per day and the second group will receive placebo (lactose tablets). Subjects will&#xD;
      be assigned randomly (like by a flip of a coin) to receive either Pimozide 2 mg per day or&#xD;
      placebo tablets. There will be a fifty-fifty chance of receiving Pimozide or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be on study medication up to 22 weeks, and on study up to 26 weeks. There&#xD;
      are 8 clinic visits and 1 phone visit over the course of the Treatment Phase of the study.&#xD;
      The second phase which is Observational, is optional with follow-up for up to 5 years from&#xD;
      the end of the Treatment Phase.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig's disease is a neuromuscular disease that&#xD;
      results in rapid decline in normal muscle function and tone leading to difficulties with&#xD;
      mobility, eating, drinking, breathing, sleeping, and communicating. The disease is&#xD;
      progressive and no cure currently exists. Most people diagnosed with ALS succumb within 3 to&#xD;
      5 years. Rilutek® (riluzole) has been approved as a treatment to slow progression of ALS, but&#xD;
      is minimally effective with mean increase in survival of only a few months. Radicava® or&#xD;
      Radicut® (edaravone) has recently been approved in Canada, USA, Japan and South Korea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscular dysfunction present in people with ALS is caused by nerve breakdown and a&#xD;
      dysfunction in the communication between the muscles and the nerves. The area where these&#xD;
      communications occur is called the neuromuscular junction. Some recent studies have focused&#xD;
      on using different medications to enhance communication at the neuromuscular junction with&#xD;
      the goal of improving muscle function as a result. This approach is unproven but may help to&#xD;
      slow the progression of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pimozide is a medication that has been demonstrated to enhance communication at the&#xD;
      neuromuscular junction in fish and mice. This study will look at whether Pimozide may help to&#xD;
      slow the progression of ALS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two parts to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Phase: In the first part of this study, 100 people from several Canadian centres&#xD;
      with ALS who have provided their consent will be randomly assigned into one of 2 groups. The&#xD;
      first group will receive a dose of up to 2mg of Pimozide per day and the second group will&#xD;
      receive placebo (lactose tablets). Subjects will be assigned randomly (like by a flip of a&#xD;
      coin) to receive either Pimozide 2 mg per day or placebo tablets. There will be a fifty-fifty&#xD;
      chance of receiving Pimozide or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each Pimozide tablet contains 2 mg of Pimozide. The matching placebo tablets for this study&#xD;
      will look exactly like the Pimozide tablets. Placebos are used in clinical trials to find out&#xD;
      if the results observed in the study are due the drug being tested, or for other reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither the subject nor their doctor will know which group a patient belongs to. However, if&#xD;
      an emergency should arise, information about a treatment group will be shared with their&#xD;
      doctor to ensure appropriate medical care. Participants will take their treatment once a day,&#xD;
      every day for about 22 weeks. The total time in the study from the screen visit up until the&#xD;
      last phone call communication is about 26 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational Phase: The second part of this study is optional. It is each subject's decision&#xD;
      whether to participate only in the first part of this study, or in both parts of the study,&#xD;
      or not at all. In the second part of this study, the Canadian Neuromuscular Disease Registry&#xD;
      (CNDR) will collect data on overall ALS progression using the Revised ALS Functional Rating&#xD;
      Scale (ALSFRS-R) and breathing using Vital Capacity data collected during breathing tests.&#xD;
      This information will be collected from a subject medical record following each routine&#xD;
      clinical appointment. Data will be collected at each routine clinic visit for up to 5 years&#xD;
      from the end of the first part of the study. There will be no extra visits for this part of&#xD;
      the study beyond routine ALS clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information collected during this part of the study will be used to compare the&#xD;
      progression of ALS, after the clinical trial is completed, among the two treatment types&#xD;
      (Placebo or 2 mg per day). By analyzing this information, the researchers conducting this&#xD;
      study hope to determine if Pimozide may help to slow the progression of ALS. To participate&#xD;
      in this part of the study consent must be provided to join the CNDR. A subject who hasn't&#xD;
      already provided their CNDR consent, and wishes to participate in this part of the study will&#xD;
      be given a CNDR consent form to review and sign in addition to this consent form. A subject&#xD;
      already participating in the CNDR will just need to sign the main study consent form.&#xD;
