    <textblock>
      Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is a major risk factor in coronary artery disease (CAD)&#xD;
      and patient undergoing revascularization with this combination , incidence of RV dysfunction&#xD;
      is reported in about 20% cases of CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RV dysfunction is a possible cause of cardiac failure after cardiac surgery and has a high&#xD;
      mortality rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RV dysfunction is a recognized cause of hypotension early after coronary artery bypass graft&#xD;
      surgery (CABG)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A decrease in RV function is an event known to occur after CABG. Right ventricular&#xD;
      dysfunction can be seen during and immediately after cardiac surgery. Although the mechanism&#xD;
      of this phenomenon is not well understood, cardiopulmonary bypass, perioperative myocardial&#xD;
      ischemia, intraoperative myocardial damage, cardioplegia, and pericardial disruption or&#xD;
      adhesion have been suggested as probable causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major reasons for complications of cardiac surgery are the need for hypothermic cardiac&#xD;
      arrest, aortic cross clamping, and exposure to a cardiopulmonary bypass circuit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been postulated that avoidance of these factors by performing off-pump coronary artery&#xD;
      bypass (OPCAB) surgery might reduce perioperative morbidity and improve outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the portion of coronary artery bypass grafting on the beating heart without the use&#xD;
      of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has been expanded in cardiac surgery as a result of awareness&#xD;
      of the damaging effect of CPB&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether OPCAB surgery can fulfill these expectations, or to which degree, is yet unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few studies on hemodynamic alternations associated with OPCAB reported that reduced&#xD;
      functions of both ventricles during coronary artery anastomosis are the main mechanism of&#xD;
      hemodynamic derangements and especially, impaired diastolic function of the right ventricle&#xD;
      (RV) plays an important role&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, clinical studies evaluating the change in RV function in patients with ischemic&#xD;
      heart disease are very rare. It is reported that the major cause of hemodynamic changes&#xD;
      during OPCAB was disturbed diastolic filling of the RV through the measurement of chamber&#xD;
      pressures or monitoring of echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There was no significant change in the RVEF and cardiac index during anastomosis of the left&#xD;
      anterior descending artery and right coronary artery. However, the significantly reduced RVEF&#xD;
      accompanied by an increase in RV afterload and decrease in the CO was observed during&#xD;
      anastomosis of the obtuse marginal (OM) artery. RV volumes did not significantly change&#xD;
      during anastomoses, though the right atrial pressure increased during anastomoses of all&#xD;
      coronary arteries. The displacement of beating heart for positioning during anastomosis of&#xD;
      the graft to OM artery caused significant derangement of RV function and decrease in CO.&#xD;
