  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The chronic disease burden is increasing worldwide leading to a rise in the demand for&#xD;
      primary healthcare and a shortage of primary care physicians. Addressing this shortage&#xD;
      entails a multi-prong approach with innovations in care delivery, greater use of healthcare&#xD;
      technology, and more efficient use of all healthcare providers on the care team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We previously developed an interactive self-service healthcare kiosk (Self-empowering and&#xD;
      enabling kiosk - SEEK® MyHealthKiosk) for the management of patients with stable chronic&#xD;
      disease in the primary care setting. A feasibility study using SEEK showed high levels of&#xD;
      acceptance and satisfaction from patients and healthcare providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this follow-up study is to evaluate the health outcomes of patients with stable&#xD;
      chronic disease who are on kiosk management compared to patients who are on routine&#xD;
      management by nurse clinicians. We hypothesize that patients who are managed by the kiosk&#xD;
      continue to maintain good disease control that are comparable to patients who are managed by&#xD;
      a nurse clinician.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who seek primary healthcare vary in their time and resource requirements. Patients&#xD;
      with acute medical conditions or poorly controlled chronic disease typically require more&#xD;
      time and attention compared to patients with stable chronic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with chronic disease routinely make follow-up visits to their primary care provider&#xD;
      for assessment of their chronic disease status and for changes to their medications as&#xD;
      necessary. Patients with well-controlled stable chronic disease may go through several visits&#xD;
      to their primary care provider in 3 or 4-monthly intervals with little or no change to their&#xD;
      medication regimen. These patients have to wait in line with the rest of the patient crowd&#xD;
      for a doctor's consultation before getting their regular supply of medications. We hence saw&#xD;
      the potential of replacing some of these physician visits with an automated healthcare kiosk&#xD;
      so that if the disease condition of such patients remained stable, they can continue on their&#xD;
      current medications without having to see a doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We previously described the feasibility of using an automated healthcare kiosk (SEEK®&#xD;
      MyHealthKiosk) for the management of patients with stable chronic disease in the primary care&#xD;
      setting. We propose a follow-up study to show equivalence of health outcomes for patients&#xD;
      managed with SEEK compared to the current standard of care. The study will be a 2-armed&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial of 120 patients with stable chronic disease on 4-monthly&#xD;
      follow-up visits over a 12-month period. Patients will be assigned randomly to intervention&#xD;
      or control groups to receive kiosk or nurse management respectively. The main primary outcome&#xD;
      measure is the overall chronic disease control of the patients. Other primary outcome&#xD;
      measures are the blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels for patients&#xD;
      without diabetes; and blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and hemoglobin A1c&#xD;
      levels for patients with diabetes. Secondary outcome measures are visit duration, patient&#xD;
      satisfaction with the management process, health-related quality of life, and the occurrence&#xD;
      of any adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential benefits from the use of SEEK are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Appropriate stratification of patient care needs so that more time and resources can be&#xD;
           channeled to patients with complex or acute needs;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient empowerment in the management of their chronic health conditions, with&#xD;
           flexibility of self-care and monitoring and decreased dependency on healthcare&#xD;
           providers;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Substitution of nurse clinicians for the management of stable chronic disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Reduction in the number of doctor visits per year for patients with stable chronic&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
