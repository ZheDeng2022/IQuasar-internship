  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with a neuroblastoma diagnose and central nervous system (CNS)/leptomeningeal&#xD;
      metastases will be given up to 2 rounds of intracerebroventricular treatment with a&#xD;
      radiolabelled monoclonal antibody, 131I-omburtamab to evaluate efficacy and safety&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One 131I-omburtamab treatment cycle takes 4 weeks and includes a treatment dose, and an&#xD;
      observation period and post-treatment evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One 131I-omburtamab treatment cycle for Japan only takes 5 weeks and includes a dosimetry&#xD;
      dose (2mCi) of 131I-omburtamab is administered during week 1 followed by blood/cerebral&#xD;
      spinal fluid (CSF) samples and whole-body scintigraphy at predefined intervals during the&#xD;
      following 48 hours after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A therapeutic dose (50mCi) of 131I-omburtamab is administered during week 1 (week 2 for&#xD;
           Japan) followed by a 3-week observation period that includes a repeated MRI, CSF&#xD;
           cytology, and safety monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A second treatment cycle of 131I-omburtamab is administered during week 5 (week 6 for&#xD;
           Japan) if there is no objective disease progression week 5 after the first injection,&#xD;
           and the participant is presenting without unexpected and clinical significant Grade 4&#xD;
           toxicity. For participants with ongoing Grade 3 toxicity a second doing cycle will take&#xD;
           place according to the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can be treated in an outpatient setting or may be admitted as inpatients for&#xD;
      both the dosimetry and the therapeutic injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants completing at least one treatment period will first enter a follow-up period&#xD;
      through week 26 and thereafter the long-term follow-up where patients will be evaluated for&#xD;
      up to 3 years post-131I-omburtamab treatment where after the trial is ended&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be monitored for adverse events during and after 131I-omburtamab injection&#xD;
      and will have pre- and post-treatment clinical assessments including neurologic examination,&#xD;
      hematology and serum chemistry, blood and CSF cultures, endocrinology assessments, CSF&#xD;
      analysis, and, pre- and post 131I-omburtamab performance testing. Performance testing will be&#xD;
      performed at trial baseline, at week 26 and every 6 months during trial period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case the patient has a subsequent relapse in the CNS/LM after 131I-omburtamab therapy&#xD;
      during the follow-up period, re-treatment to target minimal residual disease can be&#xD;
      considered and allowed.&#xD;
