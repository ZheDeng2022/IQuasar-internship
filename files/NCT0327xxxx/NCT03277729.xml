    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to find the best dose of genetically modified T-cells, to&#xD;
      study the safety of this treatment, and to see how well it works in treating patients with B&#xD;
      cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) or did not respond to previous&#xD;
      treatment (refractory).&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase I/II dose-escalation study of CD20-specific CAR T cell therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo leukapheresis and may receive treatment after if needed for disease control.&#xD;
      Patients then receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV). Patients may also receive&#xD;
      fludarabine IV. After 36-96 hours, patients receive CD20-specific CAR T cell infusion IV over&#xD;
      20-30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be actively participating in the study for approximately 15 months. The total&#xD;
      time includes the time for the T cells to be made, the T cell infusion, and for approximately&#xD;
      12 months after the T cell infusion is given. After completion of study treatment, patients&#xD;
      are followed up for a minimum of 15 years.&#xD;
