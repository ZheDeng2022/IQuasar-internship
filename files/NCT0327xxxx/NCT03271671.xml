  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory failure (ARF) is a life-threatening emergency which occurs due to impaired&#xD;
      gas exchange. In the US, the number of hospitalisations owing to acute respiratory failure&#xD;
      was 1,917,910 in the year 2009.(1) The incidence of ARF requiring hospitalization was 137.1&#xD;
      per 100,000 population.(2) In ARF due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and&#xD;
      cardiogenic pulmonary edema, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has been shown to be beneficial.&#xD;
      NIV also has several advantages over invasive mechanical ventilation. These include,&#xD;
      avoidance of endotracheal intubation and its attendant complications like airway injury,&#xD;
      nosocomial infections, and possibly shorter duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay.(3, 4)&#xD;
      The success of NIV depends on several factors like the etiology of the respiratory failure,&#xD;
      careful monitoring by the treating physician, and also adequate cooperation of patient.&#xD;
      Better synchrony of the patient's spontaneous breaths with the ventilator-delivered breaths&#xD;
      may lead to better patient cooperation and thereby, better clinical outcomes.&#xD;
      Patient-ventilator asynchrony (PVA) leads to dyspnea, increased work of breathing, and&#xD;
      prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation.(5) Pressure support ventilation (PSV) is one of&#xD;
      the commonest mode used during NIV. In a prospective multicenter observational study, severe&#xD;
      asynchrony (defined as an asynchrony index of &gt;10 %) was seen in 43% of patients of patients&#xD;
      with ARF ventilated by NIV with the conventional PSV mode.(6) Neurally adjusted ventilator&#xD;
      assist (NAVA) is new mode of ventilation which utilizes the electrical activity of the&#xD;
      diaphragm to deliver the breath.(7) During NAVA, breath is delivered when the patient's&#xD;
      diaphragm starts contracting. Further, the amount of pressure support given during the breath&#xD;
      is proportional to the strength of the electrical signal from the diaphragm. Finally, NAVA&#xD;
      also terminates the breath when the electrical activity of the diaphragm wanes. NAVA has been&#xD;
      shown to avoid over-assistance, decrease intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP),&#xD;
      and minimize wasted efforts.(8) Hence, NAVA may play a major role in improving&#xD;
      patient-ventilator synchrony.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a pooled analysis of studies comparing NAVA with PSV during NIV, it was shown that the use&#xD;
      of NAVA significantly improved patient-ventilator synchrony.(9) However, so far, no clinical&#xD;
      trial has demonstrated that this improvement in synchrony translates into better clinical&#xD;
      outcomes. In this randomized controlled clinical trial, we intend to compare the rates of NIV&#xD;
      failure and mortality between NAVA and PSV in subjects with acute respiratory failure managed&#xD;
      with NIV.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NIV is mode of ventilation wherein positive pressure ventilation is delivered by non-invasive&#xD;
      interface like nasal mask, face mask, nasal plugs or helmet avoiding invasive interface by&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation or by tracheostomy. In 1980s NIV by mask was used with success in&#xD;
      patients of obstructive sleep apnea and later on in neuromuscular respiratory failure. Use of&#xD;
      NIV has increased subsequently over next 20 years with overall first line NIV being used upto&#xD;
      23% (10) NIV is definitely useful as first line of management in COPD exacerbation,&#xD;
      cardiogenic pulmonary edema, post extubation respiratory failure and is also worth trial with&#xD;
      conflicting data in cases of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to pneumonia, ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases of acute exacerbation of COPD, NIV improves clinical outcomes.(11-13) In a&#xD;
      metaanalysis by Ram FS et al which included 14 RCT and 758 patients which showed decreased&#xD;
      mortality(11 vs 21%), intubation rate(16 vs 33%) and treatment failure(20 vs 42%)(12).&#xD;
      Similarly, there is high quality evidence supporting use in cardiogenic pulmonary edema&#xD;
      showing to improve respiratory parameters and decrease intubation rates (14-17). A&#xD;
      meta-analysis of 32 studies including 2916 patients in 2013 by Vital FM et al showed that NIV&#xD;
      reduces in hospital mortality compared to standard medical care(RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48 -&#xD;
      0.89)(14) NAVA as mode of ventilation was developed after initial landmark study &quot;neural&#xD;
      control of mechanical ventilation in respiratory failure&quot; was published in 1998 by&#xD;
      Sinderby(7). It was later on introduced on the servo-i ventilator in 2007. NAVA is a kind of&#xD;
      pressure assist ventilation using electrical activity of diaphragm and thus the neural output&#xD;
      to initiate the breath, regulate the assist level and cycle off the breath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In study by Piquilloud et al of 13 patients which compared NAVA with PSV during NIV there was&#xD;
      significant difference in asynchronies. Trigger delay (Td) was reduced with NAVA to 35 ms&#xD;
      (IQR 31-53 ms) versus 181 ms (122 - 208 ms). Also, there were no premature or delayed&#xD;
      cycling, ineffective efforts in the NAVA group. Asynchrony index (AI) with NAVA was 4.9% (2.2&#xD;
      - 10.5%) compared to 15.8% (5.5 - 49.6%) with PSV (20)In a recent meta-analysis comparing PSV&#xD;
      with NAVA during NIV by Inderpaul et al which included 9 studies with 96 subjects including&#xD;
      both adult and paediatric patients showed that asynchronies were more in PSV than in NAVA in&#xD;
      both adult and paediatric studies. The overall pooled mean difference of asynchrony index was&#xD;
      28.02(95% CI, 11.61 - 44.42). also the risk of severe asynchrony was 3.4 % times higher in&#xD;
      PSV compared to NAVA group.(9) NAVA mode of ventilation in previous studies has shown to&#xD;
      decrease asynchrony with ventilator, mainly reducing ineffective efforts, cycling delays.&#xD;
      Ineffective efforts may occur due to presence of intrinsic PEEP which in turn is more common&#xD;
      during prolonged insufflations and at high levels of assist. Ineffective efforts may also&#xD;
      occur with weak inspiratory efforts which may occur during states of high respiratory drive.&#xD;
      NAVA uses electrical activity of diaphragm to trigger a breath and there is marked difference&#xD;
      in improving synchrony with studies reporting no wasted efforts when compared to PSV mode. In&#xD;
      a study by Vignaux et al showed that during conventional NIV, 40 % of the patients experience&#xD;
      asynchrony and the rate of asynchrony correlated with leakage(6). In NAVA mode of ventilation&#xD;
      assistance is delivered based upon the neural trigger and hence is not affected by leaks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a pooled analysis of studies comparing NAVA with PSV during NIV, it was shown that the use&#xD;
      of NAVA significantly improved patient-ventilator synchrony.(9) However, so far, no clinical&#xD;
      trial has demonstrated that this improvement in synchrony translates into better clinical&#xD;
      outcomes. In this randomized controlled clinical trial, we intend to compare the rates of NIV&#xD;
      failure and mortality between NAVA and PSV in subjects with acute respiratory failure managed&#xD;
      with NIV.&#xD;
