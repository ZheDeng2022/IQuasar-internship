  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators would like to investigate whether performing ultrasound assessments in&#xD;
      patients undergoing surgery for hip fractures is able to identify previously undiagnosed&#xD;
      heart or lung conditions. The investigators would like to determine whether information&#xD;
      provided by this ultrasound assessment is significant enough to alter the anesthetic&#xD;
      management plan of these patients. This study has the potential to demonstrate that&#xD;
      ultrasound could be used as a diagnostic bedside tool in the perioperative period, possibly&#xD;
      altering standard of care for this patient population.&#xD;

      Ultrasound (US) guidance plays an important role in many commonly performed perioperative&#xD;
      anesthetic procedures, including central venous catheter (CVC) insertion and regional nerve&#xD;
      blocks[1]. The benefits of US guidance in improving patient safety and procedural efficacy&#xD;
      have been widely recognized; studies have shown that US guidance reduced the failure rates&#xD;
      and the number of attempts required for needle insertion[1, 2]. Multiple national clinical&#xD;
      practice guidelines, including those issued by the National Institute for Health and Care&#xD;
      Excellence (NICE) in the UK, and the Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society[3, 4], have&#xD;
      recommended the routine uses of US guidance for performing invasive anesthetic procedures.&#xD;
      The NICE guidelines stated that &quot;US guidance should be used in most clinical circumstances&#xD;
      where CVC insertion is necessary and that all those involved in placing CVCs using US&#xD;
      guidance should undertake appropriate training to achieve competence[3].&quot; Despite these&#xD;
      recommendations, the routine use of US guidance has not been fully adopted by&#xD;
      anesthesiologists in South Western Ontario in the past. Matava et al. conducted a survey in&#xD;
      2011 across Ontario and found that only 60% of anesthesiologists at academic hospitals and&#xD;
      33% at community hospitals use US guidance routinely for CVC insertion[5]. In addition, 56%&#xD;
      and 31% of academic and community hospital practitioners (respectively) use US guidance&#xD;
      routinely for performing regional nerve block[5]. Lack of training and perceived need were&#xD;
      identified as the major reasons why they did not routinely use US guidance, reflecting a&#xD;
      knowledge gap and deficit in training opportunity in our local region. The interests of using&#xD;
      US to provide clinical information in guiding patient management have been demonstrating&#xD;
      increasing parallels with the wide availability of US for central line insertion in various&#xD;
      settings. Specifically, ultrasound examinations have been developed for emergency medicine&#xD;
      (FAST protocol) and intensive care for managing trauma and hemodynamically unstable&#xD;
      patients[6]. The same development and application of US has also been true in anesthesia,&#xD;
      where the use of Transesophageal echocardiogram has been the standard of care for cardiac&#xD;
      surgical procedures for over a decade. The utility of ultrasound for non-cardiac surgery is&#xD;
      only just beginning to be explored for perioperative patients, especially for emergency&#xD;
      surgery or cases of unexplained hypotension, hemodynamic instability or cardiac arrest. In&#xD;
      the past few years, point of care assessment of the heart and lungs with US has become more&#xD;
      frequent among anesthesiologists. It was suggested that the uses of US in emergency&#xD;
      situations frequently changed the patients' bedside management[7]. The uses of US can also&#xD;
      assess volume status and predict hypotension after anesthesia induction. The existing&#xD;
      evidence suggests US assessment can lead to more accurate preoperative assessments; however,&#xD;
      there is lack of evidence that illustrates how US assessment specifically impacts anesthetic&#xD;
      management and patient/procedural outcomes. This information is fundamental to further expand&#xD;
      the indications of US applications from purely a procedural guidance tool to a point-of-care&#xD;
      diagnostic tool. In Canada, there are approximately 40,000 cases of hip fractures per&#xD;
      year[8]. Our institute, the London Health Sciences Centre, in London, Ontario, sees&#xD;
      approximately 400 patients a year who have experienced hip fractures and require surgery for&#xD;
      treatment. These patients are generally elderly, making this population likely to present&#xD;
      with additional comorbidities. Despite the multiple Anesthesia practice guidelines that&#xD;
      recommend using US for variety of procedures[3, 4], it is not standard of practice to be used&#xD;
      as a preoperative assessment tool for these patients undergoing surgery for hip fractures.&#xD;
      Especially considering the advanced age of these patients and potential for underlying&#xD;
      comorbidities, using US to assess these patients for cardiac and lung conditions during the&#xD;
      perioperative period has the potential to alter their anesthetic management plan if&#xD;
      previously undiagnosed conditions are discovered. Introducing the use of point-of-care US&#xD;
      assessment for these hip fracture patients has the potential to result in increased patient&#xD;
      safety and more favourable patient outcomes. The proposed project involves a prospective&#xD;
      cohort study to investigate the utility of US as a clinical assessment tool for patients&#xD;
      undergoing hip fracture surgery. In general, patients with hip fractures are elderly with&#xD;
      multiple comorbidities, and are at a higher risk for complications. Our current standard of&#xD;
      care does not involve the use of US to assess the heart and lung comorbidities of these&#xD;
      patients. The use of US has the potential to provide critical information about heart and/or&#xD;
      lung diseases that was previously unknown, possibly altering the perioperative management&#xD;
      plan and potentially improving care for these patients. Also, careful assessment of the intra&#xD;
      vascular volume may help with induction management and Anesthesia technique.The&#xD;
      anesthesiologist providing the anesthetic will suggest their anesthesia plan before and after&#xD;
      the results of the study will be introduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, cohort study. This study will be conducted at the LHSC, London,&#xD;
      Ontario. The investigators will include adult patients with a hip fracture scheduled for&#xD;
      urgent surgery and exclude patients who have a known heart or lung condition that mandates&#xD;
      the appropriate anesthetic plan. Based upon the routine pre-surgical assessments that are&#xD;
      performed in accordance with standard of care, the Anesthesiologist will develop and record&#xD;
      the plan for anesthetic management for the patient. All patients will receive a preoperative&#xD;
      US examination assessment of the heart and lungs (6 basic transthoracic US views ). The US&#xD;
      results will be available to the anesthesia and surgical teams, but will only be divulged&#xD;
      after a preliminary anesthetic plan is prepared by the anesthesiologist. Following completion&#xD;
      of this US assessment, the investigators will ask the Anesthesiologist to re-evaluate their&#xD;
      anesthetic plan and document any changes that were made as a result of the US finding and&#xD;
      provide feedback about the benefit (or lack thereof) of the information provided by the&#xD;
      ultrasound assessment. The primary endpoint of this study is a composite outcome of change in&#xD;
      anesthetic technique and choice of monitoring and fluid management. A questionnaire will be&#xD;
      distributed to the attending anesthesiologist to record their anesthetic plan pre and post&#xD;
      divulgation of US results. The investigators will assess whether the use of perioperative&#xD;
      ultrasound provided a significant unknown information that affected the anesthesia plan.&#xD;
