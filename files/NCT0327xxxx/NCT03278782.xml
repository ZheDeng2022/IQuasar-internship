  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects of pembrolizumab and romidepsin and to see how&#xD;
      well they work in treating participants with peripheral T-cell lymphoma that has come back or&#xD;
      that does not respond to treatment. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Romidepsin may stop the growth of tumor cells&#xD;
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving pembrolizumab and romidepsin&#xD;
      may work better than pembrolizumab alone in treating participants with recurrent or&#xD;
      refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the safety of pembrolizumab in combination with romidepsin. II. Estimate the&#xD;
      response rate of the combination therapy in refractory or recurrent peripheral T-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma (PTCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Estimate progression free survival (PFS). II. Estimate overall survival (OS). III.&#xD;
      Estimate complete response (CR) and duration of response (DOR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess activation of T-cells after treatment in peripheral blood and tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Correlate features of peripheral blood T-cell activation with toxicities, clinical&#xD;
      response, and PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive romidepsin intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days 1 and 8 or day 8 of&#xD;
      cycle 1 and days 1 and 8 of subsequent cycles and pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
      Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 36 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days and then every&#xD;
      12 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>As determined by incidence of adverse events graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. The phase I portion of the study follows standard 3+3 design. The 6 patients tested in the phase I at the dose finally determined as recommended phase II dose (RP2D) will be included in the response assessment of phase II study.
