      The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of gabapentin as adjunctive therapy to&#xD;
      morphine in the treatment of severe chronic neuropathic or mixed pain in children from 3&#xD;
      months to less than 18 years of age assessed by the difference in average pain scores between&#xD;
      treatment arms at the end of the treatment period.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This paediatric trial has the objective to make gabapentin available for children with severe&#xD;
      chronic neuropathic or mixed pain. This study will be conducted in full conformance with the&#xD;
      ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, consistent with ICH-GCP&#xD;
      (including ICH Topic E11 guideline) and applicable regulatory requirements including the&#xD;
      Paediatric Recommendations (CE/2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gabapentin has been successfully used to treat neuropathic pain in adults. In absence of&#xD;
      specific paediatric studies it is not approved for the same condition in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The paediatric use of gabapentin is hampered by: a) the lack of a suitable paediatric&#xD;
      formulation, b) the significant variability of gabapentin PK profile and c) efficacy and&#xD;
      safety data in this specific population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GABA-2 is a superiority trial designed to assess the potential benefit of gabapentin oral&#xD;
      solution in augmenting the analgesic effect of morphine in children affected by severe&#xD;
      chronic pain thus preventing or decreasing opioid tolerance, as it has been reported to&#xD;
      happen in adults. Thus GABA-2 study is an randomized, double blind, placebo controlled,&#xD;
      multi-centre study to evaluate the efficacy of gabapentin added to morphine in paediatric&#xD;
      patients suffering from severe chronic pain (neuropathic or mixed with ascertained&#xD;
      neuropathic component). The trial will include 66 patients aged from 3 months to less than 18&#xD;
      years affected by severe chronic neuropathic or mixed pain and in need of morphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children from 3 months to &lt;3 years of age will participate to GABA-2 on the basis of the&#xD;
      nature of the underlying disease suggestive of a neuropathic component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A block randomisation will be applied to assign children to gabapentin and morphine&#xD;
      (intervention group) or gabapentin placebo and morphine (control group) in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be stratified by age-group as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 months - &lt; 3 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 years - &lt; 8 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  8 years - &lt; 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will start with patients â‰¥ 3 years of age. Patients &lt; than 3 years of age will be&#xD;
      recruited when results from the ongoing non-clinical toxicological study in juvenile rats&#xD;
      will confirm the safety of gabapentin in the age subset 3 months-3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol has been designed to ensure double-blind conditions at randomisation and&#xD;
      throughout the treatment period. Blinding (children, caregiver, outcome assessor) will be&#xD;
      ensured by elaborating an identical (matching) gabapentin placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study comprises 3 stages over 18 to 22 weeks: 1st stage ( screening period of 1 week,&#xD;
      wash out phase of max 3 days and baseline assessment of 3 days ), 2nd stage ( treatment&#xD;
      period including an optimization phase of 3 weeks and 12 weeks of maintenance), 3rd stage&#xD;
      (study taper lasting from 0 to 4 weeks and 1 week follow up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed formulation of the IMP test is a liquid oral formulation (syrup) containing 75&#xD;
      mg/ml of gabapentin. The IMP comparator is the placebo. The background therapy is morphine&#xD;
      presented as immediate and extended-release tablets and a liquid, oral formulation. Every&#xD;
      participant will be administered morphine and the active product or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both study drugs, dosing will initiate at a starting dose in mg/kg/day and will be&#xD;
      increased according to a predefined matrix to a maximum dose in mg/kg/day. Dosing will be&#xD;
      flexibly optimised in order to maximise the potential benefits while minimising risk of AEs.&#xD;
      There will be a maximum of 5 possible dose adjustments during the 3 weeks optimisation&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing for gabapentin during the optimization period will be defined according to two weight&#xD;
      groups (5-15kg and &gt;15kg). Current dosing schedule for gabapentin is the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 1 starting dose in mg/kg/day;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 3 2 times the starting dose in mg/kg/day;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 5 3 times the starting dose in mg/kg/day;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 14 2 times the dose of Day 5 in mg/kg/day;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 21 3 times the dose of Day 5 in mg/kg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing of morphine is largely based on the &quot;WHO guidelines on the pharmacological treatment&#xD;
      of persisting pain in children with medical illnesses&quot;, 2012. The guidelines recommended&#xD;
      starting dose for immediate release formulation of morphine are '80-200 mcg/kg every 4 hours&#xD;
      for infants and 200-500 mcg/kg in 6 divided doses in older children. ' However, due to&#xD;
      compliance issues a four times daily regimen (q.i.d) will be used during the titration phase&#xD;
      of this protocol for children with body weight &gt;30kg and throughout this study for patients&#xD;
      with &lt;30kg body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The morphine starting dose in this study reflects the lower end of the WHO recommendation&#xD;
      with a titration scheduled to reach a maximum daily dose of 1.2 mg/kg/day. Patients &lt; 30kg BW&#xD;
      will have the liquid morphine formulation, 4 times daily throughout the study and patients &gt;&#xD;
      30kg will receive immediate release tablet 4 times daily, during the titration phase and&#xD;
      extended release tablets 2 times daily during the maintenance phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects that are completing the study or are withdrawn early must be tapered off of the&#xD;
      gabapentin. At the visit of Early Termination or End Of Study visit, subjects will be&#xD;
      dispensed a taper dose based on their current dose level (the dose of the medicinal product&#xD;
      taken during the maintenance period) and should follow the dose tapering as described in the&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant use of some medications that could interfere with the study will be prohibited.&#xD;
      Unrestricted use of paracetamol and/or ibuprofen alone or in combination will be used as&#xD;
      rescue therapy any time the patient experiences pain (pain level &gt;4/10 measured with age-&#xD;
      appropriate pain scales FLACC, FPS-R or NRS-11) This study includes pharmacokinetic analysis&#xD;
      to establish a population pharmacokinetic model adequate to describe the time-course and&#xD;
      variability of plasma concentrations of gabapentin and gabapentin plus morphine following&#xD;
      repeat dosing in children with chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes also an optional exploratory pharmacogenomics study which requires a&#xD;
      separate Informed Consent if the parent of the subject agrees to participate. The aims of the&#xD;
      exploratory pharmacogenomic research is to better understand inherited genetic factors and&#xD;
      their association with clinical assessments, which may include pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      gabapentin, relative susceptibility to drug-drug interactions, predisposition to side&#xD;
      effects, and/or patients' response to treatment with gabapentin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study foresees also an exploratory metabolomic study that may provide insight in the&#xD;
      mechanism of neuropathic pain and the inter-individual variation in drug response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this study, it is expected that a maximum of 15.9 mL of blood will be taken from every&#xD;
      subject (male and female). Additional 2.0 ml of blood will be required from females of child&#xD;
      bearing age for pregnancy testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis of efficacy will be conducted using ANCOVA with baseline average pain&#xD;
      score as a covariate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted under the supervision of an independent Data Safety Monitoring&#xD;
      Committee (DSMC).&#xD;

    <description>Aggressive behaviour in children aged &gt;6 years using the Retrospective Modified Overt Aggression Scale (R-MOAS) at V2, V6 and EOS visit (V10).&#xD;
The scale includes 4 domains (Verbal Incidents, Incidents Toward Other People, Incidents Involving Property, Incidents Directed Toward Self) each one describing different behaviours.&#xD;
Parents rate the frequency of 16 aggressive behaviors (referred to the past week) in the 4 areas. Numeric weighting amplifies the seriousness of more harmful behaviors in the total score. Higher score indicating more aggressive behavior.</description>

    <description>Suicidal ideation/behaviour in subjects aged 6 years and older using the Columbia - Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) scores before IMP (screening V1), V6, EOS visit (V10) and taper visit (V11).&#xD;
The C-SSRS is divided into 2 sections: Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behaviour containing each one 5 &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; questions.&#xD;
Suicidal Ideation Score: The maximum suicidal ideation category (1-5 on the CSSRS) present at the assessment. A score of 0 is assigned if no ideation is present.&#xD;
Composite endpoints are defined below:&#xD;
Suicidal ideation: A &quot;yes&quot; answer at any time during treatment to any one of the five suicidal ideation questions (Categories 1-5).&#xD;
Suicidal behavior: A &quot;yes&quot; answer at any time during treatment to any one of the five suicidal behavior questions (Categories 6-10).&#xD;
Suicidal ideation or behavior: A &quot;yes&quot; answer at any time during treatment to any one of the ten suicidal ideation and behavior questions (Categories 1-10)</description>
