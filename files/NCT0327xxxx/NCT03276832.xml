    <textblock>
      This pilot trial studies the side effects and how well imiquimod and pembrolizumab work in&#xD;
      treating patients with stage IIIB-IV melanoma. Imiquimod may stimulate the immune system.&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells&#xD;
      to grow and spread. Giving imiquimod and pembrolizumab may work better at treating melanoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To gain preliminary data of the anti-tumor activity and safety profile of the combination&#xD;
      of imiquimod and pembrolizumab in patients with unresectable cutaneous melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare and contrast (in a hypothesis generating manner) the biomarker profiles of&#xD;
      patients who have a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) by Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria with patients who do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) on day 1 and apply imiquimod cutaneously on&#xD;
      days 1-5 (Monday - Friday). Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years (approximately 35&#xD;
      courses) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 2 years.&#xD;
