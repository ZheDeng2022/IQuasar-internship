  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study comprises two trials to evaluate the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of HIV&#xD;
      self-testing strategies compared to standard of care among clients in outpatient departments&#xD;
      (OPD; Aim 1) and the sexual partners of HIV-positive clients (index testing; Aim 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 will be a cluster-randomized trial in 15 clusters (high-burden health facilities) in&#xD;
      Malawi. We will enroll 6,000 adult OPD clients (15 years or older) to test the feasibility&#xD;
      and cost-effectiveness of facility-based HIV self-testing (HIVST) for OPD clients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 will be an individually-randomized trial in 3 high-burden health facilities in Malawi.&#xD;
      We will enroll 500 adult HIV-positive clients (15 years or older) to test the feasibility and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of index HIVST among partners of HIV-positive clients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study includes two unblinded trials to evaluate the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      HIVST strategies among adults in Malawi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 will test the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of facility-based HIVST in OPD sites&#xD;
      in Malawi. It will be an unblinded cluster-randomized trial and include three arms: 1)&#xD;
      standard of care for provider-initiated testing and counseling (PITC); (2) optimized standard&#xD;
      of care for PITC; and (3) facility-based HIVST while clients wait for routine OPD services.&#xD;
      The standard of care arm will receive no intervention. The optimized standard of care arm&#xD;
      will receive training and support for implementing the Malawi guidelines for PITC and morning&#xD;
      testing. OPD clients in the facility HIVST arm will receive a HIVST demonstration and&#xD;
      distribution, followed by uses of HIVST and private spaces for kit interpretation before&#xD;
      receiving routine OPD services. Participants may present their self-test results to their&#xD;
      provider, who will refer them for confirmatory HIV testing and routine ART initiation (if&#xD;
      positive). That same day, participants from all arms will complete a brief survey upon&#xD;
      exiting the clinic. Survey and medical record data will be compared across arms to determine&#xD;
      whether facility HIVST is superior in regard to number of individuals tested for HIV,&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness, number of HIV-positive individuals identified, and linkage rates for&#xD;
      those who identify as HIV-positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 will test the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of index HIVST for the sexual partners&#xD;
      of HIV-positive clients. It will be an unblinded individually-randomized trial and include&#xD;
      two arms: 1) standard of care partner referral slips for testing; and 2) HIVST. The standard&#xD;
      of care arm will receive no intervention for partner notification and referral. HIV-positive&#xD;
      clients in the HIVST arm will receive a HIVST demonstration and distribution, with&#xD;
      instructions to give the HIVST kit to their sexual partner. Participants will be given one&#xD;
      HIVST for each of their sexual partners who has an unknown HIV status or who tested&#xD;
      HIV-negative more than six months prior (up to 3 HIVST kits distributed). Participants (index&#xD;
      clients) will be given instructions on how their partner can complete the self-test and how&#xD;
      to refer their partner(s) to care if they receive a positive result from the self-test. All&#xD;
      participants (standard of care and HIVST arms) will complete a brief survey at the beginning&#xD;
      of the intervention and a 4-week follow-up survey to assess primary and secondary outcomes.&#xD;
      Medical chart reviews will be conducted for all partners reported to test HIV-positive in&#xD;
      order to assess ART initiation rates. Survey and medical record data will be compared across&#xD;
      arms to determine whether index HIVST is superior in regard to number of partners tested for&#xD;
      HIV, cost-effectiveness, number of HIV-positive individuals identified, and linkage rates for&#xD;
      those who identify as HIV-positive.&#xD;

Facility HIVST: HIVST will be carried out in a group setting among patients in the waiting area of OPD clinics. Eligible clients will receive education about HIV testing and a demonstration of how to use and interpret results of a self-test kit will occur in the group setting. Participants will use the HIVST kit in a group setting and will be given private settings (private room or booth) to interpret their results. Participants will disclose their results to their OPD provider if they choose. Routine linkage to confirmatory testing and ART initiation will be conducted.</description>

        <description>Total cost per arm (including human resources, testing, training, equipment, facility over head, staff, and testing supplies) / total number of individual initiated ART by each arm, respectively. All costs in 2017 US$. Cost calculations do not include cost of ART. Cost data in each study group were derived from a health care perspective using micro-costing methods using the HIV Counselling and Testing costing tool developed by the Health Economics and Epidemiology Research Office in South Africa. All costs are reported in 2017 US$. We use mean cost per ART initiate. Standard deviation is not included due to the nature of calculating a 'production cost'- or the total cost incurred per the respective number of outcomes.</description>

        <title>Aim 2: Cost Per Person Tested HIV-Positive</title>
        <description>Total cost per arm (including human resources, testing, training, equipment, facility over head, staff, and testing supplies) / total number of individual tested HIV-positive by each arm, respectively. All costs in 2017 US$. Cost calculations include all costs associated with HIV testing. Cost data in each study group were derived from a health care perspective using micro-costing methods using the HIV Counselling and Testing costing tool developed by the Health Economics and Epidemiology Research Office in South Africa. All costs are reported in 2017 US$. We use mean cost per HIV-positive individual identified. Standard deviation is not included due to the nature of calculating a 'production cost'- or the total cost incurred per the respective number of outcomes.</description>

For Aim 2 (Index HIVST), adverse events were collected 4-weeks after study enrollment and delivery of the intervention (HIVST).</time_frame>
      <desc>For Aim 1, adverse events included (1) coercion to test or share test results; and (2) unwanted status disclosure. Data were collected from follow-up surveys with OPD clients enrolled in the study.&#xD;
For Aim 2, adverse events included (1) coercion to test or share test results; (2) unwanted status disclosure; (3) intimate personal violence to the HIV-positive client; and (4) end of the romantic relationship.

Facility HIVST: HIVST will be carried out in a group setting among patients in the waiting area of OPD clinics. Eligible clients will receive education about HIV testing and a demonstration of how to use and interpret results of a self-test kit will occur in the group setting. Participants will use the HIVST kit in a group setting and will be given private settings (private room or booth) to interpret their results. Participants will disclose their results to their OPD provider if they choose. Routine linkage to confirmatory testing and ART initiation will be conducted.</description>
