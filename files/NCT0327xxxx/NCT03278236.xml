  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a serious medical condition, the adverse consequences of which include increased&#xD;
      risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, reduced fertility and cancer. The economic&#xD;
      cost of obesity was placed at $58 billion dollars in Australia in 2008 [1]. Studies in mice&#xD;
      and non-human primates have shown that moderate caloric restriction (CR) increases lifespan&#xD;
      and reduces the incidence of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes [2]. Reduced&#xD;
      risk of chronic diseases is also observed in humans following CR [3]. However, daily CR is&#xD;
      difficult to maintain long term, since the body defends against weight loss by inducing&#xD;
      &quot;metabolic adaptation&quot;[3] and altering the hormonal appetite response [4]. An emerging number&#xD;
      of studies are examining the effects of limiting food intake to prescribed time periods per&#xD;
      day, or every other day. Time restricted feeding (TRF) describes a dieting approach where&#xD;
      food is available ad libitum, however only for a limited period of time (i.e. 3-12 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will examine the effects of restricting daily food intake to within a 10&#xD;
      hour period on glycaemic control, body weight and biomarkers of metabolic health for 6-weeks.&#xD;
      This study will build on the existing knowledge base in humans as to whether meal timing,&#xD;
      rather than caloric restriction per se, is important to provide the stimulus required to&#xD;
      improve metabolic health and reduce risk of chronic disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The timing of meals distributed across the wake cycle may play a role in body weight&#xD;
      regulation and metabolic health. In rodents, providing an 12 h feeding opportunity during the&#xD;
      active phase abrogated the metabolic consequences of a high fat diet, including maintaining&#xD;
      leaner body weight and normal glucose homeostasis [5]. In diet-induced obese rodents,&#xD;
      switching to a TRF protocol normalised the metabolic milieu by reducing hyperinsulinemia,&#xD;
      hepatic steatosis, and inflammation [6]. Interestingly, when lean animals were switched to a&#xD;
      TRF high fat diet protocol, which allowed ad libitum access to the high fat diet for 2&#xD;
      consecutive days per week, simulating a &quot;weekend&quot;, lean body weights and metabolic profiles&#xD;
      were maintained [6]. These studies suggest that following a TRF protocol is of significant&#xD;
      benefit to prevent weight gain, and or to normalise the metabolic milieu.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational studies of individuals who undertook the Islamic ritual of fasting during the&#xD;
      month of Ramadan [7, 8]. Under these conditions, not only is the timing of food intake&#xD;
      restricted, but feeding times are switched to non-daylight hours. The outcomes from these&#xD;
      observational studies are mixed, but many have observed reduced cardiovascular risk factors&#xD;
      [7, 8]. However, beneficial changes in glycaemic profile are more controversial. One study,&#xD;
      using continuous glucose monitors, reported there was a change in the pattern of the&#xD;
      glycaemic profile, but no change in overall glycaemia [9]. Other studies have noted that&#xD;
      fasting glucose levels are increased following Ramadan [7]. Epidemiological evidence shows&#xD;
      that individuals who report consuming more of their daily energy intake at the evening meal&#xD;
      were more overweight, than those who reported consumed more of their energy intake before&#xD;
      lunch[10]. Similarly, eating lunch late in the day (after 15:00 hrs) was predictive of poorer&#xD;
      weight loss during a 20-week dietary intervention study [11] and individuals randomized to&#xD;
      consume more calories at breakfast had greater weight loss versus those randomized to eat&#xD;
      more calories at dinner after 12 weeks [12]. Taken together these data suggest that consuming&#xD;
      more calories in the morning may be beneficial for weight management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only a limited number of controlled studies have interrogated the effects of TRF in humans&#xD;
      [13-15]. The first was a randomised controlled cross-over intervention, where lean&#xD;
      individuals were instructed either to consume all of their calories required for weight&#xD;
      maintenance over a 4 hour period from 1700-2100h, or as 3 meals/d for 8 weeks. Consumption of&#xD;
      the evening meal was supervised within the laboratory, to ensure subjects consumed the entire&#xD;
      meal. Significant reductions in body weight and body fat mass, by 1.4 and 2.1 kg&#xD;
      respectively, were noted when following the TRF protocol [13]. Despite this small amount of&#xD;
      weight loss, fasting blood glucose levels were increased, and TRF resulted in poorer glucose&#xD;
      tolerance in response to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) [14]. Thus, consuming a&#xD;
      single, large &quot;dinner&quot; meal was detrimental for metabolic health, although no differences in&#xD;
      insulin response were noted [14]. Gill et al also examined the effects of 10-11h TRF in 8 men&#xD;
      who were overweight and reported an habitual eating pattern that usually spanned at least 14&#xD;
      hours. A 3% body weight loss was observed after 2 months of TRF, and this was maintained for&#xD;
      12 months[16]. It is unclear whether responses may have differed if the food allowance was&#xD;
      prescribed at breakfast or lunch times. Finally, healthy, lean male subjects were allowed to&#xD;
      eat ad libitum for 13h per day (6am-7pm) for 2 weeks. Participants reported eating&#xD;
      significantly less on the TRF versus the control condition, and lost -0.4kg compared with a&#xD;
      gain of +0.6kg in the control condition [15]. Whilst this is a minor change in body weight,&#xD;
      this pattern is not that atypical of modern eating patterns, and further restriction of&#xD;
      eating times, and assessment of obese individuals under these conditions is warranted. The&#xD;
      metabolic health impacts were not reported in either of these studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening visit (S) - (Informed consent, screening questionnaire): Participants will be&#xD;
      assessed by a screening questionnaire (provided for review) for risk of type 2 diabetes, and&#xD;
      for their diet, medical and exercise history to determine their eligibility. Potentially&#xD;
      eligible participants will be invited to attend SAHMRI and have the research protocol&#xD;
      explained to them in detail. Informed consent to participate in the study, including a verbal&#xD;
      indication that they understand the general study protocol and requirements is then obtained.&#xD;
      Routine clinical checks are then performed (weight, height, waist circumference, blood&#xD;
      pressure). If participants meet the eligibility criteria, they will be invited to take part&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment and food intake monitoring: In this study, we will use a smartphone-based&#xD;
      monitoring and feedback tool (MyCircadianClock app) to monitor the daily pattern of ingestive&#xD;
      behaviour, activity and sleep patterns for 1-week, at baseline as well as during weeks 1,3&#xD;
      and 5. This app was developed by our collaborators at Salk Institute, Professor Satchidananda&#xD;
      Panda and Dr Emily Manoogian. Participants in our study will be asked to sign up to the&#xD;
      MyCircadianClock smartphone app and using the app are asked to take a photograph of any food&#xD;
      and drink that they consume, which time stamps when and what was eaten, for later analysis.&#xD;
      This app is part of a study conducted by Professor Panda. The Panda lab will share the&#xD;
      identifiable data collected through the app from participants of this study, once they have&#xD;
      received verification of informed consent from the participant in our study to do so. This is&#xD;
      outlined on page 4 of the SIS and consent asked on page 7 of the SIS/consent form. We have&#xD;
      attached IRB approval of the MyCircadianClock study, which explains the app in detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRF: Participants will be instructed to consume their habitual diet within a self-selected 10&#xD;
      hour period every day. Outside of the selected eating period, participants are allowed to&#xD;
      consume water (encouraged to drink 6-8 glasses per day) and calorie free foods (e.g.&#xD;
      sugar-free drinks and chewing gum) as well as black coffee and/or tea. Participants will&#xD;
      track their energy intake using the application described above. This will track compliance,&#xD;
      and allow us to assess changes in intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic Testing (W0, W6): Participants will be provided with a standardised meal that&#xD;
      provides ~30% of their estimated total daily energy requirement (McCains Lasagne, fruit&#xD;
      salad, muesli bar) to consume the evening prior to the study visit, by 1930h. They will&#xD;
      arrive at 0730 at the Research Unit following a 12 hour overnight fast. Weight, waist and hip&#xD;
      circumference and blood pressure will be measured and a 20G cannula inserted into an&#xD;
      antecubital vein. A fasting blood sample (20 mL) is drawn for baseline measurements and to&#xD;
      assess HbA1c. A second fasting blood sample (20ml) will be taken immediately prior to&#xD;
      consuming a standardised 700kcal liquid meal (EnsurePlus ®; 57% CHO, 28 % fat, 15 % protein)&#xD;
      (t=0). 6*10 mL blood samples are drawn at 15,30,60,90,120,180 minutes to measure glucose,&#xD;
      free fatty acids, insulin, c-peptide and appetite hormones. A total volume of 100 mL blood&#xD;
      will be collected at visit 0 and 6; with a total volume of 200 mL collected over 6 weeks.&#xD;
      Appetite responses during the meal will be monitored using standardised visual analog scales.&#xD;
