  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled study (RCT) to investigate the topical effectiveness of PluroGel in&#xD;
      healing venous and mixed aetiology leg ulcers. Patients with venous and mixed aetiology leg&#xD;
      ulcers will be identified from hospital outpatient clinics. Willing patients meeting the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be consented and assessed in line with standard care.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized at Week 2 to receive either topical PluroGel or Intrasite gel&#xD;
      (an alternative topical hydrogel product) if inclusion criteria is met.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a pilot, randomized, controlled, multi-center trial to determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of PluroGel in the reduction of size of wounds and reduction of slough covering&#xD;
      the wound surface compared with Intrasite Gel. The primary objectives will be to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of PluroGel compared with Intrasite Gel in the reduction of size of venous leg&#xD;
      ulcers or mixed venous arterial aetiology. Also the reduction in the percentage of slough&#xD;
      covering the wound bed in both groups will be compared. The secondary objective will be to&#xD;
      evaluate patient comfort, satisfaction and acceptance of the hydrogels along with staff&#xD;
      feedback of both hydrogels. Patients with either a venous leg ulcer (VLU) or an mixed venous&#xD;
      arterial aetiology (MAU) leg ulcer will be identified by the participant's health care&#xD;
      provider and will be treated with PluroGel or Intrasite Gel. A total of 40 subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled to the study, 20 to each arm. These subjects will be recruited from patients&#xD;
      receiving treatment for wounds at NHS outpatient clinic. Participants will be approached&#xD;
      initially by the NHS care-giver and asked if interested in participating in research. If&#xD;
      interested, participants will be asked to sign a permission to contact form for contact&#xD;
      details to be given to a member of the research team who would then contact the participant&#xD;
      to provide further information. A screening log will be kept of all patients who have been&#xD;
      considered but who do not fulfill the criteria for entry. Patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      either Plurogel and standard care or Intrasite Gel in conjunction with standard care, on an&#xD;
      equal basis. Subjects will be eligible for randomization if during the first two weeks within&#xD;
      the study the target wound has not reduced in surface area by 30% or more and there has been&#xD;
      a less than 25% reduction in the cover of the wound bed with visible slough. Once the subject&#xD;
      has completed 4-weeks of treatment, and the final visit, or the target ulcer has healed,&#xD;
      whichever is soonest, then the subject has completed the study and the termination form will&#xD;
      be completed. The Investigator will ensure that all CRF forms are completed and accurate. The&#xD;
      study end date will be the date of the last subject's last visit. The CI and study sponsor,&#xD;
      will comply with any safety reporting obligations for serious adverse device related events&#xD;
      to the manufacturer, study sponsor, R&amp;D Department(s) of the University Health Board(s) and&#xD;
      the Ethics Committee, as defined in the applicable laws and regulations, and within the&#xD;
      required timelines.&#xD;
