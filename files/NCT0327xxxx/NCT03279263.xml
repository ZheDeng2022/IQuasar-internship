  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group,&#xD;
      add-on study of MLR 1023 in adults with uncontrolled T2DM on metformin anti diabetic&#xD;
      monotherapy is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MLR 1023 in combination with&#xD;
      metformin in subjects with uncontrolled T2DM.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medical management of T2DM involves diet, exercise, weight management, and pharmacotherapy.&#xD;
      Pharmacological agents, such as metformin, Î±-glucosidase inhibitors, orlistat, and&#xD;
      thiazolidinediones, have been shown to decrease incident diabetes. Metformin has the&#xD;
      strongest evidence base and demonstrated long-term safety as pharmacological therapy for&#xD;
      diabetes treatment. The American Diabetes association position statement on diabetes care&#xD;
      recommends that if Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) targets are not achieved after approximately 3&#xD;
      months of metformin anti-diabetic monotherapy, a combination of metformin and one of several&#xD;
      oral treatment options should be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, subjects with a diagnosis of T2DM who are not adequately controlled (HbA1C&#xD;
      between 7.0% and 10.0%, inclusive) and started metformin therapy at least 3 months prior to&#xD;
      Screening will be recruited into the study. Subjects will continue taking metformin for the&#xD;
      duration of the study and once daily oral MLR 1023 or placebo will be added to metformin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacious dose-level range of MLR 1023 in diabetic subjects is anticipated to be&#xD;
      between 25 and 100 mg. Therefore, the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 25 mg and 50 mg&#xD;
      doses in addition to the 100 mg dose that was shown to be effective in the Phase 2a proof of&#xD;
      concept study will be assessed.&#xD;
