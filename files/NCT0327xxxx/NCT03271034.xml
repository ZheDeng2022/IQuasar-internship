  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lipedema is a disorder characterized by massive, bilateral accumulation of fat below the&#xD;
      waist and in the legs. Enlargement of the lower extremities is often accompanied by leg pain&#xD;
      and accumulation of fluid. Little is known about the functional changes that lead to fat&#xD;
      accumulation and pain in women with lipedema. The goals of this project is to conduct a&#xD;
      comprehensive characterization of abdominal and femoral fat tissues in lean women with&#xD;
      lipedema and obese women with lipedema and to evaluate the potential effect of a diet-induced&#xD;
      weight loss as a therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once enrolled in the study, the following tests will be conducted on lean women with&#xD;
      lipedema: 1) characterization of body composition (fat tissue distribution), insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity (response to insulin) and adipose tissue biology. The following tests will be&#xD;
      conducted on obese women with lipedema: 1) characterization of body composition (fat tissue&#xD;
      distribution), insulin sensitivity (response to insulin), adipose tissue biology, vascular&#xD;
      function (how arteries dilate/contract) and immune system function/inflammation. As control,&#xD;
      we will have BMI-matched women that are metabolically normal lean (MNL), metabolically normal&#xD;
      obese (MNO) and Metabolically Abnormal Obese (MAO) already analyzed in different studies at&#xD;
      Washington University (IRB# 201512086 and IRB# 201610005). MNL, MAO and MNO subjects&#xD;
      underwent the same testing described above for the lipedema. Therefore, we will use the data&#xD;
      generated from IRB# 201512086 and 201610005 as comparison groups in the statistical analysis&#xD;
      to understand differences and similarities between lipedema and obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second aim of the study is to determine the effect of diet-induced weight loss on body&#xD;
      composition, insulin sensitivity, adipose tissue biology, and vascular function in the women&#xD;
      with lipedema and compare these results with data obtained from BMI-matched women with MAO&#xD;
      participating in other studies at Washington University (IRB# 201512086 and IRB# 201610005).&#xD;
      The MAO population will be used as control populations and data generated from the IRB#&#xD;
      201512086 and IRB# 201610005 will be used as comparison group for statistical analysis. The&#xD;
      results from this second aim of the study will hopefully provide important insights on the&#xD;
      efficacy of diet therapy in managing lipedema.&#xD;

      Once informed consent has been obtained, participants will complete 1 screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screen Visit includes a medical history, physical examination, pregnancy test (for women of&#xD;
      childbearing potential), blood tests, urine drug test, an oral glucose tolerance test,&#xD;
      resting electrocardiogram (ECG), questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline testing will be performed in 7 weekly visits requiring 1 inpatient overnight stay&#xD;
      and will require ~30h to complete testing. Testing will include imaging scans to determine&#xD;
      leg muscle mass, abdominal (belly) fat mass and liver fat content; DXA scan, blood samples,&#xD;
      skin temperature monitoring, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure, immune system&#xD;
      function/inflammation (performed exclusively in obese with lipedema subjects and BMI-matched&#xD;
      controls), adipose tissue biopsies, adipose tissue oxygenation assessment (performed&#xD;
      exclusively in obese with lipedema subjects and BMI-matched controls).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once Baseline Testing is completed, participants will start 8-10% dietitian guided&#xD;
      weight-loss for about 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will have weekly visits with a study dietitian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After weight loss, the testing completed during baseline will be repeated during Visit 25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medical History &amp; Physical Exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Urine Drug/Pregnancy Test&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Blood pressure, pulse, height, weight, shoulder and waist circumference measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Electrocardiogram (ECG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Blood tests for routine lab analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Screening Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Food Diary&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) for Body&#xD;
           Composition to determine 1)the amount of fat in the liver, abdomen (belly), and lower&#xD;
           leg; 2)the amount of oxygen in the abdominal fat store (performed exclusively in obese&#xD;
           with lipedema subjects and BMI-matched controls); and 3) how much muscle mass is in the&#xD;
           thigh&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Metabolism study (hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp procedure)&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Abdominal and Thigh Fat biopsies&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Immune function (performed in obese with lipedema subjects and BMI-matched controls).&#xD;
