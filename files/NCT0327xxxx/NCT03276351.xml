    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized control trial that aims to investigate fixation of implants&#xD;
      after revision total knee replacement. The investigators are comparing long-stemmed revision&#xD;
      implants with hybrid cementation to short-stemmed primary implants with augment using a&#xD;
      special type of x-ray imaging (radiostereometric analysis) to assess implant movement over&#xD;
      time. The investigators are also comparing costs and patient-reported outcomes between the&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The demand for total knee replacement (TKR) continues to grow, especially for younger&#xD;
      patients who are at a greater risk of outliving the useful lifetime of their implants, thus&#xD;
      requiring revision surgery (Aggarwal et al., 2014; Stambough et al., 2014). Rates of revision&#xD;
      TKR are growing at an even faster rate than primary TKR. Between 2009-10, the incidence of&#xD;
      primary TKR grew by 9.4% in the U.S., while revision TKR grew by 17.1% (Kurtz et al., 2014).&#xD;
      Revision occurs for failures such as loosening, infection, or wear. Unfortunately, patients&#xD;
      undergoing revision TKR are roughly 6 times more likely to require re-revision compared to&#xD;
      patients undergoing primary TKR, further increasing the revision burden. Standard of care for&#xD;
      revision TKR has evolved, in search of long-lasting fixation and improved patient outcomes.&#xD;
      In many centres, the current standard of care is to use revision TKR implants with long stems&#xD;
      for enhanced fixation. Surgeon preference is variable, however, as to whether these stems&#xD;
      will be fully cemented, or whether only the most proximal aspect of the baseplate will be&#xD;
      cemented (hybrid fixation). While most common, these long-stemmed revision implants have&#xD;
      suffered from poor survivorship, are technically demanding to implant, and can result in poor&#xD;
      patient outcomes, including ongoing pain. Over the past decade porous metal augments have&#xD;
      gained favour. These devices interface between the defective bone and the implant, aiding&#xD;
      fixation. The first augment of its kind are the Trabecular Metal cone augments from Zimmer.&#xD;
      Although an improvement in principle, they have a number of drawbacks including poor fit with&#xD;
      most implant systems, increasing technical challenge and requiring intra-operative&#xD;
      customization, which lengthens the surgery. More recently, Stryker Tritanium augments have&#xD;
      been introduced that offer a closer fit with Triathlon revision implants, decreasing&#xD;
      operative time. This closeness of fit also provides an opportunity to rethink the utilization&#xD;
      of long stems when porous augments are used. Ultimately, the goal would be for porous metal&#xD;
      augments to completely fill all bone defects, essentially enabling a more primary-like TKR to&#xD;
      be performed, enhancing patient outcomes. The gold standard for measurement of implant&#xD;
      fixation over time is radiostereometric analysis (RSA). At the time of surgery, 0.8-1.0 mm&#xD;
      Tantalum beads (typically n = 6-8 per region of interest) are inserted into the bone&#xD;
      surrounding the implant of interest, and occasionally also into the polyethylene liner or&#xD;
      insert of the implant. RSA exams are then acquired within the first 2 weeks post-operation,&#xD;
      and again at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. Each exam involves a stereo&#xD;
      x-ray acquisition with a calibration unit to reconstruct the 3D location of the implant&#xD;
      relative to the marker beads. Across each exam, the migration of the implant relative to the&#xD;
      marker beads is tracked compared to the baseline exam acquired within the first 2 weeks. RSA&#xD;
      is extremely precise and accurate, and is able to track migrations on the order of 10's of&#xD;
      microns. Large early migrations within the first 1-2 years post-operation are predictive of&#xD;
      eventual implant loosening and failure. RSA can also be used to measure inducible&#xD;
      displacement of implants to assess instantaneous fixation of implanted components. These RSA&#xD;
      exams compare a supine, unloaded image of the patient's joint to a standing, loaded image of&#xD;
      their joint, to determine whether any movement occurs between the implant and marker beads&#xD;
      with loading. To our knowledge, only three published RSA studies of revision TKR exist in the&#xD;
      literature. Jensen et al. (2012) published a 2-year study with 40 patients comparing cement&#xD;
      reconstruction to Trabecular Metal cones. They found no significant difference between groups&#xD;
      for migration at 2 years, and determined that use of the Trabecular Metal cones resulted in&#xD;
      better early stability with reduced irregular motion patterns compared to using hybrid cement&#xD;
      reconstruction. Heesterbeek et al. (2016) published a 2-year study with 32 patients that&#xD;
      compared hybrid to fully cemented stem fixation using the Legion revision system, which was&#xD;
      followed up to 6.5 years by Kosse et al. (2017). At both follow-up time points, there was no&#xD;
      difference in overall migration between the hybrid and fully cemented stem groups. Taken&#xD;
      together, these studies do not reflect the latest thinking in revision knee surgery, do not&#xD;
      account for the current generation of augment design, do not directly compare augments with&#xD;
      hybrid and fully cemented fixation, and do not correlate fixation and patient outcome scores.&#xD;
