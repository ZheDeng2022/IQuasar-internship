  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Barrett's oesophagus is a transformation of the esophageal mucous membrane there intestinal&#xD;
      metaplasia under the effect of gastro- esophageal reflux disease (GERD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This metaplasia can evolve in low grade dysplasia LGD) , high grade dysplasia (HGD) then&#xD;
      invasive adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of the HGD of the Barrett is the endoscopic treatment. It is about a&#xD;
      superficial treatment of tumor without ganglionar invasion by definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endoscopic treatment of the Barrett began in the 2000s, and showed its long-term&#xD;
      efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studied factors of recurrences are the length of the Barrett, the influence of the&#xD;
      eradication completes of the Barrett besides the eradication of the dysplasia, as well as the&#xD;
      duration of spacing of the procedures. An anatomical zone is particularly delicate to treat.&#xD;
      It is about the anatomical junction between the oesophagus and the stomach appointed junction&#xD;
      oeso-gastric or cardia or line Z.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This almost virtual zone is the site of most of the recurrence. The first cause of the&#xD;
      oesophagus of Barrett and of its transformation in HGD is the reflux.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This reflux can be handled by medicinal action inhibitor of the pump with proton (PPI) or by&#xD;
      surgery (hemi-fundo plicator). This reflux is probably the cause of the long-term recurrence&#xD;
      found in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgery is a good treatment of the reflux with however unsatisfactory long-term results.&#xD;
      On the other hand, the surgery is little used after endoscopic treatment of a HGD not to&#xD;
      compromise the surveillance and the detection of a second offense potentially masked in the&#xD;
      surgical fundo-plicator. The endoscopic treatment of the expensive ebb because of the based&#xD;
      necessary material too on a fundo-plicator is complicated with use in reason also of his&#xD;
      cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical treatment by PPI for life, besides his duration and thus the potential hardness&#xD;
      for the patient, presents long-term complications recently described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effects on the appearance of gastric precancerous lesion is not certain, but this association&#xD;
      with an osteoporosis is more proved true.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PPI could also be a etiologic factor of chronic renal insufficiency and insanity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An endoscopic treatment describes by Inoue &quot; Anti-Reflux Mucosectomy &quot; ( ARMS) allows to&#xD;
      decrease the gastro- esophageal reflux disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This treatment is an equivalent of on treatment of the line Z which would at the same time&#xD;
      allow to make sure of the decrease of recurrence on the line Z by complete treatment of this&#xD;
      one and to handle the reflux of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this experimental series, 10 patients having made this endoscopic treatment were able to&#xD;
      stop their treatment by PPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study will be to make sure of the efficiency of the endoscopic treatment&#xD;
      of the reflux by it on treatment of this line Z while decreasing the frequent recurrences on&#xD;
      this line Z.&#xD;
