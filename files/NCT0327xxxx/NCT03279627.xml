  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify and explore the existing components of discharge&#xD;
      planning provided to patients with insulin treated diabetes in the inpatient setting and to&#xD;
      examine the contribution of glycemic excursions as well as comprehension of discharge&#xD;
      instructions among patients with diabetes, in predicting hospital readmissions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Diabetes is a major contributor to hospital readmissions and health care&#xD;
      expenditures. Previous studies have attempted to identify risk factors for readmission among&#xD;
      patients with diabetes. However, no studies have looked at some potentially important factors&#xD;
      including duration of diabetes, HbA1c, glycemic excursions preceding hospital discharge, and&#xD;
      patient comprehension of discharge instructions provided for home diabetes management. In&#xD;
      this study, we propose to examine patient understanding of instructions for insulin therapy&#xD;
      provided at the time of hospital discharge as a potential risk factor for readmission during&#xD;
      the following 30- and 90-day time periods. In addition, we will examine the contribution of&#xD;
      glycemic excursions obtained in the 48-hour period prior to discharge on patient&#xD;
      understanding of insulin therapy and risk for readmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to identify and explore the existing components of&#xD;
      discharge planning provided to patients with insulin treated diabetes in the inpatient&#xD;
      setting and to examine the contribution of glycemic excursions as well as comprehension of&#xD;
      discharge instructions among patients with diabetes, in predicting hospital readmissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This will be a prospective non-blinded observational study enrolling non-critically&#xD;
      ill, non-pregnant, hospitalized patients aged 18-90 years of age with insulin treated&#xD;
      diabetes and no evidence of baseline cognitive. The participants will be recruited from&#xD;
      August 2017 to December 2018 from the Inpatient Endocrine and Diabetes Consult Services and&#xD;
      from daily reports of patients experiencing BG&lt; 70 mg/dL and &gt;300 mg/dL. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will be called within 24-48 hours following hospital discharge at which time&#xD;
      they will be asked to complete a Diabetes Management Questionnaire to determine their&#xD;
      comprehension of the recommendations provided for home-insulin and other diabetes therapies.&#xD;
      This questionnaire will include questions about the types of insulin being used, the doses&#xD;
      administered, and times given. Patient interviews will be conducted again via a telephone&#xD;
      follow up at approximately 30- and 90-days following discharge with specific questions on&#xD;
      home blood glucose control and ER or hospital visits and/or readmissions. The Clinical and&#xD;
      Translational Science Institute at the University of Pittsburgh will be consulted for&#xD;
      statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has the potential to identify modifiable factors that can potentially contribute&#xD;
      to the observed frequency of hospital readmissions among patients with insulin treated&#xD;
      diabetes. This study could also advocate for discharge protocols and close follow up of&#xD;
      patients with insulin-treated diabetes following discharge to ensure appropriate&#xD;
      understanding of discharge instructions for insulin therapy and home diabetes management.&#xD;
