      The team &quot;Cognitive intervention, cognitive reserve and brain plasticity&quot;, Team 10, is part&#xD;
      of the Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging (CCNA). The team's aim is to develop&#xD;
      and test a multi-faceted intervention program meant to increase cognitive and brain reserve&#xD;
      by providing cognitive stimulation through participation in cognitive training sessions and&#xD;
      engaging leisure activities. This will be done with a partially randomized controlled&#xD;
      double-blind preference trial with a comprehensive cohort design, in participants with&#xD;
      subjective cognitive decline (SCD) recruited in Montreal and Toronto.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the absence of a cure for Alzheimer's disease (AD), there is paramount interest for&#xD;
      non-pharmacological cognitive interventions that are designed to restore, increase, or&#xD;
      optimize capacities and adaptation. Numerous epidemiological studies have shown that&#xD;
      education, cognitively engaging leisure activities, and cognitively demanding professions are&#xD;
      associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline and dementia. When estimating the&#xD;
      proportion of AD cases attributable to modifiable risk factors, it was found that cognitive&#xD;
      inactivity was the factor that contributed to many of the cases worldwide (19.1% or 6.5&#xD;
      million cases). Thus, the level of cognitive stimulation that individuals receive throughout&#xD;
      their life is a critical protective factor against cognitive decline and AD, which suggests&#xD;
      potentially powerful avenues for intervention. In a number of influential papers, Stern&#xD;
      suggested that differences in cognitive lifestyle contribute to cognitive reserve, defined as&#xD;
      the built-up resilience of the brain against the detrimental effect of age-related brain&#xD;
      damage. Cognitive stimulation is thought to create richer brain networks and facilitate the&#xD;
      recruitment of alternative regions or networks. Barnes and Yaffe projected that 1.375 million&#xD;
      AD cases worldwide might be prevented by reducing by 25% the prevalence of cognitive&#xD;
      inactivity. These findings have tremendous consequences when designing strategies against&#xD;
      dementia. Thus, the goal of Team 10 is to design and test an innovative cognitive training&#xD;
      program to increase cognitive reserve and reduce decline in persons with a high risk of AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have shown that cognitive training can increase cognitive abilities in healthy&#xD;
      older adults, or persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Studies with MCI also show&#xD;
      that cognitive training in MCI results in greater brain activation and connectivity, as well&#xD;
      as the recruitment of alternative networks, which supports the view that it contributes to&#xD;
      the creation of cognitive reserve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are different types of cognitive interventions that are potentially available. Choosing&#xD;
      the proper one necessitates a fine understanding of their mechanisms of action and their&#xD;
      match to the individual's needs and capabilities. Furthermore, many of the existing programs&#xD;
      have not received empirical support from studies relying on good quality methodology and&#xD;
      there is a lack of evidence regarding their capacity to reduce cognitive decline and&#xD;
      dementia. Hence, previous studies have been limited by some or all of the following&#xD;
      methodological issues: 1) they most often relied on a small number of participants; 2) they&#xD;
      had time-limited follow-up; 3) many did not use a randomized controlled design or provided&#xD;
      limited information on their randomization process; 4) very few have assessed the participant&#xD;
      characteristics that define best responders (i.e., the profile of individuals that benefit&#xD;
      the most from the intervention). Another important aspect is that the programs that are&#xD;
      typically used in those studies are often not optimally adapted to seniors' needs and&#xD;
      preferences and are not grounded in real life, limiting adherence and generalization to&#xD;
      everyday life. Emotional and cognitive engagement refers to participants enjoying as well as&#xD;
      actively participating to the learning experience and has been shown to be a critical factor&#xD;
      in determining learning outcomes. Thus, our program will be designed to promote engagement,&#xD;
      which is absent in the previous studies. Finally, one other important gap is that there are&#xD;
      still a lot that is unknown about the brain processes involved in these interventions and how&#xD;
      they alter brain structure and/or function, especially in healthy older adults. Thus, an&#xD;
      additional important issue is to understand the brain plasticity processes resulting from&#xD;
      cognitive training. Brain plasticity refers to the remarkable ability of the central nervous&#xD;
      system to spontaneously re-organize or expand during normal learning processes, or to&#xD;
      self-repair in acute or progressive brain diseases. This is critical given that an increasing&#xD;
      number of studies has revealed that non-pharmacological interventions can have a positive&#xD;
      impact in AD and that intermediate mechanisms of neural plasticity and functional&#xD;
      compensation likely modulate the detrimental effect of the disease on symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will develop ENGAGE, a program to increase cognitive reserve and reduce&#xD;
      decline over a 2-year period in persons with a high risk of AD. The investigators propose a&#xD;
      multi-faceted intervention program meant to increase reserve by providing cognitive&#xD;
      stimulation through participation in engaging cognitive and leisure activities. This&#xD;
      ground-breaking program proposes for the first time to combine (1) hands-on training to&#xD;
      improve memory and attention through teaching strategies to optimize efficiency, and (2)&#xD;
      selected engaging leisure activities that are known to increase brain functions in younger&#xD;
      and older adults, such as learning music, learning a second language, and playing carefully&#xD;
      selected casual video-games. There are many reasons to combine brain training and leisure&#xD;
      activities. First, one limitation of brain training for memory and attention is that&#xD;
      participants sometimes fail to generalize the strategies learned in a lab setting and to&#xD;
      apply them in their everyday life. Thus, the investigators propose to practice these&#xD;
      strategies in the leisure activities, e.g., to learn information relevant to the music or&#xD;
      Spanish lessons. Providing natural, ecologically-valid situations to apply and practice the&#xD;
      cognitive strategies is done to train participants to use them more spontaneously outside the&#xD;
      formal brain training setting. Second, these leisure activities correspond to the cognitively&#xD;
      demanding activities that are identified as protective in epidemiological studies, and thus&#xD;
      likely to promote brain plasticity. Third, they are attractive and will therefore improve&#xD;
      motivation for training. The enjoyable characteristic of the leisure activities will also&#xD;
      make them attractive to older adults with lower education, a segment of population which may&#xD;
      especially benefit from such intervention. Finally, if proven effective, the training program&#xD;
      will have the important advantage of being easy to implement in the community and will be&#xD;
      relatively low-cost relative to formal health care. Another objective of this research&#xD;
      project is to provide recommendations regarding profiles of participants which may benefit&#xD;
      the most from the intervention. The investigators will thus measure whether the effect of the&#xD;
      training is modulated by sex differences as women have been suggested to have less brain&#xD;
      reserve than men as well as age, education or socio-cultural background, lifestyle habits,&#xD;
      genetic factors and other markers of cognitive reserve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team benefits from the contribution of clinicians and researchers from across&#xD;
      Canada who will combine their unique expertise on brain training and on the effects of&#xD;
      leisure activities on the brain to provide the most innovative and potentially meaningful&#xD;
      approach to cognitive intervention. Overall, this innovative program will provide brain&#xD;
      training through specific cognitive training and carefully selected leisure activities that&#xD;
      are known to have a positive impact on cognition and will be particularly attractive to older&#xD;
      adults from varied backgrounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop a multi-faceted intervention program that combines brain-based cognitive&#xD;
           training and engaging leisure activities to increase cognitive reserve.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine whether the program improves cognition and well-being, and prevents cognitive&#xD;
           decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess its effect on brain structure and function using structural and functional&#xD;
           Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if individual differences (demographics, reserve level, genetic background)&#xD;
           modulate outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide empirical evidence that cognitively-engaging activities provided later in life&#xD;
           can increase brain reserve, promote cognitive health and reduce cognitive decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses. The investigators hypothesize that participants who will be engaged in the&#xD;
      intervention program will show better behavioral and brain outcomes than participants from&#xD;
      the control group who will receive an active control program. More specifically, improved&#xD;
      behavioral performance following the intervention is expected in neuropsychological tests&#xD;
      measuring cognitive components that are targeted in the program (mainly memory and&#xD;
      attention), as well as a transfer effects to an ecologically-valid test measuring functioning&#xD;
      in a simulated real-life situation. The investigators also expect improvement in&#xD;
      participants' subjective evaluation of their proficiency and satisfaction with life&#xD;
      (questionnaires). Regarding retention of training benefits, the hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      experimental group will show better cognition at the follow up testing, 2 years from the&#xD;
      beginning of the study, and less cognitive decline when comparing 0- to 2-year performance.&#xD;
      Regarding fMRI testing, the investigators expect more task-related activation following&#xD;
      training and correlations between brain changes and cognitive gain, which would be considered&#xD;
      as a marker of enhanced neurocompensation processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. The consort guidelines will be used to organize and report the trial&#xD;
      (http://www.consort-statement.org). The study uses a randomized controlled double-blind&#xD;
      preference trial with a comprehensive cohort design. Outcomes will be tested by assessors who&#xD;
      will not be involved in the intervention, and who will be blind to training assignment. One&#xD;
      hundred forty-four (144) participants with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), but no&#xD;
      objective impairment based on cognitive tests, will be recruited and randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either the cognitive program (ENGAGE SPANISH or ENGAGE MUSIC) or the active control program&#xD;
      (ENGAGE DISCOVERY). Participants in the ENGAGE DISCOVERY program will undergo the same amount&#xD;
      of activities as proposed in the ENGAGE SPANISH/MUSIC programs, but those activities will be&#xD;
      designed not to be cognitively challenging. Behavioral measures (objective and subjective&#xD;
      measures of cognition and efficiency in everyday life functioning) as well as neuroimaging&#xD;
      measures (fMRI scan during a memory task) will be collected at 3 time points: before the&#xD;
      intervention (PRE), immediately after the intervention (POST-1), and 2 years after PRE&#xD;
      (POST-2). PRE tests will be administered within a 12-week window before the beginning of the&#xD;
      intervention. POST-1 and POST-2 will each be administered within a 8-week window.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure that participants will not be enrolled in an activity that they dislike, and thus&#xD;
      remain the 'leisure' aspect, they will be able to exclude either the 'Music' or 'Spanish'&#xD;
      activity prior to randomization to the intervention or control conditions. This was decided&#xD;
      to personalize the intervention as people vary considerably in how attracted they are by&#xD;
      different leisure activities, and to give participants a sense of choice, which was found to&#xD;
      reduce disappointment related to randomization, and thus to reduce attrition. This will be&#xD;
      done in a manner that will allow preserving double blindness. If participants who are&#xD;
      randomized in the cognitive program did not wish to exclude an activity, then a second&#xD;
      randomization will assign them in one of the 2 activities (either music or Spanish). Thus,&#xD;
      the training vs active control comparison is fully randomized but further comparison of the&#xD;
      two leisure activities will rely on a partially randomized comparison cohort. In that case,&#xD;
      the randomized cohorts will be first compared, followed by a comparison of the entire cohort,&#xD;
      including those in the preference arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this intervention will be analyzed at three-endpoints: 1) at baseline (PRE);&#xD;
      2) immediately after the intervention (POST-1); and 3) 2 years after baseline, i.e., about 18&#xD;
      months after the end of the intervention (POST-2).&#xD;
