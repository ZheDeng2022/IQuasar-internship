      This clinical investigation compares success rates for anatomically placed leads to&#xD;
      conventional, targeted lead placement for BurstDR™ during the trial evaluation period with&#xD;
      the St Jude Medical™ Invisible Trial System. Subjects will be blinded to treatment group and&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (AB): anatomic lead placement followed by BurstDR™ stimulation during an initial&#xD;
      trial evaluation period Group 2 (TB): targeted lead placement followed by BurstDR™&#xD;
      stimulation during an initial trial evaluation period&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject qualifies for permanent system implant according to pre-defined criteria after&#xD;
      the initial trial evaluation period, the subject will exit the clinical investigation and&#xD;
      continue their treatment per the physician's standard of care. Subjects who do not qualify&#xD;
      for permanent system implant according to pre-defined criteria after the initial trial&#xD;
      evaluation period may participate in an extended trial evaluation period, per physician&#xD;
      discretion, during which they will be programmed with tonic stimulation. Subjects continuing&#xD;
      to an extended trial evaluation period will be followed through the completion of the&#xD;
      extended trial period. At the end of the extended trial evaluation period, subjects will exit&#xD;
      the clinical investigation.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint is the qualification rate for permanent system implant at the end of the initial trial evaluation period.&#xD;
Qualification for permanent system implant was defined by a composite where all the following conditions were met:&#xD;
≥ 50% patient reported pain relief (PRP) at the end of the trial evaluation&#xD;
Trial evaluation period lasted for a minimum of 3 days&#xD;
Physician recommends subject for permanent system implant&#xD;
Subject reports a willingness to pursue a permanent system implant&#xD;
Subjects did not qualify for permanent system implant if they met both of the following:&#xD;
&lt; 50% PRP (patient reported pain relief) at the end of the trial evaluation&#xD;
Trial evaluation period lasted for a minimum of 5 days</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The subject enrollment for the DELIVERY study began on 22 September 2017, at 23 clinical sites in the United States, Europe, and Australia. A total of 270 subjects were randomized into the two treatment groups (Anatomic Lead Placement and Targeted lead placement).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 288 subjects were screened, of which 18 subjects were withdrawn before randomization due to unmet inclusion/exclusion criteria (n=6), withdrawal of the consent (n=11) and subject was on the clinic's wait list to receive an implant only after the study closed (n=1). The last follow-up visit occurred on 27 August 2018.</pre_assignment_details>
