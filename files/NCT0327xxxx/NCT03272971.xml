  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, single-arm, single-center, pilot study of bronchoscopic&#xD;
      Radio-Frequency Ablation (RFA) treatment of target lung lesions, prior to surgical tumor&#xD;
      resection. Up to ten (10) subjects will be treated at the investigational site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects identified for this study will be those that have a surgical resection already&#xD;
      scheduled as part of their lung cancer treatment. Patients who have consented to participate&#xD;
      in this study (enrolled) will undergo screening assessments to evaluate the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria associated with their lung cancer and general health. Only patients that meet all of&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be scheduled for RFA&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to RFA, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans will be used to characterize&#xD;
      the lesion and determine the access pathways for ablation. At the time of the RFA procedure,&#xD;
      a point-of-entry, along a bronchial wall, is created under an image-guided navigation system.&#xD;
      The RFA catheter is advanced down the access path until it reaches the tumor and RF is&#xD;
      administered at the prescribed dose. Upon completion of the RFA treatment, the subject is&#xD;
      immediately prepared for surgical resection in accordance with their lung cancer standard of&#xD;
      care. There are no follow-up visits as part of this study, the subject is excited following&#xD;
      surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resected tissue will undergo pathological evaluation for tissue viability.&#xD;
