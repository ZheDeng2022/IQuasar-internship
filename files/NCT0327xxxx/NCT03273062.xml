  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a follow-up study for an ongoing open label trial conducted by the Sheppard&#xD;
      Pratt-Lieber Research Institute utilizing the catechol-O-methyl-transferase (COMT) inhibitor&#xD;
      Tolcapone to evaluate its effects on cognition and neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with&#xD;
      brain injuries (BI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, investigators will conduct a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial&#xD;
      utilizing a crossover design to study the effects of two weeks of Tolcapone 200mg&#xD;
      administered three times a day (total of 600mg/day) on cognitive performance. Physical,&#xD;
      emotional, cognitive and social functioning will also be evaluated through participant and&#xD;
      proxy report. The investigators are planning to randomize a total of 12 patients with a&#xD;
      history of acquired brain injury (BI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a follow-up study for an ongoing open label trial conducted by the&#xD;
      Sheppard Pratt-Lieber Research Institute utilizing the catechol-O-methyl-transferase (COMT)&#xD;
      inhibitor Tolcapone to evaluate its effects on cognition and neuropsychiatric symptoms in&#xD;
      patients with brain injuries (BI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measures utilized in this study were chosen based on the available data from the&#xD;
      currently ongoing open-label clinical trial. The proposed study will utilize the same study&#xD;
      medication at the same dose and frequency. In addition, the length of administration of study&#xD;
      medication (two weeks) is identical. In the proposed study, investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial utilizing a crossover design to study the&#xD;
      effects of two weeks of Tolcapone 200mg administered three times a day (total of 600mg/day)&#xD;
      on cognitive performance. Physical, emotional, cognitive and social functioning will be&#xD;
      evaluated through participant and proxy report. The investigators are planning to randomize a&#xD;
      total of 12 patients with BI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cross-over design requires two 2-week long study periods during which the participant&#xD;
      receives either Tolcapone two 100mg capsules three times a day (total of 600mg/day) or&#xD;
      placebo. Participants will be randomly assigned to two sequence groups either starting with&#xD;
      Tolcapone treatment (T-P group) or placebo (P-T group). Investigators and participants will&#xD;
      be blind to the study group assignment and hence blind to the treatment (Tolcapone vs.&#xD;
      placebo) that subjects receive at a given time. The study periods are separated by a &quot;washout&#xD;
      period&quot; that is at least two weeks and maximally 4 weeks long to reduce the potential for&#xD;
      carryover effects. Patient reported outcomes will be obtained a total of four times, twice&#xD;
      prior to the start of each respective study period (Pre-Study Period Visits I &amp; II) as well&#xD;
      as at the end of each study period (Outcome Measures Visits I &amp; II). Cognitive outcome&#xD;
      measures will be obtained twice throughout the study, at the end of each respective study&#xD;
      period (Outcome Measures Visits I &amp; II).&#xD;
