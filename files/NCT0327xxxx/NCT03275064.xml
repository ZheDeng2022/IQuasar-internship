      The purpose of this two-part study is to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      multiple intra-articular (i.a.) injections of LNA043 in regenerating the articular surface in&#xD;
      patients with cartilage lesions of the knee (Part A) and knee osteoarthritis (Part B). In&#xD;
      Part A, this study aims to establish Proof of Concept (PoC), namely regeneration of the&#xD;
      articular cartilage, in order to provide information on the potential clinical utility of&#xD;
      LNA043, with the ultimate goal of replacing current surgical procedures for cartilage repair&#xD;
      with an injectable, less invasive regenerative therapy. In Part B, this study aims at further&#xD;
      evaluating the cartilage anabolic activity of LNA043 in a more severe knee OA population, and&#xD;
      at testing the potential benefit of a higher dose of LNA043 administered i.a. monthly instead&#xD;
      of weekly.&#xD;
