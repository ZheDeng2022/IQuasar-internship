      The purpose of this multi-site study is to evaluate the efficacy of a high omega-3/low&#xD;
      omega-6 dietary intervention (the H3-L6 Diet) vs. a Control Diet in reducing headache pain&#xD;
      and improving function in soldiers, veterans and military healthcare beneficiaries with&#xD;
      post-traumatic headache (PTH). In addition, the study will examine the effects of the diet&#xD;
      interventions on anti-nociceptive and pro-nociceptive lipid mediators derived from omega-3&#xD;
      and omega-6 fatty acids.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Migraine-like PTH is an ideal patient population to test the effects of the H3-L6&#xD;
      intervention for several reasons. First, although PTH is considered a secondary headache&#xD;
      syndrome, the fact that migraine-like PTH has a phenotype indistinguishable from primary&#xD;
      migraine disorders and shares common pain-related comorbidities (e.g. anxiety, depression)&#xD;
      suggests that shared biochemical mechanisms may underlie both conditions. Second, many PTH&#xD;
      patients experience poor or incomplete therapeutic responses to available treatments, often&#xD;
      while suffering from drug-related adverse effects. The prospect of improved headache outcomes&#xD;
      with concurrent reduction in medication use (as seen in the Chronic Daily Headache Trial) may&#xD;
      be particularly beneficial in PTH, since certain headache medications (e.g. opiates, muscle&#xD;
      relaxants, sleep aids) have cognitive side effects, which may worsen residual cognitive&#xD;
      impairment from Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While PTH is an important cause of disability after TBI, problems with memory, executive&#xD;
      function, depression, anxiety, irritability, fatigue, post-traumatic stress, and other&#xD;
      neurobehavioral disorders are also common after TBI and contribute to disability. The H3-L6&#xD;
      (High Omega-3 Low Omega-6) intervention increased circulating concentrations of several key&#xD;
      bioactive mediators which could hypothetically also have favorable effects on these&#xD;
      TBI-associated non-headache impairments associated with TBI combat injuries. Omega-3 fatty&#xD;
      acids have been widely studied in pre-clinical models and human TBI and demonstrate promising&#xD;
      evidence of both neuroprotective and neurorestorative efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential mechanisms include antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and pro-neurogenic effects. In&#xD;
      our pilot study, the H3-L6 intervention significantly increased circulating levels of&#xD;
      docosahexaenoic acid-eicosapentaenoic acid (DHA-EPA) , a potent stimulator of neurite growth&#xD;
      and synaptogenesis in hippocampus and other central nervous system (CNS) tissues.&#xD;
      Corresponding increases in the synaptamide biosynthesis in central nervous system tissues&#xD;
      could hypothetically assist cognitive and functional neurorecovery associated with traumatic&#xD;
      brain injury. Further, the reduction of proinflammatory metabolites of omega-6 fatty acids&#xD;
      may provide additional benefits beyond what can be achieved through omega-3 supplementation&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Type: Interventional, Phase 2, double blind Study Design: Allocation: Randomized,&#xD;
      parallel group Masking: Double Blind (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor) Primary&#xD;
      Purpose: Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and Objective: The investigators will obtain support for the following hypotheses&#xD;
      through three specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To compare the efficacy of the H3-L6 Diet to the Control Diet, in reducing&#xD;
      headache pain and improving headache-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Compared to the Control Diet, the H3-L6 Diet will produce significant&#xD;
      improvement in:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1a) the Headache Impact Test-a headache-specific quality of life measure-Primary Clinical&#xD;
      Outcome);&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1b) mean total Headache Hours per day; and&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1c) mean Severe Headache Hours per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To evaluate whether the H3-L6 Diet can increase circulating anti-nociceptive&#xD;
      omega-3 metabolites, and reduce pro-nociceptive omega-6 metabolites, in patients with&#xD;
      Posttraumatic Headaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Compared to the Control Diet, the H3-L6 Diet will produce significant increases&#xD;
      in anti-nociceptive omega-3 metabolites including 17-hydroxy DHA (Primary Biochemical Aim),&#xD;
      and reductions in pro-nociceptive omega-6 metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Outcomes Measures Specific Aim 3: To explore the potential of the H3-L6 intervention&#xD;
      for improving non-headache TBI outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Compared to the Control Diet, the H3-L6 Diet will produce significant&#xD;
      improvement in:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (3a) non-headache pain; (3b) depression/anxiety; (3c) symptoms of post-traumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder; (3d) cognitive function; (3e) sleep quality; and (3f) will significantly reduce the&#xD;
      use of acute pain medications. Enrollment: Up to 300 total participants enrolled among the 3&#xD;
      military sites for 120 12-week diet completers&#xD;
