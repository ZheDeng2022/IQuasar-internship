      Introduction Complications of diabetes, such as cardiovascular disease, are associated with&#xD;
      increased mortality among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. The presence of type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (T2DM) also increases the relative risk of developing cardiovascular disease in&#xD;
      women compared to men . Major cardiovascular disease risk factors that have been identified&#xD;
      in T2DM patients include arterial stiffening, endothelial dysfunction, hyperglycemia , and&#xD;
      elevated glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in T2 DM, due to&#xD;
      arterial structure and functional changes. Evaluation of vascular dysfunction in T2 DM&#xD;
      patients include: carotid intima media thickness (IMTc), pulse wave velocity (PWV), and&#xD;
      brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD). IMTc is increased in patients with T2 DM with&#xD;
      reductions in FMD, which have already been reported to be inversely and strongly related to&#xD;
      the extent of hyperglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of vascular complications is multifactorial and may not be explained by&#xD;
      hyperglycemia alone. Other presumably unrelated risk factors, such as hyperhomocysteinemia&#xD;
      may be involved in the atherothrombotic process. High levels of homocysteine have been&#xD;
      identified as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in T2DM patients. Levels of plasma&#xD;
      homocysteine increase in women after menopause, and postmenopausal diabetic women are&#xD;
      consequently at significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High concentrations of homocysteine are associated with increased low-density lipoprotein&#xD;
      oxidation, endothelial dysfunction, dysfunction of Î²-islet cells and inhibiting secretion of&#xD;
      insulin. Also, hyperhomocysteinemia was an independent risk factor for the occurrence of&#xD;
      diabetic peripheral neuropathy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In newly diagnosed normotensive T2DM patients, the left ventricular mass index (LVMI),&#xD;
      carotid intima media thickness (CIMT), and creatinine levels and 24-hr microalbuminuria were&#xD;
      used to determine cardiac, carotid, and kidney end-organ diseases, respectively. It was found&#xD;
      that, LVMI, CIMT, and creatinine level were positively correlated with the homocysteine&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, determinants of hyperhomocysteinemia, such as low concentrations of folate and&#xD;
      vitamin B12 involved in homocysteine metabolism are also associated with increased risk of&#xD;
      vascular damage. Folic acid supplementation may improve the cardiovascular health of&#xD;
      post-menopausal women with diabetes, reduce homocysteine levels and improve vascular health&#xD;
      in different study populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased plasma homocysteine, triglyceride and waist circumference as well as decreased&#xD;
      folic acid and vitamin B12 in type 2 diabetes mellitus were evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sudchada et al. concluded that folic acid supplementation in patient with T2DM may reduce&#xD;
      total homocysteine levels and have a trend to associate with better glycemic control compared&#xD;
      with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      in postmenopausal Korean women with type 2 diabetes mellitus, folic acid supplementation&#xD;
      reduced serum homocysteine levels, increased serum folate and vitamin B12 levels, and lowered&#xD;
      lipid parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A case-control study showed that low intakes of folate and B12 in type 2 diabetic patients&#xD;
      were associated with hyperhomocysteinemia. Additionally, folate has also been shown to&#xD;
      improve glycemic control by reducing glycosylated hemoglobin fasting blood glucose, serum&#xD;
      insulin and insulin resistance as well as homocysteinemia in type 2 diabetes patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Folic acid supplementation significantly reduced LDL-C levels as well as LDL-C/HDL-C and&#xD;
      TC/HDL-C ratios. The improvements in lipid parameters might be due to the reduction of serum&#xD;
      homocysteine levels caused by folic acid supplementation. In another study, associations&#xD;
      between fasting plasma homocysteine concentration and age, serum creatinine, and vitamin B12.&#xD;
      However, no association between folate and homocysteine was found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether serum homocysteine levels are associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) and the&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome (MS) needs investigation in different ethnic groups. High serum&#xD;
      homocysteine and low folate levels are associated in Turkish men independently with coronary&#xD;
      heart disease, which needs confirmation in a larger sample. In women, vitamin B12&#xD;
      concentrations are significantly associated with metabolic syndrome likelihood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      there is no support that metformin consumption increases homocysteine secondary to folate and&#xD;
      /or B12 deficiency in patients with T2DM. Also, among adults with hypertension with no&#xD;
      history of stroke and/or myocardial infarction, folic acid supplementation had no significant&#xD;
      effect on the risk of new-onset diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, clinical studies have shown that folic acid therapy is not very effective in&#xD;
      normalizing hyperhomocysteinemia in uremic patients. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that&#xD;
      vitamin B12 supplementation alone, or in combination with folic acid, decreases total&#xD;
      homocysteine concentrations, but full normalization is not achieved. folate levels were&#xD;
      comparable to controls at various chronic kidney disease stages, whereas vitamin B12 levels&#xD;
      were lower, except at stage IV in patients with T2DM. They did not find any correlation&#xD;
      between B-vitamins and levels of total homocysteine and cysteine, regardless of the CKD&#xD;
      stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate cardiovascular changes in type 2 diabetic postmenopausal women through&#xD;
           measurement of vascular parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the possible changes in some metabolic features in type 2 diabetic&#xD;
           postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To relate, if found, the degree of metabolic changes to the extent in vascular&#xD;
           parameters changes in type 2 diabetic postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study and its design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects:&#xD;

      will be recruited. The diabetic participants will receive their treatment for T2DM (oral&#xD;
      hypoglycemic agents or insulin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients receiving hormone replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
