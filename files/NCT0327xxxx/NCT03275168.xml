  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot project will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary&#xD;
      effectiveness of a couples-based behavioral intervention [COUPLES] that augments individual&#xD;
      evidence-based interventions with joint health education counseling for STI-affected AYA&#xD;
      dyads within a primary care setting.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While public health programs have demonstrated modest success in reducing the adolescent and&#xD;
      young adult (AYA) risk for STI/HIV, significant health disparities remain. The risk of&#xD;
      STI/HIV is not uniform among AYA. AYA residing in segregated urban communities with high STI&#xD;
      prevalence and complicated sexual networks face even greater risk for disease and associated&#xD;
      complications. Additional supports designed to increase engagement in care and reduce STI&#xD;
      acquisition and transmissions are urgently needed to meet the sexual health and reproductive&#xD;
      health goals for the nation. Overwhelmingly, AYA STI prevention interventions have targeted&#xD;
      individuals and individual-level factors. While effective, these interventions do not&#xD;
      adequately address other important influences affecting AYA risk for STI/HIV, such as partner&#xD;
      or relationship influences on sexual decision-making and behavior. Partner notification and&#xD;
      treatment is a key strategy for disease control and has previously been tested among adults&#xD;
      for STI/HIV prevention work but has yet to be evaluated for AYA. Our prior research&#xD;
      demonstrates that AYAs with complicated STIs are likely to notify their partners to seek&#xD;
      treatment (88-92%); however, AYAs receiving brief behavioral interventions, relative to those&#xD;
      receiving standard of care were 3 times more likely to be successful in arranging for their&#xD;
      partner's treatment. Thus, partner interventions may hold promise for harnessing the power of&#xD;
      relationship dynamics to enhance sexual decision-making, communication, and subsequent health&#xD;
      behaviors. The investigators propose to pilot test an intervention designed to change sexual&#xD;
      health outcomes by understanding partners and the learning environment related to sex&#xD;
      [COUPLES] by simultaneously delivering two evidence-based STI/HIV prevention interventions&#xD;
      Sister-to-Sister Teen and Focus on the Future. The simultaneous delivery of effective&#xD;
      interventions will be augmented with a joint partner health education counseling session&#xD;
      focused on enhancing communication and negotiation of safe sexual practices within the&#xD;
      relationship. If successful, this pilot will support the development of a larger trial&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in the busy primary care setting by&#xD;
      providing evidence that AYA can and will safely engage their partners in a supportive primary&#xD;
      care setting that integrates high quality treatment with evidence-based STI/HIV prevention&#xD;
      interventions delivered by health educator teams.&#xD;
