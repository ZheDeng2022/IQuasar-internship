      This study is an open-label, single-center, randomized, comparative phase IV clinical trial.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of concomitant&#xD;
      administration of EV71 vaccine manufactured by Sinovac (Beijing) Vaccine Technology Co., Ltd.&#xD;
      with recombinant hepatitis B vaccine/Group A meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine. 780&#xD;
      healthy infants of 6 months old as participants are randomly assigned into three experimental&#xD;
      groups in the ratio 1:1:1. The group I receive EV71 Vaccine (first dose)&amp; recombinant&#xD;
      hepatitis B vaccine on day 0 and EV71 vaccine (second dose)&amp; Group A meningococcal&#xD;
      polysaccharide vaccine on day 30. The group II receive recombinant hepatitis B vaccine on day&#xD;
      0 and Group A meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine on day 30. The group III receive the first&#xD;
      and second dose of EV71 Vaccine on day 0 and day 30 respectively.&#xD;
