  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research will utilise an open feasibility parallel groups trial to examine the impact of&#xD;
      novel internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) interventions for stress,&#xD;
      anxiety, and depression compared to treatment as usual (face to face counselling and&#xD;
      psychotherapy) in an employment context. Participants will consist of employees accessing&#xD;
      services provided by employee assistance programmes (EAP) provided at the European&#xD;
      headquarters of a large technology organisation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be recruited for the online intervention through either self-referral or a&#xD;
      referral from one of the counsellors or GPs at the onsite well-being service centre.&#xD;
      Participants in the face-to-face group will be recruited by referral from a member of the&#xD;
      EAP; those on the waiting list for face-to-face services provided by the EAP will be&#xD;
      approached to participate in the research. At baseline, participants in both the online and&#xD;
      the face-to-face groups will complete sociodemographic information, the PHQ-4, PSS-4, the&#xD;
      HPQ-SF, as well as an assessment of risk using question 9 from the PHQ-9. Eligible&#xD;
      participants in the online intervention group will be offered one of three internet-delivered&#xD;
      CBT interventions (Space from Stress, Space from Anxiety, Space from Depression).&#xD;
      Participants attending the onsite EAP counselling service will receive 8 sessions of&#xD;
      counselling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened at baseline for risk. This assessment will be conducted through&#xD;
      the response to question 9 on the PHQ-9, in which respondents are requested to indicate how&#xD;
      often they have been bothered by &quot;thoughts that you would be better off dead or of harming&#xD;
      yourself in some way&quot; rated on a 4-point Likert scale, with 0 indicated &quot;not at all&quot;, 1 =&#xD;
      &quot;several days&quot;, 2 = &quot;more than half the days&quot;, 3 = &quot;nearly every day&quot;. Any participant who&#xD;
      scores &gt; 1 will be automatically prompted to answer additional questions to qualify the level&#xD;
      of risk indicated. These questions include &quot;Do you have any current plans to end your life?&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;Have you made any actual preparations towards ending your life?&quot; answered in a simple&#xD;
      &quot;yes/no&quot; format and &quot;how likely is it that you will act on these thoughts or plans to end&#xD;
      your life&quot; rated on a 0=10 scale with 0 indicating &quot;I would never do this&quot; and 10 indicating&#xD;
      &quot;I am definitely going to do this&quot;. Participants are also asked an open-ended question about&#xD;
      their protective factors &quot;what is stopping you from acting on these thoughts?&quot;. If any risk&#xD;
      to self or others is highlighted, the participant will be immediately provided with crisis&#xD;
      contact numbers (GP Out of Hours, Samaritans, Aware, Pieta House, Women's Aid, Amen) through&#xD;
      the platform, and encouraged to contact these services directly if they feel in crisis. In&#xD;
      addition, participants who indicate risk at baseline will be recommended that they contact&#xD;
      the onsite GP or one of the counsellors at the onsite wellness centre. Those who exceed the&#xD;
      cut-off score for risk ( &gt;1 PHQ-9 Question 9) on the screening questions will not be eligible&#xD;
      to participate in the study and will be able to access support from the onsite GP and /or the&#xD;
      counselling team at the onsite wellness centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of the trial, all supporters who are trained mental health practitioners&#xD;
      will remain alert for indications of risk and will escalate concerns within the established&#xD;
      supervision governance structure in an appropriate time frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment, participants in both the online interventions and the face-to-face&#xD;
      intervention will complete the PHQ-4 and PSS-4. At the end of the treatment, participants&#xD;
      will be asked to complete the PHQ-4, PSS-4, SAT, and the HPQ-SF. These measures will also be&#xD;
      completed at 4-months follow-up. A mixed-method approach will be used to include quantitative&#xD;
      and qualitative analysis of symptom severity, work performance, and user satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of the online interventions (Space from Depression, Space from Anxiety, Space from&#xD;
      Stress) consists of 8 modules of internet-delivered CBT, delivered over an 8-week period.&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned a supporter who will provide weekly post-session feedback on&#xD;
      progress and exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Support for this trial will be provided by Nuffield Health clinical support services.&#xD;
      Nuffield Clinical Support Services is an established clinical service that provides support&#xD;
      through Nuffield Health's Employee Assistance Programmes. The service is composed of British&#xD;
      Association of Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapists (BABCP) accredited cognitive&#xD;
      behavioural psychotherapists. They also have a small group of psychological well-being&#xD;
      practitioners who are also British Association of Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapists&#xD;
      (BABCP) accredited or currently in supervised training for accreditation. Each supporter will&#xD;
      provide post-session feedback of between 10 and 15 minutes per participant per session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule of Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete the primary and secondary outcome measures at baseline.&#xD;
      Thereafter, they will complete the PHQ-4 and PSS-4 at each counselling or online review&#xD;
      session. Once participants have completed treatment, they will be contacted to complete both&#xD;
      the primary and secondary outcome measures. Satisfaction with treatment will be measured&#xD;
      post-treatment at 4-month follow-up, where participants will complete the PHQ-4, PSS-4 and&#xD;
      HPQ-SF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility of Internet-delivered interventions for stress, anxiety and depression as&#xD;
      part of the organization's EAP will be evaluated based on participant recruitment, enrollment&#xD;
      and retention rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness over time of Internet-delivered interventions for the treatment of stress,&#xD;
      anxiety and depression will be determined independently using linear mixed models. Stress&#xD;
      severity will be measured using PSS-4 scores, depression and anxiety severity using PHQ-4&#xD;
      scores. In addition, sociodemographic characteristics will be assessed at baseline and&#xD;
      factors significantly associated with treatment groups incorporated in the analysis model if&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of an internet-delivered intervention on workplace absence and job performance&#xD;
      will be determined through the collection of HPQ-SF measures pre-treatment, immediately&#xD;
      post-treatment and at 4-month follow-up. HPQ-SF absenteeism and presenteeism scores will be&#xD;
      analysed using repeated measures ANOVA to detect differences at each time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Employee satisfaction with an internet-delivered intervention will be assessed in the&#xD;
      Satisfaction with Treatment Questionnaire. Quantitative and qualitative measures of&#xD;
      satisfaction will be summarised using descriptive statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Internet-delivered intervention group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registered employees of the company will be eligible to participate in this study and will be&#xD;
      recruited through the services their EAP provide. Participants may also be referred to the&#xD;
      internet-delivered intervention by their general practitioner or other mental health&#xD;
      professionals within the EAP. Interested participants will be able to log on to the&#xD;
      SilverCloud Platform, where they can read the participant information sheet. Participants in&#xD;
      the face-to-face group will be given a hard copy of the participant information sheet. This&#xD;
      will detail what is involved with the study, the procedure, and how to proceed. Should&#xD;
      participants agree to take part in the research, they will be requested to indicate their&#xD;
      informed consent digitally. Participants will then complete the baseline measures.&#xD;
      Participants excluded at this stage based on their risk assessment scores will be directed to&#xD;
      the appropriate services within the EAP, for example, to the GP or face-to-face counselling&#xD;
      services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using computer algorithms to score screening instruments at baseline, participants will be&#xD;
      automatically provided with feedback on their measures (e.g. your scores indicate you may be&#xD;
      experiencing moderate symptoms of depression). This feedback consists of informing the&#xD;
      participant of their overall score for each measure and highlight the individual as the&#xD;
      expert in their own life. All participants in the Internet-delivered intervention group will&#xD;
      make an informed decision on choosing one of the three programmes, based on the combination&#xD;
      of scores from the depression, anxiety, and stress scales. Participants will then self-select&#xD;
      one of the three programmes: Space from Depression, Space from Anxiety, Space from Stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant in the Internet-delivered intervention group will be assigned a supporter&#xD;
      who will monitor participant's progress throughout the trial. Once a participant begins their&#xD;
      chosen programme, they will receive a message from their supporter at their first log-in.&#xD;
      This message welcomes them to the programme, highlights aspects of it and encourages them in&#xD;
      the use of it. Weekly, supporters will log in and review participants progress, leaving&#xD;
      feedback for them and responding to the work they have completed. Supporters will be BABCP&#xD;
      accredited cognitive behavioural psychotherapists and psychological well-being practitioners&#xD;
      who are also BABCP accredited or currently in supervised training for accreditation, provided&#xD;
      by Nuffield Health EAP clinical support services. Each supporter will provide post-session&#xD;
      feedback of between 10 and 15 minutes per participant per session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Face to face counselling/psychotherapy group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the trial starts, those beginning face-to-face services will be approached to&#xD;
      participate in the research by a member of the EAP. Those who wish to participate will then&#xD;
      sign a paper/ digital on iPad consent form and will complete measures at baseline and&#xD;
      post-treatment, as per the schedule of assessment. Risk will be monitored by the clinician&#xD;
      responsible for the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an open feasibility trial that uses standard instruments to assess symptoms of&#xD;
      anxiety, depression and stress and adjustment psychopathology. It does this using reliable&#xD;
      and valid instruments, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) a self-report measure of depression and anxiety that has&#xD;
      been widely used in screening, primary care, and research. The PHQ-4 items reflect the&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria for depression outlined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of&#xD;
      Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition - Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4): a self-report measure of non-specific perceived stress. Based&#xD;
      on Lazarus's transactional model of stress respondents rate how unpredictable,&#xD;
      uncontrollable, and overloaded they appraise their life to be. Items are answered on a&#xD;
      5-point Likert scale (0= never, 1=almost never, 2=sometimes, 3=fairly often, 4=very often)&#xD;
      referring to the past month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health and Work Performance Questionnaire - Short Form: a brief self-report measure designed&#xD;
      to estimate the workplace costs of health difficulties in two domains: absenteeism and&#xD;
      reduced job performance. Validation studies have demonstrated significant correlations&#xD;
      between self-reported HPQ scores and archival pay roll and performance assessments. The HPQ&#xD;
      has been demonstrated to be valid, reliable and sensitive to change and recommended for use&#xD;
      in Internet-delivered environments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Satisfaction with Treatment (SAT) Questionnaire: includes nine quantitative items rated on a&#xD;
      scale from 0 to 4 (e.g., How did this online treatment compare to previous treatments? 0 =&#xD;
      'Much better' to 4 = 'Not at all good'). The Satisfaction with Treatment questionnaire also&#xD;
      contains two qualitative questions asking participants to describe what they liked most and&#xD;
      least about the Internet-delivered intervention.&#xD;
