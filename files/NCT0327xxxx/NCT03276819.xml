      This is a multicenter minimal risk or burden prospective 3-cohort follow-up and monitoring&#xD;
      study that aims to collect clinical, socio-psychological, medico-economics data and&#xD;
      biospecimens for patients with oral potentially malignant lesions (OPML) or resectable head&#xD;
      and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort A: OPML patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort B (specific design): smokers (adults who have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in&#xD;
           their lifetime) motivated to quit - either current smokers (who currently smokes&#xD;
           cigarettes every day (daily) or some days (nondaily)) or former smokers (adults who have&#xD;
           smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, but say they currently do not smoke)&#xD;
           who stops smoking within 3 months prior to the diagnosis - with a resectable HNSCC&#xD;
           requiring postoperative radiotherapy or chemoradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort C: Patients with resectable HNSCC non-eligible to cohort B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is the identification of biomarkers (predictive of&#xD;
      malignant transformation or second primary tumor) and new strategies for prevention and&#xD;
      therapy, mainly through extensive genomic, epigenomic and immune characterization of OPML and&#xD;
      HNSCC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this study is to reduce the incidence of HNSCC which may impact as well&#xD;
      other smoking-related cancers. It may be interesting to foster excellent translational&#xD;
      research towards the target of reducing the incidence of HNSCC by developing a global and&#xD;
      personalized approach for prevention and treatment of HNSCC. The only way to reach this goal&#xD;
      is to develop an ambitious program that coordinates the efforts of experts from various&#xD;
      fields (surgeons, medical oncologists and addictologists, scientists, sociologists and&#xD;
      economists) that will work together toward the same goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study intends to gather a large scale clinical, sociological, psychological data&#xD;
      gathering combined to a unique set of biospecimens collected prospectively including oral&#xD;
      preneoplastic disease and resectable HNSCC. This represents a unique setting to develop&#xD;
      multidisciplinary studies including a translational research component (validation and&#xD;
      discovery of biomarkers, high throughput molecular studies to understand the dynamics of&#xD;
      molecular changes and identify new strategies for prevention), a sociopsychological component&#xD;
      and an addiction component that aim to increase the percentage of patients entering a process&#xD;
      of weaning, as well as a medico-economics component that intend to evaluate the impact of new&#xD;
      approaches that may emerge from our work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, this study proposes to prospectively collect clinical, sociopsychological,&#xD;
      medico-economics data and biospecimens in patients included in 3 different cohorts. Cohort A&#xD;
      will include patients with OPML, either from smokers/drinkers (S/D) or&#xD;
      non-smokers/non-drinkers (NS/ND), while cohort B and C will include patients with HNSCC&#xD;
      eligible to upfront surgical resection. Patients in cohort B will be included in an&#xD;
      interventional randomized clinical trial evaluating an intensive and sustained smoking&#xD;
      cessation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with OPML, no standard workup and treatment plan is recommended. OPMLs biopsy is&#xD;
      important to identify patients with high grade dysplasia and in situ carcinoma who should&#xD;
      undergo surgical resection of the OMPLs if possible. Although LOH status in OPML biopsies or&#xD;
      buccal brushes has been evaluated in this population as a biomarker of risk to develop oral&#xD;
      cancer, it is not routinely performed. More studies are required to validate their value as a&#xD;
      biomarker of risk in a prospective setting and to identify the best set of biomarkers. In&#xD;
      smokers and/or excessive alcohol drinkers, it is critical to counsel and help patients quit&#xD;
      and it should be part of the standard of care. Unfortunately, this is not always the case.&#xD;
      Studies of chemopreventive agents have not resulted in the development of an intervention&#xD;
      that can be considered as standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the accumulated knowledge, no comprehensive molecular characterization of OPML is&#xD;
      available. Identification of new targets for prevention and therapy, mainly with genomic,&#xD;
      epigenomic and immune characterization of OPML is critical. Cohort A will allow to&#xD;
      prospectively collect clinical information and biospecimens (biopsies, buccal brushes and&#xD;
      saliva). These unique resources will allow to confirm the value of LOH as a biomarker of risk&#xD;
      and develop standardized procedures for sample processing that can be transferred in the&#xD;
      routine setting, validate or identify other biomarkers and improve risk assessments beyond&#xD;
      LOH, to understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of molecular changes that may help&#xD;
      predicting oral cancer risk, identify relevant targets and suggest new chemoprevention&#xD;
      strategies including immunoprevention interventions. Furthermore, patients included in this&#xD;
      cohort will benefit from standardized care plans and state of the art smoking and alcohol&#xD;
      cessation programs according to current recommendations, and will be given the opportunity to&#xD;
      participate in future chemoprevention studies that may be embedded in the near future in the&#xD;
      umbrella protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with resectable HNSCC (cohorts B and C), smoking and alcohol cessation is one&#xD;
      important step in the management. They allow reducing treatment-related morbidity and&#xD;
      improving radiation and chemoradiation efficacy. It is tempting to believe that they may also&#xD;
      improve patients' quality of life as in the general population, and reduce the risk of second&#xD;
      primary tumor (SPT). Available data focusing on patients with HNSCC and smoking cessation is&#xD;
      scarce. Although the diagnosis and treatment of patients with HNSCC favors smoking cessation,&#xD;
      a significant proportion of former smokers are actively smoking during follow-up despite&#xD;
      having completed treatments associated with substantial morbidity. The literature review&#xD;
      shows that the range of patients that continue to smoke at one year is in the range of&#xD;
      21-41%. Of note, those smoking quit rates at one year are based on patient self-reporting&#xD;
      without biological confirmation in the majority of the cases, which clearly overestimates&#xD;
      quit rates. Smoking cessation programs currently available lead to disappointing results.&#xD;
      HNSCC patients with smoking addiction harbor the highest risk of SPTs. In this vulnerable&#xD;
      population, beyond early management of nicotine dependence, new strategies / innovative&#xD;
      interventional approaches are warranted. Preliminary results from a monocentric study&#xD;
      indicate that an active intervention in this challenging population may lead to encouraging&#xD;
      results in motivated patients. Furthermore, an intensive smoking cessation program&#xD;
      implemented during radiation therapy is feasible in this population of patients. In cohort B,&#xD;
      the efficacy of an intensive and sustained smoking cessation program in a randomized cohort&#xD;
      of these patients at highest risk with potentially curable HNSCC (cohort B) will be&#xD;
      evaluated, with the hypothesis that an intensive and sustained smoking cessation program led&#xD;
      by an addictologist or a tobacco treatment specialist (TTS) during radiation therapy may&#xD;
      improve the 6- and 12-month quite-rate compared with a minimal tobacco cessation&#xD;
      intervention. Among secondary objectives of this trial, medico-economics information will be&#xD;
      gathered to provide an initial assessment of the cost-effectiveness of the experimental&#xD;
      versus standard arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort C will allow prospective collection of clinical information and biospecimens&#xD;
      (biopsies, buccal brushes and saliva) only. Patients will benefit from state of the art&#xD;
      smoking and alcohol cessation programs according to current recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Well-annotated cohorts of patients with HNSCC are scarce. Information and biospecimens&#xD;
      collected in cohorts B and C will provide unique resources to identify biomarkers of risk of&#xD;
      recurrence and SPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having access to large scale information and to biospecimens in patients with preneoplastic&#xD;
      disease (cohort A) who may or may not develop smoking/alcohol related cancers, and with HNSCC&#xD;
      (cohorts B and C) who may develop disease recurrence or SPT, represent a unique opportunity&#xD;
      to understand the dynamics of molecular changes and their interaction with smoking cessation&#xD;
      and/or alcohol withdrawal.&#xD;
