  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although several large well designed clinical trials have shown that erythropoietin which is&#xD;
      commonly used to treat anemia associated with kidney disease, increases the risk of stroke&#xD;
      and heart disease, the mechanism for this increased risk is unknown. The investigators'&#xD;
      preliminary studies show that the adverse effects of erythropoietin are from activation of&#xD;
      the heterodimeric erythropoietin/ beta common receptor which only occurs with high doses of&#xD;
      erythropoietin. The investigators propose a clinical trial of 120 patients assigned to low&#xD;
      doses of erythropoietin given more frequently or the same cumulative dose of erythropoietin&#xD;
      administered as a high dose once every two weeks and assess effects on the beta common&#xD;
      receptor activation, inflammation and vascular disease as evidence by MRI of the carotid&#xD;
      arteries.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Erythropoietin (EPO) is the most widely prescribed cytokine, yet the benefits and potential&#xD;
      side effects of different dosing regimens are poorly understood. It is now recognized that&#xD;
      erythropoietin administered at high doses to patients with chronic kidney disease, results in&#xD;
      an increased risk of morbidity and mortality from heart disease and stroke. However, the&#xD;
      mechanisms that mediate this increased risk of cardiovascular disease is not known. There are&#xD;
      two receptors for erythropoietin the homodimeric EPO receptor (EPOR) and the heterodimeric&#xD;
      beta common receptor ( CR)/EPOR. The investigators have demonstrated that activation of the&#xD;
      heterodimeric CR/EPOR only occurs with high doses of EPO. Our exciting, published,&#xD;
      preliminary data also demonstrates that the CR is in a complex with vascular endothelial&#xD;
      growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and that high doses of EPO activate VEGFR-2 through the&#xD;
      CR, resulting in the deleterious effects of VEGFR-2 activation on the cardiovascular system.&#xD;
      This is particularly important in patients with kidney disease since they are already at a&#xD;
      high risk of cardiovascular disease. Moreover in advanced kidney disease cyanate derived from&#xD;
      the high urea levels can non-enzymatically form an amide bond with EPO. This carbamylated EPO&#xD;
      (cEPO) has no effect on hemoglobin, but still activates the heterodimeric CR/EPOR. To date&#xD;
      there have been no studies that have directly measured levels of cEPO or activation of the&#xD;
      CR/EPOR in patients with kidney disease. Our hypothesis is that the administration of&#xD;
      low-doses of EPO more frequently will result in lower levels of total and carbamylated&#xD;
      erythropoietin decreased activation of VEGFR-2 via the heterodimeric CR/EPOR and consequently&#xD;
      decreased inflammation and atherosclerosis. The investigators will directly test this&#xD;
      hypothesis by randomly allocating 120 patients with chronic kidney disease to either low-&#xD;
      dose EPO given thrice weekly or the same cumulative dose, a high-dose, administered once&#xD;
      every 2 weeks. Our hypothesis predicts that low-dose EPO will be as effective at correcting&#xD;
      anemia, but will demonstrate less progression of carotid artery plaque, as assessed by&#xD;
      non-contrast magnetic resonance imaging, as compared to the high-dose, EPO given every 2&#xD;
      weeks. To delineate how EPO affects blood vessels, the investigators will isolate endothelial&#xD;
      cells from blood vessels in 20 patients who are assigned to low-dose EPO and 20 allocated to&#xD;
      high-dose EPO. Within these cells the investigators will investigate the signaling pathways&#xD;
      that are triggered by activation of CR/EPOR. In a substudy of 20 subjects with kidney disease&#xD;
      randomized to low-dose EPO or to high-dose EPO, as well as 20 healthy controls receiving a&#xD;
      single dose of high- or low-dose EPO, the investigators will determine how kidney function&#xD;
      and dosing affects levels of total and carbamylated erythropoietin. The investigators' study&#xD;
      will not only provide us with a thorough understanding of the mechanism by which EPO mediates&#xD;
      the increased risk of atherosclerosis, but a clinical strategy to avoid the side effects of&#xD;
      EPO therapy and a tool to quantify the cardiovascular risk of EPO and newer erythropoiesis&#xD;
      stimulating agents by assessing activation of the heterodimeric CR/EPOR.&#xD;
