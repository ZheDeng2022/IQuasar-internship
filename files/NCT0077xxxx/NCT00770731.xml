      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of Torisel&#xD;
      (temsirolimus), Hycamtin (topotecan hydrochloride), and Velcade (bortezomib) that can be&#xD;
      given, in combination, to patients with advanced cancer that has spread or is unable to be&#xD;
      surgically removed. The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temsirolimus is designed to block pathways that control important events such as the growth&#xD;
      of blood vessels that are vital for the growth of cancer. This may cause cancer cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topotecan hydrochloride is designed to block the function of important proteins in cancer&#xD;
      cells. These proteins, when active, allow a cell's genes to duplicate and for the cancer&#xD;
      cells to divide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bortezomib is designed to block the function of important proteins in cancer cells. These&#xD;
      proteins control the destruction of proteins in tumor cells, which is important for their&#xD;
      growth. This may cause cancer cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Dose Level:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be enrolled into a group&#xD;
      of about 3-6 participants that are receiving the same drug combination. The first group of&#xD;
      participants will receive the lowest dose of the drug combination. The next group of&#xD;
      participants will receive the next highest dose of the drug combination. The third group will&#xD;
      receive an even higher dose than that. This process will continue until the study doctor&#xD;
      finds the highest safe dose of the drug combination. The dose that you receive will depend on&#xD;
      when you are enrolled in this study and the safety data that is available at that time. The&#xD;
      dose that you receive may be lowered if you do not tolerate the study drug combination well.&#xD;
      You will not receive any doses of the study drug higher than the dose you are first assigned&#xD;
      to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the highest tolerated dose is found, up to 10 more participants will be added at that&#xD;
      dose level. This is called an Expansion Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temsirolimus, topotecan, and bortezomib will be given in &quot;cycles.&quot; Cycles will be about 21&#xD;
      days long or longer, depending on any side effects you may experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle, you will receive temsirolimus through a needle in your&#xD;
      vein over about 30-60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1 and 8 of each cycle, you will receive topotecan hydrochloride by vein over about&#xD;
      30-60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of each cycle, you will receive bortezomib by vein over less than 1&#xD;
      minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While on study you will not be able to take any drugs that may interfere with the study&#xD;
      drugs. You should talk with your doctor before taking any non-study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a week during Cycle 1, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in the Expansion Group, then during Week 3 of Cycle 1, you will have a tumor&#xD;
      biopsy to compare the activity of the tumor before treatment and after treatment has begun.&#xD;
      This is done for research purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in the Expansion Group, then 24-48 hours after starting Week 1 of Cycle 1, you&#xD;
      will have a bone marrow aspiration performed. The tissue will be used to see how the study&#xD;
      drug combination acts in the body and to learn the effect it may have on cancer cells. This&#xD;
      is done for research purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Week 1 of Cycle 2, you will have an ECG. After this, you will have extra ECGs if the&#xD;
      doctor thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Week 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, urine may be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once every 2 cycles (Cycles 2, 4, 6, and so on), you will have a CT or MRI scan to check the&#xD;
      status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FDG-PET Scans:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 2-3 months while you are on study and before Cycle 1 if you have not had a FDG-PET&#xD;
      within the last 1 month, you may have a FDG-PET scan. You must fast for at least 6 hours&#xD;
      before the FDG-PET scan. If you are a diabetic, you must fast for at least 4 hours before the&#xD;
      FDG-PET scan. If it is needed, you may take drugs or drink water. The FDG-PET will be used to&#xD;
      see if the activity of the cancers decreased with the drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive a small amount of FDG solution by vein. You will then rest in a quiet&#xD;
      darkened room for 45-60 minutes before the PET scan. Pictures of your body will be taken&#xD;
      using a PET scanner, which will about take 1 1/2 hours. The entire procedure should take&#xD;
      about 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each time you have a FDG-PET scan, blood (either a finger stick or about 1 teaspoon) will be&#xD;
      drawn to measure your blood sugar levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be on study for as long as you are benefiting. You will be taken off study if the&#xD;
      disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Treatment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you are off study, you will have an end-of-treatment visit. At this visit, the&#xD;
      following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Temsirolimus, topotecan, and bortezomib are all FDA&#xD;
      approved and commercially available. Temsirolimus is FDA approved for the treatment of renal&#xD;
      cell cancer. Topotecan hydrochloride is FDA approved for the treatment of ovarian, small cell&#xD;
      lung, and cervical cancers. Bortezomib is FDA approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma&#xD;
      and mantle cell lymphoma. The use of these drugs together is investigational and authorized&#xD;
      for use in research only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 80 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
