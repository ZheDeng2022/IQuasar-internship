      Background: Stem cell transplantation (SCT) is associated with pulmonary complications and&#xD;
      may lead to high morbidity and mortality. We encountered several children post-SCT with a&#xD;
      clinical picture suggestive of airway hyper-reactivity (AHR) and evidence of reversible&#xD;
      airway obstruction that was not reported pre-transplant. Our aim was to determine if SCT&#xD;
      induced AHR as assessed by methacholine challenge test (MCT) and to determine any correlation&#xD;
      between AHR and pulmonary complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Prospective study evaluating consecutive patients referred for SCT to the Department&#xD;
      of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology at Meyer Children's Hospital. Evaluation included pulmonary&#xD;
      function test and methacholine challenge test before and after the transplantation, and&#xD;
      assessment of pulmonary complications.&#xD;

      We encountered several children post SCT with clinical picture suggestive of airway&#xD;
      hyper-reactivity (AHR) by spirometric evidence of reversible airway obstruction that was not&#xD;
      reported pre transplantation. Our question was if AHR is present but undiagnosed pre BMT or&#xD;
      AHR is developed post transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim was to determine if BMT induces AHR as assessed by methacholine challenge test (MCT)&#xD;
      and to determine a possible correlation between AHR and pulmonary complications. The study&#xD;
      was Prospective. Subjects: consecutive patients were referred for pulmonary function tests&#xD;
      (PFT's); MCT and clincical evaluation before SCT and were followed after transplantation for&#xD;
      at least a year. The study was approved by the ethics committee and parental consent was&#xD;
      obtained. Clnical evaluation included medical history: type of disease, previous&#xD;
      chemo/radiotherapy. Type of SCT was recorded (allogeneic/ autologous). respiratory evaluation&#xD;
      included: Respiratory history; previous asthma medications; allergy/ parental smoking;&#xD;
      Physical exam; CXR O2-Sat. on rest and exercise. PFT's included: Spirometry, lung volumes,&#xD;
      diffusion capacity; MCT prior and 2-6 months post SCT; Follow-up: 6-12 months post SCT.&#xD;
      Pulmonary complication: Any respiratory symptoms or signs: cough, SOB, hemoptysis, hypoxemia;&#xD;
      New chest radiological finding; Number of hospitalizations due to pulmonary complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics: Sample size-26 patients to detect an increase of 0.5SD in AHR with a power of&#xD;
      80%. No. of children with AHR before and after SCT.; Pulmonary complications and AHR:&#xD;
      hospitalizations for pulmonary complications and AHR.&#xD;
