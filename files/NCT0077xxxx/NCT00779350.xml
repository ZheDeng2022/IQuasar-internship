      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relative bioavailability of the test&#xD;
      formulation of sertraline 100 mg tablets with an already marketed reference formulation&#xD;
      Zoloft® 100 mg tablets (Pfizer), under fasted conditions in healthy male and female adult&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This randomized, single-dose, two-way, crossover study was conducted to compare the relative&#xD;
      bioavailability of two formulations of 100 mg sertraline hydrochloride tablets under fasting&#xD;
      conditions. The study was conducted with 36 (30 completing) healthy adults in accordance with&#xD;
      protocol No.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10540323(Revision 0). In each study period, a single 100 mg dose was administered to the&#xD;
      subjects following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. The test formulation was Ranbaxy&#xD;
      Research Laboratories's Sertraline Hydrochloride 100 mg Tablets and the reference formulation&#xD;
      was ZOLOFT® (sertraline hydrochloride) 100 mg Tablets Manufactured by Roerig (Division of&#xD;
      Pfizer). The subjects received the test product in one study period and the reference product&#xD;
      in the other period; the order of administration was according to the dosing randomization&#xD;
      schedule. There was a 14-day interval between treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples were collected pre-dose and at intervals over 144 hours after each dose. The&#xD;
      plasma samples for all subjects completing both periods of the study were sent to Helen&#xD;
      Fassoulas, B.Sc., Director of Operations, Warnex Bioanalytical Services Inc., 3885 boul&#xD;
      Industriel, Laval, Quebec, H7LAS3 Canada, Telephone: 450-663-6724, ext. 438, FAX:&#xD;
      450-975-8111 for determination of sertraline plasma concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was performed by Yetta I. Wilbur, Biostatistician, Novum Pharmaceutical&#xD;
      Research Services, 5900 Penn Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15206, USA, Telephone: 412-363-3300, Fax:&#xD;
      412-362-5783 to evaluate the relative bioavailability of the test formulation to that of the&#xD;
      reference product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 36 healthy adult subjects.&#xD;
