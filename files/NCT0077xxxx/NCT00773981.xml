  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anastomotic leakage is a major and potentially mortal complication with an incidence of&#xD;
      10-13% after resection of the rectum. For patients showing no clinical signs of peritonitis,&#xD;
      the traditional method has been a conservative treatment with transrectal rinsing. This&#xD;
      treatment is often associated with a very protracted postoperative course with healing times&#xD;
      of up to a year or more for the anastomotic leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with vacuum drainage (VD) is a new method primarily developed for wound therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of transrectal vacuum treatment on&#xD;
      the healing of anastomotic leakage after rectum resection in a prospective, randomized,&#xD;
      controlled multicentre trial in 60 patients found to develop clinically significant&#xD;
      anastomotic leakages after elective rectal resection.&#xD;

    <description>Treatment with vacuum drainage (VD) is a new method primarily developed for wound therapy. The principle of the method is application of negative pressure on the wound surface with the help of a sponge that is connected to a pump. Sponge dressings should be changed 3 times pr week as long as vacuum therapy is used. If there has been no development of granulation tissue or no shrinking of the cavity in 3 weeks Vacuum therapy can be stopped. Maximum vacuum therapy is 8 weeks.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically significant* anastomotic leakage after intended curative&#xD;
             rectal resection (LAR) for rectal cancer with primary anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose operation did not include ileostomy must have surgery to create a stoma&#xD;
             within two days after beginning of the vacuum therapy and before randomization.&#xD;
             Anastomotic leakage must have been diagnosed within 21 days of the primary operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with and without preoperative radiation therapy may participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Groups will be formed accordingly, because patients who had preoperative radiation&#xD;
             therapy heal more slowly.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with anastomotic leakage (diagnosed by endoscopic or radiology techniques)&#xD;
             and clinical signs and symptoms indicating a health impairment (fever, pain, elevated&#xD;
             creatinine levels).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anastomotic leakage after rectal cancer surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &lt; 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Leakage diagnosed more than 21 days after the primary operation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient does not consent to temporary ileostomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anastomosis technically inaccessible for vacuum-assisted drainage&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Small intestine visible in abscess cavity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Residual cancer tissue in the pelvic cavity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suspicion of fistulation between the abscess cavity and internal genitalia, urinary&#xD;
             tract system, or small intestines.&#xD;
