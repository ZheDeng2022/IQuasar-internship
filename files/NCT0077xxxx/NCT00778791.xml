        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. All subjects selected for this study will be at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Each subject shall be given a general physical examination within 28 days of&#xD;
             initiation of the study. Such examination includes, but is not limited to, blood&#xD;
             pressure, general observations, and history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Each female subject will be given a serum pregnancy test as part of the pre-study&#xD;
             screening process. At the end of the study, the subjects will have an exit evaluation&#xD;
             consisting of interim history, global evaluation, and clinical laboratory&#xD;
             measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Adequate blood and urine samples should be obtained within 28 days before beginning of&#xD;
             the first period and at the end of the trial for clinical laboratory measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Clinical laboratory measurements will include the hematology, clinical chemistry,&#xD;
             urine analysis, HIV screening, Hepatitis B &amp; C, drugs of abuse scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with a significant recent history of chronic alcohol consumption or drug&#xD;
             addiction (past two years), or serious gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic or cardio-&#xD;
             vascular disease, tuberculosis, epilepsy, asthma (past five years), diabetes,&#xD;
             psychosis or glaucoma will not be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects whose clinical laboratory test values are outside the reference range may be&#xD;
             retested at the discretion of the clinical investigator. If the clinical values are&#xD;
             outside the range on retesting, the subject will not be eligible to participate in the&#xD;
             study unless the clinical investigator deems the result to not be significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects who have a history of allergic responses to the class of drug being tested&#xD;
             will be excluded from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. All subjects will have urine staples assayed for the presence of drugs of abuse as per&#xD;
             of the clinical laboratory screening procedures and at each dosing period check-in.&#xD;
             Subjects found to have urine concentrations of any of the tested drugs will not be&#xD;
             allowed to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects should not have donated blood and/or plasma for at least thirty (30) days&#xD;
             prior to the first dosing of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects who have taken any investigational drug within thirty (30) days prior to the&#xD;
             first dosing of the study will not be allowed to participate&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Female subjects who are pregnant, breast-feeding, or who are likely to become pregnant&#xD;
             during the study will not be allowed to participate. Female subjects of child bearing&#xD;
             potential must either abstain from sexual intercourse or use a reliable barrier method&#xD;
             (e.g. condom) of contraception during the course of the study (first dosing until last&#xD;
             blood collation) or they will not be allowed to participate. Female subjects who have&#xD;
             used hormones or contraceptives within 14 days of dosing or implanted or injected&#xD;
             hormone contraceptives within 180 days of dosing will not be allowed to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All female subjects will be screened for pregnancy at check-in each study period. Subjects&#xD;
        with positive or inconclusive results will be withdrawn from the study&#xD;
