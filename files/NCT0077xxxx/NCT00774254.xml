  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is part of an effort to learn about interactions between doctors and patients. The&#xD;
      study will use virtual reality technology to examine how patients and doctors interact when&#xD;
      they discuss disease risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men and women between the ages of 25 and 40 who have access to the Internet and were born and&#xD;
      raised in the United States may be eligible for this study. Participants will be recruited&#xD;
      from the Washington D.C. area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete an online questionnaire about their health-related background, family health&#xD;
           history, cancer risk perceptions, and demographic information (e.g., age, marital&#xD;
           status, education, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participate in activities in a virtual reality environment in which they interact with a&#xD;
           virtual doctor in a virtual clinical scenario. For this experiment, participants wear a&#xD;
           head-mounted display that allows them to see the virtual world images.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fill out a second questionnaire after completing the virtual reality activities. This&#xD;
           questionnaire includes information on the participants virtual reality experience, the&#xD;
           information provided in the experience, and questions about themselves and their&#xD;
           background.&#xD;

      This study will investigate interactions between doctors and patients regarding risks of&#xD;
      common, complex diseases using virtual reality technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men and women between the ages of 25 and 40 who have access to the Internet and were born and&#xD;
      raised in the United States may be eligible for this study. Participants will be recruited&#xD;
      from the Washington D.C. area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects complete two phases. The first phase is to complete an online questionnaire&#xD;
      about their heath-related background, family health history, cancer risk perceptions, and&#xD;
      demographic information using a secure survey website. The second phase involves interacting&#xD;
      with a virtual doctor in a virtual environment clinical scenario, followed by completion of a&#xD;
      second questionnaire. While in the virtual environment, participants wear a head-mounted&#xD;
      video unit that allows them to see elements of the environment. The activities in the virtual&#xD;
      environment take about 15 minutes. The total time for the study is about 60 minutes.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Self-reported ability to speak, read, and write in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Self identifying as African-American or Black&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Having been born and raised in the U.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not having been diagnosed with any of the diseases used in the experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Being between 25 and 40 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Having access to the Internet.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Both men and women will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals below the age of 25 because they might not yet have completed their&#xD;
             education and those above the age of 40 because they might have less familiarity with&#xD;
             interactive technologies than younger individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because the study will utilize virtual reality technology, individuals who are&#xD;
             particularly susceptible to motion sickness will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All individuals with epilepsy, low vision, hearing problems, and vestibular disorders&#xD;
             (e.g., vertigo) will be excluded from the study for safety reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We will re-screen for safety exclusion criteria when participants arrive to&#xD;
             participate in the in-person portion of the study.&#xD;
