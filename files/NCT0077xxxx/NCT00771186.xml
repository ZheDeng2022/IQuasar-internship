  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to further study the role of LEMG in accurately predicting the&#xD;
      recovery of vocal function as well to study the timing of a change of LEMG activity prior to&#xD;
      such return of function. We aim to do this by collaborating with several active pediatric&#xD;
      otolaryngological practices throughout the country who in turn have agreed to evaluate&#xD;
      infants and children with vocal fold immobility who fit a standardized inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria by means of a standardized LEMG protocol over a one year period of time.&#xD;
      Our particular goal is to collect and then review information over a one year period of time&#xD;
      on all children evaluated for vocal fold immobility by means of LEMG.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary central hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative LEMG performed in a serial fashion can predict return of RLN function in children&#xD;
      after iatrogenic injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative LEMG performed in a serial fashion will allow some projection as to the timing of&#xD;
      RLN recovery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Children age 0-18 with vocal fold immobility documented by laryngeal fiberoptic&#xD;
           evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Children who have had a recent, identifiable cardiac surgical etiology for RLN injury&#xD;
           and subsequent VFI&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Children whose parents sign informed consent and who themselves sign assent if they are&#xD;
           old enough to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Children whose families do not give informed consent or who themselves do not give&#xD;
           informed assent ( if the children are old enough to understand)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Children with congenital VFI where the etiology is not clearly identified&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age of patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Age of initial fiberoptic evaluation and of initial diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Serial Laryngeal Recordings&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Fiberoptic Evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
      LEMG Recording&#xD;
&#xD;
      While in a light plane of anesthesia, the following recordings will be routinely performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 10 seconds of both right and left vocal fold LEMG simultaneously recorded with a gain of&#xD;
           50 V&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 10 seconds of both right and left vocal fold LEMG simultaneously recorded with a gain of&#xD;
           200 V&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 10 seconds of right vocal fold LEMG recorded with a gain of 50 V&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 10 seconds of right vocal fold LEMG recorded with a gain of 200 V&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 10 seconds of left vocal fold LEMG recorded with a gain of 50 V&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. 10 seconds of left vocal fold LEMG recorded with a gain of 200 V&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total recording time: 60 seconds&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timing of LEMG and Awake Fiberoptic Laryngoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following current standard clinical evaluation we are performing at MEEI, we propose to&#xD;
      perform awake fiberoptic laryngoscopy and operative LEMG at the following time points:&#xD;
      initially (within 3 weeks of injury if possible), at the 3 month post-injury mark, and at the&#xD;
      9- month post injury mark ( 3 recordings in total; we will perform a final fiberoptic&#xD;
      laryngoscopy in the office at the one year time interval). The time points were chosen as&#xD;
      each recording necessitates an operative procedure with general anesthesia so we wanted to&#xD;
      limit the over number of general anesthetics. We recognize that the risk of limiting the&#xD;
      number of operative LEMG recordings is that we lose some data-points to chart recovery of RLN&#xD;
      function, but we felt that the risks of multiple general anesthetics were sufficient enough&#xD;
      to warrant limiting the number of recordings as much as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Database protection&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Data collected will be entered into a password protected database.&#xD;
