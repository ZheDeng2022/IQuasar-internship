  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is characterised by a partial or complete collapse of the&#xD;
      upper airway during sleep. The treatment of choice for OSA is Continuous Positive Airway&#xD;
      Pressure (CPAP). CPAP acts as a positive airway splint, delivering a fixed positive airway&#xD;
      pressure to the upper airway via a tube and mask. Compliance, however, to therapy requires&#xD;
      that the mask is suitably comfortable so as not to disturb sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A key contributor to comfort is the seal component of the mask system. Current mask seals are&#xD;
      mainly silicone elastomers, which though well understood and accepted, are often&#xD;
      uncomfortable. It is proposed to replace the solid elastomer with a soft polymer foam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The foam is highly porous, and has open cells at its surface. It is therefore more likely to&#xD;
      accumulate biological material with repeated use. The current (silicone) material does not&#xD;
      present any problematic bioburden issues. Therefore it is important to investigate whether&#xD;
      the foam will present bioburden problems to patients, within specified usage parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study therefore are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to observe the rate of bacterial accumulation on foam mask seal material (polyether&#xD;
           polyurethane,)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to determine the replacement interval for a foam mask seal, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. assess the comfort and function of a foam mask seal.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Test Units: The test unit is a foam seal component which directly replaces the patients&#xD;
      existing silicone mask cushion, and is fitted to the patients existing mask frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will wear the test unit mask, instead of the current CPAP mask, each night whilst&#xD;
      sleeping. Upon waking, subjects will remove the test unit mask and place it with the skin&#xD;
      contact side uppermost on a flat surface adjacent to their bed (e.g. a bedside table). Test&#xD;
      unit masks should not be covered, and are to remain exposed to the bedroom environment for&#xD;
      the rest of the day. The cycle repeats for up to 35 days (5 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If necessary, the test can be terminated before this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A control group of 2 subjects will wash their test unit mask with only hot water every day&#xD;
      for the 5 weeks. Another 4 subjects will have the foam of their test unit mask replaced&#xD;
      during the 5 weeks of the trial. Two subjects will have the foam changed after 2 weeks and&#xD;
      the other 2 subjects after 4 weeks. This will allow estimations of bioburden after 1,2,3,4&#xD;
      and 5 weeks of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The foam samples are to be sealed in the supplied sterile container. The sealed container&#xD;
      will be delivered as soon as possible to the project administrator. The project administrator&#xD;
      will appropriately collect, record, store, and dispatch the sealed samples for&#xD;
      microbiological analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbial analysis will determine the number of colony forming units, and species present in&#xD;
      each test unit upon test termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin Reactions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to report any skin reaction they experience under the test unit.&#xD;
      Subjects will keep a bi-weekly record of any skin redness, irritation, etc.&#xD;
