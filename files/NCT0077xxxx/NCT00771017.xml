      RATIONALE: Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Androgen ablation&#xD;
      therapy, such as bicalutamide, leuprolide, and goserelin, may lessen the amount of androgens&#xD;
      made by the body. Vaccine therapy may help the body build an effective immune response to&#xD;
      kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether androgen ablation therapy is more effective&#xD;
      with or without vaccine therapy in treating patients with prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying androgen ablation therapy to see how well&#xD;
      it works when given together with or without vaccine therapy in treating patients with&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the median PSA recurrence-free survival of patients with nonmetastatic,&#xD;
           biochemically relapsed prostate cancer who respond with a PSA ≤ 0.5 ng/mL when&#xD;
           administered a brief (6-month) course of androgen ablation either alone or in&#xD;
           combination with GVAX prostate cancer vaccine (CG1940/CG8711) immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety of combined treatment with androgen ablation and CG1940/CG8711&#xD;
           immunotherapy in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine median time to metastatic disease development in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to Gleason score (&gt; 7&#xD;
      vs ≤ 7), PSA doubling time (&lt; 3 months vs 3-9 months vs &gt; 9 months) and prior androgen&#xD;
      ablation (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms at a 1 (arm I):2 (arm&#xD;
      II) ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (androgen-ablation therapy): Patients receive oral bicalutamide once daily on days&#xD;
           1-28. Patients also receive luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist&#xD;
           treatment comprising leuprolide acetate or goserelin intramuscularly (IM) on day 8.&#xD;
           Treatment with LHRH agonist repeats every 12 weeks for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II (androgen-ablation therapy and vaccine): Patients receive androgen ablation as in&#xD;
           arm I. Patients also receive GVAX prostate cancer vaccine (CG1940 and CG8711)&#xD;
           intradermally (ID) on day 1. Beginning on day 1 of week 3, patients receive booster&#xD;
           doses of CG1940 and CG8711 ID every 2 weeks for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are evaluated on day 1 of week 25 to assess disease. If PSA &gt; 0.5 ng/mL AND there is&#xD;
      no evidence of metastatic disease on imaging studies, then patients can be treated at the&#xD;
      discretion of the investigator. If PSA ≤ 0.5 ng/mL, and there is no evidence of metastatic&#xD;
      disease, then patients are considered responders and continue having PSA evaluated every 4&#xD;
      weeks until PSA relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for 5 years and then&#xD;
      annually thereafter.&#xD;
