  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of surfactant protein D under native and altered conditions will be investigated&#xD;
      in immune cells that are derived from bronchoalveolar lavage in patients with allergic asthma&#xD;
      following segmental allergen challenge. The goal of this study is to elucidate the pro-&#xD;
      versus anti-inflammatory function of SP-D molecules and to identify motifs of SP-D that have&#xD;
      treatment potential in allergic asthma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Following a baseline BAL, allergen (3×) and saline (1×) will be instilled into four different&#xD;
      lung segments during a first bronchoscopy. After 24 hours during a second bronchoscopy BAL&#xD;
      will be collected in these challenged segments to harvest invaded cells for in-vitro&#xD;
      experimentation. In addition, bronchial biopsies and epithelial brushes will be taken to&#xD;
      assess the degree of local inflammation in bronchial mucosa and to study the activation of&#xD;
      airway epithelium following allergen challenge.&#xD;
