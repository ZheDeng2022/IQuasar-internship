      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if magnetic resonance imaging with&#xD;
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy (&quot;MRI/MRS&quot; scanning) can measure any extra growth in the&#xD;
      tumor that does not show up on regular MRI images. This study procedure will be performed on&#xD;
      patients with recurrent glioblastoma who are either being treated with chemotherapy that&#xD;
      blocks blood vessel growth, or will soon begin this type of chemotherapy.&#xD;

      The Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI scanning is commonly used to check the status of glioblastoma. In this study, MRI&#xD;
      scanning will also be used to try to better understand how chemotherapy that blocks blood&#xD;
      vessel growth may be affecting the status of the glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The timing of all MRI scans for this study will be done on schedule for routine patient care.&#xD;
      There will not be any extra MRI scans performed, but an MRS portion to the MRI scans will be&#xD;
      added. The MRS results will be used in this study to look at the chemical differences between&#xD;
      the cancerous and normal tissue, in order to try to better understand how your chemotherapy&#xD;
      may be working.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can begin this study, you will have &quot;screening tests&quot; to help the doctor decide if&#xD;
      you are eligible to take part in this study. The following tests and procedures will be&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who are able to have children must have a negative blood (about 1 teaspoon)&#xD;
           pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI/MRS Scanning:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will have an MRI/MRS scan of&#xD;
      the brain. The first of these scans will be performed before the chemotherapy starts (either&#xD;
      before your first cycle of this type of chemotherapy or before your next cycle, depending on&#xD;
      whether you were receiving this type of chemotherapy before the study or not). After that, an&#xD;
      MRI/MRS scan will be repeated at Weeks 8 and 16 after the beginning of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI/MRS scans will follow the same procedure and use the same MRI scanner machine as a&#xD;
      regular MRI scan, but will take about an additional 10 minutes. You will lie still on your&#xD;
      back with your head placed within the openings of the scanner. A contrast solution, which&#xD;
      helps make the tumor visible, will be given through a needle in your vein. The scanning&#xD;
      procedure should take about an hour at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the MRI/MRS scans will not be used to affect your course of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your regular doctor recommends that the tumor be surgically removed, the surgery will be&#xD;
      discussed with you in detail and you will sign a separate informed consent form for it.&#xD;
      Leftover tissue that was removed during the surgery will be collected and used as part of&#xD;
      this study. The tissue will be used to further check the status of the disease, and it will&#xD;
      be compared with the MRI/MRS images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarker Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, you will also have blood drawn for biomarker testing. Biomarkers are chemical&#xD;
      &quot;markers&quot; in the blood, other body fluids, or tissue that may be related to the status of&#xD;
      disease and/or the effects of treatment. This blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be&#xD;
      drawn before the chemotherapy starts and then every 8 weeks while you are on study. The blood&#xD;
      draws will occur on the same days as the MRI/MRS scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will continue having blood drawn for biomarker testing every 8 weeks, unless you stop&#xD;
      taking this type of chemotherapy that blocks blood vessel growth. In that case, you will be&#xD;
      taken off study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you do have surgery, your participation in this study will end after the surgery. If you&#xD;
      are unable to have surgery, your participation will end after your last MRI/MRS scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. MRI scanning is an FDA approved and commercially available&#xD;
      procedure for checking the status of glioblastoma. At this time and for this purpose, MRS&#xD;
      scanning is being used in research only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 18 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
