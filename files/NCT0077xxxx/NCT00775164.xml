      The primary objective of this study is to examine the effects of four months of pioglitazone&#xD;
      vs. metformin treatment on HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure, insulin&#xD;
      resistance, endothelial function, arterial stiffness, adipokines, oxidative stress, and blood&#xD;
      biomarkers of endothelial activation in obese insulin resistant children. 30 obese children&#xD;
      with elevated fasting insulin levels will be randomly assigned to pioglitazone or metformin&#xD;
      for 16 weeks. Change in clinical variables over the 16-week study period will be compared&#xD;
      between groups.&#xD;

      Background and Specific Aim/Hypothesis Obese, insulin resistant children are at increased&#xD;
      risk of future cardiovascular disease due to elevated systolic blood pressure, fasting&#xD;
      insulin, triglycerides, inflammation, oxidative stress, and reduced HDL cholesterol.&#xD;
      Behavioral/lifestyle therapy should be the foundational approach to treating obesity and&#xD;
      insulin resistance in all individuals, especially children. However, some children may need&#xD;
      concomitant medical therapy in order to adequately address their severe risk factor profile&#xD;
      and early vascular abnormalities. Although not approved by the FDA, metformin has been used&#xD;
      with mixed success to treat obesity-associated cardiometabolic risk factors in children with&#xD;
      evidence of insulin resistance. Clearly, other drug therapies should be explored to treat&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors in obese, insulin resistant children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thiazolidinediones have been used to improve glucose control in adult patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus for approximately 10 years. These peroxisome proliferator activated&#xD;
      receptor agonists are unique among anti-diabetic agents in that they regulate gene&#xD;
      transcription to improve insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues (predominately skeletal&#xD;
      muscle and adipose tissue). In addition to improving glycemic control, these drugs also&#xD;
      improve multiple cardiometabolic risk factors such as lipoprotein profile, blood pressure,&#xD;
      inflammatory markers, adipokines, and endothelial function. Despite the substantial body of&#xD;
      data showing benefit in adults, pioglitazone has never been evaluated as a therapy to improve&#xD;
      the cardiometabolic risk factor profile in obese children with evidence of insulin&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim: To examine the effects of four months of pioglitazone vs. metformin treatment&#xD;
      on HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure, insulin resistance, endothelial function,&#xD;
      arterial stiffness, adipokines, oxidative stress, and blood biomarkers of endothelial&#xD;
      activation in obese, insulin resistant children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: In the context of background behavioral therapy, four months of pioglitazone vs.&#xD;
      metformin treatment will significantly improve HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, blood&#xD;
      pressure, insulin resistance, endothelial function, arterial stiffness, adipokines, oxidative&#xD;
      stress, and blood biomarkers of endothelial activation in obese insulin resistant children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance There is a substantial lack of data in the literature concerning potential drug&#xD;
      therapies for reducing risk factors in children at high risk of developing future&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. Since the prevalence of obesity and insulin resistance in children&#xD;
      has increased dramatically in the last several decades, there is an urgent need for data from&#xD;
      randomized, controlled trials to guide treatment approaches for high risk children. This&#xD;
      pilot study will result in the acquisition of valuable preliminary data which will be used to&#xD;
      seek funding for and conduct a larger scale clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of&#xD;
      pioglitazone for treating cardiometabolic risk factors in obese, insulin resistant children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Patient Population: 30 obese, hyperinsulinemic children and adolescents entering a&#xD;
      Pediatric Weight Management Program at the University of Minnesota will be enrolled. In this&#xD;
      program, children and their families work with a team of trained professionals including&#xD;
      physicians, dieticians, and psychologists to reduce weight by making healthier eating choices&#xD;
      and increasing physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This will be a randomized, double-blind, active-comparator clinical trial.&#xD;
      Variables will be assessed at baseline (prior to randomization) and after four months of&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection: The screening visit will take place in the Pediatric Weight Management&#xD;
      Clinic and will include a complete medical history and physical examination. All research&#xD;
      testing will take place in the University of Minnesota General Clinical Research Center&#xD;
      (GCRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis and Power Considerations: Randomization will be stratified by gender and&#xD;
      Tanner stage. Changes between groups over time will be compared with a 2X2 (group by time)&#xD;
      repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc tests. The main analysis of interest will be&#xD;
      the ANOVA interaction term, which compares the change in variables over time (pre vs. post)&#xD;
      between groups. The purpose of this study will be to obtain preliminary data to design and&#xD;
      seek funding for a larger clinical trial.&#xD;
