    <textblock>
      60 patients, in three group of 20 patients each, scheduled for surgery needing general&#xD;
      anesthesia will be researched. Group A: tracheal intubation of single lumen tube using&#xD;
      laryngoscope. Group B: single lumen tube using lightwand. Group C: double lumen endobronchial&#xD;
      cath. During general anesthesia, the spectral power of heart rate variability at three&#xD;
      periods: (1) preoperation baseline (2) pre-intubation and (3) post-intubation will be&#xD;
      calculated and compared to investigate the autonomic stimulation effect of different tracheal&#xD;
      intubation methods.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tracheal intubation is a common practice during general anesthesia. Laryngoscope and&#xD;
      lightwand are two commonly used methods of tracheal intubation. The autonomic stimulation of&#xD;
      tracheal intubation may have adverse effect to the patients and have been investigated since&#xD;
      many years ago. Conventional methods for assessing autonomic activity include measurement of&#xD;
      blood catecholamine levels or measuring changes of the hemodynamic variables such as heart&#xD;
      rate and blood pressure. The former is invasive and noncontinuous, and the latter is&#xD;
      nonspecific and not accurate. Heart rate variability, a parameter derived from the spectral&#xD;
      power of RR interval sequence in the ECG, is a non-invasive but direct measurement of&#xD;
      autonomic activity. It is ideal and we will use this in the current research for comparing&#xD;
      the autonomic activation during tracheal intubation of the two different methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Totally 60 ASA class I-II patients aged 18-65 years will be recruited. 40 of these are&#xD;
      scheduled for various kind of surgery needing general anesthesia with tracheal intubation of&#xD;
      single lumen tube. These 40 patients will be randomly assigned into group A and B, each with&#xD;
      20 patients. In group A the tracheal intubation will be performed by laryngoscope, and in&#xD;
      group B the intubation performed by lightwand. The other 20 patients of the study, the group&#xD;
      C, are scheduled for operations needing intubation of double lumen endobronchial cath. The&#xD;
      intubation will be performed by laryngoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECG wil be recorded from at least 5 minutes before induction of general anesthesia and&#xD;
      continue to at least 10 minutes after tracheal intubation. The induction and maintenance of&#xD;
      anesthesia will performed as routine practice. The ECG records wil be analyzed offline. Power&#xD;
      spectrum wil be generated by time-frequency analysis and the heart rate variability&#xD;
      parameters at three periods (1)preoperation baseline (2) pre-intubation and (3) immediately&#xD;
      post-intubation will be calculated and compared among the three groups.&#xD;
