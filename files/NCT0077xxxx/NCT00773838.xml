  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical activity of vorinostat in combination&#xD;
      with bortezomib in participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after at least 2&#xD;
      prior treatment regimens. The primary objective is to define the objective response rate (RR)&#xD;
      associated with the administration of vorinostat in combination with bortezomib to patients&#xD;
      with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma after at least 2 prior treatment regimens. The&#xD;
      primary hypothesis of the study is the administration of vorinostat in combination with&#xD;
      bortezomib will result in a clinically meaningful rate of objective response.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The protocol has been amended to indicate that the Final Analysis is designated as the time&#xD;
      when the primary endpoint of 29 responders has been met, or the time when all participants&#xD;
      have discontinued treatment or have been enrolled in the study for at least 6 months (if the&#xD;
      primary endpoint is not reached by this time). Following the Final Analysis, participants&#xD;
      will be allowed to continue study treatment in an extension as long as they have not met the&#xD;
      criteria for discontinuation, and will be followed for overall survival and serious AEs.&#xD;

PD: &gt;25% increase in level of serum Mparaprotein, which must also be an absolute increase of at least 5g/L (500 mg/dL) and confirmed on a repeat investigation or 25% increase in 24-hour urinary light chain excretion, which must also be an absolute increase of at least 200mg/24hour and confirmed on a repeat investigation or &gt;25% increase in plasma cells in a bone marrow aspirate or on trephine biopsy, which must also be an absolute increase of at least 10% or definitive increase in size of existing LBLs or STP or development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium &gt;11.5 mg/dL or 2.8 mmol/L not attributable to any other cause). To report the median TTP (in months) and associated 95% CIs Kaplan-Meier method was used.</description>
