  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased intake of dietary fibre and whole grains is related to reduced risk of developing&#xD;
      diabetes. The term &quot;whole grain&quot; is often used for whole-meal products in which the structure&#xD;
      of the cereal grain is destroyed in the flour containing the original dietary fiber, but also&#xD;
      for cereal products in which a large proportion of whole cereal grains is intact. The aim of&#xD;
      this study was to evaluate the effect of commercial rye whole-meal bread (RWMB) compared to&#xD;
      white-wheat bread (WWB) on gastric emptying rate (GER), postprandial glucose response in&#xD;
      healthy subjects.&#xD;

      Ten healthy subjects, without symptoms or a prior history of gastrointestinal disease,&#xD;
      abdominal surgery or diabetes mellitus, were assessed by using a blinded crossover trial. The&#xD;
      subjects were examined regarding blood glucose levels and GER after ingestion of 150g WWB or&#xD;
      RWMB on two different occasions after an overnight fast. GER was measured using a&#xD;
      standardized real time ultrasonography. GER was calculated as a percentage change in antral&#xD;
      cross sectional area 15 and 90 minutes after the finished meal with WWB and RWMB.&#xD;
      Finger-prick capillary samples were collected before and 40, 60, and 90 min after the start&#xD;
      of the meal to measure blood glucose levels.&#xD;
