      In this study, smokers will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions for six weeks: 1)&#xD;
      nicotine-free cigarettes (0.05mg); 2) extra low nicotine cigarettes (0.3 mg); or 3) medicinal&#xD;
      4 mg nicotine lozenge. The tobacco toxin profiles across these various products will be&#xD;
      compared. The effects of these products on biomarkers of exposure and risk factors for&#xD;
      disease, compensatory smoking, components of tobacco addiction and short-term smoking&#xD;
      cessation will be determined. Predictors of response to these products (e.g., compensatory&#xD;
      smoking, compliance with product use, time to lapse) will also be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following primary hypothesis will be tested: 1) Extent of tobacco toxin exposure will be&#xD;
      greatest for the extra low nicotine cigarette and least for nicotine lozenge. Other secondary&#xD;
      hypotheses include: 2) Compensatory smoking, as calculated by using cotinine, will be&#xD;
      greatest for the extra low cigarette compared to the nicotine-free cigarette; 3) Greater&#xD;
      positive subjective responses to cigarettes will be observed with extra low nicotine vs.&#xD;
      nicotine-free cigarette; 4) Similar withdrawal symptoms and negative affect will be observed&#xD;
      with nicotine-free cigarette and nicotine lozenge, and least withdrawal and negative affect&#xD;
      with the extra low nicotine cigarette; 6) Least dependence and greatest motivation and&#xD;
      self-efficacy to quit will be observed with nicotine lozenge and the greatest dependence and&#xD;
      least motivation and self-efficacy to quit with the extra low nicotine cigarette use; 7)&#xD;
      Shorter time to lapse will be observed with extra low nicotine vs. nicotine-free cigarettes&#xD;
      because of extinction is likely to occur with nicotine-free cigarettes, and the longest time&#xD;
      to lapse for nicotine lozenge because the cigarette condition groups will have experienced&#xD;
      stronger attentional bias toward cues, and more dependence prior to the quit date and greater&#xD;
      withdrawal after the quit date.&#xD;

      Smokers (N=150) will be enrolled in the study and will smoke ad libitum for a period of two&#xD;
      weeks during which time they will be assessed for baseline measurements. Subjects will then&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to one of the three conditions (N=50). Subjects will be blinded as to&#xD;
      whether they are assigned to the Quest nicotine-free vs. extra low nicotine condition. There&#xD;
      are no distinguishing features between these two cigarettes. Nicotine lozenge assignment is&#xD;
      open label. Subjects will be asked to use only their assigned study product (low nicotine,&#xD;
      nicotine-free cigarettes or lozenge) for a period of 6 weeks. Study cigarettes will be given&#xD;
      to them at each clinic visit and subjects will be told to smoke ad libitum. They will be&#xD;
      provided a supply equivalent to 150% of their baseline-smoking rate to allow for compensatory&#xD;
      smoking to occur. They will keep record of each cigarette they smoked. If they smoked&#xD;
      cigarettes other than those assigned to them, they will be asked to notate on a sheet when&#xD;
      that cigarette was smoked. At the end of the 6-week period, they will be asked to quit&#xD;
      smoking and NRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First morning urine and fasting blood samples will be collected at baseline and 2 and 6 weeks&#xD;
      on the study products; at 6 weeks of abstinence and the 1 month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Counseling. In each condition, subjects will be provided brief, structured counseling that is&#xD;
      similar in duration. The subjects in the cigarette conditions will discuss any difficulties&#xD;
      they experienced with switching cigarettes and problem solving these obstacles. Problem&#xD;
      solving each obstacle will be solicited from the subject. However, if no solution or limited&#xD;
      solution is provided, the counselor will provide a standardized response for each of the&#xD;
      obstacles confronted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Phase. Subjects will be followed up 1 month after the end of the 6 week abstinence&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
