      Patients presenting for elective surgery requiring tracheal intubation will be randomized to&#xD;
      one of two different ETT stylets. The primary outcome is time to intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis is that there will be no difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GlideScope video laryngoscope (Verathon) is a widely used intubating device that uses a&#xD;
      high-resolution camera embedded into a plastic laryngoscope blade. An LED provides&#xD;
      illumination. The GlideScope often provides a good laryngoscopic view, but passing the&#xD;
      endotracheal tube (ETT) through the vocal cords is sometimes difficult. Because of the 60&#xD;
      degree anterior curvature of the GlideScope's blade, ETT's must have stylets inserted so that&#xD;
      the ETT distal tip can be positioned anteriorly. Various authors have recommended different&#xD;
      angles of the ETT to optimally place it into the trachea, including matching the GlideScope's&#xD;
      60 degree angle, or configuring the ETT with a 90 degree bend. Previous studies demonstrated&#xD;
      that 90 degree sharp bend was both faster and subjectively easier in a heterogeneous group of&#xD;
      intubators. With the introduction of the Flex-It stylet by Parker Medical, the question&#xD;
      arises as to the the best configuration of stylet for the ETT. Therefore, this prospective,&#xD;
      randomized, single-blinded trial is proposed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Written informed consent will be obtained by one of the study investigators, and a copy will&#xD;
      be given to each participant. Written informed consent will also be obtained from the&#xD;
      operator of the GlideScope. Envelopes with computer-generated randomized group assignments&#xD;
      will be present at each site. The envelopes will be consecutively numbered (i.e. &quot;U1&quot;, &quot;U2&quot;&#xD;
      for University Hospital, &quot;S1&quot;, &quot;S2&quot; for St Joseph's Health Care, etc.). After consent,&#xD;
      randomization will occur by selecting the next consecutive envelope. The envelope will&#xD;
      contain the data collection form as well as a piece of paper that has the following&#xD;
      information:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  at the top will be the randomization group (A, B) and a text description of the&#xD;
           endotracheal tube angle and stylet (i.e. &quot;90 degrees - malleable stylet&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in the body of the piece of paper will be a template that shows the exact shape into&#xD;
           which the tube must be bent, including where the distal and proximal ends are, the angle&#xD;
           of curvature that must be followed, and the location along the length of the tube at&#xD;
           which to create this angle. The angle and location will be the same for both males and&#xD;
           females.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three distinct anesthesia providers involved in the conduct of this study, as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. &quot;operator&quot; - person performing the intubation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. &quot;timer&quot; - person timing the outcome (one of the co-investigators)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. &quot;shaper&quot; - person who ensures that the angle and stylet of the tube matches the group to&#xD;
           which the patient was allocated&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the person intubating must be blind up until the time at which the tube is to be&#xD;
      used, the unopened envelope will be taken to a third anesthesia provider, who will prepare&#xD;
      the ETT with stylet in an area that is not visible to the person performing the intubation or&#xD;
      to the person timing the intubation. The person performing the intubation will specify what&#xD;
      size of tube to be prepared. This will most commonly be 7.5 mm internal diameter (ID) for a&#xD;
      female and 8.0 ID for males, but the operator is free to use whatever size they feel is&#xD;
      appropriate. The tube size selection will take place before unblinding so the group&#xD;
      allocation cannot affect the decision of tube size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tubes will all be cut at the 27 cm marking. &quot;Group A&quot; ETT's will be shaped with the aid&#xD;
      of a standard malleable stylet (Rusch 14 Fr) that has been lubricated with single-use&#xD;
      water-soluble lubricant. &quot;Group B&quot; ETT's will be instrumented with the Flex-It Stylet, with&#xD;
      identical lubricant. The prepared tube will then be concealed under a standard green OR towel&#xD;
      and brought to the operating room (OR). This tube will be placed close to the patient's head&#xD;
      so that it is readily accessible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the OR, the GlideScope will be turned on at least 60 seconds before use so that the lens&#xD;
      can warm-up to prevent fogging. The patient will be cared for in the usual fashion with&#xD;
      respect to monitoring and induction of general anesthesia. To ensure adequate&#xD;
      pre-oxygenation, the patient's end-tidal oxygen must be ≥ 70%. Muscle relaxation will be&#xD;
      used, and the agent used is at the discretion of the operator. After induction of anesthesia,&#xD;
      bag-mask ventilation will be used in the usual fashion until the operator decides to proceed&#xD;
      to laryngoscopy with the GlideScope. The operator will remain blinded to the group allocation&#xD;
      until after the laryngoscopic view has been obtained with the GlideScope, where upon he will&#xD;
      be handed the endotracheal tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The timer (who cannot see the tube under the green towel) will watch the operator until the&#xD;
      GlideScope is inserted into the patient's mouth, start the timer, and then turn 180º to face&#xD;
      the anesthetic monitor. The timer will not be able to see the ETT, stylet, or curvature&#xD;
      because he will be facing the monitor screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timing will continue until end-tidal CO2 of at least 30 mmHg is seen on the anesthesia&#xD;
      monitor, at which point the data collection form will be filled out, and the study protocol&#xD;
      will be finished. (The time to intubation will be recorded to the nearest tenth of a second.)&#xD;
      If the operator fails to intubate within 3 attempts or 150 seconds, the intubation will be&#xD;
      noted as a failure, and the ultimately successful means of securing the airway will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The definition of an &quot;attempt&quot; for the purposes of this clinical trial are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. anytime the GlideScope blade is removed from the patients mouth and then re-inserted&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. anytime the endotracheal tube is re-shaped (regardless of whether or not the GlideScope&#xD;
           is actually removed from the patient's mouth&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. if substantial adjustments are made to the patient's position (such as head position,&#xD;
           neck flexion, or neck extension). Small movements that would occur in the normal process&#xD;
           of intubation would not count as &quot;substantial&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If oxygen desaturation (as recorded by pulse oximetry) below 95% occurs, then the patient&#xD;
      will be ventilated in the usual fashion to ensure oxygenation, and re-attempting intubation&#xD;
      using the GlideScope may proceed, but the timing will continue, and the same limits to&#xD;
      successful intubation (within 3 attempts or total of 150s) will apply. Between attempts, the&#xD;
      tube may be re-shaped by the operator if the operator feels that another curvature would be&#xD;
      preferred.&#xD;
