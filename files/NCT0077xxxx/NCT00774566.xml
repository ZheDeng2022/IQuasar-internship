      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as a randomized, controlled, prospective, non-inferiority clinical&#xD;
      trial, where the efficacy and safety of the cryoballoon ablation system (CE certificated)&#xD;
      will be compared to the standard ablation technique (segmental isolation of the pulmonary&#xD;

      nerve injuries, cerebrovascular accidents (CVA), pericardial tamponade, pain scores during&#xD;
      the procedure, levels of cardiac inflammatory markers are compared between the treatment&#xD;
      groups. The short and long-term clinical success as well as the costs of both systems will&#xD;
      also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief description of the cryoablation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This catheter system uses nitrous oxide as refrigerant to cool the inside of the catheter tip&#xD;
      or the balloon down to -30 to -70 degree in a closed system. Delivering the freezing energy&#xD;
      on human cells for several minutes leads to their destruction. The destructed cells cannot&#xD;
      conduct anymore. For PV isolation the cryoballoon can be placed at the orifice of the&#xD;
      pulmonary veins to ablate the muscle connections between the PV- and left atrium (LA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AF is a common and disabling cardiac arrhythmia, affecting 600.000-700.000 persons in&#xD;
      Germany. In addition to hemodynamic compromise and higher mortality rates, AF causes an&#xD;
      increased risk of systemic emboli arising from the LA. The risk of stroke inpatients with&#xD;
      nonvalvular AF is 5 to 7 times greater than in comparable patients without AF; overall, 20 -&#xD;
      25% of ischemic strokes are due to cardiac emboli, of which half arise in patients with&#xD;
      nonvalvular AF. In addition to such proven mortality and morbidity risks, AF is associated&#xD;
      with a substantial burden of symptoms, stemming from the arrhythmia itself, exacerbation of&#xD;
      comorbid conditions such as congestive heart failure, associated anxiety over possible&#xD;
      sequelae as well as the substantial burden of side effects from antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD).&#xD;
      Currently available treatments are unsatisfactory for many reasons. AAD treatment has a&#xD;
      relatively low efficacy even in patients suffering from paroxysmal AF, with frequent&#xD;
      recurrences and a high incidence of intolerable drug side effects. Isolation of PVs using RF&#xD;
      energy has shown considerable clinical success in the treatment of paroxysmal AF, but has&#xD;
      been associated with serious complications, including PV stenosis, thromboembolic&#xD;
      complications, cardiac perforation, phrenic nerve palsies, esophageal fistulae and&#xD;
      pericardial tamponade. Furthermore, RF can be painful where as freezing with cryotherapy may&#xD;
      be pain free.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CryoCath Technologies has developed and tested the Arctic Front™ Cardiac CryoAblation&#xD;
      Catheter System (with the FlexCath™ Steerable Sheath) to allow the rapid formation of&#xD;
      continuous cryoablation lesions at the PV ostia. Pre-clinical data have demonstrated&#xD;
      long-term effectiveness of balloon cryoablation for permanent electrical isolation of the PVs&#xD;
      with no risk of PV stenosis. Results from these pre-clinical studies suggest that no&#xD;
      pulmonary venous stenosis and no thromboembolic incidents have occurred even with multiple 4&#xD;
      or 8-minute cryoenergy deliveries. However, achieving an adequate therapeutic effect using&#xD;
      focal or linear cryolesions often required multiple applications and lengthy procedure times.&#xD;
      Balloon cryoablation of subjects with PAF has been studied in PS-011, a feasibility study of&#xD;
      the Arctic Front™ Balloon Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter System, in conjunction with the&#xD;
      Freezor® MAX and Xtra and the Arctic Circler Linear™ Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter. Twenty&#xD;
      (20) subjects were enrolled at two European centers using the 23 mm Arctic Front™ Balloon,&#xD;
      and an additional 7 subjects were enrolled using 28 mm Arctic Front™ Balloon. Acute&#xD;
      procedural success was 100%, and long term follow-up reveals a high rate of freedom from&#xD;
      recurrent AF. A low incidence of adverse events was noted, with two patients experiencing&#xD;
      reversible loss of phrenic nerve capture during the procedure. Both patients recovered fully.&#xD;
      Of the original 20 subjects treated with the 23 mm balloon, 16 / 20 (80%) were AF-free&#xD;
      between the 6 and 12 month follow-up visits. Of the additional 7 subjects treated with the 28&#xD;
      mm balloon, 5 / 6 (83%) were AF free through 6 months. Another non-randomized feasibility&#xD;
      study of the Arctic Front™ 23 mm Balloon Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter System under protocol&#xD;
      PS-012 has completed enrollment at four centers in the United States. Based on incompletely&#xD;
      monitored data, as of July 12th, 2006, 31 patients have undergone a successful cryoablation&#xD;
      procedure with Acute Procedural Success (isolation of ≥ 3 PVs) in 100% (31 / 31 subjects).&#xD;
      Electrical isolation was achieved in 129 / 130 PVs (99.3%). A total of 67 adverse events (AE)&#xD;
      have been reported, and no deaths. Nine (9) serious AEs have been reported. Four device&#xD;
      related serious AEs involved changes in phrenic nerve conduction: 3 patients had cryoablation&#xD;
      discontinued immediately and nerve function recovered completely by 1 month, and the fourth&#xD;
      subject had transient loss of capture during the procedure, followed at the 1 month visit by&#xD;
      shortness of breath, a viral infection and slight paralysis of a hemidiaphragm. Two other&#xD;
      device related serious AEs were a pericardial tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis and&#xD;
      hospitalization, and a right groin hematoma. Three additional non-device related serious AEs&#xD;
      included one episode of chest pain, one instance of right neck bleeding after vascular access&#xD;
      and one instance of left groin site bleeding after vascular access. Long term follow-up for&#xD;
      PS-012 is incomplete, but 17 subjects have reached 3 months, and 14 / 17 (82%) are free from&#xD;
      recurrent AF. Only one of these 14 subjects was on a previously failed AF drug, giving a 76%&#xD;
      (13 / 17) rate of freedom from recurrent AF off drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional data from another non-randomized clinical study are now available (Neumann et al.&#xD;
      Circumferential pulmonary vein isolation with the cryoballoon technique. JACC 2008, Vol&#xD;
      52(4); 273-8). 346 patients consecutive patients in three German centers have undergone a&#xD;
      successful cryoablation therapy. The study population consisted of 293 patients with&#xD;
      paroxysmal and 53 patients with persistent atrial fibrillation. Isolation of the pulmonary&#xD;
      veins was achieved in 97% where as freedom from documented paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was&#xD;
      achieved in 74% after a median follow-up of 12 month. No death and no PV narrowing occurred.&#xD;
      In 26 patients (7,5%) a phrenic nerve palsy could be observed. The majority of the patients&#xD;
      recovered within 6 month, all patients recovered within 12 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these encouraging results this randomized clinical study has been designed to&#xD;
      provide valid scientific evidence of the safety and effectiveness of the Arctic Front™&#xD;
      Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter System (with a FlexCath™ Steerable Sheath) to electrically&#xD;
      isolate PVs in patients with PAF by comparing it with segmental isolation with RF-energy,&#xD;
      which represents the most widely accepted and used energy form in AF-ablation procedures.&#xD;
      Compared to the RF ablation procedures PV isolation with the Cryo Balloon technique is easier&#xD;
      and faster to perform and there is no need for expensive additional mapping systems to avoid&#xD;
      current dreaded complications such as PV-stenosis or esophageal fistula.&#xD;

      Preprocedural investigations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transesophageal echocardiography to exclude LA thrombus in each patient before each&#xD;
           ablation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT or MRT of the LA (optional)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ablation procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After venous and arterial access a single or double transseptal puncture is performed. In&#xD;
      both groups a pulmonary vein angiography must be performed before and after PV - isolation&#xD;
      for all of the PVs. PV - potentials must be recorded before and after PV - isolation with a&#xD;
      circular mapping catheter. In group 1, the RF - ablation procedure is performed using an open&#xD;
      4 mm irrigated tip catheter in combination with a 3D - navigation system. It is recommended,&#xD;
      that the 3D - navigation system should be able to display all mapping and ablation catheters.&#xD;
      An antral PV - isolation will be performed. In group 2 a cryoablation of the PV - ostia using&#xD;
      either the 28 mm or the 23 mm cryo-balloon will be attempted. At least two cryoenergy&#xD;
      applications of 300 - 360 sec must be performed in each PV. Additional cryoenergy&#xD;
      applications can be delivered if necessary to achieve complete isolation. The 28 mm&#xD;
      cryoballoon should be used preferentially for all veins. If a complete isolation could not be&#xD;
      achieved with the 28 mm cryoballoon ablation, a switch over to the 23 mm balloon is possible;&#xD;
      otherwise touch-ups with a conventional cryocatheter (Freezor® Max, CryoCath) will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups the aim is to completely isolate the PVs. The upper limit of RF - or cryo -&#xD;
      applications is dependent on the procedure duration and the clinical condition at the time of&#xD;
      the procedure and left to the physician´s decision. After the ablation all the pulmonary&#xD;
      veins should be assessed with angiography to detect an ablation mediated PV - stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticoagulation: All patients should be anticoagulated four weeks before and at least six&#xD;
      months after the index procedure. During the procedure the activated clotting time (ACT) must&#xD;
      be kept between 250-350 sec by i.v. heparin administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AAD: All AAD should be discontinued 4 to 5 half-life periods before the procedure. No AAD&#xD;
      will be prescribed (except betablocker) after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be monitored during the hospital stay after the procedure (the first&#xD;
      24-48h). Additional clinical visits will be performed at three, six, nine and twelve months&#xD;
      after the last procedure. Another MRI or CT scan should be performed at the third month to&#xD;
      re-evaluate the PVs and at least one 24h holter ECG recording to screen for symptomatic or&#xD;
      asymptomatic atrial arrhythmias (AF, AT) has to be done. An event recorder or holter ECG to&#xD;
      reveal the long-term recurrences will be given at the six and twelve month follow-up (for&#xD;
      minimum of seven days, preferably 14 days) 22. In case of a recurrence a second procedure can&#xD;
      be performed six months after the index procedure. The procedure of choice for the&#xD;
      recurrences will be the same modality to which the patient originally had been randomized&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Primary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combined endpoint out of:&#xD;

&#xD;
      Biometrical concept:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization The randomization numbers will be allocated to the two groups in balanced&#xD;
      permuted blocks using the random number generator of the validated software SAS®. To avoid&#xD;
      any potential of predicting the group allocation of future patients, the block length is&#xD;
      fixed in a separate document that is withheld from the study site. Sealed envelopes are&#xD;
      produced labeled with the randomization number. Inside of the sealed envelope, a data sheet&#xD;
      defines the group allocation of the patient with the respective randomization number. On&#xD;
      enrollment in the study, each patient receives the randomization envelope in consecutive&#xD;
      order of inclusion in the study. Basic characteristics of the patient and day of&#xD;
      randomization are documented on the data sheet in order to allow a check whether the&#xD;
      randomization scheme was observed strictly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test problem and analysis of primary endpoint The primary objective of this trial is to&#xD;
      demonstrate non-inferiority of isolating PVs procedure with the cryoballoon catheter (CC) as&#xD;
      compared to radiofrequency isolation (RF) with respect to the primary endpoints &quot;absence of&#xD;
      atrial arrhythmias and absence of persistent complications six and twelve months after the&#xD;
      procedure&quot;, respectively. For this purpose, the following test problems will be assessed:&#xD;
      Null hypothesis H0: pCC (rate of absence of atrial arrhythmias and absence of persistent&#xD;
      complications twelve months after the procedure with CC) - pRF (rate of absence of atrial&#xD;
      arrhythmias and absence of persistent complications twelve months after the procedure with&#xD;
      RF) -d versus alternative hypothesis H1: pCC - pRF &gt; -d, where d = 0.15 defines the&#xD;
      non-inferiority margin that is deemed to be acceptable in view of the advantages of CC with&#xD;
      respect to aspects other than the primary endpoint. The analogous test problem is formulated&#xD;
      for the endpoint after six months follow up. These test problems will be analyzed applying&#xD;
      the non-inferiority test for rates according to Farrington and Manning17 at a one-sided&#xD;
      significance level of a = 2.5%. The following multiple test procedure for hierarchically&#xD;
      ordered hypotheses is applied to account for the multiplicity in primary endpoints: The null&#xD;
      hypothesis formulated for the six months outcome is only tested if the null hypothesis for&#xD;
      the twelve months outcome can be rejected; otherwise both null hypotheses are accepted. If&#xD;
      both null hypotheses can be rejected, the null hypotheses H0g are tested at one-sided level a&#xD;
      = 2.5% for margins g &lt; d as long as H0g has to be accepted for a value gSTOP. Then,&#xD;
      non-inferiority of CC as compared to RF has been shown for all non-inferiority margins g &lt;&#xD;
      gSTOP. This multiple test procedure controls the overall type I error rate a18, 19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confirmatory analysis will be primarily based on the FAS which is consistent with the&#xD;
      intention-to-treat (ITT) principle by including all patients who were randomized to the two&#xD;
      groups. This approach reflects the idea that the study should match as close as possible to&#xD;
      the conditions in clinical practice. However, the PP analysis plays an important role&#xD;
      particularly in non-inferiority studies, and therefore the results of the PP analysis set are&#xD;
      to be interpreted and discussed with special attention in parallel to the ITT analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of the sample size Sample size calculation is based on the following&#xD;
      considerations. In view of the advantages of CC as compared to RF in dimensions other than&#xD;
      the primary endpoints, an inferiority by a difference in rates of 0.15 for CC as compared to&#xD;
      RF with respect to the two primary outcomes is deemed to be acceptable. Therefore, the&#xD;
      non-inferiority range was set equal to d = 0.15. On the basis of previous studies and&#xD;
      experiences with the procedures16, equal rates of pCC = pRF = 0.78 are assumed for sample&#xD;
      size calculation. Under these assumptions, the sample size required to achieve a power of 1 -&#xD;
      b = 80% for the one-sided Farrington-Manning test at level a = 2.5% amounts to 2 x 122 = 244&#xD;
      patients17. In order to cope with the uncertainty about the assumed overall rate of 0.78, a&#xD;
      sample size review is performed after 150 patients are randomized or the outcome of the&#xD;
      primary variable is available for 100 patients, respectively, depending on which of the&#xD;
      events occurs first. No significance test is performed then and hence there is no option for&#xD;
      early stopping with rejection of the null hypothesis. Instead, the overall rate for the&#xD;
      primary variable is estimated based on the available data and the sample size is recalculated&#xD;
      employing the obtained value in the sample size formula (i.e. pCC = pRF = estimated overall&#xD;
      rate) and leaving the values for a, 1-b, and d as above. It was shown that this procedure&#xD;
      does not affect the type I error rate of the analysis20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient's allocation to the different analysis populations (full analysis set (FAS)&#xD;
      according to the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle, per protocol (PP) analysis set, safety&#xD;
      analysis set) will be defined prior to the analysis. The allocation will be documented in the&#xD;
      statistical analysis plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the data review before start of any analysis, deviations from the protocol will be&#xD;
      assessed as &quot;minor&quot; or &quot;major&quot;. Major deviations from the protocol will lead to the exclusion&#xD;
      of a patient from the PP analysis set. If a patient discontinues from the study prematurely,&#xD;
      missing data with respect to the primary outcome variable will be replaced by ICA-r method19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of secondary endpoints The secondary variables will be analyzed descriptively by&#xD;
      tabulation of the measures of the empirical distributions. According to the scale level of&#xD;
      the variables, means, standard deviations, median, 1st and 3rd quartiles as well as minimum&#xD;
      and maximum or absolute and relative frequencies, respectively, will be reported. Logistic&#xD;
      regression models will be applied to assess the effects of potential risk factors on primary&#xD;
      and secondary efficacy variables. Additionally, for variables with longitudinal measurements&#xD;
      the time courses of individual patients and summarized by treatment groups will be compared.&#xD;
      Descriptive p-values of the corresponding statistical tests comparing the treatment groups&#xD;
      and associated 95% confidence intervals will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety analysis will be based on the set of all patients for which one of the procedures&#xD;
      was applied. Adverse and serious adverse events as well as complications will be tabulated,&#xD;
      absolute and relative frequencies; the severity and the relationship to the procedure will be&#xD;
      given and compared between the groups. Cardiac markers will be described and interpreted with&#xD;
      respect to the reference values, and the measures describing the empirical distributions of&#xD;
      the changes are calculated. Additionally, for each cardiac marker, shift tables presenting&#xD;
      changes between the categories &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;abnormal&quot; will be given per treatment group.&#xD;

      Radiological restricted movement of the diaphragm Minor: asymptomatic or less than 50%&#xD;
      restriction Major: symptomatic or more than 50% restriction In cases of persistent symptoms&#xD;
      due to phrenic nerve palsy at least one fluoroscopy will be performed up to the 6 months&#xD;
      follow-up to verify the restriction of the diaphragm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bleedings and vascular complications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minor: Any bleeding or vascular complication (hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, atriovenous fistula)&#xD;
      requiring prolonged hospitalization but could be managed conservatively Major: Any bleeding&#xD;
      or vascular complication requiring additional therapy (i.e. surgery, transfusion therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
      CVA: Every new TIA or stroke after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and at every clinical visit patients will be ask to complete a standardized&#xD;
      questionnaire to evaluate the symptomatic and life restrictiveness originating from the&#xD;
      arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain After venous and arterial puncture and after the complete procedure the patients will be&#xD;
      asked to grade their sensation of pain (range 1-10)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Costs Standard prices for consumable material such as catheters, electrodes, refrigerant per&#xD;
      EP study will be evaluated. Purchase or leasing prices i.e. for a mapping system or the cryo&#xD;
      console will not be considered.&#xD;
