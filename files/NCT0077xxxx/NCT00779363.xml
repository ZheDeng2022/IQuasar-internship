  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this feasibility study are to evaluate the safety and functionality of the&#xD;
      TANTALUS System with TANTALUS II IPG, to assess the effect of GCM signal application on&#xD;
      trends of HbA1c, blood glucose and body weight changes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective multi center, non-randomized, treatment only clinical trial with up to&#xD;
      thirty (30) obese with type 2 diabetes subjects. The study is designed to demonstrate that&#xD;
      use of the rechargeable TANTALUS II IPG is safe and that it functions as designed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo an approximately two week baseline screening process. Eligible subjects&#xD;
      will undergo device implantation. This will be followed by therapy initiation approximately&#xD;
      one week after implantation. The device will then be activated to automatically deliver&#xD;
      gastric contractility modulating (GCM) for 12 weeks of therapy. Stimulation will continue in&#xD;
      for a safety monitoring period of 18 months following the therapy period.&#xD;
