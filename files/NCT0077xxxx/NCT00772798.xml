      TITLE:A Phase II non-comparative study of paclitaxel plus carboplatin in combination with&#xD;
      Vorinostat in patients with advanced, recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer.&#xD;
      INDICATION:Second-line treatment of patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive epithelial&#xD;
      ovarian cancer. RATIONALE:Recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer is today an incurable disease.&#xD;
      The current standard of care consists of systemic chemotherapy using either carboplatin plus&#xD;
      paclitaxel (in platinum-sensitive patients) or single agent chemotherapy with agents like&#xD;
      liposomal doxorubicin, topotecan, weekly paclitaxel or gemcitabine (platinum non-sensitive&#xD;
      patients). The outcome for patients with advanced ovarian cancer nevertheless remains&#xD;
      poor.Preclinical evidence suggests that vorinostat, a potent histone deacetylase (HDAC)&#xD;
      inhibitor, may potentiate the antitumor activity of paclitaxel and/or carboplatin. The study&#xD;
      will assess whether the addition of vorinostat to paclitaxel plus carboplatin is manageable&#xD;
      and induces reasonable response rates in patients with advanced recurrent, platinum-sensitive&#xD;
      ovarian cancer. Biomarkers will be collected from both primary tumors and biopsies before and&#xD;
      after start of treatment with vorinostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:Phase II, single-center study. All eligible patients will be treated with intravenous&#xD;
      paclitaxel plus carboplatin plus oral vorinostat. Patients will be treated with a maximum of&#xD;
      6 cycles or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
      Clinical endpoints will include adverse experiences, progression-free survival (PFS) and&#xD;
      response rate (RR). SAMPLE:Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of&#xD;
      epithelial ovarian cancer, cancer of the Fallopian tube or primary peritoneal adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
      All patients will have received first-line therapy with carboplatin plus paclitaxel. Patients&#xD;
      should be platinum sensitive, defined as recurrence or progression of ovarian cancer, cancer&#xD;
      of the Fallopian tubes or primary peritoneal adenocarcinoma 6 months or later after the end&#xD;
      of first-line chemotherapy. Patients to be enrolled on this study must have acceptable&#xD;
      performance status and acceptable renal and hepatic function, and be free of other serious&#xD;
      intercurrent illness that could impair their ability to receive protocol therapy. The study&#xD;
      will include up to 55 assessable patients, of which 20 will provide biomarkers. It is&#xD;
      estimated that the inclusion period will last approximately 24 months. DOSAGE/DOSAGE FORM,&#xD;
      ROUTE, AND DOSE REGIMEN Eligible patients will be treated with paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) and&#xD;
      carboplatin AUC5 administered by intravenous infusion (IV) on day 1 of each treatment cycle.&#xD;
      In addition, all eligible patients will receive treatment with oral vorinostat (400 mg)&#xD;
      administered once daily by mouth with food on days -4 through 10 of Cycle 1 (25-day treatment&#xD;
      cycle) and days 1 through 14 of each subsequent 21-day treatment cycle. Patients will receive&#xD;
      antiemetic therapy according to institutional guidelines as well as premedication with&#xD;
      dexamethasone, and antihistamines (an H1-receptor antagonist and an H2-receptor antagonist)&#xD;
      for prevention of the side effects of paclitaxel.&#xD;
