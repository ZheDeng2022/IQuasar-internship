      To compare the single-dose oral bioavailability of loratadine 10 mg orally disintegrating&#xD;
      tablets of Ohm Laboratories (a subsidiary of Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals Inc., USA) with&#xD;
      Claritin® Reditabs® (containing loratadine 10 mg) of Schering-Plough Healthcare Product Inc.,&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was conducted as an open label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-sequence,&#xD;
      two-period, single-dose, crossover, bioavailability study on loratadine formulation comparing&#xD;
      loratadine 10 mg orally disintegrating tablets of Ohm Laboratories, Inc. (a subsidiary of&#xD;
      Ranbaxy pharmaceuticals Inc, USA) with Claritin® Reditabs® 10 mg tablet (containing&#xD;
      loratadine 10 mg) of Schering- Plough Healthcare Product Inc, in healthy, adult, male, human&#xD;
      subjects under fasting condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single oral dose of loratadine 10 mg orally disintegrating tablets was orally administered&#xD;
      under low light condition during each period of the study under the supervision of a trained&#xD;
      Medical Officer. Subjects were instructed to let the tablets completely dissolve on the&#xD;
      tongue before swallowing the saliva and then, 240 mL of water was administered 30 seconds&#xD;
      after drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of the study safety parameters assessed were vital signs, clinical&#xD;
      examination, medical history and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical&#xD;
      parameters and urine analysis) at baseline. Laboratory parameters of hematology and&#xD;
      biochemistry were repeated at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 80 subjects were randomized to receive a single oral dose of the test or reference&#xD;
      formulation for loratadine 10 mg. Seventy-four subjects completed both the periods of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
