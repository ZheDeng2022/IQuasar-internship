  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a robust, low-power, stable, and light weight, active&#xD;
      knee prosthetic device that can dramatically increase gait symmetry and walking economy of a&#xD;
      transfemoral amputee during walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      State of the art prosthetic knees can be classified into three main classes: a) mechanically&#xD;
      passive, b) variable-damping, and c) powered. Although the devices within each of these&#xD;
      classes offer some advantages for above-knee amputees, their overall performance still&#xD;
      presents some deficiencies. Artificial knees in the first two groups are predominantly&#xD;
      damping devices, incapable of providing positive power output. Moreover, current powered&#xD;
      prostheses are heavy and inefficient in their energy consumption, and/or they have a limited&#xD;
      range of motion. To overcome such inadequacies, we have designed a novel prosthetic knee&#xD;
      device with a biomimetic approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design of the active knee prosthesis is inspired by the antagonistic muscle anatomy of&#xD;
      the human knee joint. This device mimics the synergistic muscle activity at the knee using a&#xD;
      double series-elastic actuator (SEA) system that resembles the major mono-articular muscle&#xD;
      groups that help flex and extend the knee joint. The agonist-antagonist SEA knee architecture&#xD;
      will allow for precise force control of the knee joint, mimicking the spring-like behavior of&#xD;
      the human knee, as well as providing adequate energy for forward progression of the body. The&#xD;
      SEA has been previously developed and tested on legged robots. Also, the SEA has been&#xD;
      successfully applied to the development of an actuated ankle-foot orthoses (AAFO) at MIT AI&#xD;
      Lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanical architecture of the active knee prosthesis allows for independent engagement&#xD;
      of flexion and extension tendon-like, series springs for the control of joint position and&#xD;
      impedance, as well as net joint torque. Furthermore, this architecture permits a joint&#xD;
      rotation with near zero friction, allowing the controller to take advantage of the passive&#xD;
      dynamics of the system, thus, augmenting the overall energetic efficiency of the system.&#xD;

      Healthy participants with above-knee amputations will be recruited. Participants will meet&#xD;
      the following eligibility criteria. They will be experienced at prosthesis ambulation, with a&#xD;
      capacity of ambulation at least at a K3 level (i.e. having the ability or potential for&#xD;
      ambulation with variable cadence). Additionally, amputee participants will be generally&#xD;
      healthy and will have no other musculoskeletal problems or any known cardiovascular,&#xD;
      pulmonary or neurological disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research objective is to evaluate the efficacy of an active knee prosthesis that is&#xD;
      designed to increase gait symmetry, speed, and to lower metabolic energy demands during&#xD;
      walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each amputee participant, a complete study will include three separate experimental&#xD;
      sessions conducted in three different locations. These locations are: The Biomechatronics&#xD;
      Group, MIT Media Laboratory; the Holodeck room in CSAIL at MIT; and the Indoor Track at MIT's&#xD;
      Johnson Athletic Center. The time between experimental sessions will be approximately one to&#xD;
      two weeks and the time duration of each session will be two to three hours. For each session,&#xD;
      an amputee study participant will be asked to walk at slow, normal, and fast paces for two&#xD;
      different conditions. The experimental conditions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Using an assigned commercially, available knee prosthesis (e.g. Otto Bock C-Leg or Ossur&#xD;
           Rheo)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Using the active knee prosthesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first session, each amputee participant will be scheduled to visit the Biomechatronics&#xD;
      Group in The MIT Media Laboratory. The main purpose of this session is to qualitatively&#xD;
      assess the degree to which the active prosthesis can improve amputee gait. Morphological data&#xD;
      (for example, height, weight, limb length and circumference) of the participant will be&#xD;
      recorded using the biomechanical data collection form. These data will be used during&#xD;
      analysis of data gathered during the gait research sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be asked to walk along a 30-foot level walkway in the Biomechatronics&#xD;
      Group. During the session, each participant will be asked to walk at slow, normal and fast&#xD;
      paces for each of two walking conditions. For each condition and speed, approximately 10-15&#xD;
      trials will be performed. Parallel bars will be utilized to prevent any injury to the subject&#xD;
      if he were to lose balance and fall. A safely harness attached to the ceiling will also be&#xD;
      utilized if the subject makes that request. In addition, a member of the laboratory staff&#xD;
      will also accompany the study participant to catch him in the event of a fall, if necessary.&#xD;
      The participant may ask to rest or to terminate their participation in the study at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be walking on the platform 60-90 times for the entire first session,&#xD;
      which should take approximately 2 hours. When using the active prosthesis with the walking&#xD;
      program, our researchers will tune the parameters of the walking program to the participant's&#xD;
      own gait pattern. The parameters used to tune the walking program will be recorded for use in&#xD;
      Sessions 2 and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second session, amputee study participants will be scheduled to visit the Holodeck&#xD;
      room in CSAIL at MIT (Rm 33-339), that has installed the motion capture system to measure&#xD;
      human movement. The main purpose of this session is to collect knee state, torque and power&#xD;
      on amputees walking at slow, moderate and fast speeds. These active knee prosthetic data will&#xD;
      then be compared to conventional prosthetic knee behaviors measured at the same three speeds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be asked to walk along a 30-foot level walkway in the Holodeck room in&#xD;
      CSAIL at MIT. Before conducting experiments, one of the investigators will place reflective&#xD;
      markers on the participant's skin with tape at specific points over joints of their body.&#xD;
      These special markers are then seen by the cameras in the room (See Data Collection&#xD;
      Instruments). During the session, each participant will be asked to walk at slow, normal and&#xD;
      fast paces for each of two walking conditions. For each condition and speed, approximately&#xD;
      10-15 trials will be performed. Motion data is collected from cameras in the room and from&#xD;
      the force plates that are placed in the walkway. As the device has been setup in the first&#xD;
      session, two members of the laboratory staff will walk on each side of the participant&#xD;
      throughout the experiment. The second session should take between 2 and 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the third session, each transfemoral amputee participant will be scheduled to visit the&#xD;
      Indoor Track of the Johnson Athletic Center at MIT, which is located at the 2nd floor of the&#xD;
      Athletic Center. The main purpose of this session is to test if the active knee prosthesis&#xD;
      does, in fact, reduce the metabolic cost of amputee walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the session, each participant will be asked to wear a Cosmed Oxygen Consumption (VO2)&#xD;
      mask that will measure the metabolic rate. Two members of the laboratory staff will walk on&#xD;
      each side of the participant throughout the experiment. The procedure for the experiment will&#xD;
      be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be asked to wear the VO2 system and first walk for 8 minutes on the&#xD;
      track with an assigned commercially, available above knee prosthesis (Otto Bock C-Leg or&#xD;
      Ossur Rheo) to establish a control metabolic rate. After resting for 8 minutes, he/she will&#xD;
      wear the active prosthesis and get acclimated to the device by walking for 5 minutes. He/she&#xD;
      will then walk on the track for 8 minutes as we measure his/her metabolic rate with the&#xD;
      device. The participant will then rest for another 8 minutes. This protocol will be repeated&#xD;
      two additional times, and the entire experiment will take approximately 3 Hrs. Throughout the&#xD;
      study, each participant will be videotaped and photographed to document the effect of the&#xD;
      prosthesis on walking.&#xD;
