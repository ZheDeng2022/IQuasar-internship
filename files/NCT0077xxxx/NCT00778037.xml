      The study was conducted as an open label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-sequence,&#xD;
      two-period, single-dose, crossover, bioavailability study comparing Cyclobenzaprine&#xD;
      hydrochloride 10 mg tablet of Ohm Labs Inc (A subsidiary of Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals Inc USA.)&#xD;
      with Flexeril速 10 mg tablet (containing Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride 10 mg) manufactured by&#xD;
      Merck &amp; Co Inc., USA and distributed by McNeil Consumer &amp; Speciality Pharmaceuticals, in&#xD;
      healthy, adult, male, human subjects under fasting condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, A single oral dose of one Cyclobenzaprine&#xD;
      hydrochloride 10 mg tablet was administered with 240 mL of drinking water at ambient&#xD;
      temperature during each period of the study under supervision of a trained Study Personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of the study safety parameters assessed were vital signs, clinical&#xD;
      examination, medical history and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical&#xD;
      parameters, serology and urine analysis) at baseline. Laboratory parameters of hematology and&#xD;
      biochemistry were repeated at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of forty (40) subjects were enrolled in the study. Out of which thirty-four (34)&#xD;
