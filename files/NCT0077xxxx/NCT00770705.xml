    <textblock>
      Phenoxybenzamine, an irreversible alpha-adrenergic blocker, may prove beneficial to infants&#xD;
      and children with congenital heart disease undergoing open cardiac repair, due to a theoretic&#xD;
      benefits of a uniform and smooth reduction in systemic vascular resistance in the&#xD;
      perioperative period. Vasodilation allows for low pressure, high flow systemic perfusion&#xD;
      while on cardiopulmonary bypass. Support for the use of phenoxybenzamine in humans has been&#xD;
      documented in several studies involving the perioperative management of both adults and&#xD;
      children requiring cardiopulmonary bypass, and in management of patients with&#xD;
      pheochromocytoma. 1-7 Phenoxybenzamine has been associated with more uniform body cooling and&#xD;
      rewarming, and improved tissue perfusion during bypass.8 It is also known to increase cardiac&#xD;
      output, stroke volume, and renal blood flow when given intravenously. 9 Specifically in&#xD;
      pediatric open heart surgery, the combined use of phenoxybenzamine and dopamine provided a&#xD;
      stable hemodynamic condition without a high total peripheral vascular resistance and&#xD;
      stimulated postoperative diuresis. 9 Afterload reduction with parenteral phenoxybenzamine in&#xD;
      neonates undergoing the Norwood procedure for hypoplastic left heart syndrome is associated&#xD;
      with improved systemic oxygen delivery and stabilization of systemic vascular resistance.10&#xD;
      Furthermore, a strategy of reducing afterload with phenoxybenzamine and stabilizing the&#xD;
      pulmonary to systemic flow ratio in this select population of patients has also been shown to&#xD;
      improve operative survival. 11 We hypothesize that phenoxybenzamine will reduce afterload on&#xD;
      the systemic ventricle in our selected patient population, thereby improving ventricular&#xD;
      performance and decreasing the risks of pulmonary to systemic flow imbalance associated with&#xD;
      current short-acting vasodilator therapy. We will plan to evaluate both physiologic variables&#xD;
      as well as surgical outcomes in the selected study population.&#xD;

      II. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Description of the Problem One of the effects of cardiac operations involving&#xD;
           cardiopulmonary bypass is reversible myocardial dysfunction lasting a number of days&#xD;
           postoperatively. Typically this period of myocardial dysfunction is treated with&#xD;
           vasoactive drugs aimed at improving contractility and reducing afterload. Problems exist&#xD;
           with the current vasodilator therapy, including: variable response, inadequate response,&#xD;
           complications of delivery mechanism with the potential for swings in blood pressure and&#xD;
           ongoing dose adjustments. These are necessary due to the patients' autonomic nervous&#xD;
           system reactivity changes during the post-cardiopulmonary bypass period. Evidence to&#xD;
           support therapies targeting control of systemic vascular resistance include randomized&#xD;
           controlled studies looking at the outcome of high risk neonates undergoing open cardiac&#xD;
           procedures with very high dose synthetic narcotic anesthesia. This is known to reduce&#xD;
           sympathetic nervous system activity. There exist numerous, uncontrolled but widely&#xD;
           accepted, studies documenting the adjunctive use of vasodilators such as sodium&#xD;
           nitroprusside, nitroglycerin and alpha-adrenergic blockers including phenoxybenzamine in&#xD;
           the perioperative period. The results of all of these studies point towards a salutatory&#xD;
           effect of measures to control vasoconstrictor responses on blood flow to the organs at&#xD;
           risk, primarily the organs in the splenic circulation: the liver, kidneys, and&#xD;
           intestines. Ischemia to these organs is responsible for a significant amount of&#xD;
           morbidity in the post-bypass period including late onset sepsis and renal dysfunction.&#xD;
           In addition, after myocardial injury the natural vasoconstrictor responses that&#xD;
           mammalian organisms have to falling cardiac output are counterproductive and may&#xD;
           initiate a cascade of responses, necessitating medical interventions culminating in&#xD;
           overt myocardial pump failure. This then can lead to patient death or need for&#xD;
           institution of extracorporeal circulatory support after the initial cardiopulmonary&#xD;
           bypass period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Physiologic Role of Phenoxybenzamine Numerous reports have demonstrated that with nearly&#xD;
           complete blockage of alpha-adrenergic receptors (i.e. phenoxybenzamine) that both&#xD;
           infusions of exogenous catecholamines and the neural release of endogenous&#xD;
           catecholamines result not in vasoconstrictor responses but instead augmented myocardial&#xD;
           contractility without increases in afterload. While medical interventions to effect&#xD;
           circulatory responses are already in use commonly in the perioperative period, including&#xD;
           synthetic narcotic analgesia and the use of short-acting vasodilator agents, these&#xD;
           measures alone have not been universally effective in preventing the sort of hemodynamic&#xD;
           deterioration described above. Therefore, we propose to use phenoxybenzamine, a drug&#xD;
           which irreversibly binds to alpha-adrenergic receptors and some dopamine receptors, as&#xD;
           an adjunct to the management of the perioperative vascular tone abnormalities in high&#xD;
           risk infants and children undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass for open heart procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Existing pharmacologic and clinical data Phenoxybenzamine (Dibenzyline: Wellspring&#xD;
           Pharmaceutical Corporation, Bradenton, FL) is a haloalkylamine that irreversibly blocks&#xD;
           both α-1 and α-2 adrenergic receptors. The drug exhibits a slightly higher affinity for&#xD;
           the α-1 receptor. 12 There exists a body of literature concerning intravenous&#xD;
           administration of phenoxybenzamine in the setting of congenital heart disease surgery,&#xD;
           specifically in the Norwood repair for hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The use of&#xD;
           phenoxybenzamine during cardiac surgery has been demonstrated to facilitate higher pump&#xD;
           flow rates during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and is associated with attenuation of&#xD;
           postoperative metabolic acidosis. 13 Specifically, phenoxybenzamine has been shown to be&#xD;
           more effective than sodium nitroprusside in improving tissue perfusion postbypass (as&#xD;
           demonstrated by a comparison of rewarming characteristics), with lower base deficits in&#xD;
           patients treated with phenoxybenzamine. 14 Indeed, to date there are many congenital&#xD;
           heart disease surgical centers in the United States who, prior to the Norwood procedure,&#xD;
           administer 0.25 mg/kg of phenoxybenzamine at the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass in&#xD;
           an attempt to optimize systemic organ perfusion in the perioperative period. Such a&#xD;
           protocol, at this dose specifically, has been described to improve systemic oxygen&#xD;
           delivery in patients undergoing the Norwood procedure for hypoplastic left heart&#xD;
           syndrome, as well as an improvement in survival to future surgical palliations. 10&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Aims and Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our general hypothesis is that a blockade of vasoconstrictor responses in the period around&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass will result in better organ preservation and improvement in cardiac&#xD;
      output postoperatively. More specifically, as serum lactate serves as a surrogate for&#xD;
      demonstrating the adequacy of end organ perfusion, we will utilize this continuous variable&#xD;
      as our primary endpoint for the purposes of this protocol. Our hypothesis is that the use of&#xD;
      phenoxybenzamine in this select population will reduce initial postoperative lactate levels&#xD;
      by a clinically-relevant level of 25%, relative to historical controls. Secondary endpoints&#xD;
      evaluated as well will include utilization of inotropic support, duration of hospitalization,&#xD;
      and time to resolution of postoperative lactic acidosis. Both physiologic and outcome&#xD;
      variables will be examined and compared to a matched cohort of patients drawn from our recent&#xD;
      experience without the use of phenoxybenzamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Patient Selection and Clinical Management&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection will be determined by an assessment of the risk of systemic ventricular&#xD;
      dysfunction following open cardiac repair in a population of infants undergoing stage I&#xD;
      palliation (Norwood procedure) for the diagnosis of either hypoplastic left heart syndrome or&#xD;
      similar left-sided obstructive lesions in the setting of single-ventricle physiology.&#xD;
      Eligible neonates and infants include those aged 0 days to 6 months. These patients will be&#xD;
      evaluated on an individual basis and the decision to give phenoxybenzamine would be&#xD;
      determined by the attending surgeon, anesthesiologist, and cardiologist. No other change in&#xD;
      the patients' perioperative management will occur. Efficacy will be assessed by evaluating&#xD;
      the need for vasodilators and inotropic agents, as well as by evaluating the effects of&#xD;
      alpha-blockade on the clinical course and hemodynamics of the patient. Comparison to a&#xD;
      matched historical cohort of patients not receiving the drug will be performed. Likewise, the&#xD;
      historical cohort population to be included in this population include all infants who have&#xD;
      undergone the Norwood procedure for either hypoplastic left heart syndrome or those with a&#xD;
      similar univentricular lesion requiring aortic arch reconstruction. Aside from the importance&#xD;
      of meeting protocol inclusion criteria, there are no specific criteria to exclude subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Drug Administration and Safety Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parenteral phenoxybenzamine requires an IND for human administration, which has been&#xD;
      submitted to the FDA and is pending (see attached). The only significant risk of parenteral&#xD;
      phenoxybenzamine has been excessive alpha-adrenergic blockade resulting in diastolic&#xD;
      hypotension. This problem has been treated with intravenous adrenergic support in the form of&#xD;
      norepinephrine or vasopressin. Precautions in place during the use of phenoxybenzamine will&#xD;
      include physician presence during administration, invasive arterial blood pressure&#xD;
      monitoring, and inotropic agents available for immediate use. This drug will be obtained from&#xD;
      WellSpring Pharmaceuticals and stored in the Investigational Drug Pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug will be administered in the operating room. After induction of anesthesia and the&#xD;
      pIacement of appropriate cardiovascular monitoring lines, an initial loading dose of 0.25&#xD;
      mg/kg will be administered intravenously immediately prior to cardiopulmonary bypass.For up&#xD;
      to 72 hours postoperatively, 0.25 mg/kg/day will be administered Based on published&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic data these doses should block 90 -95% of alpha-peripheral receptors with a&#xD;
      half life of 24 - 36 hours for regeneration. This period of time corresponds nicely with the&#xD;
      period of highest hemodynamic vulnerability of this patient population. No alteration in&#xD;
      usual perioperative monitoring will occur solely to allow drug administration. Monitoring of&#xD;
      anesthesia, preload, afterload, contractility, and cardiac output will be maintained&#xD;
      throughout the period of administration and recovery in ways which are at present, performed&#xD;
      in this patient population: invasive transthoracic cardiac lines, echocardiography, venous&#xD;
      and systemic oximetry, and analysis of acid/base abnormalities. Secondary end-organ function&#xD;
      will be monitored including kidneys (urine output, creatinine,) and brain (cerebral&#xD;
      oximetry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential toxicity of the drug is related to the effects of excessive vasodilatation.&#xD;
      Subjects will be monitored for toxicity through both frequent physical examination as well as&#xD;
      continuous blood pressure monitoring in the immediate postoperative period. The ultimate&#xD;
      rescue therapy for excessive vasodilation and hypotension would be the institution of high&#xD;
      flow extracorporeal circulation, which we would be in a position to provide in a most timely&#xD;
      fashion in both the operating room and intensive care unit. Pharmacologic management to&#xD;
      counteract adverse effects of alpha-adrenergic blockade would be norepinephrine, administered&#xD;
      in the dose 0.01-0.05 mcglkglmin. Epinephrine may be relatively contraindicated in this&#xD;
      setting because beta-adrenergic receptors are left unopposed. Therefore, drugs that stimulate&#xD;
      both types of receptors (e.g., epinephrine) may produce an exaggerated hypotensive response&#xD;
      and tachycardia. Those subjects experiencing hypotension refractory to conventional&#xD;
      postoperative management, who are experiencing end-organ dysfunction related to hypotension,&#xD;
      or who require norepinephrine reversal of the previous dose of phenoxybenzamine would be&#xD;
      strongly considered for withdrawal from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse reactions reported in oral administration include nasal congestion, mycosis,&#xD;
      tachycardia, drowsiness and fatigue. This drug has been FDA approved for oral administration&#xD;
      in treatment of pheochromocytoma to control episodes of hypertension and sweating. It has&#xD;
      also shown efficacy in micturition disorders resulting from neurogenic bladder, functional&#xD;
      outlet obstruction and partial prosthetic obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed throughout their hospital course until the time of discharge home.&#xD;
      There will be no further follow up asked of subjects related to this study. Historical cohort&#xD;
      analysis will include analysis of clinically-relevant endpoints as noted below, as well as&#xD;
      laboratory values and vital signs during the perioperative period and until time of discharge&#xD;
      home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A three-physician panel, comprised of those involved in operative and postoperative care of&#xD;
      this particular patient population (but not an investigator in this study) will be appointed&#xD;
      to review subject cases. The panel will meet at 5-subject intervals to review the data and&#xD;
      safety profile from each case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Data Storage, Acquisition, and Analysis An electronic database, which is&#xD;
      password-protected and available only to the PI and co-investigators will be utilized for the&#xD;
      purposes of data analysis. A copy of the data acquisition form accompanies this application.&#xD;
      The data will be destroyed 5 years following completion of the study and analysis of the&#xD;
      resulting data. Data acquired for the study will be stored in a password-protected database.&#xD;
      Only the PI and the co-investigators will have access to this password and the database. Upon&#xD;
      identification of eligible historical cohorts, their charts will be reviewed with pertinent&#xD;
      data entered in the above-described database. The data of historical cohorts will be&#xD;
      de-identified as an attempt to maintain confidentiality. Subject ID numbers in the historical&#xD;
      cohort group will be assigned only to differentiate between subjects for the purpose of data&#xD;
      analysis, and will not specifically identify subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will include several clinically-relevant endpoints, including overall surgical&#xD;
      mortality (survival to discharge), time to initial extubation and cessation of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, and length of hospital stay. End-organ function status post cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass will be assessed by evaluating lab values currently studied, including serum lactate.&#xD;
      Monitoring of hemodynamic values including blood pressure and left atrial pressure will be&#xD;
      utilized to indirectly assess cardiac output. Other end organs evaluated will include kidney&#xD;
      (urine output and other tests of renal function such as creatinine) and brain (clinical&#xD;
      evaluation and tests ordered as indicated, as well as cerebral oximetry). We will also&#xD;
      evaluate the need for inotropic and/or vasodilator support (both dose and duration). The&#xD;
      study will not require additional lab or radiology testing based on patient inclusion. Data&#xD;
      reviewed from historical cohorts include those as specified in the data collection sheet,&#xD;
      namely the above-described clinically-relevant endpoints, as well as laboratory values (serum&#xD;
      lactate, serum creatinine), vital signs (blood pressure, cerebral oximetry, and left atrial&#xD;
      pressure), evidence of end organ perfusion (urine output), and postoperative inotrope&#xD;
      requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As serum lactate serves as a surrogate for demonstrating the adequacy of end organ perfusion,&#xD;
      we will utilize this continuous variable as our primary endpoint for the purposes of this&#xD;
      protocol. Our hypothesis is that the use of phenoxybenzamine in this select population will&#xD;
      reduce initial postoperative lactate levels by a clinically-relevant level of 25%, relative&#xD;
      to historical controls. Secondary endpoints evaluated as well will include utilization of&#xD;
      inotropic support, duration of mechanical ventilation and overall hospitalization, and time&#xD;
      to resolution of postoperative lactic acidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent experience with the Norwood procedure, the conventional palliative surgical therapy&#xD;
      for hypoplastic left heart syndrome, demonstrated a mean initial serum lactate of 7.3 ± 3.3&#xD;
      mmol/L in 21 neonates. 15 Assuming a clinically significant reduction by 25% to 5.5 mmol/L&#xD;
      (at 80% power and an assumed p ≤ 0.05 demonstrating statistical significance), one would&#xD;
      require a total of 54 study subjects. Given an anticipated surgical volume of approximately&#xD;
      20 Norwood procedures annually, along with a 15% dropout or refusal rate, we would expect to&#xD;
      accrue a total required volume of 62 subjects in approximately 3 years. We will also compare&#xD;
      data with data that already exists within our cardiac registry for further evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Consent and Peer Judgement&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug will not be administered without the knowledge of attending surgeon and&#xD;
      anesthesiologist and after discussion with the perfusionists in order to ensure safety and&#xD;
      advisability. In the postoperative period the drug will not be administered without&#xD;
      discussion with all relevant participants in the patient's postoperative care. Informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from the patients family and documented in the chart prior to&#xD;
      administration of the drug. Because this drug is not yet FDA approved in the United States,&#xD;
      specific consent is necessary. An investigational new drug application has been filed and&#xD;
      permission from the FDA is pending. Significant adverse effects will be reported to the Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration and to the Vanderbilt University Institutional Review Board Health&#xD;
      Sciences Committee within 24 hours, and annual status reports will be filed with Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration according to their policies.&#xD;
