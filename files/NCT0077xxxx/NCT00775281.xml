      Interstitial cystitis (IC)/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) is a clinical syndrome of&#xD;
      pelvic pain and/or urinary urgency/frequency in absence of a specific cause such as bacterial&#xD;
      infection or damage to the bladder. The pathogenetic mechanisms of IC/CPPS are as yet&#xD;
      undefined and it is largely this lack of knowledge, which precludes a systematic therapeutic&#xD;
      approach. Experimental evidence, including results from the animal models of cystitis and the&#xD;
      knock-out mice, indicate a participation of tachykinin receptors, especially the NK1R, in&#xD;
      neurogenic inflammation, which is considered an important element of the IC complex. However,&#xD;
      there is very scant information about the molecular mechanisms of IC in humans, or of the&#xD;
      types of receptors, which participate in neurogenic inflammation. Based on our molecular&#xD;
      biological know-how and the clinical expertise, we propose to investigate the role of the&#xD;
      tachykinin and bradykinin receptors and their signalling partners in CPPS and bladder&#xD;
      dysfunction in humans.&#xD;

      Although IC has been recognised for more than a century, its pathophysiology remains a&#xD;
      mystery, and as a consequence the treatment of IC is largely empirical. A multitude of&#xD;
      mechanisms of the disease have been postulated ranging from neuroinflammatory to autoimmune&#xD;
      or possibly infectious or toxic agents. Newer studies have hinted towards a genetic basis of&#xD;
      the disease, but in most hypotheses an inflammatory component of some kind is involved and&#xD;
      many findings support this theory. An often-cited hypothesis is the leaky epithelium. The&#xD;
      healthy bladder is coated with a thin mucinous substance bladder surface mucin, which is&#xD;
      composed of numerous sulfonated glycosaminoglycans and glycoproteins. In IC patients, in&#xD;
      contrast to controls, as well as in some animal models of IC, qualitative changes to this&#xD;
      surface layer have been observed (Lilly et al, 1990., Moskowitz et al, 1994). An initiating&#xD;
      event (toxin) may lead to functional changes and increased permeability. This in turn leads&#xD;
      to nerve sensitisation and possibly up-regulation. There is increasing evidence that the&#xD;
      progression of IC is accompanied by a significant up-regulation of sensory nerves in the&#xD;
      bladder (Letourneau, 1996). Nerve growth factor (NGF), a neurotropin that sensitises&#xD;
      nociceptor fibres, was reported to be increased in bladders of IC patients (Lowe, 1997), and&#xD;
      application of NGF in Wistar rats acutely induced bladder hyperactivity (Chuang, 2001).&#xD;
      Sensory nerves in neurogenic inflammation secrete inflammatory mediators such as Substance P&#xD;
      (SP), a nociceptive neurotransmitter in the central and peripheral nervous system. Increased&#xD;
      amounts of the released Substance P have been found in the urine of IC patients&#xD;
      (Hohenfellner, et al,1992, Pang et al., 1995, Pang et al., 1996), the concentration of&#xD;
      Substance P reflecting the patients' degree of pain (Chen et al., 1999). Substance P and&#xD;
      related tachykinins (TKs) mediate a variety of physiological processes in the genitourinary,&#xD;
      pulmonary and gastrointestinal tract through stimulation of NK1 and NK2 receptors.&#xD;
      Pre-clinical evidence obtained through use of selective tachykinin receptor antagonists&#xD;
      indicates that endogenous tachykinins are involved in regulation of smooth muscle&#xD;
      contraction, vasodilation, water metabolism and inflammation. Recently it was shown that mRNA&#xD;
      encoding for SP receptor NK1 is in-creased in the bladder biopsies from patients with&#xD;
      interstitial cystitis (Marchand et al., 1998). NK1R mRNA was found in detrusor muscle,&#xD;
      urothelium and vascular structures, and the endothelial NK1R were markedly increased. SP&#xD;
      binding to NK1R on endothelial cells results in vasodilation, plasma extravasation, cytokine&#xD;
      release and activation and infiltration of immune cells, all characteristic of IC.&#xD;
      Experiments with the NK1R knockout mice allowed for the first time to demonstrate the&#xD;
      obligatory requirement of NK1R in cystitis and participation of these receptors in the chain&#xD;
      of events linking mast cell degranulation and inflammation (Saban et al., 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in the sarcolemma, and altered expression of the tachykinin and bradykinin receptors&#xD;
      might significantly influence the downstream signalling events leading to propagation of the&#xD;
      symptoms of chronic pelvic pain/IC. By uncovering the link between clinical symptoms and the&#xD;
      molecular regulation of the atypical inflammatory response, we may be able to offer novel and&#xD;
      specific options for treatment. In the current proposal, we would like to further our studies&#xD;
      of urinary bladder pathology, in particular the symptomatic complex of PBS/interstitial&#xD;
      cystitis, and investigate the effect of changes in human urothelium and detrusor muscle cells&#xD;
      on the NK1R-mediated signalling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsies from controls and PBS patients will be obtained in either general or spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia transurethrally from the bladder dome and trigone with a biopsy tong. RNA will be&#xD;
      extracted, and the expression levels of selected genes analyzed using Taqman real-time PCR&#xD;
      and gene expression arrays (Applied Biosystems). Calcium imaging will be used to monitor the&#xD;
      receptor activation and protein levels analysed by SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting. Receptor&#xD;
      tissue distribution will be analysed by immuno-cytochemistry.&#xD;
