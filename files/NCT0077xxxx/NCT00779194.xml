  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease of unknown origin. It involves&#xD;
      multiple organs including the joints, skin, kidneys and central nervous system. The disease&#xD;
      process is caused by a dysfunction of the immune system. The drugs currently used for the&#xD;
      treatment of SLE are only partially effective and carry significant risks for side-effects.&#xD;
      Rapamycin, also called sirolimus or Rapamune, has been approved by the FDA to prevent&#xD;
      rejection of organ transplants at daily doses of 2 mg to 8 mg. Patients that were resistant&#xD;
      or intolerant to conventional medication have been effectively treated with Rapamycin and&#xD;
      were able to decrease the amount of prednisone they needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to prospectively determine the therapeutic efficacy and&#xD;
      mechanism of action of Rapamune in patients with SLE. Healthy subjects not receiving Rapamune&#xD;
      will be asked to donate blood to serve as controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the research effort to understand the reason for the variations in the effects of&#xD;
      treatment drugs by different individuals, a sub-study of the DNA makeup of subjects enrolled&#xD;
      in the trial will also be done. The purpose of the sub-study is to possibly determine whether&#xD;
      different responses to the drugs used to treat SLE have a correlation with the differences in&#xD;
      the genetic makeup of the subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      40 SLE subjects and 40 healthy controls are being recruited. The study will lasts 1 year with&#xD;
      9 study visits from day 0 to day 360. The healthy controls only need to donate blood once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug, Rapamune, is manufactured by Pfizer Pharmaceuticals. It is taken by mouth at&#xD;
      a starting dose of 2mg/day. The dose is adjusted to achieve blood levels in the range of 6-15&#xD;
      ng/ml (the levels found to be effective for preventing organ rejections).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are obtained before taking Rapamune, every two weeks for the first month, then&#xD;
      every three months until 1 year, and then three months later to check the effect of&#xD;
      discontinuing rapamycin. Each SLE subject will be asked to provide up to 100 ml (20&#xD;
      teaspoons) of blood at each visit. The first 6 visits will take place within 3 months and the&#xD;
      remaining 3 visits every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine laboratory work will be performed. Part of the blood drawn will be used for research&#xD;
      and part will be used for routine lab work as part of standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The non-routine laboratory studies include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assessment of mitochondrial function in intact T cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Analysis of mTOR activity, FKBP12 expression, and global gene expression in lupus T&#xD;
           cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Predictors of therapeutic efficacy of rapamycin in SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug levels will be checked at every visit. The non-routine laboratory studies will&#xD;
      be performed at Visits 0 and 8 for SLE subjects and at Visit 0 for the healthy control&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy control subjects will be matched by age ( a decade or less), gender, and ethnic&#xD;
      origin. They will be recruited and analyzed on the same day as lupus subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will sign an informed consent at visit 0. There is a separate informed consent&#xD;
      for the main study, one for the SLE subjects and one for the Healthy Controls. The same&#xD;
      subjects can participate in the genetic sub-study. They must sign another informed consent&#xD;
      for the genetic sub-study, one for the SLE subjects and one for the Healthy Controls. There&#xD;
      is no need for additional blood drawing since part of the blood drawn for the main study can&#xD;
      be used for the genetic sub-study.&#xD;
