      This study compared the relative bioavailability (rate and extent of absorption) of the test&#xD;
      Gabapentin tablets 800 mg by Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited to the reference Neurontin ® 800 mg&#xD;
      tablets of Parke Davis Pharmaceuticals Ltd., distributed by Parke Davis, division of&#xD;
      Warner-Lambert Co. in 28 healthy, adult subjects (21 males and 7 females) under fasting&#xD;
      conditions using randomized, two-way crossover design.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single oral dose of the test or reference product was administered to the volunteers on two&#xD;
      separate occasions under fasting conditions with at least a 7 day washout between doses. Food&#xD;
      and fluid intake were controlled during each confinement period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of twenty eight (28) healthy subjects (21 males and 7 females) were enrolled in the&#xD;
      study of which twenty seven (27) subjects completed the study.&#xD;
