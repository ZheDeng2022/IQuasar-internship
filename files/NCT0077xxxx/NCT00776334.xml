      The objective of this study is to compare the relative bioavailability of fosinopril sodium&#xD;
      40 mg tablets (Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited, Lot No. 1238312) with that of Monopril速 in&#xD;
      healthy adult subjects under fasting conditions.&#xD;

      The study was conducted as an open label, balanced, randomised, two-treatment, two-period,&#xD;
      two-sequence, single-dose, crossover , bioequivalence study on Fosinopril formulations&#xD;
      comparing fosinopril 40mg tablets of Ranbaxy Laboratories with Monopril速 in healthy, adult,&#xD;
      human, subjects under fasting conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects underwent pre-study examinations that included a physical examination,&#xD;
      12-1cad ECG, and laboratory tests - including hematology, blood chemistries, urinalysis,&#xD;
      infectious diseases (Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV), and urine drugs of abuse. Laboratory&#xD;
      testing for female subjects also included a serum pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty (40) subjects were enrolled in this study; 39 completed the study.&#xD;
