      The purpose of this study is to investigate neurobehavioral, affective, and social processes&#xD;
      that may influence and predict treatment response in pediatric anxiety disorders.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol proposes to study neurobehavioral and social correlates of treatment response&#xD;
      in 200 youth (ages 9-13) with general anxiety disorder (GAD), separation anxiety disorder&#xD;
      (SAD), and social phobia (SP). All youth with an anxiety disorder will receive 14 weeks of&#xD;
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Client Centered Therapy (CCT) for child anxiety&#xD;
      disorders. The study combines state-of-the-art measures from affective neuroscience,&#xD;
      ecologically valid (EMA) measures of mood and behavior in natural environments, and measures&#xD;
      of family and social context within a developmentally framed treatment study. The study&#xD;
      design focuses on predictors and mechanisms of treatment response. This protocol will test&#xD;
      key features of a &quot;vigilance-avoidance&quot; model focusing on hypotheses that pretreatment neural&#xD;
      correlates of affective reactivity will predict treatment response and early changes in&#xD;
      emotional processing will correlate with clinical response during treatment. In addition, the&#xD;
      protocol examines how affective experiences within the family and social context are&#xD;
      associated with treatment response and change across treatment, and how these are associated&#xD;
      with and interact with neurobehavioral changes in affective functioning. Taken together these&#xD;
      aspects of the study will advance understanding of the neurobehavioral, affective, and social&#xD;
      processes that underpin treatment response in ways that will inform the design, refinement,&#xD;
      and optimal developmental timing of cognitive behavioral treatments, and thus, decrease the&#xD;
      morbidity, mortality, and lifetime impairments from these common disorders in youth.&#xD;
