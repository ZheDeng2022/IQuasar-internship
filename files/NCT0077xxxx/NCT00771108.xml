  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to provide a better understanding of how exercise (walking)&#xD;
      affects non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in overweight people. NAFLD, which is&#xD;
      common in obese people, occurs when the liver has too much fat.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects about 33% of adults in the United States.&#xD;
      The prevalence of NAFLD is four to five times higher in obese than lean persons and is&#xD;
      associated with insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. Decreasing calorie intake and&#xD;
      increasing physical activity has been recommended as primary therapy for NAFLD, but the&#xD;
      independent effect of aerobic exercise is unknown. The current exercise guidelines for&#xD;
      disease prevention and weight management range from 150 min/wk, recommended by the Centers&#xD;
      for Disease Control and the American College of Sports Medicine, to 300 min/wk, recommended&#xD;
      by the Institute of Medicine. However, it is not known whether aerobic exercise alone can&#xD;
      improve NAFLD, and which recommended dose of exercise might have the most beneficial effects.&#xD;
      The purpose of this proposal is to determine the effect of moderate intensity endurance&#xD;
      exercise on: 1) hepatic fat content; 2) hepatic lipoprotein kinetics; and 3) plasma&#xD;
      inflammatory markers. We hypothesize that aerobic exercise will decrease hepatic fat content,&#xD;
      improve VLDL kinetics, and decrease inflammation in a dose-dependent fashion. The results&#xD;
      from this study will help determine exercise guidelines for obese patients with NAFLD, and&#xD;
      lay the groundwork for future studies evaluating the effects of exercise on metabolic&#xD;
      diseases associated with obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal involves conducting a randomized controlled trial that will randomize obese&#xD;
      subjects with NAFLD (&gt; 10% hepatic fat content) to one of two groups: Group 1 (Control, no&#xD;
      exercise) and Group 2 (Moderate Intensity Aerobic Exercise- 150 min/wk to 300 min/wk of&#xD;
      supervised exercise performed at 45-55% of O2 max).&#xD;
