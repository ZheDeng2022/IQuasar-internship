  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how well this combination of chemotherapy drugs&#xD;
      works with bevacizumab in eliminating primary tumor in the breast prior to&#xD;
      surgery(pathological complete response or pCR in the breast). Bevacizumab is a drug that&#xD;
      works by blocking new blood vessel formation by the tumor cells. Giving chemotherapy and&#xD;
      bevacizumab before surgery may allow for lesser amount of breast tissue to be removed. To be&#xD;
      able to predict in the future which patients are more likely to get pCR to this drug&#xD;
      combination, specialized tests on tumor tissue will be performed.&#xD;
