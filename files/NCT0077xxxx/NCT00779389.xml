  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central hypothesis to be tested in this study is that dual blockade of EGFR and Src&#xD;
      pathways or proteins are distinct compared to inhibition of either kinase alone in head and&#xD;
      neck and lung cancers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) constitutes 3% of all malignancies&#xD;
      and is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide. There will be an estimated 40,000 new&#xD;
      cases and 11,000 deaths in the United States in 2007 and approximately 500,000 cases&#xD;
      worldwide yearly [1]. Squamous cell carcinoma accounts for at least 90% of all head and neck&#xD;
      cancers. Surgical resection remains a standard treatment for patients with resectable HNSCC.&#xD;
      For patients with high risk of local or distant relapse, radiation therapy (RT) alone, or in&#xD;
      combination with chemotherapy, is given after surgery to improve loco-regional control and&#xD;
      overall survival. Moreover, surgery often represents the only curative option in patients who&#xD;
      relapse locoregionally. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of death&#xD;
      worldwide. NSCLC is infrequently diagnosed when the cancer can be eradicated with surgical&#xD;
      extirpation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the modulation of biomarkers by EGFR and/or Src targeting in head and neck&#xD;
           and lung cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if biomarker modulation is associated with reduction of tumor volume and/or&#xD;
           evidence of histologic response in the tumor (e.g. decreased proliferation and/or&#xD;
           decreased apoptosis) as well as safety and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject population Patients will be accrued from head and neck and lung cancer patients who&#xD;
      are surgical candidates. Surgery will be the primary curative treatment for patients enrolled&#xD;
      in this study. Patients should not require any standard induction treatment prior to surgery.&#xD;
      Surgery will have to be the best treatment option as determined by the treating physician.&#xD;
      Therefore, we will not be delaying chemoradiotherapy or other curative treatment. We plan to&#xD;
      include any stage of HNSCC or NSCLC that will be managed by primary surgery. If surgery is&#xD;
      unexpectedly cancelled, the patient will be removed from the study unless there is an&#xD;
      accessible lesion for biopsy. Ideally, the pre-treatment biopsy and the intraoperative sample&#xD;
      will be obtained from the same site (when there are multiple lesions). Please see Section 3.0&#xD;
      for detailed eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Plan The study drug or placebo will be taken for 14-21 days, and will be&#xD;
      discontinued one day prior to planned surgical resection. If surgery is delayed, the study&#xD;
      drug or placebo will be continued until one day prior to surgery, for up to a maximum of 28&#xD;
      days. Seven days is the minimum treatment for the patients to be evaluated. The interval&#xD;
      between the last dose of experimental drug and surgery will be 12-36 hours. Please see&#xD;
      Section 5.0 for treatment plan details. If the combination of erlotinib and dasatinib results&#xD;
      in toxicity leading to a delay in surgery, the study will be terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical design and sample size This is a 4-arm randomized trial that is intended to&#xD;
      estimate the effects of short-term preoperative therapy with EGFR and Src inhibitors upon a&#xD;
      panel of biomarkers. The 4 treatment arms are erlotinib, dasatinib, their combination, and a&#xD;
      placebo. We anticipate accruing 56 evaluable patients (14 patients per arm).&#xD;
