      The objective of this study was to compare the rate and extent of absorption Ranbaxy&#xD;
      Laboratories Limited, India, amoxicillin - clavulanic acid and GlaxoSmithKline, U.S.A.&#xD;
      (Augmentin ES-600), amoxicillin - clavulanic acid, administered as a 1 x 5 mL (600 mg - 42.9&#xD;
      mg) oral suspension, under fasting conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a single center, randomized, single-dose, open-label, 2 - way crossover&#xD;
      bioequivalence study to compare the rate and extent of absorption of a test amoxicillin -&#xD;
      clavulanic acid versus Augmentin ES - 600, a reference amoxicillin - clavulanic acid, under&#xD;
      fasting condition. Prior to study commencement, subjects were randomly assigned to a&#xD;
      treatment in accordance with the randomization scheme generated by Anapharm. Subjects were&#xD;
      confined to the Anapharm Clinical Research Facility from at least 10 hours prior to the drug&#xD;
      administration until after the 12 - hour post dose blood draw, in each period. The treatment&#xD;
      phases were separated by a washout period of 20 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 55 healthy, adult subjects signed the study - specific Informed Consent Form and&#xD;
      were confined for Period I; of these subjects, 48 (24 males and 24 females) were enrolled and&#xD;
      were dosed in the study; 42 of these enrolled subjects completed the study.&#xD;
