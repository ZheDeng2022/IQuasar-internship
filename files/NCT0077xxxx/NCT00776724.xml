      This is a multi-center randomized phase III trial. The purpose is to evaluate and compare the&#xD;
      pathological complete response (pCR) rates after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with tailored&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic regimens or standard chemotherapy for stage II/III breast cancer with tumor&#xD;
      size more than 2 cm.&#xD;

      This is a multicenter randomized phase III trial. The purpose is to evaluate and compare the&#xD;
      pathological complete response (pCR) rates after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with tailored&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic regimens or standard chemotherapy for stage II/III breast cancer with tumor&#xD;
      size more than 2 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For primary operable breast cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is one of standard options.&#xD;
      Pathological complete response (pCR) was associated with significantly improved long-term&#xD;
      disease free and overall survival. Anthracycline/taxane-based chemotherapy regimens have been&#xD;
      studied extensively in prospective trials and are the most frequently prescribed treatments&#xD;
      in patients with breast cancer as neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Regimens that have been tested in&#xD;
      large multicenter phase III trials and yielded pCR rates of at around 15% and up to 20% after&#xD;
      6 cycles of chemotherapy. Recent evidences have showed that the expression of several&#xD;
      proteins in the tumor samples such as tau, topoisomerase II alpha (topo II), and ERCC1 can&#xD;
      predict the tumor response to taxanes, anthracyclines, and platinums, respectively. We&#xD;
      hypothesized that select chemotherapeutic agent according the expressions of drug sensitivity&#xD;
      predictive biomarkers from patient's tumor sample may improve the efficacy of breast cancer&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized phase III trial, TE (Docetaxel/ epirubicin) will be given in control arm&#xD;
      since it is a highly active regimen for breast cancer. In the Tailored chemotherapy arm, 7&#xD;
      different combination chemotherapy regimens that containing 2 drugs among taxotere,&#xD;
      epirubicin, cisplatin, vinorelbine, and 5FU, will be given according to the expressions of&#xD;
      tumor biomarkers. The doses and schedules of those regimens are selected according published&#xD;
      1st line protocols for breast cancer. The primary endpoint is the pCR rate. After 4 cycles of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy, under the assumption of pCR rate of 15% in TE arm, to achieve 80%&#xD;
      power at the 5% level (one side) of significance for the detection of a 15% increase of pCR&#xD;
      rate in tailored regimen arm, 134 patients in either arm should be included in the study. If&#xD;
      a 10% drop-out rate and multi-center study variation effect are considered, totally 316&#xD;
      patients will be required.&#xD;
