      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I, randomized, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of four vaccination regimens against the influenza virus hemagglutinin H5. One&#xD;
      group will receive A/Indonesia/05/2005 (inactivated H5N1) vaccine as both prime and boost,&#xD;
      two groups will receive the VRC-AVIDNA036-00-VP (DNA) vaccine as prime with inactivated H5N1&#xD;
      boost but with different boost intervals, and one group will receive the DNA vaccine twice as&#xD;
      prime followed by H5N1 boost. The hypothesis is that these regimens will be safe for human&#xD;
      administration and will elicit antibody and T cell responses against the H5 protein. The&#xD;
      primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the investigational vaccine&#xD;
      regimens, at a dose of 4 mg for the DNA vaccine and 90 microgram for the inactivated H5N1, in&#xD;
      healthy adults. Secondary and exploratory objectives are related to the immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      study vaccine regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inactivated H5N1 vaccine is monovalent subunit virion vaccine, A/Indonesia/05/2005 clade&#xD;
      2, manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur, Inc (Swiftwater, PA). Vaccine vials will be supplied at 90&#xD;
      microgram/0.5mL. The VRC-AVIDNA036-00-VP vaccine was developed and manufactured by VRC, NIAID&#xD;
      and is composed of a single closed-circular DNA plasmid that encodes the H5 protein with a&#xD;
      CMV/R promoter. Vaccine vials will be supplied at 4 mg/mL. Each vaccination will be&#xD;
      administered intramuscularly (IM) in the deltoid muscle using needle and syringe for the H5N1&#xD;
      vaccine and the Biojector (Trademark) 2000 Needle-Free Injection Management System&#xD;
      (Biojector) for the DNA vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 healthy adults, ages 18-60 years will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be simultaneously randomized at a ratio of 1:1:1:1 into one of four groups.&#xD;
      Subjects and clinicians will be blinded to group assignment until Day 0 following completion&#xD;
      of the enrollment. At the point of enrollment the randomly assigned regimen will become known&#xD;
      to subjects and clinicians. Subjects will receive either two or three injections on the&#xD;
      schedule shown in the schema. The protocol requires five clinic visits and two telephone&#xD;
      follow-up contacts for Groups 1, 2, and 3, and six clinic visits and three telephone&#xD;
      follow-up contacts for Group 4.&#xD;
