      The objective of this study was to evaluate the relative bioavailability of the test&#xD;
      formulation of metformin hydrochloride 1000 mg tablets with an already marketed reference&#xD;
      formulation GLUCOPHAGE® (metformin hydrochloride) 1000 mg tablets (Bristol-Myers Squibb&#xD;
      Company) under fed conditions in healthy, male and female adult subjects.&#xD;

      This randomized, single-dose, two-way, crossover study was conducted to compare the relative&#xD;
      bioavailability of two formulations of 1000 mg metformin hydrochloride tablets under fed&#xD;
      conditions. The study was conducted with 32 (30 completing) healthy adults in accordance with&#xD;
      Protocol No. 10640303 (Revision 0). In each study period, a single dose (1 x 1000 mg tablet)&#xD;
      was administered to all subjects following a standardized high fat breakfast preceded by an&#xD;
      overnight fast of at least 10 hours. The test formulation was Ohm Laboratories, Inc's (A&#xD;
      Group of Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals Inc.) Metformin Hydrochloride 1000 mg Tablets and the&#xD;
      reference formulation was GLUCOPHAGE® (metformin hydrochloride) 1000 mg Tablets&#xD;
      (Bristol-Myers Squibb Company). The subjects received the test product in one study period&#xD;
      and the reference product in the other period; the order of administration was according to&#xD;
      the dosing randomization schedule. There was a 7-day interval between treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples were collected pre-dose and at intervals over 24 hours after each dose. The&#xD;
      plasma samples for all subjects completing both periods of the study were sent to Helen&#xD;
      Fassoulas, Director of Operations, Warnex Bioanalytical Services Inc., 3885 boul Industriel,&#xD;
      Laval, Quebec, H7L4S3 Canada, Telephone: 450-663-6724, Fax: 450-975-8111 for determination of&#xD;
      metformin concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was performed by Braulio Suarez, M.D., Novum Pharmaceutical Research&#xD;
      Services, Wilcrest Green Office Park, 3320 Walnut Bend Lane, Houston, Texas 77042-4712, USA,&#xD;
