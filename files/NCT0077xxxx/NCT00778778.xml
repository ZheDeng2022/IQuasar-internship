      The objective of this study was to assess the single-dose relative bioavailability of Ranbaxy&#xD;
      and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (CEFZIL 速) 500 mg cefprozil tablets, under fasting&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This was a blinded, randomized, single dose, 3-way crossover comparative bioavailability&#xD;
      study performed on 27 healthy adult volunteers (13 males and 14 females). In each period,&#xD;
      subjects were housed from at least 10 hours before dosing until after the 10 hour post dose&#xD;
      events. Subjects received a single oral 500 mg cefprozil dose of their assigned formulation,&#xD;
      with 240 mL of water under fasting condition. Food was restricted from 10 hours before dosing&#xD;
      until 4 hours post dose and water was not permitted from 2 hours before dosing and was&#xD;
      restricted until 2 hours following dosing but was allowed ad libitum at all other times. The&#xD;
      doses were separated by a washout period of 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of twenty seven (27) healthy adult volunteers (13 males and 14 females) were enrolled&#xD;
      in the study, out of which only twenty four (24) subjects (11 males and 13 females) completed&#xD;
      the clinical phase of the study.&#xD;
