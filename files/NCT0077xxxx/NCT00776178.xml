      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bladder cancer often recurs after treatment and patient survival varies greatly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  More knowledge is needed about factors that can help identify patients who are at&#xD;
           greater risk of disease recurrence and progression to minimize the need for screening&#xD;
           and to help guide treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The New England Study of Environment and Health (NESEH), conducted by the departments of&#xD;
           health in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, the Dartmouth Medical School and the NIH,&#xD;
           examined the relationship between health and environmental factors such as smoking, diet&#xD;
           and water quality in New England. This study provides an opportunity to learn more about&#xD;
           patients with bladder cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before launching a full-scale follow-up study on bladder cancer, it is necessary to&#xD;
           determine the feasibility of obtaining needed follow-up information from patients&#xD;
           enrolled in the NESEH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the completeness and quality of information about treatment, recurrence, and&#xD;
      progression that can be obtained for patients from their medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Participants from the NESEH study who are residents of Maine and who were diagnosed with&#xD;
      bladder cancer between 2001 and 2003.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the vital status of NESEH bladder cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Select a sample of 40 living and 18 deceased patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interview patients or their next of kin by telephone for about 30 to 45 minutes to&#xD;
           update exposure information, obtain names and addresses of all hospitals and physicians&#xD;
           they have seen since diagnosis, and obtain authorization to access medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain and abstract medical records.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bladder cancer is a highly recurrent disease with substantial variability in survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients currently undergo repeated cystoscopy for many years after diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is a need to identify prognostic markers of recurrence and progression to minimize&#xD;
           the need for routine screening and to identify patients who should be treated more&#xD;
           aggressively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The New England Study of Environment and Health (NESEH), a population-based case control&#xD;
           study of 1,213 patients in Maine (ME), Vermont (VT), and New Hampshire (NH), provides an&#xD;
           excellent opportunity study the clinical, host-genetic, and environmental determinants&#xD;
           of prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before launching a full-scale follow-up study, we need to determine the feasibility of&#xD;
           following a population-based case series and of obtaining patient-related (vital status,&#xD;
           exposures) and tumor-related (recurrence, progression, pathology) information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The completeness and quality of information that can be obtained for each patient. The&#xD;
           most important issue is the extent to which medical records from private physicians will&#xD;
           be needed, and whether private physicians are cooperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Our ability to identify next-of-kin (NOK) of deceased patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proportion of patients (and NOK) that we can contact and enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ability of NOK to provide information on exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Bladder cancer patients from ME who participated in the original case-control study (ages&#xD;
      30-79, newly diagnosed with histologically-confirmed carcinoma of the bladder, including&#xD;
      carcinoma in situ), excluding those diagnosed after 2003 (5 years of follow-up are needed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conduct interviews with 40 living patients and the NOK of 9 deceased patients to update&#xD;
           exposure information and find out where the patient received health care, the types of&#xD;
           treatment received, and whether and when the disease recurred or progressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For living patients or NOK that we are unable to locate (an estimated 10 living patients&#xD;
           and 9 NOK), request medical records from health care providers (to see if physicians&#xD;
           will provide records in the absence of an authorization form).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate participant and physician response rates and the completeness of the medical&#xD;
           history information obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will proceed with the full study if we obtain sufficient medical information for 70%&#xD;
           of the living patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will examine whether there were important issues related to deceased patients (e.g.,&#xD;
           NOK identification/enrollment, exposure assessment, access to medical records). If so,&#xD;
           consider a simpler approach for this segment of the population (e.g., survival study&#xD;
           based on NDI Plus and information available from the NESEH).&#xD;

&#xD;
        With the exceptions noted below, all bladder cancer patients who participated in the NESEH&#xD;
        and were residents of ME when first diagnosed with bladder cancer will be eligible for this&#xD;
