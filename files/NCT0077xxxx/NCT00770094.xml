    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trial in which up to 180&#xD;
      consecutive eyes scheduled to undergo excimer laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) for the&#xD;
      correction of myopia with or without astigmatism will be enrolled. Enrolled subjects will&#xD;
      have a different Excimer laser system performed in each eye. There will be 30 subjects (60&#xD;
      eyes) in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: WaveLight ALLEGRETTO WAVE™ wavefront guided excimer laser treatment in one eye of&#xD;
      the subject and the AMO/VISX CustomVue™ wavefront guided Excimer Laser System performed on&#xD;
      the contralateral eye Group 2: WaveLight ALLEGRETTO WAVE™ wavefront guided excimer laser&#xD;
      treatment in one eye of the subject and the Bausch and Lomb Zyoptix™ wavefront guided Excimer&#xD;
      Laser System performed on the contralateral eye Group 3: WaveLight ALLEGRETTO WAVE™ wavefront&#xD;
      optimized excimer laser treatment in one eye of the subject and the Bausch and Lomb&#xD;
      Planoscan™ Excimer Laser System performed on the contralateral eye The choice of treatment&#xD;
      will first be randomized into one of the three groups and then will also be randomized to the&#xD;
      dominant eye prior to LASIK procedure according to the randomization schedule&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have up to -7.00D of spherical equivalent myopia or myopia with&#xD;
             astigmatism, with up to -7.00D of spherical component and up to 3.00 D of astigmatic&#xD;
             component at the spectacle plane in both eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a stable refraction as documented by previous clinical records or&#xD;
             clinical history. Spherical equivalent has not progressed at a rate of more than 0.50D&#xD;
             per year prior to the baseline examination in both eyes or as documented by clinical&#xD;
             judgment by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who wear contact lenses must discontinue wear at least 3 days for soft and at&#xD;
             least 3 weeks for RGP prior to the preoperative evaluation or surgery, in either eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have visual acuity correctable to at least 20/20 in both eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be willing and able to return for scheduled follow up examinations for&#xD;
             three months after LASIK surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must sign and be given a copy of the written Informed Consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects for whom both eyes do not meet all inclusion criteria and either eye meets&#xD;
             any exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects for whom the combination of their baseline corneal thickness and the planned&#xD;
             operative parameters for the LASIK procedure would result in less than 250 microns of&#xD;
             remaining posterior corneal thickness below the flap postoperatively in either eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eyes for which the baseline standard manifest refraction exhibits greater than 1.00D&#xD;
             more minus in sphere power, or a difference of greater than 0.75 D in cylinder power&#xD;
             between eyes.&#xD;

             is permitted).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects for whom the preoperative assessment of the ocular topography and /or&#xD;
             aberrations indicates that either eye is not a suitable candidate for LASIK vision&#xD;
             correction procedure. Examples include frank or forme frust keratoconus, corneal&#xD;
             warpage, and pellucid marginal degeneration, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with clinically significant dry eye syndrome or clinically significant&#xD;
             blepharitis in either eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with anterior segment pathology, including clinically significant cataracts&#xD;
             or corneal scarring or neovascularization in either eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with residual, recurrent, active ocular or eyelid disease, including any&#xD;
             corneal abnormality (specifically, recurrent corneal erosion, severe basement membrane&#xD;
             disease) in either eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with ophthalmoscopic signs of progressive or unstable myopia or keratoconus&#xD;
             (or keratoconus suspect) in either eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with unstable (distorted/not clear) corneal mires on central keratometry in&#xD;
             either eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have undergone previous intraocular or corneal surgery of any kind,&#xD;
             including any type of surgery for either refractive or therapeutic purposes in either&#xD;
             eye.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects on chronic systemic corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive therapy that&#xD;
             may affect wound healing, any immunocompromised subjects, and subjects with clinically&#xD;
             significant atopic disease, connective tissue disease, or diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of steroid-responsive rise in intraocular pressure, glaucoma,&#xD;
             or preoperative IOP&gt;23 mm Hg in either eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with macular pathology in either eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are pregnant, lactating, or planning to be pregnant during the course of&#xD;
