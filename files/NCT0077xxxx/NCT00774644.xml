      The objective of this study is to compare the relative bioavailability of clarithromycin 500&#xD;
      mg tablets (Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited) with that of BIAXIN速 500 mg tablets in healthy,&#xD;
      adult subjects under fasting conditions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study was conducted as an open label, balanced, randomised, two-treatment, two-period,&#xD;
      two-sequence, single-dose, crossover , bioavailability study on clarithromycin formulations&#xD;
      comparing clarithromycin 500mg tablets of Ranbaxy Laboratories with Biaxin速 tablets 500mg&#xD;
      (containing clarithromycin 500 mg)in healthy, adult, human, male subjects under fasting&#xD;
      conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects underwent pre-study examinations that included a physical examination,&#xD;
      12-lead ECG, and laboratory tests - including hematology, blood chemistries, urinalysis,&#xD;
      infectious diseases (Hepatitis B, Hepatitis Ci HIV), and urine drugs of abuse. Laboratory&#xD;
      testing for female subjects also included a serum pregnancy test.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Source of Subjects: Non-institutionalized subjects consisting of members of the&#xD;
             community at large.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Characterization of Study Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. All subjects selected for this study will be at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Female subjects must be unable to become pregnant (postmenopausal for at least 1&#xD;
                  year, or surgically sterile).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Each subject shall be given a general physical examination within 28 days of&#xD;
             initiation of the study. Such examination includes, but is not limited to, blood&#xD;
             pressure, general observations, and history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Each female subject will be given a serum pregnancy test as part of the pre-study&#xD;
             screening process.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At the end of the study, the subjects will have an exit evaluation consisting of&#xD;
             interim history, global evaluation, and clinical laboratory measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate blood and urine samples should be obtained within 28 days before beginning of&#xD;
             the first period and at the end of the trial for clinical laboratory measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical laboratory measurements will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hematology: hemoglobin, hematocrit,red blood cell count, platelets, and white&#xD;
                  blood cell count (with differential).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of chronic alcohol consumption (during past 2 years), drug&#xD;
             addiction, or serious gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic or cardiovascular disease,&#xD;

             will not be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects whose clinical laboratory test values are greater than 20% outside the normal&#xD;
             range may be retested. If the clinical values are outside the range on retesting, the&#xD;
             subject will not be eligible to participate in the study unless the clinical&#xD;
             investigator deems the result to not be significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have a history of allergic responses to the class of drug being tested&#xD;
             (including any penicillin product) should be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects will have urine samples assayed for the presence of drugs of abuse as&#xD;
             part of the clinical laboratory screening procedures and at check-in each study&#xD;
             period. Subjects found to have urine concentrations of any of the tested drugs will&#xD;
             not be allowed to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects should not have donated blood and/or plasma for at least thirty (30) days&#xD;
