  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bacterial meningitis is a severe infection of the envelope which surrounds the brain. It is&#xD;
      sometimes responsible for a cerebral oedema mattering with a loss of consciousness (coma).&#xD;
      The usual treatment of this affection is based on the antibiotic therapy, anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      drug and resuscitation measures in intensive care setting but the prognosis of comatose&#xD;
      patients remains poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moderate hypothermia (body temperature is downed between 32 and 34°C°) made the proof of its&#xD;
      efficiency in certain cerebral pathologies (notably the cerebral distress after cardiac&#xD;
      arrest or oxygen lack in neonates) but was never evaluated in meningitis. In meningitis&#xD;
      animal studies and in severe traumatic brain injury, moderate hypothermia is able to diminish&#xD;
      cerebral oedema and brain inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the objective of this study is to compare two strategies: only usual care or usual care&#xD;
      completed by moderate hypothermia. The body temperature will be lowered between 32 and 34°C&#xD;
      by means of a catheter placed in a big vein and connected to a machine in which circulates a&#xD;
      cold liquid, or by means of an external cooling (ice-cold blanket, ice packs placed on the&#xD;
      body). Whatever technique is chosen, the technique is perfectly mastered by the teams which&#xD;
      take charge of the patients. After 48 hours, the technique of hypothermia will be suspended&#xD;
      and body temperature will return passively and gradually to normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that moderate hypothermia will improve the prognosis of the most&#xD;
      severe patients.&#xD;

      Investigational procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study evaluates the impact of mild induced hypothermia (32-34°C) during 48 hours&#xD;
      followed by passive rewarming according to recommendations described in appendix. All&#xD;
      treatment will be according to local recommendations and guidelines of medical societies and&#xD;
      literature. Physicians are advised to use these recommendations; however, the best treatment&#xD;
      option for the individual patient should be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mild Induced hypothermia:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators are advised to use the cooling techniques as used in patients with cardiac&#xD;
      arrest. Thus, the choice of cooling method will be left to investigators. Hypothermia will be&#xD;
      induced by cold saline infusion as described in appendix 5 [6, 48]. Core temperature will be&#xD;
      monitored by oesophageal probe and maintained between 32°C and 34°C during 48 hours and&#xD;
      followed by strictly passive rewarming. During this phase of treatment, patients will receive&#xD;
      deep sedation associated with neuromuscular blockers. Centers participating to the trial will&#xD;
      have expertise in cooling methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controls:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controls will receive standard care and will be also be deeply sedated for 48 hours.&#xD;
