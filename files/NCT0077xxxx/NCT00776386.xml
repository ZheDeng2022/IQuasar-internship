      This study has two purposes. First, the investigators will identify determinants of changes&#xD;
      in motor ability, activities of daily living, and HRQOL after distributed Constraint-induced&#xD;
      therapy for patients with stroke with the Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID)&#xD;
      analysis. The results will help target which types/characteristics of patients will benefit&#xD;
      most from the intervention and may identify different determinants across different levels of&#xD;
      outcomes. Secondly, in order to understand the extent of treatment effect in terms of&#xD;
      clinical relevance, the investigators will examine whether the change scores on measures of&#xD;
      motor ability, activities of daily living, and HRQOL after distributed CIT reach clinically&#xD;
      important differences or not.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a major cause of long-term disability in many countries. More than 50% of stroke&#xD;
      survivors experience resultant upper extremity (UE) movement impairments that lead to&#xD;
      activity limitations and restriction of participation. Various contemporary rehabilitation&#xD;
      strategies which aim to improve UE motor deficits after stroke have been proposed.&#xD;
      Constraint-induced therapy (CIT) is one of the current promising approaches, and numerous CIT&#xD;
      and distributed CIT studies have shown substantial evidence of positive treatment effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although studies have shown a form of distributed CIT can enhance motor function of the&#xD;
      affected UE, functional performance, and some aspects of HRQOL post stroke, determinants&#xD;
      related to distributed CIT outcomes remain unclear. In addition, mismatch between the&#xD;
      statistically significant and clinically important differences (CID) for change scores has&#xD;
      been identified as a limitation of CIT studies. Investigation of CID is critical for&#xD;
      understanding the clinically relevant meanings of change scores after intervention.&#xD;
      Therefore, the purposes of this project are to (1) identify determinants of changes in motor&#xD;
      ability, functional performance, and HRQOL after distributed CIT for patients with stroke&#xD;
      using the Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detector analysis; (2) examine whether the change&#xD;
      scores on outcome measures after distributed CIT reach CID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the one year, we plan to complete cumulated data of distributed CIT trials for 70&#xD;
      subjects. The distributed CIT intervention will be provided by two certified occupational&#xD;
      therapists. The Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Functional&#xD;
      Independence Measure (FIM), and Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) will be used as outcome measures in&#xD;
      this project. Six potential predictors will be selected for the FMA, WMFT and FIM, and seven&#xD;
      potential predictors will be selected for the SIS based on previous empirical findings and&#xD;
      theoretical basis. CHAID analysis will be used to identify the specific determinants and the&#xD;
      best split points of the determinants. In addition, based on Cohen's effect size benchmark,&#xD;
      if the change scores on the FMA, WMFT, FIM and SIS exceeded 0.2SD will be considered as CID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the one-year project, we will identify the determinants of motor ability, functional&#xD;
      performance, and HRQOL after distributed CIT and thus can help understand the factors that&#xD;
      may affect treatment outcomes and target patients who benefit most from this intervention.&#xD;
      Additionally, we will provide the results of CID for better evaluation and interpretation of&#xD;
      the change scores after distributed CIT.&#xD;
