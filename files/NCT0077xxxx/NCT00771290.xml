    <textblock>
      Intra-operative colonoscopy (inserting a flexible endoscope with a camera at its tip through&#xD;
      the anus and up into the rectum and colon) is most often indicated to locate or verify the&#xD;
      location of small cancer, polyp, bleeding site, or simply to inspect the bowel after the two&#xD;
      ends have been rejoined together. Usually colonoscopy utilizes ambient air to expand and&#xD;
      inflate the colon and, as a result, leaves the colon bloated or distended until the gas is&#xD;
      either expelled or absorbed. This endoscopy related bowel distension is problematic in the&#xD;
      setting of both traditional open (big incision) colorectal surgery and after minimally&#xD;
      invasive (laparoscopic assisted) procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of the former, it may prove difficult to close a traditional laparotomy incision&#xD;
      if the bowel is distended and may hinder respiration with the abdomen closed. In the setting&#xD;
      of a laparoscopic procedure, the bowel distension limits the working space available to the&#xD;
      surgeon. Since the laparoscopic domain is limited, a distended colon following&#xD;
      intra-operative colonoscopy can prevent the minimally invasive completion of a case (meaning&#xD;
      that a conversion to traditional &quot;open&quot; methods would be necessary) that otherwise was going&#xD;
      well with good prospects of laparoscopic completion. Colonic distension also causes abdominal&#xD;
      pain and lengthens the recovery time from the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that the use of CO2 during intra-operative colonoscopy or&#xD;
      sigmoidoscopy (exam of only the last 2 to 2 ½ feet of the colon) will not cause long lasting&#xD;
      bloating or distension of the colon as opposed to air. Carbon dioxide is absorbed 250 times&#xD;
      faster than ambient air and may decrease after procedure colonic distension. This&#xD;
      prospective, randomized study will compare the two gases in terms of colonic distension.&#xD;
      Patients undergoing open or minimally invasive colorectal resection will be randomized to&#xD;
      undergo intra-operative colonoscopy using one of the two gases. Direct measurements of colon&#xD;
      diameter will be taken at specific time intervals after the colonoscopy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Colonoscopic examination of the large bowel (inserting a flexible endoscope with a camera at&#xD;
      its tip through the anus and up into the rectum and colon) is sometimes required during a&#xD;
      colorectal resection (abdominal operation to remove a segment or piece of colon or rectum) in&#xD;
      order to find a small cancer, polyp, bleeding site, or simply to inspect the bowel after the&#xD;
      two ends have been rejoined together. In order to get a good look at the large intestine with&#xD;
      a colonoscope it is necessary to pump some gas into the colon via the scope in order to&#xD;
      distend and inflate it. The gas that is almost universally used is room air. Since it is very&#xD;
      hard, if not impossible, to fully suction out the gas from the colon once the exam is&#xD;
      finished, the colon is usually quite bloated or distended after the colonoscopy. This&#xD;
      dilatation can persist for hours or days since air is not well absorbed through the bowel&#xD;
      wall into the body. A distended colon can cause some problems during both traditional open&#xD;
      (big incision) surgery and laparoscopicassisted (minimally invasive) surgery. During a big&#xD;
      incision operation, colonic distension and swelling can make it hard to close the incision at&#xD;
      the end of the operation and can make breathing more difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, during a laparoscopic procedure, the colorectal dilatation can greatly decrease&#xD;
      the amount of working and maneuvering room that is available to the surgeon to the point&#xD;
      where the laparoscopic approach may have to be abandoned in favor of the big incision method.&#xD;
      Thus, colon distension following sigmoidoscopy done with air during an abdominal operation&#xD;
      can cause problems for the patient and the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative gas that can be pumped into the colon during colonoscopy is carbon dioxide&#xD;
      (CO2). Unlike air, CO2 is very rapidly reabsorbed into the body from the colon, about 250&#xD;
      times faster than air. There is now a machine available which makes it possible to easily and&#xD;
      safely use CO2 gas to distend the colon during colonoscopy. The investigators believe that&#xD;
      the use of CO2 during intraoperative colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy (exam of only the last 2 to&#xD;
      2 ½ feet of the colon) will not cause long lasting bloating or distension of the colon as&#xD;
      opposed to air. Patients undergoing either open (big incision) or laparoscopic (multiple&#xD;
      small incisions) rectal or sigmoid colon resection usually need to have intraoperative&#xD;
      sigmoidoscopy at the end of the operation to inspect the inside of the colon and rectum and&#xD;
      to check for an air leak in the vicinity of the rejoining point (anastomosis). In this study&#xD;
      one half of the patients will, by the flip of a coin, get CO2 during their sigmoidoscopy&#xD;
      while the remaining half will have air used to inflated the colon during their examination.&#xD;
      After the sigmoidoscopic exam is completed the scope will be removed, without suctioning, and&#xD;
      the colon diameter near the rectum measured by the surgeons looking and working in the&#xD;
      abdomen. The size of the colon will again be measured every 5 minutes for the next 20 minutes&#xD;
      while the surgeons prepare to close the abdomen and end the surgery. At the end of the 20&#xD;
      minute period, if the colon remains distended, the scope will be reinserted and the excess&#xD;
      gas suctioned out. The surgeons carrying out this study believe that the colons of those&#xD;
      patients getting CO2 gas for the sigmoidiscopy will more rapidly shrink in size towards their&#xD;
      original diameter than the patients who get air pumped into the colon.&#xD;
