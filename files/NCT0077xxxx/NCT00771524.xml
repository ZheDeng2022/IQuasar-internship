      This study is being performed to measure the amount of the antibiotic ceftobiprole (study&#xD;
      drug) found in the bone and blood after receiving one dose prior to your elective hip&#xD;
      replacement surgery. A piece of your hip bone which will be removed as part of your surgery&#xD;
      will be analyzed to determine how much ceftobiprole gets into the bone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 20 patients will take part in the study. Two patients will not receive ceftobiprole,&#xD;
      but will receive an antibiotic that is normally given prior to elective hip replacement&#xD;
      surgery. The remaining 18 patients will receive ceftobiprole 500 mg dripped into the vein&#xD;
      over 2 hours. All patients will have a sample of bone taken during the surgery and blood&#xD;
      samples taken at specific timepoints. The samples taken from the 2 patients who did not&#xD;
      receive study drug will assist in the development of a test used to measure the study drug in&#xD;
      the bone sample. This is an open-label, parallel group, pharmacokinetic study in healthy men&#xD;
      and women who have been cleared medically for elective total hip replacement surgery. Healthy&#xD;
      is defined as patients who are medically stable and cleared for elective surgery. The study&#xD;
      has 4 phases: a screening phase of up to 21 days before the day of surgery; a pretreatment&#xD;
      phase of up to 7 days before the day of surgery; a 1-day open-label treatment phase; an&#xD;
      end-of-study phase (end-of-study procedures or at the time of early withdrawal); and a&#xD;
      follow-up telephone contact approximately 1 week after the surgery to assess new and ongoing&#xD;
      adverse events. Two control subjects will be enrolled; these patients will not receive&#xD;
      ceftobiprole, but will undergo surgery and a bone sample, which will serve as a control for&#xD;
      qualifying the bioanalytical assay. The remaining 36 patients will be randomized to 1 of 2&#xD;
      ceftobiprole treatments. The primary objective is to estimate the penetration of ceftobiprole&#xD;
      into bone of otherwise healthy patients who are undergoing total hip replacement surgery.&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability will also be assessed. Venous blood samples will be collected and&#xD;
      analyzed for ceftobiprole concentrations using validated liquid-chromatography methodology,&#xD;
      with tandem mass spectrometric detection. Bone samples will be analyzed for ceftobiprole by&#xD;
      qualified liquid-chromatography methodology, with tandem mass spectrometric detection. Safety&#xD;
      and tolerability will be evaluated throughout the study. Blood will be drawn for clinical&#xD;
      laboratory tests and PK evaluations. A single dose of ceftobiprole 500 mg dripped into the&#xD;
      vein over 2 hours, administered prior to elective hip replacement surgery.&#xD;
