      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relative bioavailability of the test&#xD;
      formulation of furosemide 80 mg tablets (Ohm Laboratories, Inc.) with an already marketed&#xD;
      reference formulation Lasix® (furosemide) 80 mg tablets (Aventis Pharmaceuticals NJ) under&#xD;
      fasted conditions in healthy adult human subjects&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This randomized, single-dose, two-way, crossover study was conducted to compare the relative&#xD;
      bioavailability of two formulations of 80 mg furosemide tablets under fasted conditions. The&#xD;
      study was conducted with 44 (39 completing) healthy adults in accordance with protocol. In&#xD;
      each study period, a single 80 mg dose was administered to the subjects following an&#xD;
      overnight fast. The test formulation was furosemide 80 mg tablet (Ohm Laboratories, Inc.),&#xD;
      and the reference formulation was Lasix® (furosemide) 80 mg tablet (Aventis Pharmaceuticals&#xD;
      NJ). The subjects received the test product in one study period and the reference product in&#xD;
      the other period; the order of administration was according to the dosing randomization&#xD;
      schedule. There was a 7-day interval between treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples were collected pre-dose and at intervals over 12 hours after each dose. The&#xD;
      plasma samples for all subjects completing both periods of the study were sent to BA&#xD;
      Research, 10550 Rockley Road, Suite 150, Houston, Texas 77099, Telephone: 281-495-6996, Fax&#xD;
      281-575-6996 for determination of furosemide plasma concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was performed at Ba Research, 2591 Sam Bass Road, Round Rock, TX 78681,&#xD;
      Telephone 512-388-4554, Fax 512-388-4550.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 44 subjects were randomized to receive single oral dose of 80 mg furosemide&#xD;
      tablets and 39 subjects completed both the periods of the study.&#xD;
