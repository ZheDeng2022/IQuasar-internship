      The purpose of this study is to determine whether excimer laser corneal surface ablation&#xD;
      (T-Cat) can be safely combined with simultaneous corneal collagen cross-linking treatment to&#xD;
      produce an improved and stable corneal profile in the treatment of keratoconus.&#xD;

      Theoretical framework:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corneal ectasia is a relative weakness in the structure of the cornea, which produces a&#xD;
      progressive change in its shape with resultant visual distortion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excimer laser surface ablation can be used to re-shape the corneal profile. When the corneal&#xD;
      shape is very irregular, corneal topography data gives the best information as to how to&#xD;
      re-shape the cornea into a normal profile, and this Topography-Computer Assisted Treatment&#xD;
      (T-Cat) will be used to modulate the surface corneal shape.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that collagen cross-linking in the cornea occurs naturally with age, and in&#xD;
      diabetes, both of which seem to prevent progressive ectasia. Corneal collagen cross-linking&#xD;
      with riboflavin has been shown to stabilize the cornea in keratoconus, and prevents&#xD;
      progression of the disease. If cross-linking is performed at that moment that the cornea has&#xD;
      been re-shaped by T-Cat treatment, it should help prevent the corneal thinning resultant from&#xD;
      the laser treatment from destabilising the cornea and causing progressive ectasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether excimer laser corneal surface ablation (T-Cat) can be safely combined&#xD;
      with simultaneous corneal collagen cross-linking treatment to produce an improved and stable&#xD;
      corneal profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, interventional trial.&#xD;

    <description>Patients with known keratoconus or pellucid marginal degeneration will be invited to join the study. The study is partly a continuation in the management of patients who have had previous keratophakia, who will have near-normal or supra-physiological levels of corneal thickness. It is also intended for patients with relatively mild keratoconus who have sufficient corneal thickness to allow a limited laser ablation whilst still leaving a residual stromal bed of at least 350μ.</description>

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Excimer laser ablation, and collagen cross-linking</intervention_name>
    <description>Surgery is performed with topical anaesthesia. The central corneal epithelium is removed. Excimer laser ablation is applied (typically 15-30 seconds). Residual bed thickness is checked with an ultrasonic pachymeter. Topical application of riboflavin 0.1% in dextran is commenced at 5 minute intervals. When an adequate saturation of the anterior chamber with riboflavin has been achieved, cross-linking treatment will proceed. Output from the UV light generating equipment is measured with a UV light meter and set at 3mW/cm². Thirty minutes of treatment is given, interrupted at five minute intervals by the application of more topical riboflavin drops. Finally the eye has a bandage soft contact lens placed, with preservative free topical antibiotic, steroid, and cycloplegic drop application.</description>
