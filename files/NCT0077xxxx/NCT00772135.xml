      13.3 Study design and protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      13.3.1 Design: double-blind case-control cross-over study&#xD;
&#xD;
      13.3.2 Patients inclusion / exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of 12-16 patients from the main study (see main protocol) who are selected&#xD;
      by following criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abnormal right ventricular pressure response to exercise (cut-off 45 mmHg maximal RVSP&#xD;
           during exercise)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent to participation including use of sildenafil / placebo. The patients&#xD;
           will be approximately one year older than during the initial study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      13.3.3 Examination protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be examined similarly twice with at least 12 hours and one night sleep&#xD;
      between these activities to ensure drug washout. One hour before each study part, a pharmacy&#xD;
      produced capsule (envelope coded and drawn in a random manner from a box) containing either&#xD;
      sildenafil citrate 50 mg or placebo will be administered. In this manner each patient will be&#xD;
      tested once with placebo use and once with sildenafil use respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant is taken to a clinical exercise physiology laboratory for testing separated&#xD;
      by a night's sleep and at least 12 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring equipment is mounted during the period of drug absorbtion and distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. One minute handgrip static exercise is performed as described with 80% of maximal&#xD;
           strength applied. BP response is registered beat to beat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pulmonary function is examined, including pulmonary volumes (single breath, technical&#xD;
           description see below), and spirometry&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing according to main protocol (see 3.8)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Exercise echocardiography during supine bicycle exercise is performed as described in&#xD;
           main protocol (see 3.7). Other monitoring during supine cycle exercise:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Diffusion capacity is monitored (intra breath, technical description below). For&#xD;
                equipment calibration haemoglobin concentration is measured by fingertip blood&#xD;
                sampling before and after cycle exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Cardiac output and peripheral oxygen saturation is continuously monitored by Task&#xD;
                Force Monitor (see below)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Pulmonary function testing is repeated&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Handgrip testing is repeated as in 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Difffusion capacity monitoring There are two ways of measuring diffusion capacity using&#xD;
      SensorMedics V-max analyzing system (Yorba Linda, CA, USA) - intra breath and single breath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume (FEV1), FEV1 ratio&#xD;
      (FEV1/FVC), peak expiratory flow (PEF), total lung capacity (TLC or VA), diffusion capacity&#xD;
      for carbon monoxide (TLCO), adjusted diffusing capacity (TLCO/VA), residual volume (RV),&#xD;
      capillary blood volume (Vc) and membrane conductance (Dm) are included in the analysis and&#xD;
      will be performed according to European Respiratory Society standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single breath The diffusion capacity is used to estimate the amount of gas travelling from&#xD;
      lungs to the bloodstream across the membrane. In the process methane (CH4) is used in the&#xD;
      concentration of 0.3 %, 0.3 % carbon monoxide (CO), 21 % oxygen (O2) and nitrogen (N2). In&#xD;
      the estimation of TLCO several measurements are included; 1) the area of gas transportation&#xD;
      between alveoli and the capillaries (A), 2) the wall thickness (membrane) between the alveoli&#xD;
      and the erythrocytes (T), 3) the amount of haemoglobin available (Hb) and 4) the reaction&#xD;
      rate of CO too Hb (Î¸) are determinants for the amount of CO that manage to diffuse across to&#xD;
      the blood57.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the process CH4 is used as a marker, as it does not diffuse across to the blood but become&#xD;
      diluted. CH4 mixes with the residual volume in the lungs, and the degree of dilution is used&#xD;
      to calculate alveoli volume. CO diffuses across to the blood in addition to become diluted.&#xD;
      By measuring the amount of CO and CH4 in the expiration air compared to the inhaled gas,&#xD;
      after a hold of breath in 8-10 seconds, we get an expression for the diffusion capacity in&#xD;
      the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Figure 1: The single-breath method for TLCO Intra breath Intra breath reefers to the&#xD;
      continuous real-time measurement of carbon monoxide uptake by the pulmonary capillary blood&#xD;
      during a single breath maneuver. Intra breath maneuver may be performed during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calibration procedure samples to set the span points to 0.3 % CO and 0.3 % CH4 (methane).&#xD;
      The patient starts with normal breathing and is then instructed to exhale as much as possible&#xD;
      - then inhale completely. After total inhalation the patient should exhale at a slow even&#xD;
      flow until the computer end the test. The test window shows gas concentration versus time and&#xD;
      volume versus time tracing in real time during the maneuver. The flow versus time curve is&#xD;
      shown simultaneously. The collection interval used in the calculation of the TLCO is&#xD;
      extending from 20 - 80 % of the exhaled volume (marked area in figure 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Figure 2. The intra breath method for TLCO&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients need to practice this maneuver at rest before using it during exercise. The&#xD;
      exhalation time is reduced during exercise, but the patients must try to exhale as slowly as&#xD;
      they can in order for the analysis to be correct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary monitoring and analysis When analysing changes in vascular resistances during&#xD;
      exercise a measurement of pressure is only a part of the hemodynamic picture. According to&#xD;
      Ohms law, blood flow measurement is necessary to conclude about the vascular resistances. For&#xD;
      this purpose, a non-invasive cardiac stroke volume analyser based on thoracic impedance&#xD;
      technique, will be used.(Task Force Monitor, CNS systems, product description enclosed) This&#xD;
      equipment is validated for cardiac output monitoring as compared with thermodilution as gold&#xD;
      standard. Combined with a beat to beat finger cuff system for measurement of blood pressure,&#xD;
      this machine produces core circulatory parameters continuously. Autonomic nervous function&#xD;
      (BP variation, HR variation) and baroreflex sensitivity is also analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous measurement of peripheral oxygen saturation is registered with Masimo SET pulse&#xD;
      oximeters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      13.4 Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Responses with and without sildenafil will be compared within same individual. For parameters&#xD;
      affected by calibration differences in machinery from test 1 to 2 delta values will be&#xD;
      compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the main study allow estimations of anticipated results and statistical power. If&#xD;
      the average of maximal RVSP during exercise in our group is 50 mmHg and sildenafil causes a&#xD;
      20% decrease in average to 40 mmHg (SD 10.0) a sample size of 13 patients leads to&#xD;
      statistical power of 81.7% with 5% confidence level (calculation: DSS research 10.7.2008,&#xD;
