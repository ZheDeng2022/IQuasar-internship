      In the setting of fetal demise it is important to help the mother deliver the fetus&#xD;
      expeditiously and with as little physical trauma as possible. This study hypothesizes that&#xD;
      application of capsaicin to the uterine cervix will enhance cervical ripening and desensitize&#xD;
      pain fibers such that delivery is less painful.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Induction of labor is associated with increased risk of cesarean section and elevated pain&#xD;
      when compared to labor of spontaneous onset. In the setting of intrauterine fetal demise&#xD;
      (IUFD), it is desirable to induce labor in order to achieve a successful vaginal delivery for&#xD;
      the health and well being of the mother, thereby avoiding operative fetal extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current protocol for midtrimester labor induction prior to 24 weeks gestational age&#xD;
      includes intravaginal cytotec(misoprostol) 200 mcg every 6 hours for up to 24 hours,&#xD;
      occasionally followed by oxytocin infusion. When an IUFD occurs at 24 or greater weeks&#xD;
      gestational age, labor is induced with cytotec 25 or 50 mcg every 4 hours and/or oxytocin&#xD;
      infusion. The investigators hypothesize that application of lidocaine to the uterine cervix&#xD;
      followed by 0.1% capsaicin cream will facilitate cervical ripening and decrease the pain of&#xD;
      labor induction when compared to use of a placebo cream. Capsaicin&#xD;
      8methylNvannilyl6nonenamide) activates TRPV1, a nonselective cation channel activated&#xD;
      directly by heat, and low pH, and indirectly by a number of inflammatory factors, including&#xD;
      nerve growth factor (NGF), bradykinin, lipids, and prostaglandins. Activation of TRPV1 by&#xD;
      capsaicin results in an influx of Ca2 and Na ions, depolarization, exocytosis of&#xD;
      neuropeptides and excitatory amino acids, and induces a burning sensation. This initial phase&#xD;
      is followed by prolonged desensitiztion that is dose dependent. Once the TRPV1 receptor is&#xD;
      desensitized, pain transmission through Ctype primary afferent receptors is reduced. The pain&#xD;
      relief from capsaicin is due to desensitization of the TRPV1 receptor. The enhancement of&#xD;
      cervical ripening is due to activation of primary afferent Cfibers, release of neuropeptides&#xD;
      substance P, neurokinin A, calcitonin generelated peptide, secretoneurin and nitric oxide to&#xD;
      help orchestrate a series of local inflammatory responses including vasodilation, vascular&#xD;
      permeability with tissue edema and protein extravasation, and migration of inflammatory&#xD;
      immune cells. In a study of pregnant rats, vaginal lidocaine gel was applied followed by&#xD;
      capsaicin sham cream. A blinded observer monitored behavior via video over the next 72 hours.&#xD;
      All animals treated with capsaicin delivered on day 22 with minimal pain behaviors while 90%&#xD;
      of sham treated animals delivered as expected on day 23 with normal pain related behavior.&#xD;
      All pups were delivered live and rearing and suckling behavior was normal.&#xD;
