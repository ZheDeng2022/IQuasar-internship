  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the bioequivalence of Doxycycline monohydrate&#xD;
      formulations after administration of single doses to normal healthy subjects under fed&#xD;
      conditions. These data were to be evaluated statistically to determine if the products meet&#xD;
      bioequivalence criteria.&#xD;

      The study was conducted as an open label, balanced, randomised, two-treatment, two-period,&#xD;
      two-sequence, single-dose, crossover , bioequivalence study on Doxycycline monohydrate&#xD;
      comparing Doxycycline monohydrate 100mg tablets of Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals Inc with Adoxa ®&#xD;
      100 mg tablets of Bradley Pharmaceuticals Inc. in healthy, adult, human, subjects under fed&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 32 non-smoking subjects (21 men and 11 women) were included in this study, of&#xD;
      which 32 finished the study according to the protocol.&#xD;
