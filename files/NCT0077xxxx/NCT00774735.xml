        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation&#xD;
             including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac&#xD;
             monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential&#xD;
             (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant) including any female who:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is pre-menopausal with a documented bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy&#xD;
             (removal of the ovaries) or hysterectomy, or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is post-menopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. A follicle&#xD;
             stimulating hormone (FSH) level will be performed to confirm a post-menopausal status.&#xD;
             For this study, FSH levels &gt; 40 mlU/ml is confirmatory. Females on hormone replacement&#xD;
             therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt, HRT should be discontinued for&#xD;
             2 weeks and then the subject rescreened, as HRT can suppress FSH.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section&#xD;
             8.1. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study&#xD;
             medication until 14 days after the last dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight ≥ 50 kg for men and ≥ 45 kg for women and body mass index (BMI) within the&#xD;
             range 18.5-31.0 kg/m2 (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that&#xD;
             will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates,&#xD;
             cannabinoids and benzodiazepines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational&#xD;
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current&#xD;
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the&#xD;
             investigational product (whichever is longer)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a&#xD;
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK&#xD;
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary&#xD;
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a&#xD;
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first&#xD;
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical&#xD;
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise&#xD;
             subject safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If heparin is used during PK sampling, subjects with a history of sensitivity to&#xD;
             heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An average weekly intake of &gt;14 drinks/week for men or &gt;7 drinks/week for women. One&#xD;
             drink is equivalent to (12 g alcohol) = 5 ounces (150 ml) of wine or 12 ounces (360&#xD;

             anatomy or motility, hepatic and/or renal function, that could interfere with the&#xD;
             absorption, metabolism, and/or excretion of the study drugs. Subjects with a history&#xD;
             of cholecystectomy should be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History/evidence of symptomatic arrhythmia, angina/ischemia, coronary artery bypass&#xD;
             grafting (CABG) surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PCTA) or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine values greater than the upper limit of normal. A single repeat is&#xD;
             allowed for eligibility determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The subject's systolic blood pressure is outside the range of 90-140mmHg, or diastolic&#xD;

             50-100bpm for female subjects or 45-100 bpm for male subjects.&#xD;
