  <brief_title>Bioequivalence Study of Fluoxetine HCL 40 mg Capsules Under Fasting Conditions</brief_title>
  <official_title>The Objective of This Randomized, Single-dose, Two-way Evaluation is to Compare the Bioequivalence of a Test Fluoxetine HCL Formulation (Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited, Lot No. 6320101) to an Equivalent Oral Dose of the Commercially Available Fluoxetine HCL (Prozac®, Dista Products Company, Lot No 6RK57M) in a Test Population of 36 Adult Subjects Under Fasting Conditions.</official_title>

      The objective of this study is to compare the relative bioavailability of fluoxetine HCL 40&#xD;
      mg capsules (by Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited) with that of PROZAC® 40 mg capsules (by Dista&#xD;
      Products Company) following a single oral dose (1 x 40 mg capsule) in healthy, adult subjects&#xD;
      under fasting conditions&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a single-dose, open-label, randomized two-way crossover study to evaluate the&#xD;
      bioequivalence of a test formulation, versus an equivalent dose of a commercially available&#xD;
      reference drug product, in 36 adult subjects, under fasted conditions. Drug administrations&#xD;
      are separated by at least 49 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital signs (sitting blood pressure and pulse rate) were obtained at baseline (Hour 0), and&#xD;
      at post-dose Hours 3, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 360, and 1056.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the 36 subjects enrolled into the study, 31 subjects completed the study in its entirety.&#xD;
      Five (5) subjects were dropped out from the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Sex: Male and Female; similar proportion of each preferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age: At least 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Qualifying subjects must be in good health and physical condition as determined by&#xD;
             medical history, complete physical examination, and laboratory tests, all obtained&#xD;
             within four (4) weeks prior to study start. The subject may not have a history of&#xD;
             significant past illness expected to affect the investigation. The normal status of&#xD;
             subjects will be confirmed by the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
             • Laboratory Tests: Hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC, WBC, differential count, serum&#xD;
             electrolytes (Na, K, CL), fasting blood glucose, BUN, bilirubin, creatinine, AST, ALT,&#xD;
             LD, alkaline phosphatase, and urinalysis. HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and drugs of&#xD;
             abuse testing will be done for screening purposes only. Urine drugs of abuse testing&#xD;
             will be repeated at each check-in. Female subjects will have a serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             done at screening and urine pregnancy test prior to each study period at check-in.&#xD;
             Laboratory values which are greater than :E20% of the normal range will not qualify&#xD;
             unless specifically accepted (with comment) by the Principal Investigator. Results of&#xD;
             HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and drugs of abuse must be negative or non-reactive for&#xD;
             the subject to qualify for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             • Electrocardiogram: A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be obtained for all&#xD;
             subjects. The original tracings, plus interpretation, will be included in the case&#xD;
             report form packet.&#xD;
&#xD;

             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. In addition, any one of the conditions listed below will exclude a subject from the&#xD;

             in the administration of fluoxetlne HCL, including:&#xD;
&#xD;

                  Hg.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Heart rate less than 50 beats per minute after a 5-minute rest&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Treatment with any other investigational drug during the four (4) weeks prior to the&#xD;
