  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to elucidate the effects of Diesel particles on the&#xD;
      allergic inflammation in the airways of asthmatic patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A first bronchoscopy will be performed with a baseline bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and&#xD;
      epithelial brushes followed by a segmental instillation of allergen (grass mix or house dust&#xD;
      mite) alone, in combination with Diesel particles, further in combination with Diesel&#xD;
      particles without organic compounds and saline as control into four different lung segments.&#xD;
      After 24 hours, during a second bronchoscopy, BAL samples will be collected in these&#xD;
      challenged segments in order to obtain cells and lavage fluid for cell biological and&#xD;
      immunological analysis.&#xD;
