    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to compare the rate and extent of absorption of Ranbaxy&#xD;
      Laboratories Limited, India, Amoxicillin-Clavulanic acid and GlaxoSmithKline, U.S.A.&#xD;
      (Augmentin ES-600), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, administered as a 1 x 5 mL (600 mg - 42.9&#xD;
      mg) oral suspension, under fed conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a single center, randomized, single-dose, open label, 2 - way crossover&#xD;
      bioequivalence study to compare the rate and extent of absorption of a test&#xD;
      amoxicillin-clavulanic acid versus Augmentin ES-600, a reference amoxicillin- clavulanic&#xD;
      acid, under fed conditions. Prior to the study commencement, subjects were randomly assigned&#xD;
      to a treatment in accordance with the randomization scheme generated by Anapharm. Subjects&#xD;
      were confined to the Anapharm Clinical research Facility from at least 11 hours prior to drug&#xD;
      administration until after the 12.0 hour post-dose blood draw, in each period. The treatment&#xD;
      phases were separated by a washout period of 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of sixty-two (62) healthy adult subjects signed the study specific informed consent&#xD;
      form and were confined for period I; of these subjects forty eight (48), (21 males and 27&#xD;
      females) were enrolled and dosed in the study; forty six (46) of these enrolled subjects&#xD;
      completed the clinical phase of the study&#xD;
