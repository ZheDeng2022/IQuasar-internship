  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Organ transplantation has become the treatment of choice for most patients suffering end&#xD;
      stage diseases of the kidney, pancreas, liver, heart or lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascularized Composite Allotransplantation (VCA) {a.k.a. composite tissue&#xD;
      allotransplantation} is the term used to describe transplantation of multiple tissues (skin,&#xD;
      muscle, bone, cartilage, nerve, tendon, vessel) as a functional unit (e.g. hand). Several&#xD;
      recent advances in clinical organ transplant immunosuppression and experimental limb VCA have&#xD;
      now made it feasible to consider clinical VCA for the functional restoration of patients with&#xD;
      loss of one or both hands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol facilitates the development of limb VCA at the Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical&#xD;
      Center (VAMC) and at Emory University for patients with below the elbow amputations. It will&#xD;
      evaluate the patients' use of transplanted limb(s) in activities of daily living and compare&#xD;
      the function of the transplanted hand to the function with their previous prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with below the elbow amputations will be enrolled. Donor tissue will be recovered&#xD;
      from deceased donors following the guidelines of and in cooperation with the regional Organ&#xD;
      Procurement Organization. The transplantation procedure and postoperative care will be&#xD;
      performed using the standard technique for limb replantation. Patients will receive standard&#xD;
      immunosuppressive regimen. Rejections will be treated in keeping with experience from the&#xD;
      solid organ transplant experience. Graft failure will be treated with allograft amputation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol will study patients with below the elbow amputations who are selected to&#xD;
      undergo limb allotransplantation. We will study patients after they have been trained on the&#xD;
      use of a prosthetic limb device prior to transplantation. We will treat them with&#xD;
      immunosuppression known to prevent the rejection of other allografted tissues and designed to&#xD;
      minimize their dependence on chronic maintenance immunosuppression. These patients will be&#xD;
      studied to determine whether the transplanted limb functions better, worse or the same as a&#xD;
      prosthetic hand, and to quantify those differences&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  male or female, 18-55 years of age, with below elbow amputation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ability to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that precludes serial follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any active malignancy or any history of a hematogenous malignancy or lymphoma.&#xD;
             Patients with primary, cutaneous basal cell or squamous cell cancers may be enrolled&#xD;
             providing these are appropriately eliminated prior to transplant. For amputations due&#xD;
             to malignancy, 5 years recurrence free survival will be required prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any known immunodeficiency syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability or unwillingness to comply with protocol monitoring and therapy, including,&#xD;
             among others, a history of noncompliance, circumstances where compliance with protocol&#xD;
             requirements is not feasible due to living conditions, travel restrictions, access to&#xD;
             urgent medical services&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or unwillingness to practice birth control methods during the first year of&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwillingness to undergo blood transfusion if clinically indicated&#xD;
