      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With improved implant design and surgical technique, operative treatment of humeral shaft&#xD;
      fractures increasingly has become accepted. Such treatment offers several advantages. The&#xD;
      rigidly fixed, fractured limb can be used early without external support, and the patient can&#xD;
      sleep, as normal, in the supine position. In addition, the angular deformity often seen with&#xD;
      conservative treatment effectively is prevented. Although plate osteosynthesis can afford a&#xD;
      rigid fixation and good functional recovery, its disadvantages have been reported. By&#xD;
      comparison, locked nailing, which provides sufficient fixation stability and prevents slipout&#xD;
      of the nail, offers the advantages of less soft tissue injury, a lower infection rate, and no&#xD;
      need for radial nerve extrication. Locked nailing is preferred especially for open fractures,&#xD;
      comminuted fractures, pathologic fractures, and fractures associated with osteoporosis. The&#xD;
      use of Seidel locked nails with spreading fins can be complicated by inadequate fixation,&#xD;
      intraoperative bone comminution, and unsatisfactory recovery of shoulder function.&#xD;
      Biomechanically, locked nails with transfixing locking screws allow much better rotational&#xD;
      control of the distal fragment than do Seidel nails. Most rigid humeral nails are inserted&#xD;
      antegrade, but a disadvantage to antegrade nailing has been the risk of shoulder function&#xD;
      impairment, which partially negates the advantages of closed nailing and of loadsharing&#xD;
      mechanical properties. The disadvantages of retrograde nailing are potential risk of elbow&#xD;
      joint injury and nonlinear entry portal of nailing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gaullier O et al did a study of 23 cases with rotator cuff evaluation in 1999. Only humeral&#xD;
      diaphyseal fractures were enrolled. Fracture type classification was according to AO.&#xD;
      Clinical shoulder assessment was carried out using the Constant score. Treatment was Seidel&#xD;
      intramedullary locked nailing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seidel intramedullary locked nailing was too big for patients in Taiwan. Compared to patients&#xD;
      in western countries, our patients had small stature. The humeral locked nail, invented by&#xD;
      Jinn Lin, provided a proper treatment option for humeral fractures in Asian people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although H-L nail has the advantages of minimal tissue trauma, it still has the possibility&#xD;
      of rotator cuff injury. The purpose of our study is to evaluate rotator cuff injury in&#xD;
      antegrade humeral locked nailing for humeral fractures by means of sonographic evaluation and&#xD;
      shoulder functional examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Implant design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Humeral Locked nail is a uniform closed cylindrical tube with a 5° bend at 70 mm from the&#xD;
      threaded end. It is manufactured from 316L stainless steel (Carpenter Technology Corporation,&#xD;
      Indianapolis, IN) in 4 sizes: 7 (diameter) x 190 (length) mm, 7 x 210 mm, 8 x 210 mm, and 8 x&#xD;
      230 mm. The thickness of the nail wall is 1.5 mm for 8 mm nails and 1 mm for 7 mm nails.&#xD;
      There are 3 parallel screw holes (the 2 outermost holes usually are used) at the threaded&#xD;
      end, 45° oblique to the axis of the nail, and 2 transverse screw holes at the other end.&#xD;
      Cortical screws are used as locking screws that are inserted under the guide of an L shaped,&#xD;
      nail mounted targeting device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Patient selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria for patients in the present study were listed as follows: (1) subjects&#xD;
      must sign and date informed consent; (2) subjects must be over fifteen years old, of either&#xD;
      sex; (3) subjects suffered from acute humeral fractures or non-unions; (4) subjects were&#xD;
      treated by antegrade H-L nailing (United, Taipei, Taiwan); 5) subjects had solid union of&#xD;
      fractures; 6) postoperative time was at least 12 months; 7) subjects were operated between&#xD;
      2003 and 2006. The exclusion criteria for patients in the present study were listed as&#xD;
      follows: (1) subjects refusing to take the examinations, (2) subjects lost to follow up, (3)&#xD;
      subjected with pre-existing shoulder problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study design is a retrospective, cross-sectional study. Patients with acute humeral&#xD;
      fractures or nonunions treated by antegrade H-L nailing were recruited and studied.&#xD;
      Sonographic evaluation of rotator cuff was done by an experienced orthopedist and shoulder&#xD;
      functional scores such as Neer score, Constant score and QuickDASH score was assessed at the&#xD;
      same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Real-time sonography was performed with a Sonoline Sienna scanner (HDI-5000, Philips, USA)&#xD;
      equipped with a 5.5-9.4-MHz linear-array transducer. The patient was seated on a stool with&#xD;
      the examiner sitting in front of him. Lateral transverse view and lateral longitudinal view&#xD;
      were acquired. For these two views, the arm of the examined patient was placed in adduction&#xD;
      and internal rotation, which gave a better exposure of the supraspinatus tendon under the&#xD;
      acromion. Criteria for full-thickness rotator cuff tears were nonvisualization of the rotator&#xD;
      cuff and hypoechoic or anechoic discontinuity. Besides, criteria for partial- thickness&#xD;
      rotator cuff tears included focal heterogenous hypoechogenecity and incomplete hypoechoic&#xD;
      cleft. Measurement of rotator cuff tears was done on lateral transverse and longitudinal&#xD;
      views. The width of rotator cuff tears was measured on lateral transverse view, while the&#xD;
      height of rotator cuff tears was measured on lateral transverse view. Moreover, the length of&#xD;
      rotator cuff tears was measured on lateral longitudinal view. The thickness of rotator cuff&#xD;
      at the dome of humeral head was measured on lateral transverse and compared between the&#xD;
      operative and sound sides. We calculate the ratio of the thickness of supraspinatus on the&#xD;
      operative side to that on the sound side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Thickness rotator cuff tear:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Size (full or partial):&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. width (mm) ii. height (mm) iii. length (mm)&#xD;
&#xD;
      b. visualization of nail&#xD;
&#xD;
      c. scar: nature and size&#xD;
&#xD;
      d. supraspinatus thickness(mm) :&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Baseline variables and primary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We included patient's age and gender, fracture location, fracture cause, presence of nail&#xD;
      removal, post-operative period and comorbidity or associated disease as independent&#xD;
      variables. Fracture location was either humeral neck or humeral shaft. Humeral neck fractures&#xD;
      were defined as fractures above surgical neck of the humerus. Humeral neck fractures were&#xD;
      further categorized into three groups: two-part, three-parts or four-parts, according to Neer&#xD;
      classification. Meanwhile, humeral shaft fractures were defined as fractures below surgical&#xD;
      neck of the humerus and 5 cm above the olecarnon fossa. Humeral shaft fractures were&#xD;
      separated into three groups: proximal third shaft fractures, middle third shaft fractures and&#xD;
      distal third shaft fractures. Fracture causes included simple falls and traffic accidents. We&#xD;
      calculate post-operative period according to the latest operation involving rotator cuff&#xD;
      injury, which included antegrade H-L nailing and nail removal. For example, if patient X was&#xD;
      treated by antegrade H-L nailing two years ago and received nail removal one year ago, his&#xD;
      (or her) post-operative period was twelve months rather than twenty-four months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoints of the present study were functional scores and sonographic findings.&#xD;
      As to functional scores, we chose Neer score, Constant score and QuickDASH score as our&#xD;
      endpoints. Neer score consists of pain component, function component, range of motion&#xD;
      component and anatomy component. The interpretation of Neer score are listed as follows:&#xD;
      excellent when Neer score is above 89 units, satisfactory when Neer score is between 80 to 89&#xD;
      units, unsatisfactory when Neer score is between 70 to 79 units, failure when Neer score is&#xD;
      below 70 units. Constant score consist of pain, activity level, arm positioning, strength of&#xD;
      abduction and range of motion. We examined Constant score of affected and healthy shoulder&#xD;
      and calculated the difference of Constant scores between two shoulders. The interpretation is&#xD;
      according to the difference of Constant scores: excellent (0~5 points), very good (6~10&#xD;
      points), good (11~20 points), fair (21~30 points) and poor (above 30 points). The QuickDASH&#xD;
      outcome measure is a questionnaire which asks about a patient's symptoms as well as his (or&#xD;
      her) ability to perform certain activities. Patients should answer this questionnaire based&#xD;
      on their conditions in the last week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We include age, gender, fracture location, fracture cause, the presence of nail removal,&#xD;
      post-operative period and comorbidity as independent variables. We use Neer score, Constant&#xD;
      score, QuickDASH score, the presence of full-thickness rotator cuff tear, partial-thickness&#xD;
      rotator cuff tear and scar , supraspinatus thickness ratio as dependent variables. Univariate&#xD;
      analyses were conducted with Student's t tests for continuous variables and Chi square tests&#xD;
      for binary variables. We also do multivariate regression analyses to adjust the confounding&#xD;
      factors. The difference is considered statistically significant when p value is under 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Sample size calculations (power analysis):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neer score:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is used for calculation of sample size. We assume that the standard&#xD;
      deviation of Neer score in our patients is 12 points. How many patients are required to have&#xD;
      a 80% power of detecting a 10-point difference in the mean of functional score between the&#xD;
      two groups at the 5% level of significance? The required sample size is 48 patients (24&#xD;
      patients for each group).&#xD;
