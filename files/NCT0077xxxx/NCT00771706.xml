      Cough is both an important physiologic component of lung defense and a cardinal indicator of&#xD;
      disease. For those with chronic cough, defined as cough lasting for more than 3 weeks, the&#xD;
      differential diagnosis is broad, including self-limited, persistent, and chronic diseases.&#xD;
      The success of a given treatment depends upon a proper diagnosis, yet this is often not&#xD;
      obvious. Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) has been proposed as one possible etiology of a&#xD;
      chronic cough in a number of studies in the adult literature; nevertheless a clear cause and&#xD;
      effect remains to be confirmed as there continues to be no gold standard test definitively to&#xD;
      identify pathologic GER. Each year, billions of dollars are directed towards diagnosing and&#xD;
      treating GER as it relates to adults and children with a chronic cough but without solid&#xD;
      proof of effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to test the null hypothesis that there is no causative role of GER with regards to&#xD;
      the etiology of chronic cough in children. If the null hypothesis proves true, this has&#xD;
      important medical and economic ramifications, as it would suggest that treatment of acid&#xD;
      reflux for chronic cough in a child is unwarranted. With this conclusion, health care costs&#xD;
      would be reduced and children spared inappropriate medication.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1. Cough&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cough is both an important physiologic component of lung defense and a cardinal indicator of&#xD;
      disease. It is the second most common reason for medical visits during childhood. The&#xD;
      metamorphosis of coughing from a normal to a pathologic event occurs along a gradient that&#xD;
      includes frequency, character and duration.1 When considered with the age of the child, each&#xD;
      of these characteristics informs decisions about diagnosis and management. For those with&#xD;
      chronic cough, defined as cough lasting for more than 3 weeks2, the differential diagnosis is&#xD;
      broad, including self-limited, persistent, and chronic diseases. An isolated cough in an&#xD;
      otherwise healthy child may be secondary to recurrent viral bronchiolitis, post-infectious&#xD;
      etiology, pertussis, cough variant asthma, post-nasal drip, or may be psychogenic in origin.&#xD;
      Possible significant underlying causes of cough include cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary&#xD;
      dyskinesia, immune deficiencies, chronic bronchitis, retained foreign bodies, airway lesions,&#xD;
      tracheomalacia, or extrinsic compression of the airway3. Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is&#xD;
      also included in the differential diagnosis of chronic cough in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To conduct a randomized , placebo controlled trial to test the null hypothesis that&#xD;
           treatment of children with a chronic cough of more than 3 weeks' duration is not&#xD;
           effected by medicine designed specifically to treat gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and&#xD;
           its extraesophageal manifestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To utilize the &quot;gold standard population&quot;(identified through the protocol outlined in&#xD;
           specific aim number 1) to use logistic regression analysis to identify which tests&#xD;
           currently employed to identify GER can be employed within a statistically sound&#xD;
           predictive model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children ages 2 to 18 years seen at the primary care pediatricians within one of the&#xD;
      Massachusetts General Hospital for Children (MGHfC) associated practices with a chronic cough&#xD;
      of three weeks or greater duration will be candidates for recruitment into the study. The&#xD;
      MGHfC has approximately 260 community based pediatric practices within the greater Boston&#xD;
      region. Children will also be recruited from the hospital based as well as satellite clinics&#xD;
      of the divisions of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Pediatric Pulmonology at MGHfC as well as&#xD;
      from the division of Pediatric Otolaryngology at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary&#xD;
      (MEEI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be evaluated first by their pediatricians and then by a team of Pediatric&#xD;
      otolaryngologists, gastroenterologists, and pulmonologists for identifiable causes of their&#xD;
      chronic cough. These children will be excluded from entry into proposed study. Children who&#xD;
      1) do not have an identifiable and treatable cause for their cough or 2) are suspected to&#xD;
      have GER as a possible etiology of their cough as suggested by history and physical&#xD;
      examination remain as candidates for recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children in whom a clear diagnosis can not be established by the above described protocol&#xD;
      then generally undergo a series of diagnostic endoscopies performed by the three clinical&#xD;
      services simultaneously (as is current standard at the MEEI/MGHfC Pediatric Airway, Voice,&#xD;
      and Swallowing Center) that include direct laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy with culture and&#xD;
      bronchoalveolar lavage, esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy, and placement of ambulatory&#xD;
      impedance and double pH probe monitoring. It is at the this point when informed consent is&#xD;
      taken for these procedures that the patients and their caregivers are recruited into the&#xD;
      study at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. ( the site for the office and endoscopic&#xD;
      visits). The point of randomization occurs at the time of endoscopy; administration of either&#xD;
      PPI or placebo begins on the day following the endoscopy and continue for the three week time&#xD;
      interval until the time of the first post-operative office visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregivers of children who are being scheduled for diagnostic endoscopy will be met by the&#xD;
      P.I. (CJH) as well as by the nurse coordinator of the study who will review with them the&#xD;
      Informed Consent Form and the Informed Assent Form for children over the age of 8 (as is&#xD;
      standard at MEEI; informed consent forms will also be obtained from the caregivers of these&#xD;
      children). A datasheet will be recorded for those caregivers who opt not to enter the study&#xD;
      to identify why they did not enroll so these issues can potentially be addressed if there are&#xD;
      issues with patient accrual and achieving adequate sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the cough reduction rate using either PPI or placebo in children with a&#xD;
           chronic cough&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the adverse events reported by the caregivers for their children who were&#xD;
           treated with PPI therapy as opposed to placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is based upon a non-parametric outcome variable and permits a Wilcoxon Rank&#xD;
      Sum calculation. The proposed RCT is designed to provide 90% statistical power for showing a&#xD;
      significant difference in clinical outcome attributable to PPI administration assuming a 5&#xD;
      point treatment difference on the summed questions from the CQ. The null hypothesis being&#xD;
      tested is that there is no significant difference in the cough reduction rate between&#xD;
      children with a chronic cough treated either with placebo or PPI therapy.&#xD;
