      The objective of this study is to compare the relative bioavailability of glimepiride 1 mg&#xD;
      tablets (manufactured by Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited) with that of AMARYL® 1 mg tablets&#xD;
      following a single oral dose (1 x 1 mg tablet) in healthy, adult subjects under fasting&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;

               -  All subjects selected for this study will be at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Each subject shall be given a general physical examination within 28 days of&#xD;
                  initiation of the study. Such examination includes, but is not limited to, blood&#xD;
                  pressure, general observations, and history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Each female subject will be given a serum pregnancy test as part of the pre-study&#xD;
             screening process. At the end of the study, the subjects will have an exit evaluation&#xD;
             consisting of interim history, global evaluation, and clinical laboratory&#xD;
             measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate blood and urine samples should be obtained within 28 days before beginning of&#xD;
             the first period and at the end of the trial for clinical laboratory measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical laboratory measurements will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hematology: hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, platelets, and white&#xD;
                  blood cell count (with differential).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clinical Chemistry: creatinine, BUN, glucose, SGOT/AST, SGPT/ALT, bilirubin, and&#xD;
                  alkaline phosphatase.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Urine Analysis: pH, specific gravity, protein, glucose, ketones,bilirubin, occult&#xD;
                  blood, and cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  HIV Screen:(pre-study only)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Electrocardiograms of all participating subjects will be recorded before initiation of&#xD;

             (e.g. condom, IUD) of contraception during the course of the study (first dosing until&#xD;
             last blood collection) or they will not be allowed to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have used implanted or injected hormonal contraceptives anytime during&#xD;
