  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver tumors are hard to treat with radiation because the liver moves every time you breathe.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test a new and possibly more accurate way of treating liver&#xD;
      tumors. When a person is asleep under anesthesia, it is safe to stop breathing motion for a&#xD;
      while. The liver will stop moving and radiation can be given to a liver tumor. The study is&#xD;
      being done to see if radiation can be given to liver tumors safely and accurately in this&#xD;
      way.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>image guidance with general anesthesia and suspended ventilation during treatment delivery</intervention_name>
    <description>All study patients will undergo marker implantation approximately 2 weeks prior to the PET-CT simulation and treatment planning. PET-CT is performed for treatment planning purposes. This part of the process is in routine clinical use at MSKCC.&#xD;
Three cone beam imaging scans and an IV contrast injection just prior to the first cone beam scan will be added to the standard procedure. The use of these two techniques is investigational.&#xD;
The treatment delivery will make use of general anesthesia and suspension of mechanical ventilation to render the patient apneic during both target localization and dose delivery. This will allow the dose to be delivered more precisely than the techniques currently in use, thus allowing the use of smaller treatment margins and reducing the high dose exposure of healthy liver tissue. These measures have not previously been used for treatment delivery.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient eligible to receive external beam intensity modulated radiotherapy for liver&#xD;
             cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age:21&lt;80&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  KPS &gt; or = to 80&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to tolerate immobilization cradle positioning&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of solid tumor malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Liver metastases visualized on CT imaging (obtained within approximately 6 months from&#xD;
             enrollment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Target lesion â‰¤ or = to 8 cm in maximal diameter&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the case of multiple liver metastases, only one lesion will be targeted per&#xD;
             treatment session. Typically the target lesion will be the lesion which is progressing&#xD;
             or the cause of symptoms. The target lesion will be picked in consultation with the&#xD;
             referring physician.&#xD;

             enrollment in the protocol if the patient refuses resection of the metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Target lesion &gt; 8 cm in maximal diameter&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cirrhosis of the liver (Child's C)&#xD;
