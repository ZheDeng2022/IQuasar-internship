      The study compared the relative bioavailability (rate and extent of absorption) of 10 mg&#xD;
      Zolpidem tablets by Ohm Laboratories Inc. with that of 10 mg Ambien® tablets distributed by&#xD;
      Sanofi-Synthelabo, Inc. following single oral dose (1x10 mg tablet) in healthy adult&#xD;
      volunteers administered under fasting condition&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a single-center, randomized, open label, two-way cross over study conducted under&#xD;
      fasting conditions. Subjects checked into the clinical facility the day prior to dosing at&#xD;
      least 10 hours prior to dose administration. On study day 1, subjects were dosed with single&#xD;
      oral dose (1x10mg tablet) of the test and reference products thirty minutes after initiation&#xD;
      of a standardized, high fat breakfast which was preceded by an overnight fast. Following a&#xD;
      seven day wash out period, subjects returned and were dosed with an alternative treatment as&#xD;
      per randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty-six (N=36) volunteers were enrolled in the study. Subject 07 elected to withdraw foe&#xD;
      personal reasons prior to period II check in. Subject 22 was excluded from statistical&#xD;
      analysis due to emesis before twice the median Tmax of reference product&#xD;
