  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory disease which often has&#xD;
      debilitating and potentially life-threatening consequences. The cause of SLE is unknown and&#xD;
      current therapies lack specificity and carry significant side-effects. We previously&#xD;
      discovered the depletion of glutathione in lymphocytes of patients with SLE and associated&#xD;
      this metabolic change with the elevation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will titrate to tolerance during an initial 3 month open label period and then&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized to one of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was determined by statistical analysis that each group must have 105 subjects. All&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled and evaluated for tolerance of NAC between dosages of 2.4 g/day and&#xD;
      4.8 g/day for 3 months. After A 3-month open-label dose-titration phase, SLE subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized into 2 groups of 105 subjects either to continue the tolerated dosage of NAC or&#xD;
      switched to equal number of placebo capsules. There will be up to seven study visits per SLE&#xD;
      subject, including the screening and wash out visits. Visits 2-6 will be scheduled three&#xD;
      months apart. The study will last 13 months with the wash-out visit. Each subject will donate&#xD;
      approximately 100 ml of blood for biomarker studies at each visit. Healthy control subjects&#xD;
      will donate blood at the same time. They will be matched to the SLE subjects by gender, age&#xD;
      within 10 years, and ethnicity. Their blood will be used as reference for biomarker assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a consent form required to participate in the phase II study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will take NAC in a dose range of 2.4 g/day to 4.8 g/day which will be titrated to&#xD;
      tolerance during an initial 3-month open label period. After the 3-month open label period,&#xD;
      patients in each arm will continue taking equal numbers of capsules representing a dosage&#xD;
      that has been titrated to tolerance. As an example, the patients tolerating 2.4 g/day, or 4&#xD;
      capsules containing 600 mg of NAC, after 3 months will be randomized to take 4 NAC or 4&#xD;
      placebo (2.4 g/day dextrose) capsules twice daily for the 9 subsequent months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome variable will be the response (yes/no) in the SLE Respinder Index or SRI&#xD;
      at Month 12 (reduction ≥ 4 points in SELENA-SLEDAI score and therefore also called SRI-4; no&#xD;
      new BILAG A organ domain score and no more than 1 new BILAG B organ domain score; and no&#xD;
      worsening in Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) score) by ≥ 0.3 points versus baseline). A&#xD;
      positive response will also require no treatment failure, defined as the need for&#xD;
      non-protocol treatment, i.e., new or increased immunosuppressives or antimalarials; increased&#xD;
      or parenteral corticosteroids; or premature discontinuation from study treatment.&#xD;
      Corticosteroids can be tapered off at the investigator's discretion, based on disease&#xD;
      activity. Four weeks after randomization, once tapered, corticosteroids can only be increased&#xD;
      again to the dosage preceding the last taper step; any larger increase will be deemed a&#xD;
      treatment failure. In addition, any increase in corticosteroid dosage during the last 3&#xD;
      months of the trial will result in declaration of treatment failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will monitor tolerance and safety, and assess SLEDAI, BILAG, FAS, PROMIS, ASRS, prednisone&#xD;
      use, liver and bone marrow function as secondary outcomes.&#xD;
