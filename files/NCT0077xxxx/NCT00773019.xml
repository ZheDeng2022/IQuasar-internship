      This FDA Condition of Approval study will include up to 100 subjects at up to 13 US centers.&#xD;
      Subjects are selected from those evaluated and planning to receive a SynchroMed II drug&#xD;
      infusion system for treatment of severe spasticity or chronic pain. Subjects must return for&#xD;
      refill visits at 1, 6, and 12 months. In addition, subjects return for any other medically&#xD;
      necessary refills. Information is collected on all refills and adverse events.&#xD;
