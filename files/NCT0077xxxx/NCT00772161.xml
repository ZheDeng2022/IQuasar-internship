  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to provide pharmacokinetic data for the assessment of bioequivalence&#xD;
      of Ritalin LA formulation compared to Medikinet ret. concerning plasma levels and efficacy&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters and&#xD;
      bioequivalence of Ritalin LA compared to Medikinet retard, both given as oral o.d. doses of&#xD;
      20 mg over 7 days in children with ADHD. The secondary objectives are to assess the efficacy,&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of Ritalin LA and Medikinet retard and the association of these&#xD;
      parameters with plasma levels.&#xD;

      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center, Phase I, prospective, randomized, single blind, two-treatment&#xD;
      cross-over study. 24 patients will be enrolled. Study duration for each patient is&#xD;
      approximately 4 weeks (from screening/inclusion). Based on the assumption of 5 months&#xD;
      recruitment, the total study duration will be approximately 6 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of 24 prepubertal boys aged 8 - 14 years with Diagnosis of ADHD according to DSM IV&#xD;
      will be enrolled in this study to ensure that 18 subjects will complete all assessments. The&#xD;
      prepuberal status will be determined by Tanner stages ≤ 2. Diagnosis will be confirmed by the&#xD;
      K-SADS-PL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will only be allowed to enter the trial if subject and subject´s parents/legal&#xD;
      guardians provide informed consent about participation (following full explanation of the&#xD;
      trial) and a written informed consent document is signed. In addition, it has to be verified&#xD;
      by a physician that the patient meets all of the Inclusion Criteria and none of the Exclusion&#xD;
      Criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study medications will be either Ritalin LA 20 mg or Medikinet ret. 20 mg. Patients with a&#xD;
      pre-treatment of psychotropic drugs other than Methylphenidate will have an individual&#xD;
      washout period before inclusion to the study. This individual washout period will last 5&#xD;
      elimination half-life of the taken drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization the patients will enter a 2 week treatment phase with a crossover at day&#xD;
      8. Patients randomized to Sequence 1 will be treated with Ritalin LA for the first week (day&#xD;
      1 to day 7) and with Medikiniet ret. for the second week (day 8 to day 14); patients&#xD;
      randomized to Sequence 2 will be treated with Medikinet ret. for the first week (day 1 to day&#xD;
      7) and with Ritalin LA for the second week (day 8 to day 14). The study population will be&#xD;
      randomized equally to the Sequence 1 or Sequence 2 group at Visit 2. The study ends 5 weeks&#xD;
      after enrollment of the last patient (total study end).&#xD;
