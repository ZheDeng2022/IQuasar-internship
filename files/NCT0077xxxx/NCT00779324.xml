      The purpose of this study is to study the effect of amantadine on irritability and aggression&#xD;
      caused by traumatic brain injury.&#xD;

      PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To study the effect of amantadine 100 mg administered twice daily&#xD;
      compared to placebo on irritability from baseline to treatment Day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUMMARY OF PROJECT: It is anticipated that 168 subjects with 168 corresponding subject&#xD;
      informants will be recruited for the study. Carolinas Rehabilitation, the lead center, and 5&#xD;
      collaborating centers will enroll approximately 28 subjects each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited primarily from the clinics. Also, letters will be sent to patients&#xD;
      in our data base. If the first encounter with research personnel is by telephone, the&#xD;
      research assistant will obtain verbal (telephone) consent from the subject's informant for&#xD;
      the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) for subject irritability. The score on this&#xD;
      questionnaire must be ≥ 6 for qualification. This allows pre-screening to take place and&#xD;
      avoid an unnecessary clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who consent and qualify will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, amantadine to placebo.&#xD;
      Stratification to randomization group will occur based on the presence of depression defined&#xD;
      by a Beck's Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) score ≥ 13. Randomized subjects will receive&#xD;
      amantadine or placebo 100 mg twice daily every morning and 12 Noon. There will be 4 clinic&#xD;
      visits. Visits will occur at baseline, for consenting and screening, day 28, day 60 and day&#xD;
      90. At all 4 clinic visits, both the subject and the informant will be given questionnaires&#xD;
      regarding the subject's behavior and mood. Follow up phone calls will occur each week that&#xD;
      the subject is not seen in the clinic until the end of the study. Follow up phone calls will&#xD;
      assess for study medication compliance, adverse events and concomitant medication changes.&#xD;
      Day 60 ends the period of the Randomized Clinical Trial phase of the study and the subjects&#xD;
      will begin the 1 month continuation phase of the study when all participants receive active&#xD;
      amantadine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following questionnaires will be used as measures of irritability for the subject and the&#xD;
      informant: Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), State Trait Anger Expression Inventory&#xD;
      (STAXI-2), and Global Impression of Change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following questionnaires will be dispensed to the subject only: Short Form -12,&#xD;
      Satisfaction With Life Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, Brief&#xD;
      Symptom Inventory, Family Assessment Device, Fatigue Impact Scale, and tests of cognitive&#xD;
      function. The Glasgow Outcome Score-Extended will be completed by the research assistant&#xD;
      using information obtained primarily from the informant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator will complete the Clinical Global Impression of change at Visits 1, 2, 3,&#xD;
      and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      History and Physical Exam, creatinine level (kidney function) will be obtained for safety and&#xD;
      tolerability. Serum pregnancy tests will be drawn at screening for females of childbearing&#xD;
      potential.&#xD;

    <description>The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) is a 40-item rating scale developed to assess 12 behavioral domains. Only the NPI-Irritability (NPI-I) domain was used for this study. NPI-I measures irritability with items including: bad temper, rapid mood changes, sudden anger, impatience, crankiness, argumentative. The rater selects the frequency (1-3) and severity (1-4) of the most problematic of these behavioral aspect(s) over the preceding month. The NPI score is the product of the frequency and severity for the NPI most problematic item score. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of participants with greater than two-point increase on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Irritability domain. The total range is 1 (least irritability) - 12 (worst irritability).</description>

        <description>The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) is a 40-item rating scale developed to assess 12 behavioral domains. Only the NPI-Irritability (NPI-I) domain was used for this study. NPI-I measures irritability with items including: bad temper, rapid mood changes, sudden anger, impatience, crankiness, argumentative. The rater selects the frequency (1-3) and severity (1-4) of the most problematic of these behavioral aspect(s) over the preceding month. The NPI score is the product of the frequency and severity for the NPI most problematic item score. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of participants with greater than two-point increase on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Irritability domain. The total range is 1 (least irritability) - 12 (worst irritability).</description>

          <title>Change in Neuropsychiatric Inventory - Irritability Domain Assessed by Participants Day 60</title>
          <description>The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) is a 40-item rating scale developed to assess 12 behavioral domains. Only the NPI-Irritability (NPI-I) domain was used for this study. NPI-I measures irritability with items including: bad temper, rapid mood changes, sudden anger, impatience, crankiness, argumentative. The rater selects the frequency (1-3) and severity (1-4) of the most problematic of these behavioral aspect(s) over the preceding month. The NPI score is the product of the frequency and severity for the NPI most problematic item score. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of participants with greater than two-point increase on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Irritability domain. The total range is 1 (least irritability) - 12 (worst irritability).</description>

Clinicians Global Impressions of Change (CGI) is a sensitive, standardized tool to assess psychopharmacologic treatment response completed by the study physician. The Global Improvement (GI) CGI subscale documented the clinician's impression of change. The GI uses a 7-point scale to assess beneficial and negative effects. Low GI values (1 -3) indicate improvement; higher values (4-7) represent worsening.</description>
