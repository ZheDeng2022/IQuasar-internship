      The purpose of this study is to determine whether albumin administration during cardiac&#xD;
      surgery is effective in attenuating the development of inflammation following surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The host response to infection and other forms of tissue injury has been termed the systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). SIRS is seen in association with a wide variety of&#xD;
      non-infective insults, including major trauma and surgical procedures, including those&#xD;
      necessitating cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). In this population the incidence of SIRS is high,&#xD;
      afflicting up to 70% of patients. This may be manifest from an increased vasopressor&#xD;
      requirement, to refractory hypotension, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) with&#xD;
      liver, renal, myocardial, and neurological problems. MODS is associated with significant&#xD;
      mortality rates of around 30-45%. Survivors require prolonged and costly intensive care,&#xD;
      thereby representing a considerable burden for the healthcare services. Survivors often&#xD;
      suffer considerable morbidity and have significantly impaired health related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite intense investigations of anti-inflammatory therapies in SIRS and its sequelae, the&#xD;
      case of patients is largely supportive whilst underlying triggers (such as infection) for the&#xD;
      process are treated. Indeed, the only therapy drotrecogin alfa (activated) demonstrated to&#xD;
      reduced mortality in a randomised study has only been investigated in patients with the most&#xD;
      severe SIRS consequent of infection (i.e. severe sepsis) and is contra-indicated in those who&#xD;
      have just undergone surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Haemolysis is a common feature of surgery requiring CPB and may potentiate the development of&#xD;
      SIRS and organ injury through the release of heme/iron. Furthermore, haemolysis during CPB&#xD;
      may lead to the depletion of important mechanisms which scavenge free heme/hemoglobin from&#xD;
      the circulation. Albumin, the most abundant plasma protein, has specific and non-specific&#xD;
      heme and iron binding sites which are used under circumstances in which standard scavengers&#xD;
      are overwhelmed. However, albumin is also depleted following CPB. It is therefore&#xD;
      hypothesised that by priming the CPB circuit with albumin the heme/iron scavenging capability&#xD;
      of the plasma will be maintained following surgery and that the systemic inflammatory&#xD;
      response will be attenuated.&#xD;
