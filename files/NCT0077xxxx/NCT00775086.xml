      The purpose of this single center, randomized, double-blind, 2 way crossover study was to&#xD;
      determine the bioequivalence of a norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol (NGMN/EE) transdermal&#xD;
      contraceptive system.&#xD;

      The primary objective was to determine the bioequivalence of a norelgestromin/ethinyl&#xD;
      estradiol (NGMN/EE) transdermal contraceptive system lot with a faster equilibration profile&#xD;
      compared to currently marketed lot of NORELGESTROMIN/ETHINYL ESTRADIOL, after application to&#xD;
      the buttock. This was a single center, randomized, double-blind, 2 way crossover study. The&#xD;
      double-blind treatment phase included two 7-day treatment periods separated by a 21-day&#xD;
      washout period. Safety was assessed throughout the study. The study population was comprised&#xD;
      of healthy women who weighed at least 110 pounds with a body mass index (BMI) between 16 and&#xD;
      29.9 kg/m2, and a hematocrit of at least 36%. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to 1&#xD;
      of 2 treatment sequence groups. A 20 cm2 NGMN/EE transdermal contraceptive patch (test or&#xD;
      NORELGESTROMIN/ETHINYL ESTRADIOL (reference) was applied to each patient on the buttock and&#xD;
      worn for 7 days. Twenty-one days after removal of the first patch the patient crossed over to&#xD;
      the other treatment. After each patch was removed, the skin was checked for redness and&#xD;
      swelling. Blood samples were collected for measurement of drug concentrations during the&#xD;
      7-day wear periods and for 3 days after each patch was removed. Patients were telephoned&#xD;
      weekly during the washout period to remind them to use back-up contraception. After the last&#xD;
      blood sample collection in Period 2, or in instances where the patient withdrew early from&#xD;
      the study, posttreatment procedures including physical and gynecologic examinations, vital&#xD;
      signs, laboratory evaluations, and a serum pregnancy test were performed. The following&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic parameters were to be estimated for NGMN, NG, and EE after test and&#xD;
      NORELGESTROMIN/ETHINYL ESTRADIOL patch application: Cmax - maximum observed serum&#xD;
      concentration after patch application; tmax - time of maximum serum concentration after patch&#xD;
      application; Css - mean steady-state concentration for NGMN and EE after patch application&#xD;
      calculated as the mean concentration between 48 and 168 hours; Cavg - average concentration&#xD;
      for NG calculated as AUC168/168; AUC - the area under the serum concentration-time curve for&#xD;
      NGMN, NG, and EE using linear trapezoidal summation from the data obtained after patch&#xD;
      application from time 0 (dosing) to 168 hours postdose (AUC168), from time 0 to 240 hours&#xD;
      postdose (AUC240), from time 0 to infinity (AUCinf), and from time 0 to the last measurable&#xD;
      concentration for EE (AUClast); and tÂ½ - apparent terminal half-life, computed as (ln2/ke)&#xD;
      where ke is the slope of the terminal log-linear phase of the serum concentration-time curve.&#xD;
      Patch adhesion was assessed and scores summarized. Assessment of bioequivalence will be based&#xD;
      on the use of 90% confidence intervals (for 2 one-sided test procedures) for the ratios of&#xD;
      mean (test to reference) pharmacokinetic parameters, AUC240 and Css for NGMN and EE. The 2&#xD;
      patches were considered bioequivalent if the 90% confidence intervals fell within 80% to 125%&#xD;
      limits for both AUC240 and Css for NGMN and EE. Safety evaluations were based on adverse&#xD;
      events, including erythema and application site reaction and changes in physical and&#xD;
      gynecologic examinations (including breast exams), vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, and clinical&#xD;
      laboratory test results from pre- to poststudy. Serum pregnancy testing and urine drug&#xD;
      screening was performed. Changes from screening were summarized using descriptive statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A fast equilibratin patch or NORELGESTROMIN/ETHINYL ESTRADIOL patch (20 cm2 transdermal&#xD;
      contraceptive system) contains NGMN 6.0 mg and EE 0.75 mg. Each patient wore a patch (test or&#xD;
      NORELGESTROMIN/ETHINYL ESTRADIOL) on the buttock for 7 days, according to a&#xD;
      computer-generated randomization schedule. There was a 21-day washout period. Patients then&#xD;
      crossed over to the other treatment for 7 days.&#xD;
