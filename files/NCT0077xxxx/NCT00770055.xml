      RATIONALE: Gathering information about patients with breast cancer over time may help doctors&#xD;
      learn more about a patient's use of the internet to find information about treatment, symptom&#xD;
      management, and emotional support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying internet use among women with recurrent metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document the proportion of women who use the internet to access treatment and symptom&#xD;
           management information and to seek emotional support after diagnosis of metastatic&#xD;
           recurrent breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the association of treatment stage and effectiveness with internet use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the association of individual differences in patients' demographics,&#xD;
           beliefs, emotional functioning, and social and professional support with internet use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the association of patients' use of the internet to seek resources with&#xD;
           their beliefs, emotional functioning, and relationship functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients undergo assessments consisting of paper and pencil questionnaires at four&#xD;
      time points. The timing of these assessments is linked to the patient's treatment course and&#xD;
      her presumed need to access internet resources for information on cancer, treatment, symptom&#xD;
      management, and emotional support. Patients who discontinue regular care at the Cancer&#xD;
      Institute of New Jersey site during the course of the study may complete study assessments&#xD;
      through phone interviews conducted by a member of the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo a baseline survey prior to deciding on a treatment course for their newly&#xD;
      progressive disease. Patients complete the first part of the survey to provide information on&#xD;
      demographics, beliefs about cancer, mood states, somatic symptoms, and available resources&#xD;
      for cancer information and emotional support. Patients complete the second part of the&#xD;
      survey, if they have used the internet previously to obtain information and resources about&#xD;
      cancer or if they have received cancer information that someone else located on the internet&#xD;
      for them, which inquires about patients' internet use, any internet resources they have&#xD;
      received from family members, friends, or other people they know, and their own evaluation of&#xD;
      these internet resources. Patients undergo the second study assessment after completion of&#xD;
      the first course of treatment and prior to initiating course 2 (i.e., 3 to 4 weeks after&#xD;
      initiating treatment). The third study assessment occurs within the first 2 weeks after the&#xD;
      medical oncologist's first evaluation of treatment response (i.e., 6-9 weeks after initiating&#xD;
      treatment). The fourth assessment occurs after the medical oncologist's second evaluation of&#xD;
      the patient's response to treatment, following tumor re-staging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete several questionnaires during these assessments to provide information&#xD;
      about personal characteristics (demographics, physical and psychological well-being, beliefs&#xD;
      about cancer and treatment, optimism), social and healthcare networks (perceived social&#xD;
      support, social network composition, beliefs about treatment team), and outcomes (use of&#xD;
      non-internet cancer information, use of the internet for cancer resources, use of interactive&#xD;
      technologies, communication with treatment team and family, evaluation of internet&#xD;
      resources).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information is extracted from the patients' medical record: stage and node&#xD;
      status at primary diagnosis, previous oncology surgeries, previous adjuvant treatments,&#xD;
      current menopausal status, treatment at time of recurrence, disease free interval, site(s) of&#xD;
      metastasis, and response to current treatment.&#xD;
