      Goals of this registry:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 To collect and store very limited demographic information (age, birthdate, race and&#xD;
      ethnicity), limited cancer risk and breast and ovarian disease history, as well as limited&#xD;
      family history of breast and ovarian cancer on patients who are at risk of breast or ovarian&#xD;
      cancer or who have had a diagnosis of either cancer,&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 To make available summary information (in an anonymous form) regarding the subjects in&#xD;
      this registry to Consortium members, and other investigators, who can use these data to plan&#xD;
      research projects and evaluate the feasibility of such projects,&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 To make available summary information (number of new patients seen in the clinic, number&#xD;
      of mutations, number of preventive surgeries, average age of patients seen) to the Lynne&#xD;
      Cohen Foundation for Ovarian Cancer Research, in order to document the numbers of subjects&#xD;
      who utilize their supported clinics.&#xD;

      Information Collection for Entry into Multicenter Registry:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, a study staff member will collect the following&#xD;
      information by asking you at a clinic visit and checking your medical records. The following&#xD;
      information will be entered in the registry:&#xD;
&#xD;
      your demographic information (your sex, year of birth, and race/ethnicity) whether any member&#xD;
      of your family has a history of ovarian and/or breast cancer whether any member of your&#xD;
      family has any known genetic markers that may mean a higher risk of developing a cancer a&#xD;
      brief summary of your history of breast and/or ovarian disease and whether you have any known&#xD;
      genetic markers that may mean a higher risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer a&#xD;
      brief summary of the results of the clinic visit on the day you agreed to take part in this&#xD;
      study (Day 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Information Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each time you visit the M. D. Anderson high-risk clinic (either the high-risk breast cancer&#xD;
      clinic or the high-risk ovarian cancer clinic), the study staff will check your medical&#xD;
      records and enter in the registry any updates to your cancer risk information. You will also&#xD;
      be asked if any family members have been diagnosed with ovarian and/or breast cancer, and&#xD;
      this will be entered in the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you miss any of your planned clinic visits, the study staff may contact you by phone to&#xD;
      collect this information, contact you by mail to send you a questionnaire with this&#xD;
      information, and/or reschedule your appointment. If you receive a questionnaire by mail, you&#xD;
      will fill it out and mail it back to the research staff in the stamped, self-addressed&#xD;
      envelope that will be provided to you. It should take about 5-10 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study staff plans to keep all personal identifying information (such as your name)&#xD;
      strictly confidential. Your data will be handwritten on paper forms that will be stored in a&#xD;
      locked file cabinet. The study staff will enter your data into the multicenter database&#xD;
      (registry) with your participant identification (ID) number but not your name or other&#xD;
      identifying information. The registry is password-protected. Only designated members of the&#xD;
      study staff will have access to the participant ID numbers and be able to link the data to&#xD;
      you. This is to allow medical information related to your data to be updated as needed. The&#xD;
      linking information will be saved securely (on a password-protected computer) in the research&#xD;
      office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multicenter registry is called the Lynne Cohen registry. It is maintained at the&#xD;
      University of Southern California Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of Registry for Planning Future Research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lynne Cohen clinics make up the multicenter group of clinics that are involved in this study.&#xD;
      If a researcher at any Lynne Cohen clinic is planning to perform a research study involving&#xD;
      ovarian or breast cancer causes or prevention, he or she can contact the Lynne Cohen&#xD;
      Foundation. A staff member at the Lynne Cohen Foundation will check to see how many patients&#xD;
      are included in the registry. This will help the researcher find out how many people the&#xD;
      researcher may be able to ask to join his or her study. That number of people will also help&#xD;
      the researcher decide if the planned study is feasible. The number of patients in the&#xD;
      registry is the only information that will be shared with these researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation in this study will last for as long as you agree to keep having this study&#xD;
      information collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When your participation in this study ends, the M. D. Anderson study staff will delete or&#xD;
      destroy any personal identifying information and contact information collected. The rest of&#xD;
      the study data will continue being stored in the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 1000 patients will be enrolled in this multicenter study. Up to 200 will be enrolled at&#xD;
      M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
