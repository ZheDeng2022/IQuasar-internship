      MOPS: Mannheim Obesity Pilot Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity is a central feature of the metabolic syndrome. With increasing prevalence of&#xD;
      overweight and obesity, the incidence of WHO III° obesity will further augment. In this&#xD;
      subset of obese patients, metabolic complications and cardiovascular risk are major clinical&#xD;
      issues. Epidemiological data show that with increased BMI mortality rises (1). The SOS-Study&#xD;
      demonstrated, for the first time, that bariatric surgery and consecutive weight reduction are&#xD;
      associated with a decrease in cardiovascular and overall mortality. Significant mortality in&#xD;
      this study was caused by cardiovascular events and cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic Syndrome - MS - Despite varying definitions of the metabolic syndrome, obesity is&#xD;
      one of its central features. Depending on the definition used, it can represent an obligate&#xD;
      criterion (IDF) or a facultative parameter (WHO and ATP III). Even though not obligate,&#xD;
      extreme obesity is a central risk factor for most other parameters of the metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial dysfunction -ED- represents the initial step of atherosclerosis (3). An&#xD;
      appropriate measurement is the evaluation by retinal analysis. Epidemiological data&#xD;
      demonstrate increased cardiovascular risk with retinal vessel pathology (4).&#xD;

      Methods and procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We conducted a prospective study in obesity WHO III° with consecutive enrollment. The study&#xD;
      protocol was approved by the local ethics committee. Patients were recruited within an&#xD;
      integrated concept designed for individuals seeking weight reduction. This network&#xD;
      encompassed a complex approach by nutrition specialists, bariatric surgeons,&#xD;
      endocrinologists, ENT specialists and psychologists. Patients could present themselves at any&#xD;
      of the aforementioned specialists for study inclusion. Those who consented were followed,&#xD;
      after conventional weight loss (diet, activity) or bariatric surgery 1 year later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a standardized form, we evaluated the medical and obesity history as well as associated&#xD;
      metabolic complications (impaired glucose metabolism, elevated Cholesterol and NASH). We&#xD;
      further inquired about regular medication, related diseases and classic cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors (Framingham risk score: cardiovascular disease, family history of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, nicotine abuse and arterial hypertension).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometry - Subsequently, a complete physical examination was conducted, taking into&#xD;
      consideration the use of an adequate cuff to measure blood pressure. We further recorded&#xD;
      circumferences of the neck, arm and waist (midway between the lower rib margin and iliac&#xD;
      crest, with a measuring tape at the end of gentle expiration). Body weight and height were&#xD;
      determined by calibrated scales to the nearest 0.1kg and cm, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolism - Metabolic analysis was performed after an overnight fast. Baseline measurements&#xD;
      included blood glucose, insulin, cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides and liver enzymes.&#xD;
      Every individual without known diabetes was screened for the presence of impaired glucose&#xD;
      metabolism by means of an OGTT. To exclude endocrine obesity we measured TSH levels and&#xD;
      performed a one mg dexamethasone suppression test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intima media thickness (IMT) - Measurement of the intima media thickness of the right carotid&#xD;
      artery was performed in order to detect subclinical vascular disease. Imaging protocol was&#xD;
      executed according to the consensus statement of the American Society of Echocardiography&#xD;
      (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structural and functional endothelial dysfunction: Arterial and venous ratio (AVR) and&#xD;
      flicker reaction - DVA was used for digital fundus imaging as well as conventional fundus&#xD;
      examinations and retinal vessel analysis (RVA, imedos, Jena, Germany). Structural endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction was determined by arterial-venous ratio (AVR). After mydriasis with phenylephrine&#xD;
      10% and tropicamide 1%, images centred on the macula, the inferior arcade and the optic disc&#xD;
      were recorded in both eyes. AVR was calculated by software after marking arteries and veins&#xD;
      within two diameters of the optic disc (RVA, imedos, Jena, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional endothelial dysfunction was measured by flicker reaction of retinal vessels. This&#xD;
      technique records dilatation of retinal vessels during and after exposure to flickering&#xD;
      light. We used 1.5 mm segments of vessels within two disc diameters, which showed no crossing&#xD;
      or bifurcation, and had a tortuosity &lt; 30°. After baseline calibration, flickering light was&#xD;
      shown for 20 seconds via interruption of continuous light at 12.5 Hz. During this period and&#xD;
      for further 80 seconds, vessel diameter was continuously measured. To achieve higher&#xD;
      reliability, this procedure was performed three times. Flicker of the artery and vein was&#xD;
      expressed as the maximum in percent of the baseline diameter. Adjustment for eye movement was&#xD;
      performed automatically by software. Details of this technique were published elsewhere&#xD;
      (6-7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIA - Body composition was determined preoperatively by BIA. All patients were required to&#xD;
      rest for 30 minutes, after which BIA was performed by applying 4 silver electrodes, with 2&#xD;
      detecting electrodes placed at the ulnar aspect of the right wrist and the right medial&#xD;
      malleolus. After connecting the electrodes to the multiple-frequency BIA instrument (BIA&#xD;
      2000, Data Input, Darmstadt, Germany), measurements were recorded in real time via computer.&#xD;
      The calculations for BCM, ECM, ECM/BCM, fat and TBW were performed using Nutri 2000 software&#xD;
      (Data Input, Darmstadt, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints - The endpoint of our study was the identification of cardiovascular risk and&#xD;
      metabolic complications or factors representing these risks in a population with obesity WHO.&#xD;
      Therefore, we measured parameters of the metabolic syndrome, endothelial dysfunction and&#xD;
      subclinical atherosclerosis. Patients, who gave informed consent, are followed after&#xD;
      conventional weight loss (diet, activity) or bariatric surgery yearly. The decision for the&#xD;
      type of intervention is connected to a complex process. According to the German obesity&#xD;
      society subjects with more than 40 kg/m2 and patients with a BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2 with obesity&#xD;
      associated disease have the indication for bariatric surgery. After drafting of an expert's&#xD;
      opinion for coverage of the costs by the health insurance patients may attend bariatric&#xD;
      surgery. Because of the noncommittal character of the guideline of the German obesity society&#xD;
      to health insurances not all patients will be able to get coverage for their surgery costs.&#xD;
      Patients who are not able to get cost coverage or refuse surgery represent the conservative&#xD;
      treatment (activity, diet). The interventional group will be treated by bariatric surgery&#xD;
      (sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass). Therefore, the study has observational&#xD;
      character.&#xD;
