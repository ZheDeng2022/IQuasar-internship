  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To add to our understanding of the relationship between blushing, symptom severity and&#xD;
      potential mechanisms that underlie blushing in patients with Social Phobia (SP), the&#xD;
      investigators propose comparing SP patients' vascular responses to topical m-N pre and post&#xD;
      treatment with Seroquel or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atypical antipsychotics such as seroquel have been used successfully as adjunctive treatments&#xD;
      in other anxiety disorders, including PTSD (Labatte, 2001; Krashin &amp; Oates, 1999; McDougle et&#xD;
      al., 2000; Pfanner et al., 2000; Bogetto et al., 2000) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder&#xD;
      (Katzman et al., 2005). Responses to the blushing exposure will be assessed prior to and&#xD;
      following treatment with seroquel or placebo and at one month following intervention. Levels&#xD;
      of prostaglandin will be compared between groups and will also be correlated with symptom&#xD;
      severity in the clinical groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this randomized, double blind flexible -dose study will be to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy , safety and tolerability of seroquel SR 50mg to 800mg and placebo in outpatient&#xD;
      subjects diagnosed with SP. The study will begin with a single week of Seroquel 50mg or&#xD;
      placebo. Subsequently, tablets will be administered by the investigator in a flexible dose&#xD;
      fashion during the visits. Patients will be followed up weekly (biweekly after week 6) and at&#xD;
      the clinician's discretion. After the fist week the patients' dosage will be increased up to&#xD;
      a maximum of 800 mg daily with expected average dose of 300mg dail. This dose will remain&#xD;
      fixed after 8 weeks of treatment until week 16.&#xD;
