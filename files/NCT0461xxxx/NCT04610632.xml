  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-clinical lay user study using stored clinical samples from the SPD BioBank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers recruited into the study and meeting the criteria will test a randomised pregnant&#xD;
      or not pregnant urine sample sourced from SPD's biobank with a new home pregnancy test.&#xD;
      Volunteers will be required to follow the product instructions for use (IFU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The order of testing will be randomised prior to execution of the protocol, and each urine&#xD;
      sample will only be identifiable by a unique reference number. An independent study&#xD;
      technician not involved in study conduct will be responsible for blinding the samples.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women will be informed of the opportunity to participate in a study in which they will be&#xD;
      required to use a home pregnancy test to test a urine sample provided to them. Interested&#xD;
      applicants will be invited to join the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be advised that the product they will be testing is under investigation and&#xD;
      that the volunteer will not be testing their own urine and therefore volunteers will not&#xD;
      learn their own pregnancy status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be required to consent to the study prior to participation. Each volunteer&#xD;
      will test only one device, they will be provided with one investigational device and one&#xD;
      urine sample. The order of testing will be randomised prior to execution of the protocol, and&#xD;
      each urine sample will only be identifiable by a unique reference number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When ready the volunteer will be required to read the IFU prior to testing the urine sample&#xD;
      provided with the investigational device according to the instructions. The volunteer will&#xD;
      advise the study technician of the result, who will record this on the result sheet.&#xD;
