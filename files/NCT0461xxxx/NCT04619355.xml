    <textblock>
      Heart diseases known as the second cause of death in Koreans are coronary artery diseases&#xD;
      such as angina and myocardial infarction. Coronary artery disease occurs when fat components,&#xD;
      such as cholesterol, accumulate in the body. When these fat components are deposited in blood&#xD;
      vessels, blood vessels' walls become thick, and the blood vessels narrow, which interferes&#xD;
      with circulation. Without smooth circulation, the heart muscle does not function properly&#xD;
      because the supply of oxygen and nutrient-rich blood, which is necessary for the heart to&#xD;
      function normally, is not properly supplied. It leads to angina pectoris and chest pain and&#xD;
      can cause myocardial infarction or even heart attack. Coronary artery disease in various&#xD;
      aspects has a high mortality rate when it occurs in old age. The methods currently used for&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment are coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI),&#xD;
      and myocardial partial blood flow reserve history. There is a wide variety of tests&#xD;
      (Fractional Flow Reserve, FFR), near-infrared spectroscopy intravascular ultrasound&#xD;
      (NIRS-IVUS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the various aspects and treatment methods of this disease, treatment is often&#xD;
      difficult, so the clinical significance is great. In the case of PCI, one of the methods of&#xD;
      examination and treatment, the National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) has been&#xD;
      established to establish guidelines for improving patient prognosis after surgery in the&#xD;
      United States. NCDR, which started with the American College of Cardiology (ACC) initiative,&#xD;
      is currently in an indispensable position for establishing clinical practice guidelines such&#xD;
      as monitoring treatment-related indicators, quality improvement (QI), and clinical research.&#xD;
      In charge. Besides, in recent years, the use of new drugs or new devices (Post-Market&#xD;
      Surveillance), real-time risk estimation, and personalized planning is increasing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research to analyze the prognosis of various aspects of coronary artery disease, tests, and&#xD;
      procedures has been constantly conducted, but comprehensive studies that can be used to&#xD;
      improve the overall treatment are considered to be insufficient. At this point, a&#xD;
      comprehensive study is required to establish clinical guidelines and to develop them&#xD;
      continuously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, the area that needs research is whether or not future events can be prevented&#xD;
      using vascular imaging. Studies have shown that if lipids are actively treated with statins,&#xD;
      the lipid component of atherosclerotic plaques can be significantly reduced in just a few&#xD;
      weeks. Suggests. According to the results of a YELLOW (Reduction in Yellow Plaque by&#xD;
      Aggressive Lipid-Lowering Therapy) study published in 2012 based on a near-infrared&#xD;
      spectroscopy-vascular ultrasound analysis, the active treatment group of statins showed the&#xD;
      lipid-core burden index compared to the standard treatment group. ) showed a significant&#xD;
      decrease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, this study collects all comprehensive indicators such as test methods, test&#xD;
      results, procedures, and treatment results for all patients undergoing near-infrared&#xD;
      spectroscopy-vascular ultrasound treatment in Korea, including this institution, A&#xD;
      comprehensive study of the disease registry related to the near-infrared&#xD;
      spectroscopy-vascular ultrasound procedure is conducted to determine the type of disease, the&#xD;
      number of affected vessels, and disease-related indicators.&#xD;
