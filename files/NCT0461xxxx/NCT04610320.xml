  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether Daratumumab-SC, a drug that eliminates&#xD;
      antibody-producing plasma cells, can effectively lower the level of preformed antibodies in&#xD;
      patients awaiting heart transplantation. These preformed antibodies limit the number of donor&#xD;
      hearts that are compatible for the patients. If Daratumumab-SC can effectively remove&#xD;
      preformed, donor-specific antibodies, then highly allosensitized patients will have more&#xD;
      compatible hearts available to them, potentially decreasing transplant waitlist time and&#xD;
      reducing mortality.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participant is on an active list for a heart transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a high level of allosensitization, defined as a calculated PRA (panel&#xD;
             of reactive antibodies) of 50%, based on their antibody status at the time of entry&#xD;
             into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign an informed consent form prior to any&#xD;

             1 second (FEV1) &lt;50% of predicted normal. Note that FEV1 testing is required for&#xD;
