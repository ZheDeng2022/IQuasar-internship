  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One in 300 women will become persistent opioid users after cesarean delivery (1). Cesarean&#xD;
      delivery is the most common surgical procedure in the United States, representing 31.9% of&#xD;
      the 3,788,235 deliveries in 2018 (2). Patients have to cope with the pain and challenges of&#xD;
      post-operative care while adjusting to motherhood and completing activities of daily living.&#xD;
      Often when they return home, they are also tasked with other domestic roles which compounds&#xD;
      the challenge of this post-operative period. With a potential impact just in the US on 1.2&#xD;
      million mothers each year, optimizing post-operative pain management in order to reduce the&#xD;
      risk of persistent opioid use represents an urgent unmet public health goal. To this end,&#xD;
      there are national efforts to reduce the cesarean rate and optimize post-cesarean pain&#xD;
      management (3,4). The majority of efforts in the last few years have focused on home-going&#xD;
      medications and alterations in prescription practices. Recent recommendations from the&#xD;
      Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Society indicate that patients should receive multi-modal&#xD;
      analgesia on a regular basis, along with early post-delivery mobilization (3). However, the&#xD;
      efficacy of scheduled non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAID) along with&#xD;
      acetaminophen in the immediate post-operative period and after going home have not been&#xD;
      systematically studied in the cesarean population. We hypothesize that patients who receive&#xD;
      scheduled medications in the post-operative period are less likely to require opioids for&#xD;
      pain relief both in the hospital and after they return home.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a pragmatic randomized control trial of post-cesarean pain management&#xD;
      techniques with participants allocated in a 1:1 ratio using a random block allocation table&#xD;
      using blocks of size 4 and 6. Given the nature of the study, it would be impossible to blind&#xD;
      participants and clinicians. Participants will be randomized after completion of the&#xD;
      procedure to ensure that patients who have significant surgical complications such as severe&#xD;
      hemorrhage or those undergoing hysterectomy are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive intrathecal morphine 150mcg per OU standard of care, with&#xD;
      orders for pain management per anesthesia for the first 24 hours with a regular diet, removal&#xD;
      of urinary catheter 12-24 hours post-operatively, and abdominal binder placed after surgery.&#xD;
      In addition, patients will be provided with a fitness tracker to be worn on their wrist&#xD;
      throughout hospitalization and until their post-operative visit. After 24 hours, participants&#xD;
      will be assigned to either receive current OU standard of care therapy which includes&#xD;
      ibuprofen 800mg every eight hours as needed (PRN), acetaminophen 1000mg every eight hours&#xD;
      PRN, and oxycodone five mg every six hours PRN or the study protocol. The study protocol will&#xD;
      include scheduled ibuprofen 800mg every eight hours and acetaminophen 1000mg every eight&#xD;
      hours, given at the same time, along with oxycodone five mg every six hours PRN for&#xD;
      breakthrough pain. Both sets of patients will be provided with 60 pills of acetaminophen&#xD;
      500mg and 30 pills ibuprofen 800mg to take at home, with the study participants receiving&#xD;
      instructions to take the medications in a scheduled fashion and the other group in an as&#xD;
      needed fashion. Both groups will receive a discharge prescription for 20 pills of oxycodone&#xD;
      five mg every 6 hours PRN to be taken for breakthrough pain as needed--current standard at&#xD;
      OU. All prescriptions will be delivered to the patient from the pharmacy prior to discharge&#xD;
      per our departmental standard. Patient requiring more medications to control pain beyond the&#xD;
      randomized approach described above will be treated per the discretion of the attending&#xD;
      physician or designee. Patients will be seen for a post-operative care visit on post&#xD;
      discharge day 8-12 depending on patient and clinic availability and asked to bring their&#xD;
      fitness tracker and medication bottles with them for assessment of steps taken, medication&#xD;
      consumed, pain outcomes and satisfaction scores. The Oklahoma PMP Aware system will be&#xD;
      accessed to record prescriptions for controlled substances from other providers.&#xD;
