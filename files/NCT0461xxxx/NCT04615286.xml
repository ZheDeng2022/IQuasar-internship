  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infection of the pleural space is serious condition that requires hospitalization, invasive&#xD;
      interventions and long courses of antibiotics[1]. Treatment of pleural infection requires&#xD;
      long hospital admission with a median of 19 days[2] and medical treatments fails requiring&#xD;
      surgical intervention in up to 30% of cases[3]. The mortality from pleural infection is&#xD;
      around 10% at 3 months[4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides drainage of the infected fluid, antibiotics are a core component of management of&#xD;
      pleural infection[5] and are typically given intravenously in the first few days of treatment&#xD;
      until the condition is stabilized at which stage patients are shifted to oral antibiotics of&#xD;
      equivalent spectrum. In almost half of the cases of pleural infection, the choice of&#xD;
      antibiotics is entirely empirical due to low yield of microbiological tests on pleural fluid&#xD;
      in these cases[6]. International guidelines cite a minimum length of antibiotic course of&#xD;
      pleural infection of four weeks[5,7] with antibiotic courses typically lasting six weeks[8].&#xD;
      However, these recommendations are based on expert opinion with no robust evidence to support&#xD;
      such durations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RAPID (renal function, age, purulence, infection source and dietary factors) score has&#xD;
      recently been validated as a robust tool to predict 3-month mortality of patients with&#xD;
      pleural infection based on demographic and laboratory data (table 1)[4]. A low score (0-2) is&#xD;
      associated with 2-3% mortality, medium score (3-4) 9% mortality and high score (5-7) 30%&#xD;
      mortality at three months[9]. The utility for this score in clinical management is yet to be&#xD;
      determined and this study will attempt using this score to stratify lengths of antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment based on proposed risk of adverse outcomes as stipulated by the RAPID score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility and safety of prescribing shorter&#xD;
      courses of antibiotics (2-3 weeks) versus the standard longer courses (4-6 weeks) in&#xD;
      medically-treated patients with pleural infection at lower risk of mortality (RAPID score&#xD;
      0-4) who can be safely discharged home within 14 days of hospitalization and how this impacts&#xD;
      success of medical treatment.&#xD;

      Infection of the pleural space is serious condition that requires hospitalization, invasive&#xD;
      interventions and long courses of antibiotics. Treatment of pleural infection requires long&#xD;
      hospital admission with a median of 19 days and medical treatments fails requiring surgical&#xD;
      intervention in up to 30% of cases. The mortality from pleural infection is around 10% at 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides drainage of the infected fluid, antibiotics are a core component of management of&#xD;
      pleural infection and are typically given intravenously in the first few days of treatment&#xD;
      until the condition is stabilized at which stage patients are shifted to oral antibiotics of&#xD;
      equivalent spectrum. In almost half of the cases of pleural infection, the choice of&#xD;
      antibiotics is entirely empirical due to low yield of microbiological tests on pleural fluid&#xD;
      in these cases. International guidelines cite a minimum length of antibiotic course of&#xD;
      pleural infection of four weeks with antibiotic courses typically lasting six weeks[8].&#xD;
      However, these recommendations are based on expert opinion with no robust evidence to support&#xD;
      such durations. A recent trial compared a two-week versus a three-week antibiotic course for&#xD;
      parapneumonic pleural infections. The trial that concluded prematurely due to inability to&#xD;
      recruit to target sample size and found that the two regimens were equivalent in terms of&#xD;
      risk of failure of medical treatment. Besides being an underpowered study, the results are&#xD;
      only applicable to parapneumonic effusions but not primary pleural infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RAPID score has recently been validated as a robust tool to predict 3-month mortality of&#xD;
      patients with pleural infection based on demographic and laboratory data. A low score (0-2)&#xD;
      is associated with 2-3% mortality, medium score (3-4) 9% mortality and high score (5-7) 30%&#xD;
      mortality at three months. The utility for this score in clinical management is yet to be&#xD;
      determined and this study will attempt using this score to stratify lengths of antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment based on proposed risk of adverse outcomes as stipulated by the RAPID score. A&#xD;
      shorter antibiotic course that is as effective as the standard long course is desirable given&#xD;
      the common occurrence of side effects with antibiotic treatment. The presence of a robust&#xD;
      predictive score of outcome seems as an attractive tool to help stratify patients who can be&#xD;
      safely treated with shorter antibiotic courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility and safety of prescribing shorter&#xD;
      courses of antibiotics (2-3 weeks) versus the standard longer courses (4-6 weeks) in&#xD;
      medically-treated patients with pleural infection at lower risk of mortality (RAPID score&#xD;
      0-4) who can be safely discharged home within 14 days of hospitalization and how this impacts&#xD;
      success of medical treatment.&#xD;
