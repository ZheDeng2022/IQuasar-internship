  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most children with cancer survive because they are given intensive treatments, but&#xD;
      unfortunately, these treatments are associated with distressing symptoms. To address this&#xD;
      problem, we developed the Symptom Screening in Pediatrics Tool (SSPedi) so that children&#xD;
      receiving cancer treatments can communicate their bothersome symptoms, and Supportive care&#xD;
      Prioritization, Assessment and Recommendations for Kids (SPARK), a web-based application that&#xD;
      links identified symptoms to supportive care guidelines for symptom management. To establish&#xD;
      that these tools improve the lives of children newly diagnosed with cancer, we will conduct a&#xD;
      trial that randomizes 20 pediatric cancer institutions and measures the impact of three times&#xD;
      weekly symptom screening, symptom feedback to healthcare providers and the development of&#xD;
      care pathways for symptom management to improve total symptom burden, fatigue and quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aims 1 and 2: Among children with newly diagnosed cancer, to determine if symptom screening&#xD;
      and feedback to healthcare providers at least three times weekly and locally-adapted symptom&#xD;
      management care pathways, when compared to usual care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Improves overall self-reported symptom scores (total SSPedi score), fatigue&#xD;
      (PROMIS-Fatigue) and cancer-specific QoL (PedsQL 3.0 Acute Cancer Module) over 8 weeks&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Symptom screening and care pathways will improve symptoms, fatigue and QoL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Improves symptom documentation, increases provision of interventions for symptoms, and&#xD;
      reduces emergency department visits and unplanned clinic visits and hospitalizations over 8&#xD;
      weeks Hypotheses: Symptom screening and care pathways will increase symptom documentation and&#xD;
      provision of interventions for symptoms, and will reduce healthcare utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: As an exploratory aim, we will evaluate key elements of the intervention related to&#xD;
      the external validity and generalizability of the intervention effects using the RE-AIM&#xD;
      framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Strategy This is a cluster randomized trial including 20 pediatric oncology sites.&#xD;
      The coordinating center is The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada. Sites will be&#xD;
      randomized to either systematic symptom screening via SPARK with provision of symptom reports&#xD;
      to healthcare providers containing links to care pathways for symptom management&#xD;
      (intervention) or usual care (control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Methods Eligibility: We will include children with cancer who: (1) are 8-18 years of&#xD;
      age at enrollment (SSPedi is validated in this age range); (2) are English or&#xD;
      Spanish-speaking (all PROs are validated in these languages in this age range); (3) have any&#xD;
      newly diagnosed cancer; (4) have a plan for any chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery; and&#xD;
      (5) enroll within 28 days after treatment initiation. Exclusion criteria will be cognitive&#xD;
      disability (attending lower than second grade or equivalent) or visual impairment (cannot see&#xD;
      SPARK even with corrective lens).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: In this cluster randomized trial, we will randomize sites to either intervention&#xD;
      or control groups. At both intervention and control sites, we will enroll participants within&#xD;
      28 days after treatment initiation. Eligible participants will be identified by site&#xD;
      personnel and the study will be explained to them by trained research team members.&#xD;
      Participant capacity to consent will be assessed by the clinical or research team according&#xD;
      to institutional standards. After the study has been explained and sufficient time has been&#xD;
      provided to ensure all questions have been answered, informed consent and assent will be&#xD;
      obtained from participants and guardians as appropriate. For those who decline to contribute&#xD;
      PROs, they will be given the option to only participate in a retrospective chart review to&#xD;
      evaluate symptom documentation, intervention provision and healthcare utilization. Careful&#xD;
      tracking of all newly diagnosed patients by site research personnel will occur to determine&#xD;
      how many patients are approached and consented, and where possible, reasons for declining&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all enrolled participants who will be contributing PROs (excluding those only involved in&#xD;
      the retrospective chart review), a personal SPARK account will be created to allow SSPedi to&#xD;
      be completed and symptom results to be recorded. At the 10 intervention sites, site-specific&#xD;
      symptom management care pathways will be adapted from template care pathways for each of the&#xD;
      15 symptoms included in SSPedi. Enrolled participants will be prompted by text or email to&#xD;
      complete symptom screening three times weekly via SPARK with corresponding feedback sent to&#xD;
      their healthcare providers. Symptom reports will contain links to care pathways for symptom&#xD;
      management. Active intervention will last for eight weeks starting from the date of&#xD;
      enrollment. At the 10 control sites, participants will complete SSPedi to obtain the primary&#xD;
      outcome at weeks 0, 4 and 8 but the scores will not be revealed to providers and will not be&#xD;
      linked to care pathways. Usual care will be provided to participants at control sites and&#xD;
      thus, there will be no study-requested routine, systematic symptom screening, symptom&#xD;
      feedback to providers, or linkage to care pathways. If sites already routinely perform&#xD;
      systematic symptom screening or use care pathways for symptom management, these may be&#xD;
      continued but their use will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At both intervention and control sites, demographic information including age, sex, race,&#xD;
      ethnicity, diagnosis, cancer stage, family socioeconomic information and treatment plan will&#xD;
      be collected at enrollment. The following PROs will be obtained by trained research staff at&#xD;
      baseline, week 4 and week 8 for all participants: SSPedi, PROMIS Fatigue and the PedsQL 3.0&#xD;
      Acute Cancer Module (Aim 1). We will contact participants ahead of time to coordinate the&#xD;
      week 4 and 8 PROs so that they can be completed in person during hospitalizations or clinic&#xD;
      visits. If unable to arrange completion of these PROs in person, we will use their contact&#xD;
      information to complete the questionnaires by email, text or over the phone. Data from health&#xD;
      records (Aim 2) will be abstracted for all enrolled participants. Relapse and cancer&#xD;
      treatment received information will be collected at the end of the study.&#xD;

    <measure>Symptom Screening in Pediatrics Tool (SSPedi) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>SSPedi measures the degree to which 15 symptoms bothered the participant yesterday or today. Each symptom is scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all bothered) to 4 (extremely bothered). The total score ranges from 0 to 60 where higher numbers indicate more bothersome symptoms. The total SSPedi score is reliable, valid and responsive to change in children with cancer 8-18 years of age.(1)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pediatric Bank v2.0 - Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will be measured using PROMIS. PROMIS uses a T-score metric in which 50 is the mean of a relevant reference population and 10 is the standard deviation of that population. The recall period is the last 7 days and a higher score equals more fatigue. It is reliable and valid in children 8-18 years of age with cancer.(2)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PedsQL 3.0 Acute Cancer Module</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>This is a cancer-specific measure of quality of life. It assesses pain and hurt, nausea, procedural anxiety, treatment anxiety, worry, cognitive problems, perceived physical appearance and communication. The self-report 7-day recall version will be used. The minimum value on the scale is 0 and maximum value is 100. PedsQL uses reverse scoring thus a higher score indicates a better outcome. This measure is a multidimensional instrument that is reliable and valid in children with cancer.(3)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Documentation of symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Documentation of symptoms will be abstracted from the patients' health records. This outcome will be obtained with a one day window before and after the week 8 patient-reported outcome assessment.</description>

    <description>Participants enrolled at intervention sites will be prompted to complete symptom screening three times weekly via SPARK with corresponding feedback and links to symptom management care pathways sent to their healthcare providers.&#xD;
Symptom screening using SPARK can be performed at any time and as often as desired, but screening will be prompted three times weekly for eight weeks.&#xD;
Each day the participant completes symptom screening and has at least one severely bothersome symptom, the primary healthcare team will receive an email summarizing the symptom report and highlighting symptoms that are &quot;a lot&quot; or &quot;extremely&quot; bothersome.&#xD;
Upon study activation, we will work with each of the 10 intervention sites to develop site-specific, adapted care pathways that consider relevant work flows, institutional culture and available resources.</description>
