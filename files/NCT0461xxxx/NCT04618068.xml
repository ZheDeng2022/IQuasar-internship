      The study is a cross-sectional survey investigating the Prevalence of Different Stages of&#xD;
      Periodontal Diseases among a sample of Young Adult Obese Egyptian patients attending the oral&#xD;
      diagnosis clinic at faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University.&#xD;

      In recent years, research has focused on the relationship between periodontitis and systemic&#xD;
      disorders such as diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular diseases and&#xD;
      obesity. Obesity is the result of many disorders arising from several different causes,&#xD;
      including complex interactions among genetic, biochemical, neural and psychological factors&#xD;
      as well as environmental, social and economic factors. Moreover, obesity is considered itself&#xD;
      a risk factor for several diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      tumors and potentially for periodontal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity has a significant association with periodontitis in terms of body mass index (BMI),&#xD;
      waist-to-hip circumference ratio, body fat, and maximum oxygen consumption. The BMI has&#xD;
      always been considered a simple method for analysis of the nutritional status by world health&#xD;
      organization. In 2014, the world health organization (WHO) estimated that around 600 million&#xD;
      obese adults worldwide were obese and a further increase is expected in the future due to&#xD;
      increased consumption of high-calorie diets and a sedentary lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A bidirectional relationship links metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes or obesity and&#xD;
      periodontitis The common soil between these chronic conditions is likely to be systemic,&#xD;
      low-grade inflammation: dental plaque releases bioactive products, which in turn stimulate&#xD;
      host responses at the gingival and systemic level, promoting the release of inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines. These mediators are implicated in insulin resistance, impaired Î²-cell function,&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction, driving diabetes onset and the accelerating atherosclerosis marking&#xD;
      it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association between obesity and periodontitis is one of the most recent fields of&#xD;
      research in periodontal medicine and the possible underlying biological mechanisms remain&#xD;
      unclear. Since then, the hypothesis that obesity is a risk factor for periodontitis has been&#xD;
      evidenced by several epidemiological studies. The visceral adipose tissue has been shown to&#xD;
      act as an organ that secretes important bioactive substances termed adipocytokines, including&#xD;
      tumor necrosis factor alpha, which may affect periodontal disease pathogenesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study has shown that in a population young adults, tumor necrosis factor levels in&#xD;
      gingival crevicular fluid correlate with individuals with BMI greater than forty. The authors&#xD;
      suggested that obesity is type of low grade systemic inflammatory disease affecting&#xD;
      periodontal disease progression. The systemic inflammation associated with obesity may&#xD;
      increase susceptibility to chronic infectious diseases, which may explain how obesity would&#xD;
      affect the development of periodontal diseases. However, whether obesity and overweight are&#xD;
      associated with periodontitis is still under debate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many clinical studies have shown that overweight status, obesity, weight gain, and increased&#xD;
      waist circumference are risk factors for the development of periodontitis or the worsening of&#xD;
      periodontal status. Patients presenting moderate and severe periodontal disease have been&#xD;
      found to produce higher systemic levels of inflammatory and immune markers. Treatment of&#xD;
      periodontal disease can reduce these markers. Since the first report suggesting in a rat&#xD;
      models existence of a possible relation between obesity and periodontal disease in 1977, only&#xD;
      21 years later, the first human study on the Japanese population, revealing that obese&#xD;
      subjects showed a probability of suffering from periodontitis 8.6 times greater than&#xD;
      non-obese ones.&#xD;

        Dental patients will be recruited in a consecutive manner from the outpatient Diagnostic&#xD;
        center, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University. Medical history will be taken, thorough&#xD;
        oral examination will be done, and a full questionnaire will be filled for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The questionnaire will be filled through a face-to-face personal interview with the patient&#xD;
        using simple, short, easily comprehended questions. It will include a section for&#xD;
        demographic information of age, sex, social and educational of the patient. It will include&#xD;
        questions about medical condition, habits of trauma, smoking and its frequency.&#xD;
