    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I dose-finding study of FT538 as monotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)&#xD;
      and in combination with monoclonal antibodies in multiple myeloma (MM). The study will&#xD;
      consist of a dose-escalation stage and an expansion stage where participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      into indication-specific cohorts.&#xD;
