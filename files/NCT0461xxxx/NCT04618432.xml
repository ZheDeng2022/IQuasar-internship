      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It may be in the interest of the NIDCD Clinical Research Program (CRP) to collect clinical&#xD;
      data or specimens generated in the diagnosis and treatment of head and neck or communication&#xD;
      disorders and to evaluate patients to determine candidacy for intramural clinical studies.&#xD;
      This protocol will provide the administrative vehicle to enable the evaluation and provision&#xD;
      of clinical care for patients with head and neck and communication disorders by the NIDCD&#xD;
      CRP, Clinical Center, and consult services. No investigational therapies will be administered&#xD;
      in this&#xD;
&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
