    <textblock>
      Sponsor is conducting this post market clinical study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of its PROFEMUR® Preserve Classic Femoral Stem. This type of study is required&#xD;
      by regulatory authorities for all devices that have been approved in Europe (EU) to evaluate&#xD;
      the medium and long-term clinical evidence. This study has been designed in accordance with&#xD;
      MEDDEV2.12/2 (European Medical Device Vigilance System) rev2 and ISO (International&#xD;
      Organization of Standardization) 14155:2011 guidelines.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Component Survivorship</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>To estimate component survivorship of the PROFEMUR® Preserve Classic Femoral Stem at 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 years.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>HOOS Functional Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>Complete characterization (mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation) of functional scores as assessed by the Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS), which ranges from 0 to 100 with a score of 0 indicating worst hip symptoms and 100 indicating no hip symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EQ-5D-5L Functional Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>Complete characterization (mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation) of functional scores as assessed by EQ-5D-5L. This functional score data will be summarized over 5 domains, namely, mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each domain has 5 levels: no problems, slight problem, moderate problem, severe problem, inability to perform the activity. With no problems being the best outcome and inability to perform the activity being worst outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Satisfaction as assessed by Forgotten Joint Score</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>To determine proportion of subjects being satisfied and level of their satisfaction as assessed by the Forgotten Joint Score (FJS). The study will be reporting forgotten joint score measures for the assessment of joint-specific patient reported outcomes. The questions focus on the patients' awareness of the implanted joint in everyday life or any unintended perception of a joint.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Satisfaction as assessed by Satisfaction Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>To determine proportion of subjects being satisfied and level of their satisfaction as assessed by the Satisfaction Survey, consisting of questions asked about how satisfied the patient is with the new implant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Radiolucencies</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the presence of radiolucencies surrounding implanted components</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess subject safety</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>To assess safety of the PROFEMUR® Preserve Classic Femoral Stem through device-related adverse event findings and/or adverse device effects during follow-up visits.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess device tolerability within subject</measure>
