  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: CBD is commonly being used as an over-the-counter treatment for arthritis-related&#xD;
      pain, however no clinical trial has been performed to establish efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: CBD is more effective than placebo for relieving pain and improving&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes for thumb basal joint arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: The study design with be a double-blind, randomized controlled trial with&#xD;
      crossover. Treatment will be blinded to the subjects and investigators. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned 2 weeks of the CBD or control and then crossover to the other condition for&#xD;
      2 additional weeks. Patients will apply the cream at the thumb base twice daily for 1 hour.&#xD;
      Subjects will be advised to observe for physiologic changes, skin changes, or other adverse&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;

      Study Population: 40 subjects with presenting with thumb basal joint arthritis over the age&#xD;
      of 18 will be recruited from the UVA Hand Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants: This will be a single-site study&#xD;
      conducted at the UVA Hand Center at the University of Virginia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Study Intervention: The study design will be a double-blind randomized control&#xD;
      trial with crossover. Treatment will be blinded to the subjects and investigators. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned 2 weeks of the case (CBD) or control cream and then crossover to&#xD;
      the other cream for 2 more weeks. Patients will apply the topical cream at their thumb basal&#xD;
      joint one time daily for 1 hour. The subjects will be advised to observe for physiologic&#xD;
      changes, skin changes, or other adverse effects. If mild to serious adverse events are&#xD;
      noticed, the creams will be removed immediately and appropriate care and observation will be&#xD;
      taken. Each condition will last for 2 weeks and then subjects will be contacted by the study&#xD;
      coordinator to facilitate crossover into the other condition. To capture any delayed-onset&#xD;
      adverse events, including those related to skin changes that might develop after the drug is&#xD;
      discontinued, subjects will attend a follow-up visit seven (7) days following the last dose&#xD;
      of investigational cream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: This study will last one year from the beginning of subject recruitment to&#xD;
      data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration: Subjects will be enrolled in this study for approximately five (5)&#xD;
      weeks from Screening until the final Study Visit.&#xD;

    <description>PROMIS-29 will measure health-related quality of life and is a validated, 29 question survey divided into seven sub-domains of function including physical functioning, social function, pain interference, pain intensity, sleep, depression, and anxiety, where a higher score indicates more pain interference.</description>

    <time_frame>Every 2 weeks during intervention and 1 week washout, up to 5 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Reported Outcome Information System (PROMIS) Upper Extremity Computer Adaptive Test (CAT) is a computerized assessment measuring the physical function of the upper extremity. It is scored using a T-score, and the average is 50 for the U.S. population. In a given PROMIS, a T-score above 50 represents more of the measured variable than the average. For this variable, a T-score above 50 indicates greater physical function than the average population.</description>

    <time_frame>Every 2 weeks during intervention and 1 week washout, up to 5 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Kapandji score (ranging 0 to 10) is validated measures in past studies as outcomes for hand disability. The Kapandji score is a tool useful for assessing the opposition of the thumb, based on where on their hand the patient is able to touch with the tip of their thumb. A score of 0 indicates no opposition, a score of 10 indicates maximal opposition.</description>
