  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of thyroid function in pregnancy has been object of several guidelines in the&#xD;
      last years. Normal thyroid function reduces prenatal and post-natal risks and gestational&#xD;
      complaints. Trimester specific reference values of thyroid hormones and thyroid stimulating&#xD;
      hormone (TSH) are available for selected geographic population but its are not yet are&#xD;
      available in our country. Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is the most frequent autoimmune&#xD;
      thyroid disease which can induce thyroid dysfunction, mainly sub-clinical hypothyroidism. Due&#xD;
      to the large incidence in women HT and its potential link with thyroid dysfunction this&#xD;
      disease could be search and monitored before pregnancy. Anyway a strong recommendation is to&#xD;
      test TSH levels in all patients seeking pregnancy at risk for thyroid dysfunction for a&#xD;
      history or current symptoms/signs of thyroid dysfunction, known positivity od thyroid&#xD;
      autoimmunity or goiter, a history of neck radiation, age &gt;30 years, diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      previous infertility or pregnant loss, morbid obesity, living in area of moderate-severe&#xD;
      iodine deficiency or recent administration of drugs/substance interfering with thyroid&#xD;
      function.&#xD;

      The aim of the study was to retrospectively evaluate from 2011 (data of publication of the&#xD;
      first American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines for thyroid dysfunction in pregnancy) to&#xD;
      now medical record of the a secondary level endocrine unit to verify the adherence to&#xD;
      guidelines in the management of thyroid function in pregnant women with HT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators search&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the adherence to clinical and biochemical endocrine evaluations before conception&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the use (correct/un-correct) of L-T4 intervention and its monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the difference in thyroid function control between women with a fix increment of- L-T4&#xD;
           posology (25 mcg/week more for each 2 kg increment in body weight) after the initial&#xD;
           L-T4 adjustment or prescription&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. the clinical and biochemical endocrine evaluation 1-2 months after delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. the outcome of pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. the e-mail up-to-date survey on current of off-springs health&#xD;
