      The objective is to compare the care including the solution of ambient sensory biofeedback&#xD;
      &quot;Inner Garden&quot;, compared to the care without this solution, on the regulation of behavioral&#xD;
      disorders during a crisis requiring to take the child out of group care. The nursing support&#xD;
      with the &quot;Inner Garden&quot; tool in three care units will be compared with the practice in six&#xD;
      other units not equipped with this tool.&#xD;

      Psychiatric illnesses affect more than one person in five each year. In France, the majority&#xD;
      of disorders among minors under the care of child psychiatry in full or part-time&#xD;
      hospitalization are disorders of psychological development (32%) and behavioural and&#xD;
      emotional disorders (24.6%). Hospitalisation is reserved for the most complex acute crisis&#xD;
      situations, as well as for children who need to be cared for by a multidisciplinary team&#xD;
      several times a week to support their psychological development. In our study, the&#xD;
      investigators focus on one of the clinical manifestations regularly present: the state of&#xD;
      agitation when its intensity is moderate to severe. &quot;The state of agitation is defined as a&#xD;
      psychic, motor and relational behavioural disorder that leads to a reaction of intolerance on&#xD;
      the part of people in the entourage&quot;. The care teams will then implement care actions that&#xD;
      will be a graduated response adapted to the intensity of these states of agitation. In&#xD;
      addition to the support provided by a caregiver, the investigators propose to use the &quot;Inner&#xD;
      Garden&quot; system developed in 2014 at the laboratory of National Institute for Research in&#xD;
      Digital Science and Technology in Bordeaux. It is an interactive Zen garden allowing to&#xD;
      present feedback (topographical, physiological) under different sensory modalities.&#xD;

    <description>This questionnaire measures the perception of adults close to children about their ability to regulate their emotions in everyday life. It proposes 24 behavioural statements that refer to emotional responses and reactions of joy, anger, empathy with peers and adults, frustration, and activity transitions. For each statement, the adult rates the frequency of the behaviour on a 4-point Likert scale: &quot;never&quot;, &quot;sometimes&quot;, &quot;often&quot;, &quot;almost always&quot;.</description>
