      Management protocol of patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      A day before surgery All the patients included in the study will be explained in detail about&#xD;
      the purpose of the study, and the need, benefits, and risks of arterial cannulation and the&#xD;
      purpose of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained during the pre-anaesthetic checkup. Patients will&#xD;
      be asked to remain nil per oral as per standard American Society of Anesthesiologists&#xD;
      guidelines. Premedication will be advised as per institutional protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-anaesthetic room After shifting from the ward to the pre-anaesthetic room, an intravenous&#xD;
      line will be secured with an 18 or 20 G cannula in the dominant hand and baseline heart rate,&#xD;
      blood pressure and oxygen saturation will be recorded. The patient will then be shifted to&#xD;
      the operation theatre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operation theatre After shifting to the operating table, a pulse oximeter, a non-invasive&#xD;
      blood pressure monitor, and an electrocardiogram monitor will be attached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial pressure transducer and tubings will be flushed with normal saline and will be kept&#xD;
      ready.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Barbeaue test will be done using pulse oximetry in the thumb of the non-dominant hand to&#xD;
      assess the type of Ulnopalmar arch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anaesthesia faculty/resident/assistant not involved in the study will then be asked to&#xD;
      open an opaque, sealed envelope to decide the technique to be used for cannulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radial artery cannulation Radial artery catheterisation will be done by the investigating&#xD;
      anaesthesiology resident under the supervision of the consultant anaesthesiologist in the&#xD;
      operation theatres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anaesthesia resident performing arterial cannulation must have placed at least 20 radial&#xD;
      arterial catheters by palpation method and 20 using USG-guided DNTP method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's arm will be slightly abducted (less than 90 degrees) from the body and placed&#xD;
      on an arm board and the wrist will be placed in an extended position by placing a towel roll&#xD;
      making an approximately 60-degrees angle with the forearm. The wrist will be then stabilised&#xD;
      in this position by taping it to the arm board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To maintain asepsis, the wrist will be then prepped with povidone Iodine 10%. Surgical&#xD;
      gloves, sterile drapes, and a sterile plastic sheath for USG-guided technique will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigating resident will sit on a chair of a comfortable height facing the patient's&#xD;
      wrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To anaesthetise the cannulation site, 1 ml of 2% lidocaine will be injected with a 25-gauge&#xD;
      needle, approximately 3 cm proximal to the distal wrist crease after wiping off the povidone&#xD;
      iodine with a sterile gauge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 20-Gauge intravenous catheter of the same trademark will be used to catheterise the radial&#xD;
      artery in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The timer (SEIKOSHA stopwatch, Seikosha co. ltd, Japan) will be started once the USG-probe is&#xD;
      placed on the prepped wrist or when the operator begins palpation of the radial pulse in the&#xD;
      USG-guided and palpation techniques, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after successful cannulation, an assistant will attach the pressure monitoring&#xD;
      tubing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The timer will be immediately stopped once the arterial waveform appears on the monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If after 300 seconds, the radial artery is not cannulated, the procedure will be aborted, and&#xD;
      documented as &quot;failure to cannulate.&quot; A senior anaesthesiologist will then perform arterial&#xD;
      cannulation using any method at his/her discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following data will be collected Systolic and diastolic blood pressure before cannulation&#xD;
      using NIBP First pass success of radial cannula placement Number of cannulae used Number of&#xD;
      skin punctures Number of redirections Time for successful cannulation (in secs)&#xD;
&#xD;
      USG guided DNTP technique USG machine (Sonosite M-Turbo, Fujifilm Sonosite Inc. USA) with a&#xD;
      linear probe (6-13 MHz) will be used, using the vascular mode, optimal gain, and autofocus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A short-axis out-of-plane view of the radial artery will be obtained and kept at 1.5 cm depth&#xD;
      aligned with the central line of the USG probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The needle and catheter will be advanced through the skin at an angle of 45 to 60 degrees&#xD;
      until the hyperechoic needle tip is seen on the ultrasound image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultrasound probe will then be moved proximally along the forearm and away from the needle&#xD;
      insertion point until the needle tip disappears from the ultrasound image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The needle and catheter will then be advanced a few millimeters until the needle tip is seen&#xD;
      again on the ultrasound image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This stepwise process will be repeated several times until the needle tip is visualised in&#xD;
      the lumen of the radial artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this point, the angle of approach will be decreased and the same process shall be&#xD;
      continued, keeping the needle tip in the center of the arterial lumen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The needle and catheter assembly will be advanced stepwise for approximately 3 to 5mm inside&#xD;
      the arterial lumen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the needle is advanced through the posterior vessel wall, the operator will be allowed to&#xD;
      withdraw the needle slightly and advance again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After around 3 to 5mm of the needle is advanced, the catheter will then be threaded off the&#xD;
      needle and the pressure-monitoring tubing will be immediately attached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palpation method The investigating resident will palpate the radial arterial pulse with the&#xD;
      non-dominant hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The needle and catheter assembly will be advanced towards the radial artery at a 15° to 30°&#xD;
      angle until a flashback of blood is observed in the needle hub.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once flash-back of blood appears in the hub, the needle angle will be decreased slightly and&#xD;
      the catheter will be advanced about 3 to 5mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the operator suspects puncture of the posterior arterial wall, the cannula will then be&#xD;
      gradually withdrawn such that the cannula tip will be in the arterial lumen. The intraluminal&#xD;
      position of the catheter will be ensured by blood in the catheter lumen as the needle is&#xD;
      being withdrawn. The needle angle will then be decreased slightly and the catheter will be&#xD;
      advanced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If blood continues to flow into the hub, the catheter will be threaded off the needle and&#xD;
      then the pressure-monitoring tubing will be attached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new cannula will be used if the cannula hub is full of blood but the artery is not&#xD;
      cannulated successfully or there is obvious catheter kinking or shearing during redirections&#xD;
      or skin punctures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After radial artery cannulation Once radial artery cannulation is complete, the cannula will&#xD;
      be secured with adhesive tape and injection port will be covered with an opaque dressing to&#xD;
      prevent inadvertent intra-arterial injection of drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The wrist will then be placed in a neutral position with the forearm placed either parallel&#xD;
      to the torso or abducted and secured on an arm board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine preoxygenation, anaesthesia induction, patient positioning, and maintenance of&#xD;
      anaesthesia will be done as per standard institutional practice.&#xD;
