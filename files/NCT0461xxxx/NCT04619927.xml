      Rationale: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common presentation of atherosclerosis. For&#xD;
      the prevention of adverse events related to arterial thrombosis in PAD patients, clopidogrel&#xD;
      is recommended. Clopidogrel in itself is inactive and needs to be metabolized by cytochrome&#xD;
      P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) into the active metabolite. About 30% of PAD patients receiving&#xD;
      clopidogrel is carrying one or two CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele(s) and do not or to a&#xD;
      limited extent convert the prodrug into its active metabolites, and are therefore at&#xD;
      increased risk of adverse clinical events related to arterial thrombosis. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      genotype-guided prescription of antithrombotic treatment reduces adverse clinical events&#xD;
      related to arterial thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary aim of the GENPAD study is to evaluate the ability of genotype-guided&#xD;
      antithrombotic treatment to reduce adverse clinical events related to arterial thrombosis in&#xD;
      PAD patients. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the ability of genotype-guided&#xD;
      antithrombotic treatment to reduce the separate elements of the primary composite outcome and&#xD;
      to assess the risk of clinically relevant bleedings in patients allocated to the&#xD;
      genotype-guided antiplatelet treatment versus standard clopidogrel prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A randomized, controlled, open label, multicenter trial. Study population:&#xD;
      Patients (n=2276) with PAD consulting a vascular surgeon for diagnosis and/or treatment,&#xD;
      receiving clopidogrel according to the guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Testing for carriage of the CYP2C19*2 and *3 loss-of-function alleles, followed&#xD;
      by a genotype guided antithrombotic treatment with either clopidogrel 75mg once daily (normal&#xD;
      metabolizers), clopidogrel 75mg twice daily (intermediate metabolizers), or low-dose&#xD;
      rivaroxaban plus acetylsalicylic acid (poor metabolizers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparator: All patients receive clopidogrel 75mg once daily without pharmacogenetic&#xD;
      guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary combined outcome is the occurrence of adverse&#xD;
      clinical events related to arterial thrombosis at 24 months. The occurrence of major adverse&#xD;
      cardiovascular events, major adverse limb events, death and clinically relevant bleedings are&#xD;
      the secondary endpoints.&#xD;

      Rationale: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common presentation of atherosclerosis,&#xD;
      resulting in intermittent claudication, pain at rest or gangrene. For the prevention of&#xD;
      adverse events related to arterial thrombosis in PAD patients, clopidogrel is recommended.&#xD;
      Clopidogrel in itself is inactive and needs to be metabolized by cytochrome P450 2C19&#xD;
      (CYP2C19) into the active metabolite. About 30% of PAD patients receiving clopidogrel is&#xD;
      carrying one or two CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele(s) and do not or to a limited extent&#xD;
      convert the prodrug into its active metabolites, and are therefore at increased risk of&#xD;
      adverse clinical events related to arterial thrombosis and subsequent cardiovascular death.&#xD;
      We hypothesize that genotype-guided prescription of antithrombotic treatment reduces adverse&#xD;
      clinical events related to arterial thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary aim of the GENPAD study is to evaluate the ability of genotype-guided&#xD;
      antithrombotic treatment to reduce adverse clinical events related to arterial thrombosis in&#xD;
      PAD patients. Adverse clinical events of interest are major adverse cardiovascular events&#xD;
      (myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic arrack), major adverse limb events&#xD;
      (acute/chronic limb ischemia of peripheral vascular intervention including amputation) and&#xD;
      death. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the ability of genotype-guided antithrombotic&#xD;
      treatment to reduce the separate elements of the primary composite outcome and to assess the&#xD;
      risk of clinically relevant bleedings in patients allocated to the genotype-guided&#xD;
      antiplatelet treatment versus standard clopidogrel prescription. Other objectives are to&#xD;
      evaluate cost-effectiveness, to explore health state scores and health-related quality of&#xD;
      life between study groups and metabolizer states and to set-up a biobank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A randomized, controlled, open label, multicenter trial. Study population:&#xD;
      Patients (n=2276) with PAD consulting a vascular surgeon for diagnosis and/or treatment,&#xD;
      receiving clopidogrel according to the guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Testing for carriage of the CYP2C19*2 and *3 loss-of-function alleles, followed&#xD;
      by a genotype guided antithrombotic treatment with either clopidogrel 75mg once daily (normal&#xD;
      metabolizers), clopidogrel 75mg twice daily (intermediate metabolizers), or low-dose&#xD;
      rivaroxaban plus acetylsalicylic acid (poor metabolizers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparator: All patients receive clopidogrel 75mg once daily without pharmacogenetic&#xD;
      guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary combined outcome is the occurrence of adverse&#xD;
      clinical events related to arterial thrombosis at 24 months. The occurrence of major adverse&#xD;
      cardiovascular events, major adverse limb events, death and clinically relevant bleedings are&#xD;
      the secondary endpoints. Health state, quality of life and medical consumption will be&#xD;
      measured with validated questionnaire. Questionnaires will be used to assess which&#xD;
      antithrombotic treatment the participant is receiving during follow-up, medication adherence&#xD;
      and the occurrence of extramural adverse events at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Participants will visit the hospital once for informed consent procedure, blood&#xD;
      sample withdrawal and/or buccal sample collection This visit will be combined with a routine&#xD;
      visit to the vascular surgeon or vascular laboratory. Patients might experience some&#xD;
      discomfort while taking blood samples and buccal sample collection for a short amount of&#xD;
      time. The follow-up of participants will range from 6 months (minimum) to 36 months&#xD;
      (maximum). Participants are sent questionnaires at baseline and at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months,&#xD;
      dependent on the duration of their follow-up. Completing the questionnaires will take&#xD;
      approximately 30 minutes. Risks regarding the study are negligible and consist of the&#xD;
      possible adverse events related to doubling the daily dose of clopidogrel or related to&#xD;
      rivaroxaban and acetylsalicylic acid.&#xD;

    <description>Health state score measured by the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire five-level (EQ-5D-5L) will be determined at baseline and during follow-up.

The validated Dutch tariff for the EQ-5D-5L will convert the descriptive score to a continuous score (range -1 to 1) in which a higher value represents a better health state than a lower value..</description>

    <description>Health-related quality of life measured by the abbreviated World Health Organization Quality of life questionnaire (WHOQoL-Bref) will be determined at baseline and during follow-up. Patients score their quality of life with 26 questions on 4 domains (physical, psychological, social relationships and environment). Each question can be answered by 1 to 5. Scores are scaled in a positive direction (i.e. higher scores denote higher quality of life). The mean score of individual items within each domain, multiplied by 4, represents the domain score (range 4 to 20). The mean of the domain scores is the health-related quality of life score (range 4 to 20).</description>
