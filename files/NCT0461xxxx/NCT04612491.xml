      This study is designed to determine if having a seperate in-office pre-operative consultation&#xD;
      with the dermatologist before having a dermatologic procedure has any effect on patient&#xD;
      anxiety levels and satisfaction following the procedure. The goal of the study is to help us&#xD;
      understand if pre-operative consultation is beneficial to patients to reduce anxiety and&#xD;
      increase satisfaction following the procedure.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The score on the PSQ-18 survey following the Mohs procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQ-18 (aka patient satisfaction questionaire-18) is a validated assessment tool developed to measure holistic patient satisfaction with the aspects of clinical care (assessing six domains of patient satisfaction: technical quality, interpersonal manner, communication, financial aspects of care, accessibility of care and time spent with the physician), and by virtue of its brevity (18 questions taking an average of 3-4 minutes to complete) has great utility for measuring patient satisfaction in the clinical setting. Each question ranges from 1-5. Lower scores are better.&#xD;
The primary null hypothesis for this study is that mean PSQ-18 survey scores do not differ between patients receiving pre-operative consultation versus those not receiving this intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient anxiety as measured on the 10-point VAS scale for anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS is a horizontal line with a scale ranging from &quot;no anxiety at all&quot; to &quot;extremely anxious.&quot; By measuring the position of the patient's response on the line, a score out of 10 will be generated. The VAS for anxiety will be administered to enrolled patients at three time points: randomization (consent visit), pre-operatively on day of Mohs surgery and post-operatively on the day of the Mohs surgical procedure.</description>
