  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Improvement in clinical care has resulted in longer life expectancy of children&#xD;
      with intestinal failure (IF). However, recent data indicate that their body composition (BC)&#xD;
      is abnormal with a relatively high fat mass (FM) and low fat free mass (FFM). Abnormal BC is&#xD;
      linked to poor prognosis and increased length of hospital stay; yet BC is not assessed in&#xD;
      pediatric clinical practice. Instead, growth charts which lack sensitivity to detect changes&#xD;
      in BC are used. Physical activity (PA) is the most important predictor of FFM and increased&#xD;
      PA contributes to decreased FM. Decreased PA in childhood is associated with increased FM and&#xD;
      decreased FFM which are linked to diabetes and cardiovascular disease in adulthood.&#xD;
      Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) is considered the reference method for measuring BC in&#xD;
      the clinical setting but it is expensive and not suitable for routine use. Bioelectrical&#xD;
      Impedance Analysis (BIA) on the other hand is relatively inexpensive and non-invasive but&#xD;
      needs to be validated for use in patients with IF. Objectives: 1) validate BIA against DXA as&#xD;
      a clinical tool for monitoring changes in BC in children with IF, 2) quantify PA levels using&#xD;
      activity counts from accelerometers and 3) assess strength. Design: 1-18 years, with IF&#xD;
      followed by the intestinal rehabilitation program at SickKids. All subjects receiving a DXA&#xD;
      for routine clinical monitoring are eligible. BIA and muscle strength will be measured in&#xD;
      clinic. Demographic data and IF related factors including height, weight, PN prescription,&#xD;
      age, diagnosis, bowel length and length of time off PN for those who have achieved enteral&#xD;
      autonomy will be obtained. DXA measurement will be done by Diagnostic Imaging at SickKids.&#xD;
      Patients will be fitted with an accelerometer to be worn for 7 days. Statistics: Differences&#xD;
      between sexes will be assessed by t test. Relationship between PA and BC, and BC and muscular&#xD;
      strength will be assessed by linear regression analysis. Agreement between DXA and BIA will&#xD;
      be assessed using a Bland-Altman test. Significance will be set at p&lt;0.05. Significance: This&#xD;
      study has the potential to establish BIA as a convenient clinical tool to assess BC and&#xD;
      provide a more accurate basis for nutritional and PA prescriptions to optimize long-term&#xD;
      outcomes and quality of life in IF patients.&#xD;

      METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with IF will be recruited from patients followed by our multidisciplinary&#xD;
      intestinal rehabilitation program at SickKids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: patients who are wheelchair bound or non-weight bearing, those unwilling&#xD;
      to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An annual DXA is ordered for all our patients beginning at 1-year of age as part of routine&#xD;
      clinical monitoring. On the day of the scheduled DXA, FFM using BIA, FM using Skinfolds and&#xD;
      muscle strength will be measured in clinic. After DXA measurement, patients will be fitted&#xD;
      with an accelerometer to be worn for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body composition: 3 methods - BIA, Skinfolds &amp; DXA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole body and segmental BIA (leg, trunk and arm) will be taken on the right side of the body&#xD;
      using a fixed frequency analyzer (50kHz) (BIA model 101A: RJL Systems). Resistance (R) and&#xD;
      reactance (Xc) measurements will be made using 4-terminal bioelectrical impedance analyzer&#xD;
      according to the manufacturer's recommendations after 10 hour overnight fasting for patients&#xD;
      on enteral nutrition. Three readings R and Xc (in) will be taken from each subject. Patients&#xD;
      on parenteral nutrition (PN) will be prescribed a standard fluid intake of 130 mls/kg and be&#xD;
      cycled off PN for 3 hrs before measurement of BC. Body composition will also be assessed by&#xD;
      BIA in clinic and DXA (GE-Lunar DPS Pro (EG Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA), at the Radiology&#xD;
      Department, SickKids as part of routine annual clinical monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four SF thicknesses (triceps, biceps, subscapular, and super iliac) will measured to the&#xD;
      nearest 1mm with a Harpenden caliper to obtain estimates of fat mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric &amp; IF related factors: Data will be collected on PN prescription, % of calories&#xD;
      on PN and enteral nutrition, number of months weaned of PN (if off PN), age, sex, diagnosis,&#xD;
      weight and height.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity level:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity will be measured by accelerometry using the Actigraph GT3X accelerometer&#xD;
      for measuring activity counts. It provides quantitative information regarding vertical&#xD;
      acceleration of the trunk, and lower body parts at specified time intervals and can be used&#xD;
      to evaluate frequency, intensity and duration of PA. Their small size and robust design make&#xD;
      them an excellent alternative for use in children. They are less burdensome relative to heart&#xD;
      rate monitors and capable of detecting the intermittent activity patterns characteristic of&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to wear the accelerometer for 7 consecutive days, including two&#xD;
      weekend days during waking hours except when participating in water related activities (e.g.,&#xD;
      showering, swimming). The accelerometer will be worn on an elastic belt on the right hip,&#xD;
      above the iliac crest. Each subject will receive a call by a research coordinator to remind&#xD;
      them to wear the monitor. Subjects will also be given a handout that will include common&#xD;
      solutions to potential barriers for wearing the monitor along with a prepaid envelope to&#xD;
      return the accelerometer at the completion of the 7 days. Data from the accelerometers will&#xD;
      be downloaded and analyzed with the manufacturer's software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle strength&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, objective measures will be used to assess both functional strength and&#xD;
      specific muscle strength of the participants. The Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor&#xD;
      Proficiency-2 (BOT-2) is norm referenced and designed to measure gross and fine motor skills&#xD;
      in children and youth 4-21 years of age. It is a widely accepted test with a reliable and&#xD;
      efficient measure of motor proficiency. The strength subtest will be utilized in this study&#xD;
      and is designed to measure functional strength. Children will be tested on their grip&#xD;
      strength using a Jamar 5030J1 dynamometer. Specific muscle strength of select arm and leg&#xD;
      muscles will also be measured clinically by a physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient with intestinal failure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with IF will undergo all tests as described above. Before clinic visit, patients&#xD;
      will be contacted by the person preparing for clinic (a study team member) and the study will&#xD;
      be introduced to the parents or child by a member of the health care team. If parents are&#xD;
      interested, the study will be further explained in clinic and any questions answered by a&#xD;
      study team member. The same person will obtain informed consent/assent (study team member but&#xD;
      not a member of the health care team) Patients will be recruited in clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with IF followed by the GIFT team at the hospital and aged 1-18 years will be&#xD;
      eligible to participate except those who are wheel chair bound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy control participants will be recruited by posting flyers in common areas at the&#xD;
      Hospital for Sick Children and the PGCRL. Contact information for the study team member&#xD;
      accepting enquire will be included on the flyer. These postings will be negotiated through&#xD;
      Public Affairs. Healthy controls will also be recruited through families of patients with IF&#xD;
      and children of staff members and other colleagues at the Hospital for Sick Children. Two&#xD;
      healthy controls will be recruited for each case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy controls will be age, race and sex matched. Age will be matched within ±2 months for&#xD;
      subjects between 1-3 years and within ±6 month for those 4 years and above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both IF patents and controls will be fitted with an accelerometer and sent home to wear it&#xD;
      for 7 days. A stamped and addressed envelope will be given to mail the accelerometer back to&#xD;
      the hospital for those patient who live outside of the GTA. For those residing within the&#xD;
      GTA, the accelerometers will be picked up from their homes or an arranged location by study&#xD;
      team members.&#xD;
