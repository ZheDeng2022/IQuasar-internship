        ≥5minute of seated rest, with a single repeat permitted to assess eligibility, if needed,&#xD;
        at each of these 2 visits: For subjects with SBP ≥160 mm Hg or DBP ≥100 mm Hg, the period&#xD;
        between Screening and Day 1 must be used to refine the doses of the agents used for&#xD;
        management of blood pressure with the aim to have stable BP on Day 1;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        - For participants in Group 5 on Dialysis only: Hemodynamic instability during or at the&#xD;
        conclusion of dialysis during the 2 weeks prior to dosing, as marked by symptomatic&#xD;
        hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Criteria for Dosing on Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants will progress to dosing on Day 1 provided they have satisfied all the&#xD;
        following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In women of childbearing potential, urine pregnancy test on Day -1 is negative;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 only: Approval from the sponsor must be obtained before&#xD;
             proceeding with dosing participants in either Cohort 1 or Cohort 2;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cohorts 2-5 only: Participants must have measurement on Day 1 of SBP &lt;160 mm Hg and&#xD;
             DBP &lt;100 mm Hg; A single repeat assessment is permitted, to confirm that the above&#xD;
             criterion is met [and in such cases, the repeat assessment overrides initial results].&#xD;
