      Objective of Clinical Trial: To test, in a blinded study the bioavailability of Genepro&#xD;
      Generation 3 (GEN3) Protein as compared to whey protein. This study is intended to show the&#xD;
      equivalent value of Genepro Gen3 as compared to whey protein (1scoop (12g) Genepro Generation&#xD;
      3 (GEN3) compared to 30g serving of whey protein). Total Serum Protein levels will be tested&#xD;
      every other week to evaluate blood protein levels in each participant&#xD;

&#xD;
      Objective of Clinical Trial: To test, in a blinded study the bioavailability of Genepro&#xD;
      Generation 3 (GEN3) Protein as compared to whey protein. This study is intended to show the&#xD;
      equivalent value of Genepro Gen3 as compared to whey protein (1scoop (12g) Genepro Generation&#xD;
      3 (GEN3) compared to 30g serving of whey protein). Total Serum Protein levels will be tested&#xD;
      every other week to evaluate blood protein levels in each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters: This study encompasses a 6-week program that follows 40 gastric bypass patients&#xD;
      that have undergone weight loss surgery. We will establish a baseline blood analysis prior to&#xD;
      the start of the study and subsequently we will take bi-weekly blood work to chart and&#xD;
      register the findings (weeks 2, 4 and 6). For this study we will only be doing the bi-weekly&#xD;
      analysis on blood protein levels by utilizing Spectrophotometry with total serum protein. The&#xD;
      target blood protein range is 6.1-8.7 g/dL this test is administered without fasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 40 Post Op Gastric Bypass patients. 20 men, 20 women. All participants were&#xD;
      between the ages of 25-80 years of age. All participants have been post operation from their&#xD;
      weight loss surgery for a minimum of 6 months prior to the start of the study and no longer&#xD;
      than 8 months at the start of the study. Participants will be randomly selected, blindly, by&#xD;
      the study sponsor. The selection will utilize participants files with names and ethnicity&#xD;
      removed. Selection will be randomized into Group A and Group B. One group will be assigned&#xD;
      Genepro while the other group will be assigned a leading whey protein powder. Participants&#xD;
      will be assigned a Identification Code/Number for the duration of the study. Results will be&#xD;
      posted using this identification number as well as stating the age and gender of the&#xD;
      participant. Participant names will be held in confidence. Participants must maintain a daily&#xD;
      log that will be shared with study investigators. This log will contain daily lists of food&#xD;
      and beverage consumed as well as personal thoughts on taste and ease of use of protein&#xD;
      supplements as well as a daily synopsis of overall general emotional and physical feelings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Compensation: Three (3) thirty serving units of Genepro Generation 3 at the&#xD;
      conclusion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gathering Results: 40 subjects will receive Genepro Generation 3 protein (12g serving) for&#xD;
      one week prior to the study as well as all 6 weeks of the study. In conjunction the other&#xD;
      group of 20 subjects will receive 30g whey protein for one week prior to the study as well as&#xD;
      all 6 weeks of the study. Bi-Weekly blood analysis will determine blood protein levels. Blood&#xD;
      draws are to be conducted at a WakeMed facility (Cary, NC or Raleigh, NC - determined by the&#xD;
      proximity to the patient for their convenience). Results will be submitted for review and&#xD;
      entry from WakeMed to the sponsor oversight POC every 2 weeks. To ensure proper transfer of&#xD;
      data, WakeMed will keep and store all lab reports/results for a minimum of 2 years after the&#xD;
      conclusion of the study. Soft copies will be inserted into a virtual storage center to be&#xD;
      maintained and accessible by both, the sponsor as well as the medical partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diet: Diet guidelines limit the calories you consume while providing you with balanced meals&#xD;
      to help prevent nutritional deficiencies and preserve your muscle tissue. Each patient&#xD;
      tolerates suggested foods differently. Daily calories should be between 600 to 700 for the&#xD;
      duration of this study. Each subject is to follow a diet low in calories, fats and sweets.&#xD;
      The goal for each subject is to consume a minimum of 65 to 75 grams of protein a day. High&#xD;
      protein foods include eggs, meats, fish, seafood, tuna, poultry, tofu, milk, soy, cottage&#xD;
      cheese, and yogurt. 30g of each daily intake of protein will be provided by a powdered&#xD;
      protein supplement. 20 subjects will utilize a 30g serving of whey protein for 1 week prior&#xD;
      to the study as well as 6 weeks of the study. The other group of 20 subjects will use a&#xD;
      single serving (12g) of Genepro Gen3 Protein over the same duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject were given the following eating guidelines:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eat slowly and chew small bites of food thoroughly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Avoid rice, bread, raw vegetables, fresh fruits, and meats that are not easily chewed&#xD;
           such as pork and steak. Ground meats are usually better tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  With soft and solid foods, take only three bites at one sitting, then wait a minimum of&#xD;
           20 minutes before eating more.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eat balanced meals with small portions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Avoid the use of drinking straws and carbonated beverages, chewing gum and ice because&#xD;
           they can introduce too much air into your pouch and cause discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Avoid sugar, sugar-containing foods and beverages, concentrated sweets, and fruit juices&#xD;
           Alcoholic beverages will have a more profound effect and should be avoided or consumed&#xD;
           with caution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Storage and Distribution of Protein Powder: WakeMed Clinical Oversight Manager and Principal&#xD;
      Investigator, Marina Maddaloni, will be provided with a lockable storage container to be&#xD;
      positioned in her personal office. WakeMed will be provided white and black containers. One&#xD;
      color will house either Genepro or regular Whey protein. WakeMed will not have knowledge of&#xD;
      which color container holds which protein powder to ensure that the distribution to&#xD;
      participants is totally blinded. Participants will be given enough protein supplementation,&#xD;
      either regular whey or Genepro Generation 3 protein, to last the duration of the study.&#xD;
