  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dravet syndrome (DS) is an epileptic encephalopathy caused by pathogenic variants in the&#xD;
      SCN1A gene resulting in medically refractory epilepsy and psychomotor delays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a pilot study assessing for feasibility, the investigators aim to test whether alterations&#xD;
      in cortical excitatory:inhibitory ratio can be reliably recorded. The investigators will&#xD;
      utilize transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) metrics of cortical excitatory and inhibitory&#xD;
      tone as an initial step towards translating findings from rodent genetic models of DS into&#xD;
      disease-specific biomarkers and offer future measures of therapeutic target engagement in&#xD;
      this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete two visits, each consisting of a TMS session and an EEG session.&#xD;
      Visits will be scheduled 4-8 weeks apart.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single site study to be conducted at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) investigating&#xD;
      the neurophysiological biomarkers of epilepsy and developmental disability in children and&#xD;
      young adults with Dravet Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanistically, the features of the DS phenotype are attributable to a loss of cortical&#xD;
      inhibition. TMS is a non-invasive form of focal cortical stimulation in which an external&#xD;
      powerful magnet induces an electrical field intracranially over the stimulated region that is&#xD;
      used to interrogate or modulate states of cortical excitation or inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, the investigators propose to test whether metrics of cortical excitability and&#xD;
      inhibition can be obtained by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and EEG in patients&#xD;
      with DS.&#xD;

    <measure>Resting motor threshold (% machine output)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Resting motor threshold (rMT) is obtained by single-pulse TMS and measures voltage-gated sodium-channel-mediated cortical excitability. It is the minimum intensity of stimulation needed to reliably evoke a motor evoked potential (MEP) of at least 50 microvolts in over 50% of trials. It is reported as a percentage of total machine output.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Durations of cortical silent period (ms)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Cortical Silent Period (CSP) is a single-pulse TMS measure of GABA-mediated cortical inhibition, in which stimulation is applied to the motor cortex while subjects are activating a target muscle (here, abductor pollicis brevis and deltoid muscles), resulting in a pause in muscle contraction. The time between stimulation and the return of voluntary muscle activity is the CSP, measured in milliseconds (ms).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ratio of motor evoked potential amplitudes (no units)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Facilitation (ICF) are paired-pulse TMS metrics of cortical inhibition and excitability, respectively. A short interval interstimulus (1-5 ms) leads to cortical inhibition reflective of GABAergic neurotransmission; a longer interval interstimulus of 10-20 ms leads to a cortical facilitation, which reflects glutamatergic neurotransmission; an even longer interstimulus interval of 50-300 ms reflects GABAB-mediated local inhibition and likely GABAA-mediated network inhibition. The ratio of the peak-to-peak amplitude (in mm) of the second MEP to the first (or control) MEP will be calculated for each of these stimulation protocols.</description>

    <intervention_name>Transcranial Magenetic Stimulation (TMS)</intervention_name>
    <description>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a method for noninvasive electrical cortical stimulation, where small intracranial currents are generated by a powerful, fluctuating, extracranial magnetic field. TMS is unique in its capacity for experimental, diagnostic, and therapeutic utility. Single pulse (spTMS) and paired-pulse TMS (ppTMS) have been used extensively to study, measure, and modulate cortical excitability and plasticity.</description>
