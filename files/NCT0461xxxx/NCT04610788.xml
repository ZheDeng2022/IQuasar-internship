  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study is being done to understand why people with scleroderma can develop&#xD;
      pulmonary arterial hypertension (high blood pressure in the lungs, abbreviated PAH) and a&#xD;
      weak heart muscle (heart failure). The study will also help the investigators understand why&#xD;
      people with PAH from an unknown cause (called idiopathic PAH, or IPAH) can also develop a&#xD;
      weakened heart muscle. The response of the right side of the heart or right ventricle (RV) to&#xD;
      standard PAH therapy in scleroderma-associated PAH and in IPAH will be assessed. Blood and&#xD;
      tissue samples will be collected from research participants during participants' normal&#xD;
      standard of care procedures. People with scleroderma-associated PAH or idiopathic cause&#xD;
      (IPAH) who need a right heart catheterization may join this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with scleroderma associated pulmonary hypertension (with or without interstitial&#xD;
      lung disease) have a worse prognosis compared to patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      hypertension (IPAH). The investigators have discovered through a previous protocol that&#xD;
      patients with scleroderma associated pulmonary hypertension (SSc-PAH) have intrinsic right&#xD;
      ventricular (RV) contractile dysfunction compared with patients with idiopathic pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension (IPAH) despite similar afterload imposed by the pulmonary vasculature. Patients&#xD;
      with scleroderma or presumed/known IPAH who are clinically referred for right heart&#xD;
      catheterization (RHC) will undergo, in addition to a clinically indicated RHC,&#xD;
      state-of-the-art Pressure-Volume (P/V) Loop Assessment and RV biopsy for research purposes.&#xD;
      The investigators will also do a standard pathologic assessment of the RV tissue (H&amp;E,&#xD;
      special staining, electron microscopy), microvascular density measurements using&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry techniques and isolated skinned myocyte experiments. Additional&#xD;
      experiments will include proteomics, genomics/genetics, and RV protein and microRNA&#xD;
      expression. The investigators will compare these findings in both groups (IPAH and SSc-PAH),&#xD;
      before and after standard treatment for 6 months, in order to fully understand the&#xD;
      differences in how the RV adapts to pressure overload and reasons for impaired RV function in&#xD;
      SSc-PAH as well as identifying potential therapeutic targets.&#xD;
