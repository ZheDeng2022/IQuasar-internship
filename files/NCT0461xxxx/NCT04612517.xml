  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose trial in&#xD;
      healthy subjects, randomised to ZP7570 or placebo within each cohort&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty subjects are planned to be studied in four cohorts in this multiple ascending dose&#xD;
      trial. Ten subjects will be allocated to four dose levels. Intermediate dose levels may be&#xD;
      applied. A sentinel dosing approach (sequential dosing) will be applied. The entire&#xD;
      observation period comprises 51 days starting with a 96 hours in-house stay after the first&#xD;
      dose injection, where discharge is planned for Day 5, followed by one outpatient visit. For&#xD;
      the second and the third injection dose a 36 hours in-house stay is planned. After the fourth&#xD;
      dose injection there is also a 96 hour in-house stay where discharge is planned for Day 26,&#xD;
      followed by five outpatient visits and an End of Trial Visit on Day 51. A blinded evaluation&#xD;
      of each cohort will be performed by a Trial Safety Group to determine whether the trial will&#xD;
      progress to the next planned dose level based on the stopping rules specified in the&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
