  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to better understand how people with Parkinson's control reaching movements.&#xD;
      Specifically, we are asking how these individuals respond to different environmental&#xD;
      perturbations. Testing includes reaching movements made within a virtual reality set-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting&#xD;
      approximately up to 10 million people worldwide and with 60,000 new cases diagnosed annually&#xD;
      in the U.S. alone. Some of the most common signs and symptoms in individuals with PD are&#xD;
      slowed and small movements and difficulty in movement initiation. The ability to correct&#xD;
      movements online in response to environmental changes is an important part of daily living.&#xD;
      Online movement corrections in reaching refer to the ability to smoothly change how and where&#xD;
      you reach in response to a change in the environment. For example, one can adjust the&#xD;
      position of the hand and arm when trying to catch a butterfly flying in the air. Generally&#xD;
      speaking, online movement corrections can happen in response to visual perturbations (e.g.,&#xD;
      trying to catch a butterfly) or to force perturbations (e.g., someone knocks your hand while&#xD;
      you're holding a coffee mug). Since individuals with PD have trouble with movements, it&#xD;
      stands to reason that they may have problems with online movement corrections. Surprisingly,&#xD;
      very little is known about online movement corrections in individuals with PD. The current&#xD;
      evidence suggests that individuals with PD can make online movement corrections to small&#xD;
      visual perturbations, but whether they can successfully respond to large visual perturbations&#xD;
      is debatable. Furthermore, whether individuals with PD can make online movement corrections&#xD;
      to force perturbations has not been studied. The aim of this project is to investigate if&#xD;
      individuals with PD can make online movement corrections during reaching to visual and/or&#xD;
      force perturbations. We will test both individuals with PD and age-matched healthy controls.&#xD;
      They will perform reaching movements while visual or force perturbations are applied. We will&#xD;
      use various perturbation strengths in order to test for potential differences in responses to&#xD;
      small and large perturbations. Results from this study will provide new information on how&#xD;
      individuals with PD make online movement corrections, and possibly provide insight to&#xD;
      improving rehabilitation for PD.&#xD;
