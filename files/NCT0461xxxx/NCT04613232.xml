  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) experience severe side effects during radiotherapy&#xD;
      (RT). Ongoing technological advances in wearable biometric sensors allow for real-time&#xD;
      collection of objective data e.g. physical activity and heart rate, which in the future might&#xD;
      help to detect and act against side effects before they become severe. A smartwatch such as&#xD;
      the Apple Watch allows for objective data monitoring outside hospital with minimal effort for&#xD;
      the patient. To find out if such tools can be implemented in the oncological setting&#xD;
      feasibility studies are needed.&#xD;

&#xD;
      The study will assess the feasibility of using the Apple Watch for home monitoring of&#xD;
      patients with HNC. It will bring new insights to the patient's activity levels and how heart&#xD;
      rate varies during treatment course. This is important knowledge before further investigating&#xD;
      how biometric data can be used as part of symptom monitoring.&#xD;
