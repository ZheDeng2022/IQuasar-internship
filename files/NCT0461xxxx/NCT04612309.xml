  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An increasing number of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) are able to receive&#xD;
      3 or more lines of therapy. In this setting, can be recognize treatments such as regorafenib&#xD;
      (an oral multikinase inhibitor), trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride (TAS-102), an&#xD;
      antineoplastic nucleoside analogue, and antibodies anti-epidermal growth factor receptor&#xD;
      (EGFR) in patients with RAS wild-type tumors (if no prior exposure to antibodies).&#xD;
      Maintaining quality of life is an essential goal for third- and later-line treatments for&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitors,&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and nivolumab, were approved in the US by the FDA in 2017, and the combination&#xD;
      nivolumab plus ipilimumab (anti CTLA-4) was recently approved by the FDA in 2018, all in the&#xD;
      second and later-line setting for patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or&#xD;
      deficient DNA mismatch repair mCRC whose disease has progressed despite treatment with&#xD;
      fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy. At present, these agents&#xD;
      are not approved in Europe for mCRC patients with MSI-H. Clinical trial results and&#xD;
      scientific data supported evidence that immunotherapies provide benefit but are limited to&#xD;
      the small proportion (&lt; 5%) of patients with MSI-H tumors, in whom they are highly effective.&#xD;
      Therefore, patients with MSI-H disease should be referred as expeditiously as possible to&#xD;
      receive immune checkpoint inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim the study is to retrospectively collect data of patients treated with immunotherapy&#xD;
      in the context of real clinical practice, in order to describe the real impact in terms of&#xD;
      clinical outcomes and tolerability of treatment in common clinical practice.&#xD;
