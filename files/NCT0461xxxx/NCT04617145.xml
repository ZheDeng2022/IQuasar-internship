    <textblock>
      Sixty patients with AML from both sexes aged from 35-45 years were selected from hematology&#xD;
      department in Nasser Institute Hospital where the study was conducted. Patients were randomly&#xD;
      assigned into two groups equal in number. Group (A) underwent aerobic exercises in the form&#xD;
      of cycling with 50-60% of maximum heart rate. Group (B) underwent resistive training&#xD;
      conducted in the form of a series of exercises using free weights, and dumbles. Sessions were&#xD;
      conducted three times /week for eight weeks. Six minutes' walk test (6MWT), 10 repetitions&#xD;
      maximum test (10 RM), ventilatory function test, fatigue and quality of life (QOL) scales&#xD;
      were used to assess functional capacity in both groups.&#xD;

      Aerobic Ex Group: Included 30 patients who underwent aerobic training with 50 %-60% of&#xD;
      maximum heart rate in the form of cycling by Bicycle ergometer for eight weeks, three&#xD;
      sessions/week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistive Ex Group: Included 30 patients who underwent a resistive training which were&#xD;
      conducted in the form of a series of exercises using free weights, and dumbles to increase&#xD;
      the strength of arms, pectoral muscles, abdominal, back muscles and gluteal region. Patients&#xD;
      carried out three sets of 20-30 dynamic repetitions or static isometric exercises for 40-60&#xD;
      seconds for each muscle group and rested 1-2 min between series. Sessions were conducted&#xD;
      three sessions/week for eight weeks.&#xD;
