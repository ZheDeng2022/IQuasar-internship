  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypoxemic Acute Respiratory Failure (hARF) is a common reason of admission to Intensive Care.&#xD;
      Different modalities can be used to administer oxygen, which is the first supportive&#xD;
      treatment in these patients. Recently a new device combining high flow nasal cannula (HFNC)&#xD;
      and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been developed, but a few is known in&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have designed this pilot physiologic randomized cross-over study to assess, in&#xD;
      patients with hARF, the effects of a new device combining high-flow oxygen through nasal&#xD;
      cannula (HFNC) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on lung aeration and&#xD;
      ventilation distribution .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Around 30% of patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) are affected by hypoxemic&#xD;
      Acute Respiratory Failure (hARF). The primary supportive treatment in hypoxemic patients is&#xD;
      oxygen therapy, which is commonly delivered through nasal prongs or masks. New devices, able&#xD;
      to deliver high-flow gas through a nasal cannula (HFNC), have been recently made available.&#xD;
      HFNC delivers heated and humidified gas up to 60 L/min, with a fraction of inspired oxygen&#xD;
      (FiO2) ranging from 0.21 to 1, via a wide bore soft nasal prong. Warming and humidification&#xD;
      of the inspired gas prevent the adverse effects of cool dry gases on the airway epithelium&#xD;
      and facilitate expectoration. HFNC also washes out exhaled carbon dioxide (CO2) from the&#xD;
      pharyngeal dead space. HFNC has been shown an effective means to deliver oxygen therapy in&#xD;
      many clinical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In healthy subject during spontaneous unassisted breathing, end-expiratory pharyngeal&#xD;
      pressure is about 0.3 and 0.8 cmH2O, with open and closed mouth, respectively. Compared to&#xD;
      unassisted spontaneous breathing, HFNC generates greater pharyngeal pressure during&#xD;
      expiration, while in the course of inspiration it drops to zero, which limits the&#xD;
      effectiveness of HFNC in patients with lung edema and/or collapse. By recruiting lung&#xD;
      atelectatic regions, reducing venous admixture and decreasing the inspiratory effort,&#xD;
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is likely more effective in these instances.&#xD;
      Compared to noninvasive ventilation by application of an inspiratory pressure support, CPAP&#xD;
      offers several advantages, which include ease of use and lack of patient-ventilator&#xD;
      asynchrony.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPAP may be applied either through mask or helmet. This latter is better tolerated than&#xD;
      facial masks and allows more prolonged continuous CPAP application. When applying CPAP by&#xD;
      helmet, however, heating and humidification of the inhaled gas is problematic because of&#xD;
      condensation of water inside the interface, so called &quot;fog effect&quot;. Moreover, in patients&#xD;
      receiving CPAP by helmet some re-breathing occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome these limitations and combine the beneficial effects of HFNC and CPAP,&#xD;
      investigators designed a new device combining HFNC and helmet CPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, it has been found this combination capable to provide a stable CPAP and effective&#xD;
      CO2 washout from the upper airways with negligible CO2 re-breathing. Nonetheless, because of&#xD;
      the complex interplay between CPAP and HFNC, the amount of truly applied airway pressure,&#xD;
      diaphragm function and temperature inside the helmet might be affected to some extent. In 14&#xD;
      adult healthy volunteers, we found that adding HFNC to CPAP (as referenced to CPAP), 1) did&#xD;
      not importantly alter either the pre-set airway pressure during inspiration or temperature&#xD;
      inside the helmet; 2) increased expiratory airway pressure proportionally to the flow&#xD;
      administered by HFNC, but to a lower extent than HFNC alone (as referenced to spontaneous&#xD;
      breathing); 3) determined only slight modifications of the respiratory drive (as assessed&#xD;
      through diaphragm ultrasound), compared to CPAP alone, 4) did not cause &quot;fog effect&quot; inside&#xD;
      the helmet and 5) did not worsen comfort. We therefore suggested that adding heated&#xD;
      humidified air through nasal cannula at a flow of 30 L/min during CPAP would probably be the&#xD;
      best setting to be applied in patients with hypoxemic acute respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive bedside monitoring device aimed at&#xD;
      assessing lung aeration and ventilation. HFNC and CPAP devices was shown to modify lung&#xD;
      aeration and ventilation in patients with hARF. However, nothing is known about the effect of&#xD;
      the combination of HFNC+CPAP on lung ventilation in patients with hARF. Investigators have&#xD;
      therefore designed this pilot physiologic randomized cross-over study to investigate the&#xD;
      effects of HFNC+CPAP on lung aeration and ventilation distribution, gas exchange and&#xD;
      patient's comfort.&#xD;
