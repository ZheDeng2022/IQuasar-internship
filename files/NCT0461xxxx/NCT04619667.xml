    <textblock>
      This pilot physiologic randomized cross-over study was designed to investigate if, in&#xD;
      patients with hARF, a new device combining high-flow oxygen through nasal cannula (HFNC) and&#xD;
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) reduces the respiratory effort, as compared to&#xD;
      HFNC and CPAP alone (first outcome). Furthermore, the diaphragm activation, as assessed with&#xD;
      ultrasound, gas exchange and patient's comfort among different settings will be assessed&#xD;
      (secondary outcomes).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Around 30% of patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) are affected by hypoxemic&#xD;
      Acute Respiratory Failure (hARF). The primary supportive treatment in hypoxemic patients is&#xD;
      oxygen therapy, which is commonly delivered through nasal prongs or masks. New devices, able&#xD;
      to deliver high-flow gas through a nasal cannula (HFNC), have been recently made available.&#xD;
      HFNC delivers heated and humidified gas up to 60 L/min, with a fraction of inspired oxygen&#xD;
      (FiO2) ranging from 0.21 to 1, via a wide bore soft nasal prong. Warming and humidification&#xD;
      of the inspired gas prevent the adverse effects of cool dry gases on the airway epithelium&#xD;
      and facilitate expectoration. HFNC also washes out exhaled carbon dioxide (CO2) from the&#xD;
      pharyngeal dead space. HFNC has been shown an effective means to deliver oxygen therapy in&#xD;
      many clinical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In healthy subject during spontaneous unassisted breathing, end-expiratory pharyngeal&#xD;
      pressure is about 0.3 and 0.8 cmH2O, with open and closed mouth, respectively. Compared to&#xD;
      unassisted spontaneous breathing, HFNC generates greater pharyngeal pressure during&#xD;
      expiration, while in the course of inspiration it drops to zero, which limits the&#xD;
      effectiveness of HFNC in patients with lung edema and/or collapse. By recruiting lung&#xD;
      atelectatic regions, reducing venous admixture and decreasing the inspiratory effort,&#xD;
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is likely more effective in these instances.&#xD;
      Compared to noninvasive ventilation by application of an inspiratory pressure support, CPAP&#xD;
      offers several advantages, which include ease of use and lack of patient-ventilator&#xD;
      asynchrony.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPAP may be applied either through mask or helmet. This latter is better tolerated than&#xD;
      facial masks and allows more prolonged continuous CPAP application. When applying CPAP by&#xD;
      helmet, however, heating and humidification of the inhaled gas is problematic because of&#xD;
      condensation of water inside the interface, so called &quot;fog effect&quot;. Moreover, in patients&#xD;
      receiving CPAP by helmet some re-breathing occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome these limitations and combine the beneficial effects of HFNC and CPAP, the&#xD;
      investigators designed a new device combining HFNC and helmet CPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, this combination was shown to be capable to provide a stable CPAP and effective CO2&#xD;
      washout from the upper airways with negligible CO2 re-breathing. Nonetheless, because of the&#xD;
      complex interplay between CPAP and HFNC, the amount of truly applied airway pressure,&#xD;
      diaphragm function and temperature inside the helmet might be affected to some extent. In 14&#xD;
      adult healthy volunteers, we found that adding HFNC to CPAP (as referenced to CPAP), 1) did&#xD;
      not importantly alter either the pre-set airway pressure during inspiration or temperature&#xD;
      inside the helmet; 2) increased expiratory airway pressure proportionally to the flow&#xD;
      administered by HFNC, but to a lower extent than HFNC alone (as referenced to spontaneous&#xD;
      breathing); 3) determined only slight modifications of the respiratory drive (as assessed&#xD;
      through diaphragm ultrasound), compared to CPAP alone, 4) did not cause &quot;fog effect&quot; inside&#xD;
      the helmet and 5) did not worsen comfort. We therefore suggested that adding heated&#xD;
      humidified air through nasal cannula at a flow of 30 L/min during CPAP would probably be the&#xD;
      best setting to be applied in patients with hypoxemic acute respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with hARF, the use of noninvasive respiratory support (CPAP and non-invasive&#xD;
      ventilation) is still debated. Patients receiving oxygen therapy, HFNC or CPAP/NIV maintain&#xD;
      spontaneous breathing, which allows avoidance of sedation, thus limiting diaphragm&#xD;
      dysfunction and delirium, permits easier mobilisation and prevents infections and&#xD;
      ICU-acquired weakness. However, the maintenance of spontaneous breathing in patients with&#xD;
      damaged lungs and high respiratory drive may result in global/regional pressure/volume&#xD;
      changes possibly aggravating initial lung injury. This condition has been defined as patient&#xD;
      self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI). Indeed, respiratory drive is increased in patients with&#xD;
      hARF. The high respiratory effort is one of the major determinants of increased&#xD;
      transpulmonary pressure (Pl), which is the pressure acting across the lung. Pl represents the&#xD;
      pressure alveoli are exposed to, and is considered among the most important determinants of&#xD;
      P-SILI. Therefore, the reduction of Pl, across a decrease of the respiratory effort, might be&#xD;
      advantageous in patients with hARF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have therefore designed this pilot physiologic randomized cross-over study to&#xD;
      investigate if, in patients with hARF, HFNC+CPAP reduces the respiratory effort, as compared&#xD;
      to HFNC and CPAP (first outcome). Furthermore, we will assess the diaphragm activation, as&#xD;
      assessed with ultrasound, gas exchange and patient's comfort among different settings&#xD;
      (secondary outcomes).&#xD;
