    <textblock>
      This study will assess safety, tolerability, and treatment activity of datopotamab deruxtecan&#xD;
      (Dato-DXd) in combination with durvalumab in participants with advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study will assess the safety and tolerability of datopotamab&#xD;
      deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) in combination with durvalumab with or without 4 cycles of platinum&#xD;
      chemotherapy in participants with advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have either been&#xD;
      previously treated or are treatment na√Øve in a metastatic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two dose levels of Dato-DXd (4.0 mg/kg and 6.0 mg/kg) will be studied in combination with&#xD;
      1120 mg fixed dose of durvalumab, with or without 4 cycles of platinum chemotherapy in 6&#xD;
      study cohorts. This study will be conducted sequentially and dose escalation will occur&#xD;
      according to lower dose to higher dose in the same combination regimen (4.0 mg/kg to 6.0&#xD;
      mg/kg) and from 2-drug combination (Dato-DXd and durvalumab) to 3-drug combination regimen&#xD;
      (Dato-DXd, durvalumab, and carboplatin or cisplatin).&#xD;
