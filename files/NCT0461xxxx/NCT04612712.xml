    <textblock>
      This study is an open, multi-center clinical trial, the purpose is to study the safety and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of Donafenib combined with KN046 in subjects with Advanced&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal Tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of dose escalation and dose expansion. The preset dose of Donafenib is 50&#xD;
      mg BID, 100 mg BID and 200 mg BID, and the preset dose of KN046 is 5 mg/kg Q3W. Dose&#xD;
      expansion will enroll subjects who with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
