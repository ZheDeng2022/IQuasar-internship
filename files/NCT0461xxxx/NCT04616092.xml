      Hypothesis: Correction of preoperative anemia can reduce the need for intra-/postoperative&#xD;
      RBC transfusions and can improve surgical outcomes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anemia is one of the major risk factors that has been shown to compromise surgical outcome in&#xD;
      many fields of surgery. Although red blood cell (RBC) transfusions can be used to correct&#xD;
      anemia quickly, RBC transfusions are known to be a risk factor that worsens the outcome of&#xD;
      surgery. In cerebrovascular disease, anemia can decrease the delivery of oxygen to brain&#xD;
      tissue and can cause cerebral ischemia, which can lead to secondary brain damage. On the&#xD;
      other hand, RBC transfusion may increase the viscosity of the blood, thereby reducing the&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow, or causing side effects such as vasospasm or thromboembolic event.&#xD;
      Therefore, there is a growing need for measures to correct anemia and reduce the number of&#xD;
      transfusions in the treatment of cerebrovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of ferric carboxymaltose for postoperative anemia correction in orthopedic&#xD;
      and general surgery has been reported in several studies. However, researches on the effect&#xD;
      of ferric carboxymaltose to correct preoperative anemia is rare, and there has been no study&#xD;
      on the efficacy of ferric carboxymaltose, especially in brain surgery. However, as the&#xD;
      population of the elderly grows and the technology of inspection develops, the number of&#xD;
      diagnosis of cerebrovascular diseases increases. In particular, the incidence of unruptured&#xD;
      intracranial aneurysms (UIA) has increased by 29.7% every year since 2008. Accordingly,&#xD;
      clipping sugery, known as the treatment of UIA, has increased by 16.0% every year since&#xD;
      2008.21 Therefore, it is necessary to study the efficacy of ferric carboxymaltose to correct&#xD;
      the anemia and to decrease the number of transfusion in clipping surgery for UIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seicean et al. analyzed the effects of preoperative anemia and RBC transfusion on the&#xD;
      surgical outcomes of 668 patients who underwent surgery for intracranial aneurysms for 7&#xD;
      years. 29.6 % of 668 patients were diagnosed with anemia, preoperatively. 28.3 % of patients&#xD;
      with anemia, and 8.1 % of patients without anemia received RBC transfusions,&#xD;
      intra-/postoperatively. Patients with preoperative anemia showed significantly higher&#xD;
      frequency of RBC transfusions (p&lt;0.01) in general cohort, and hospital length of stay (LOS)&#xD;
      (p&lt;0.01) and the rate of major complications (p=0.02) was significantly higher in the group&#xD;
      receiving RBC transfusions. This study have reported that preoperative anemia was predictive&#xD;
      of perioperative transfusion in the general and matched cohorts (data not shown). Other&#xD;
      studies also demostrated that lower preoperative hemoglobin was assodiated with perioperative&#xD;
      transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators performed 427 patients who underwent clipping surgery for UIAs in 2017 in&#xD;
      single institute (Seoul National University Bundang Hospital), where has the biggest&#xD;
      cerebrovascular center in Korea and is one of the world's best hospitals for cerebrovascular&#xD;
      surgery. Among 427 patients, Investigators retrospectively analysed the relationship between&#xD;
      preoperative anemia and postoperative transfusion for 338 patients treated for UIA sized&#xD;
      under 15mm and located in anterior circulation to maintain patient consistency. 15.4% of&#xD;
      patients who underwent clipping surgery were diagnosed with anemia before surgery. Though&#xD;
      Investigators did not check the level of ferritin or transferrin saturation, most patients&#xD;
      were suspected of IDA because all patients had no chronic inflammatory disease or underlying&#xD;
      disease causing anemia. The mean amount of intraoperative bleeding was 484.5ml, and 45.7% of&#xD;
      the patients were given intra-/postoperative transfusion. In conclusion, the frequency of&#xD;
      intra-/postoperative RBC transfusion was significantly higher in patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      preoperative anemia. (p&lt;0.01) Based on these results, investigators hypothesized that&#xD;
      correcting anemia before surgery could reduce the need for postoperative RBC transfusion and&#xD;
      conducted a pilot study. From November 2018 to April 2019, FERINJECT 500mg was administered&#xD;
      to 12 patients who underwent clipping surgery for UIAs. The average haemoglobin (Hb)&#xD;
      increased from 11.4g/dl before FERINJECT to 13.1g/dl on the day of surgery. Three patients&#xD;
      (25.0%) received a transfusion after surgery. When investigators retrospectively compared the&#xD;
      group with patients without correcting the anemia, investigators concluded that the anemia&#xD;
      corrected group significantly lowered the probability of postoperative transfusion. (p &lt;0.01)&#xD;
      Accordingly, investigators designed a prospective study to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      preoperative anemia correction using FERINJECT on the need for RBC transfusion and surgical&#xD;
      outcome in patients undergoing clipping surgery for UIAs.&#xD;
