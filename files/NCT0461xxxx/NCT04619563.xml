  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anlotinib is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor in domestic research and&#xD;
      development. It can inhibit angiogenesis-related kinases, such as VEGFR, FGFR, PDGFR and&#xD;
      tumor cell proliferation related kinase c-Kit kinase. In the Phase III study, patients who&#xD;
      failed at least two systemic chemotherapy (third-line or above) or were intolerant of the&#xD;
      drugs were treated with anlotinib or placebo. The PFS and OS in the anlotinib group were 5.37&#xD;
      months and 9.63 months, respectively. The placebo group PFS and OS were 1.4 months and 6.3&#xD;
      months. Therefore, it is envisaged to use anlotinib combined with docetaxel to treat EGFR&#xD;
      mutations advanced non small cell lung cancer to further improve the patient's PFS or OS.&#xD;

      This is a single arm clinical trial conducted in China. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate and observe the efficacy and safety of Anlotinib Hydrochloride (12mg, QD PO d1-14,&#xD;
      21days per cycle) combined with Docetaxel (75mg/m2 IV d1) in EGFR mutations advanced non&#xD;
      small cell lung cancer patients who have progressed after targeted therapy and chemotherapy.&#xD;
      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written&#xD;
      informed consent will undergo a 4-week screening period to determine eligibility for study&#xD;
      entry. The expected sample size is 42.&#xD;
