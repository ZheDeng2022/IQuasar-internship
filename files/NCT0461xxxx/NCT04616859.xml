  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the relevance of gender in the acute effects&#xD;
      (subjective, physiological and driving-related skills) observed after controlled&#xD;
      administration of alcohol in a binge-drinking pattern mixed with energy drinks (AmED)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consumption of alcohol mixed with energy drinks (AmED) has increased mainly among young&#xD;
      people. Energy drinks (ED) are usually combined with alcohol with the intention of&#xD;
      counteracting its effects. However, most studies have not shown a reduction in drunkenness&#xD;
      and consumption is related with engagement of risk-taking behaviours like driving under&#xD;
      alcohol effects. It is already known that alcohol concentrations and effects are higher in&#xD;
      women than in men even after adjusting dose by weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relevance of gender in the acute effects of alcohol associated with ED consumed in a&#xD;
      binge-drinking pattern has been poorly studied. A randomized clinical trial will be conducted&#xD;
      in healthy volunteers (1:1) and four treatment conditions will be administered: alcohol+ED,&#xD;
      alcohol+placebo of ED, placebo of alcohol+ED and placebo of alcohol+placebo of ED. Subjective&#xD;
      and physiological effects, driving related skills, and alcohol and caffeine concentrations&#xD;
      will be measured along an 8-hours period. A pilot study has been conducted with the first 6&#xD;
      volunteers to select the alcohol doses. In the definitive study 70 g of alcohol in men and 55&#xD;
      g in women will be used.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Males and females between 18-40 years old, weight between 50 and 100 kg and BMI&#xD;
             (BMI=weight/height²) between 20-28 kg/m². Lower or higher BMIs will be allowed, if the&#xD;
             researchers considered that do not suppose a risk to the subjects and do not interfere&#xD;
             with the objectives of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Recreational alcohol consumption in form of occasional binge-drinking (≥1 episode /&#xD;
             month) and at least consumption of 1 unit (10 g, &quot;standard&quot; drink - one alcoholic&#xD;
             drink equivalent) per day or its equivalent over the whole week [7 units, 70 g)]) and&#xD;
             having experienced drunkenness several times&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Regular consumption of beverages containing methylxanthines at least 7 per week&#xD;
             (coffee, tea, chocolate, cola soda, energy drinks). Consumption of energy drinks at&#xD;
             least once.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Understand and accept the study's procedures and sign an informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. No evidence of somatic or psychiatric disorders as per past medical history and&#xD;

             be within normal ranges. Minor or occasional changes from normal ranges are accepted&#xD;

             not clinically significant, are not life-threatening for the subjects and do not&#xD;
             interfere with the product assessment. These changes and their non-relevance will be&#xD;
             justified in writing specifically.&#xD;

             distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs or symptoms suggestive of drug-induced&#xD;
             gastrointestinal irritation.&#xD;

             subjects and they won't interfere with the study's objectives. Single doses of&#xD;
             symptomatic drugs taken during the week before the experimental session will not&#xD;
             constitute an exclusion criterion if it can be assumed that it has been completely&#xD;
             eliminated on the day of the experimental session.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Smokers of &gt;5 cigarettes/day&#xD;
&#xD;
