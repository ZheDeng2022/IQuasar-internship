  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an online registry and database of patients with cardiomyopathy and myocarditis,&#xD;
      coupled with an observational study of DCM and HCM.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study utilises The Heart Hive, an international, online registry of patients with&#xD;
      self-reported clinically diagnosed cardiomyopathy or myocarditis, and people with a family&#xD;
      history of cardiomyopathy, enrolled on an on-going basis. Registry participants are invited&#xD;
      to enter self-reported demographics and health data relevant to their cardiac diagnosis into&#xD;
      The Heart Hive online database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registry participants with self-reported clinically diagnosed dilated (DCM )or hypertrophic&#xD;
      (HCM) cardiomyopathy will be recruited to an observational, prospective study entailing&#xD;
      collection of patient-reported baseline demographic data and clinical risk factors,&#xD;
      genotyping, and annual collection of follow up data from patients, national registries (NHS&#xD;
      Digital) and medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pilot phase 100 DCM and 100 HCM patients will be recruited to a validation study.&#xD;
      Consent will be sought to access medical information from health care providers in order to&#xD;
      compare against and confirm self-reported health information. DNA will be obtained from&#xD;
      saliva samples and tested in-house using a panel of clinically validated known Mendelian DCM&#xD;
      and HCM genes as a second validation of the accuracy of self-reported diagnosis and to&#xD;
      confirm equivalent genetic architecture of DCM and HCM in direct-to-patient recruited cohorts&#xD;
      compared to traditional centre of excellence clinic-based recruitments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following validation of the approach and once funding is in place for genomic studies, larger&#xD;
      numbers of affected DCM and HCM patients will be recruited to this study from the registry of&#xD;
      research willing participants.&#xD;
