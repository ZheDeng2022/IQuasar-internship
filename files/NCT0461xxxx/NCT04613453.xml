  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if intravenous ketamine reduces suicidal thinking&#xD;
      compared to an active placebo (midazolam) in adolescents who have treatment resistant&#xD;
      depression and a recent history of a suicide event (defined as a suicide attempt, emergency&#xD;
      room evaluation for suicidal thinking, or a transition to inpatient care for suicidality in&#xD;
      the past 120 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether ketamine reduces suicidal&#xD;
      ideation (as measured via the C-SSRS, recent ideation scale) relative to an active control,&#xD;
      midazolam, 48-hours after first administration in adolescents with TRD at high suicide risk.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to examine the safety, efficacy, response predictors, and&#xD;
      post-treatment trajectory of adolescents with TRD and high suicide risk following a highly&#xD;
      conservative repeat dosing ketamine infusion paradigm (four infusions of 0.5mg/kg each over&#xD;
      two weeks) compared to an active control, midazolam. Those who are randomized to midazolam&#xD;
      and remain ill have the option to cross-over to ketamine in the open phase. All participants&#xD;
      will be followed closely for four months post-treatment and treated with standard of care&#xD;
      depression treatment (medication management and cognitive behavioral therapy). Brain-based&#xD;
      predictors of anti-suicidal responses will be assessed via connectome predictive modeling&#xD;
      (CPM), examining functional brain circuits via fMRI before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the unregulated use of ketamine in the community at widely varying doses and&#xD;
      frequencies, the safety data gathered from this highly conservative repeat dosing paradigm is&#xD;
      critical to inform the field about potential risks. Efficacy data at rapid, short-term, and&#xD;
      intermediate-term (4 month) timepoints will be critical to determining whether a larger study&#xD;
      is warranted in this population. The assessment of brain-based predictors of response through&#xD;
      the integration of functional neuroimaging adds an important measure of biological engagement&#xD;
      that will inform subsequent studies and stands to contribute towards the goal of personalized&#xD;
      medicine (i.e. determining not only if a treatment works, but in whom).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To evaluate the safety of treating adolescents with TRD at high suicide risk with a&#xD;
      conservative repeat-dosing ketamine paradigm followed by standard of care treatment over 4&#xD;
      months. Hypothesis: We anticipate no untoward effects on medical outcomes (cardiovascular&#xD;
      function and bladder health) or cognitive function (measured via Cogstate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To evaluate the 48-hour impact of ketamine on suicidal ideation compared to midazolam,&#xD;
      and to identify connectome phenotypes predictive of ideation post-treatment. Hypothesis:&#xD;
      Ketamine will reduce suicidal thinking (Columbia Suicide Rating Scale, recent ideation&#xD;
      subscale) compared to midazolam. CPM will identify networks predictive of ideation, validated&#xD;
      via k-fold or leave-one-out cross-validation within the sample. The network measures obtained&#xD;
      at this fixed ketamine dose will inform the design of larger clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3 (exploratory): To describe the trajectory of suicidal thinking, depressive symptoms,&#xD;
      and use of mental health resources in both ketamine responders and non-responders over 4&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

    <description>The C-SSRS is an assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior in clinical and research settings. The C-SSRS consists of 16 questions that ask about suicidal ideation and behaviors (the first 10 questions comprise the ideation subscale and the last 6 comprise the behavior subscale). This 5-item subscale ranges from a minimum of 0 (corresponding to no suicidal ideation) to a maximum of 5 (representing active suicidal ideation with plan and intent).</description>

    <description>Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale is an 10-item scale examines depressive symptoms and will be assessed at baseline (prior to any experimental treatment), prior to each experimental treatment, and weekly during the open phase of the trial. This 10-item scale ranges from 0 to 60, with higher values representing more intensive depressive symptoms.</description>

    <description>Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised is a 17-item scale examines depressive symptoms in children and adolescents using the combined report of the adolescent and the parent, synthesized by a clinician. It will be administered at baseline (prior to any experimental treatment), at the end of the blinded phase of the trial (Day 11), and monthly during the open phase of the trial. This 17-item clinical scale creates scores that range from 17 to 113, with higher scores representing more intensive depressive symptoms</description>
