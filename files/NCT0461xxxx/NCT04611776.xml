  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of adjuvant treatment with atezolizumab in combination with&#xD;
      platinum-doublet chemotherapy followed by atezolizumab compared with adjuvant placebo in&#xD;
      combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy followed by placebo in patients with Stage IB&#xD;
      to IIIB (T3N2) NSCLC following surgical resection who are positive for ctDNA.&#xD;

  <why_stopped>
    The positive results from IMpower010 demonstrated benefit by adding atezolizumab as adjuvant&#xD;
    therapy in early stage NSCLC. These results raised ethical concerns of enrolling pts to best&#xD;
    supportive care over checkpoint inhibition in this setting.&#xD;
