  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Experimental study that has how to compare the efficacy between conventional rehabilitation,&#xD;
      transcutaneous electrostimulation or early mobilization to reduce the time needed to reverse&#xD;
      the muscle weakness evaluated by the muscle strength scale of the MRC in patients with a&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis of intensive care unit acquired weakness in the (ICUAW).The ambit of&#xD;
      realization is a medical-surgical ICU of a general acute hospital (26 beds). A randomized&#xD;
      controlled, uni-centric design was used. The interventions are divided into three groups&#xD;
      namely; group 1 (control group) receiving standard or usual rehabilitation (GR-STD); group 2&#xD;
      receives transcutaneous electrostimulation (GR-TEE) and group 3 that consists of an early&#xD;
      mobilization protocol (GR-EM). The main outcome variable of the study is the time, in days&#xD;
      and sessions of treatment, to reverse the ICUAW.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study hypothesis: the time to revert the intensive care unit acquired weakness is less when&#xD;
      applying an early mobilization protocol or transcutaneous electro-nervous stimulation&#xD;
      compared with the usual or standard rehabilitative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations: The research protocol was presented and approved by both the Ethics&#xD;
      Committee and the Teaching and Research Committee of our institution. The informed consent of&#xD;
      each subject included in the study was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and study power: a sample size was defined in 18 subjects (6 subjects per&#xD;
      intervention group). The estimation of the sample was calculated for a one-way ANOVA where a&#xD;
      minimum difference of 2 sessions was established between the treatments, assuming a standard&#xD;
      deviation of 1.8 sessions, an alpha error of 5% and a power of 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods: the numerical variables will be presented as mean and standard deviation&#xD;
      or median and interquartile range according to the presented distribution. The categorical&#xD;
      variables will be presented by frequency and percentage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the comparison of continuous variables, Student's t test for independent samples or the&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test will be used according to the presented distribution and for the&#xD;
      categorical variables the Chi² test or the Fisher exact test will be used according to the&#xD;
      conformation of the crossed table. The Shapiro-Wilk test will be used to evaluate whether the&#xD;
      distribution presented by the numerical variables fits a normal distribution. Equality of&#xD;
      variances was assessed by the Levene´s test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparison of the time to reach an smuscle strength scale of the MRC ≥ 48 between the&#xD;
      groups with different interventions will be used the one-way ANOVA test or the Kruskal-Wallis&#xD;
      test as appropriate. For post hoc analysis, the pairs-comparison test of Games-Hollew or&#xD;
      Dunn's-Bonferroni will be used for ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis, respectively, when they reach&#xD;
      statistical significance.&#xD;
