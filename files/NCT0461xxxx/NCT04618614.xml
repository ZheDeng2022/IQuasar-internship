    <textblock>
      to investigate the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation of the somatosensory&#xD;
      area on upper limb motor performance in healthy adults&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      60 healthy subjects will be randomly allocated to one of three groups: (a) 15- min of&#xD;
      High-Definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) on primary somatosensory&#xD;
      cortex (S1) with an intensity of 1 milliampere (mA) (HD-tDCS S1); (b) 15-min of HD-tDCS on&#xD;
      primary motor cortex (M1) with an intensity of 1 mA (HD-tDCS M1); and (c) 15-min of sham&#xD;
      HD-tDCS (HD-tDCS sham).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stimulation will be administered noninvasively using an M x N 9-channel high definition&#xD;
      transcranial electrical current stimulator from Soterix Medical (New York, NY). In the&#xD;
      HD-tDCS S1 group, the anodal stimulation will target the right postcentral gyrus. In the&#xD;
      HD-tDCS M1 group, the anodal stimulation will target the right primary motor cortex (brodmann&#xD;
      area 4). The location of the electrodes will be placed based on HD-Targets brain modelling&#xD;
      software (Soterix Medical, New York, NY).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests (motor and sensory tasks): The non-dominant left arm will be tested. Motor task: The&#xD;
      subjects will perform a sequential point-to-point movement task on the graphics tablet.&#xD;
      Initially, the participants will be required to perform 3 sequences without errors to&#xD;
      familiarize themselves with the setup, the task and the sequence. Then, they will perform the&#xD;
      pre-test which consists of two blocks of 6 sequences, i.e. 12 sequences, with a 30 s break&#xD;
      between blocks. Two min after starting the appropriate stimulation, they will perform 2&#xD;
      blocks of 6 sequences (identical to the pre-test). After finishing the tDCS stimulation, the&#xD;
      participants will perform a post-test, which is also identical to the pre-test. Three outcome&#xD;
      measures will be used: movement time (s), reaction time (s) and straight line deviation (cm)&#xD;
      of the reaching movements. Sensory tasks: discriminative task (two point orientation&#xD;
      discrimination) and proprioception task will be included. The sensory tasks will be performed&#xD;
      with eyes blindfolded. In the discriminative task the experimenter will deliver a stimuli by&#xD;
      a two-pronged instrument at intervals of 2,3,4,5 mm to the distal phalanx of fingers 2 and 5&#xD;
      of the left hand. The stimulus will be oriented either across or down (total of 16 stimuli).&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to Identify the orientation of the stimulation. The outcome measure&#xD;
      will be the percentage of correct answers. In the proprioceptive task, the subjects will&#xD;
      perform a one direction point-to-point (target) movement task on the graphics tablet. The&#xD;
      task will include 20 movements, 10 passive movements and 10 active movements. After every&#xD;
      passive movement with eyes blindfolded, the subject will be asked to perform a similar active&#xD;
      movement. Initially, the participants will be asked to perform four movements to familiarize&#xD;
      themselves with the setup (the first two movements will be passive and active movements with&#xD;
      eyes open, and the following two movements will be passive and active movements with eyes&#xD;
      blindfolded). The outcome measure will be the end point error (cm) which is the distance&#xD;
      between the target and the actual arrival location.&#xD;
