  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 90% of people with Parkinson's disease have speech and voice disorders that negatively&#xD;
      impact their ability to communicate effectively in daily life. This study will test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that a combined speech and exercise intervention will improve speech&#xD;
      intelligibility in people with Parkinson's disease and speech impairment. This approach would&#xD;
      offer an affordable way to continue to both instruct and encourage training by Veterans&#xD;
      virtually indefinitely through the remote access technology. These findings may help VA&#xD;
      clinicians provide optimal care for the many Veterans with Parkinson's disease and speech&#xD;
      impairment.&#xD;

      Background/Rationale The great majority of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) develop&#xD;
      speech impairments, most of which are grouped together and called hypokinetic dysarthria.&#xD;
      Hypokinetic dysarthria is typically characterized by altered prosody (e.g., reduced loudness&#xD;
      and pitch variation), phonation (e.g., breathy or harsh voice), and articulation (e.g.,&#xD;
      imprecise consonants, centralized vowels). Changes in speech may appear early in PD and&#xD;
      progress in severity over time. Further, such changes in speech lead to significant declines&#xD;
      in functional communication and quality of life. Pharmacological and surgical interventions&#xD;
      that alleviate motor symptoms in PD are largely ineffective or sometimes even detrimental for&#xD;
      speech.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Based on results from a preliminary study, the investigators propose to conduct a&#xD;
      pilot randomized, controlled trial in patients with hypokinetic dysarthria in PD to assess&#xD;
      the potential effectiveness of a novel home-based exercise intervention with interactive&#xD;
      automated speech response features that encourage a higher level of speech performance. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that patients in the intervention program will improve in speech&#xD;
      intelligibility and self-perceived communication ability over 6 months, as compared with&#xD;
      patients in a health education program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods A total of 104 community-dwelling Veterans with hypokinetic dysarthria in&#xD;
      mild-to-moderate PD will be randomly assigned to the exercise intervention or to the health&#xD;
      education control. The investigators will test the effects of the intervention at 6 months&#xD;
      for the outcomes speech intelligibility and self-perceived communication ability.&#xD;
