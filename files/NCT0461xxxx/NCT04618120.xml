      Exercise therapies are effective methods in the treatment of complications after breast&#xD;
      cancer surgery. The study aims to compare exercise practices with virtual reality-based&#xD;
      exercise training during radiotherapy period after breast cancer surgery. Patients were&#xD;
      randomly divided into 3 groups as virtual reality group, exercise group, and control group,&#xD;
      considering the order of arrival at the clinic and the type of surgery (mastectomy and&#xD;
      breast-conserving surgery). Patients in virtual reality group received virtual reality-based&#xD;
      exercise training using Microsoft Xbox 360 Kinect (Redmond, WA). Patients in exercise group&#xD;
      received an exercise program including range of motion, posture, stretching and breathing&#xD;
      exercises. Both exercise groups participated in the exercise program for 30- 40 minutes, 3&#xD;
      days a week, as long as radiotherapy continued (5-6 weeks). Patients in the control group did&#xD;
      not receive any exercise intervention as is done in the current practice. Assessment methods&#xD;
      were applied at the beginning and at the end of the radiotherapy for all groups. Shoulder&#xD;
      range of motion was measured using universal goniometer. Hand grip strength was measured&#xD;
      using Jamar hand dynamometer. Shoulder proprioception was measured using Cybex (Lumex,NY,USA)&#xD;
      isokinetic dynamometer. Upper extremity functional status, kinesiophobia, anxiety and&#xD;
      depression level, fatigue and quality of life were evaluated with various questionnaires.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline and after the exercise training (5-6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Turkish version of the Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire is used to evaluate functional status of upper extremities. The questionnaire consists of 30 questions. A score between 0-100 is obtained from the questionnaire. 0 point means &quot;no disability&quot;, 100 point means &quot;maximum level of disability&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Change in kinesiophobia assessed by theTampa Kinesiophobia Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after the exercise training (5-6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Turkish version of theTampa Kinesiophobia Scale was used to determine the level of kinesiophobia. 4-point Likert scoring (1 = Strongly disagree, 4 = Strongly agree) is used in the scale. After reversing items 4, 8, 12 and 16, a total score is calculated. A score between 17-68 is obtained from the scale. The higher scores indicate higher kinesiophobia level.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in anxiety and depression level assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after the exercise training (5-6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Turkish version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to determine the anxiety and depression level. The scale consists of 14 questions in total. 7 of the questions measure depression, 7 measure anxiety. A total score between 0-42 is obtained from the sum of the anxiety and depression scores. The higher scores indivate higher depression and /or anxiety.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in fatigue assessed by Piper Fatigue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after the exercise training (5-6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Turkish version of Piper Fatigue Scale was used to determine the level of fatigue. The scale consists of 22 items (0-10 points) and 4 subscales: behavioral/severitiy (6 items), affective meaning (5 items), sensory (5 items) and cognitive/mood (6 items). Each subscale is scored individually and then aggregated together for an overall score. Higher scores indicate more fatigue.&#xD;
As a result of the average score; 0 points are interpreted as no fatigue, 1-3 points mild fatigue, 4-6 points moderate fatigue, 7-10 points severe fatigue.&#xD;
There are also 5 more questions in the scale that are not used in the subscale or total score calculation. These open-ended questions are about the duration of perceived fatigue, its causes, methods to alleviate fatigue and associated symptoms. They provide qualitative data.</description>

    <measure>Change in quality of life assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after the exercise training (5-6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Turkish version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) was used to evaluate quality of life level. It contains five functioning scales (physical, social, role, cognitive, and emotional functioning), eight symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, pain, dyspnea, sleep disturbances, appetite loss, constipation, and diarrhea), financial impact, and overall quality of life. All scale scores are converted to range from 0 to 100. higher scores indicate better functioning for the functioning scales and overall quality of life; higher scores indicate higher symptom burden for the symptom scales.</description>

    <measure>Patient Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Patient satisfaction was evaluated at the end of the 5-6 week exercise training.</time_frame>
    <description>The motivation of the exercises, the state of enjoying the exercise, believing that the exercise is beneficial, and the patient's willingness to continue the exercise were evaluated with 4 questions that they could answer with Likert-type answers.</description>

Virtual reality-based exercises were done using the &quot;Microsoft Xbox 360 Kinect&quot; system. Among the 'Kinect Sports' games, especially tennis, table tennis, boxing and bowling games including upper extremity movements were selected. These games require all-directional and repetitive motion of the shoulder and elbow joint. Patients played the games using the operated / affected side arms. Between games, the patient was rested in a chair. In the meantime, deep breathing exercises were done.&#xD;
The patients participated in virtual reality-based exercises 3 days a week (15-18 sessions in total) during the radiotherapy treatment continued (5-6 weeks). Each exercise session was set to last 30-40 minutes in total.</description>

11 different exercises consisting of shoulder range of motion in all directions, stretching exercises, posture exercises and breathing exercises were performed in the presence of a physiotherapist.The patients participated in this exercise program 3 days a week (15-18 sessions in total) during the radiotherapy treatment continued (5-6 weeks). One session of the exercises was completed in an average of 30-40 minutes. The same exercises were repeated in each session.</description>
