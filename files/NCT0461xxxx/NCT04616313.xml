    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal study of the long-term health impact of e-cigarette smoking on the&#xD;
      lungs. Participants will be followed over a period of 5 years, and impacts of e-cigarette&#xD;
      smoking on the lungs will be measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using&#xD;
      hyperpolarized xenon-129 gas, pulmonary function tests, exercise capacity, computed&#xD;
      tomography images and questionnaires.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 5-year longitudinal study of the long-term lung health impact of e-cigarette&#xD;
      smoking. Participants with a history of e-cigarette smoking age ≥ 16 years will be recruited&#xD;
      from within 2 hours of London, ON through local family and tertiary care physicians,&#xD;
      emergency departments and community and social media advertisements. Asymptomatic age and&#xD;
      sex-matched participants who have never smoked e- or c-cigarettes will be recruited through&#xD;
      community advertisement, media and social media. Participants must satisfy all inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria in order to participate in the study. We will compare lung health of&#xD;
      participants at baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks and 48 weeks, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years with&#xD;
      an asymptomatic control group with no history of e-cigarette or c-cigarette use. The study&#xD;
      will involve 6 in-person visits and 1 telephone call for a health update. All measurements&#xD;
      will be made with at least 4 hours after the last cigarette and/or vape to provide a way to&#xD;
      practically focus on chronic and not acute effects. Pulmonary function and imaging&#xD;
      measurements will be made before and after bronchodilator administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 1, informed consent will be obtained before any study related assessments or&#xD;
      procedures are performed. Eligibility criteria will be reviewed. Safety assessments including&#xD;
      vital signs, pulmonary function testing, hematology, sputum sampling, exercise testing, and&#xD;
      respiratory questionnaires will be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 will take place 12 weeks after visit 1 and will include vital signs, pre and post&#xD;
      bronchodilator pulmonary function testing, pre and post bronchodilator MRI imaging, chest CT&#xD;
      scan, exercise testing, and questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 will take place at 24 weeks and will involve a telephone call to update health&#xD;
      information as well as questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4 will take place at 48 weeks and will involve vital signs, pre and post bronchodilator&#xD;
      pulmonary function testing, pre and post bronchodilator MRI imaging, hematology, blood&#xD;
      chemistry, sputum analysis, exercise testing, and questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5 will take place at year 3 and will involve vital signs, pre and post bronchodilator&#xD;
      pulmonary function testing, pre and post bronchodilator MRI imaging, blood draw, sputum&#xD;
      induction and analysis, exercise testing and questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 6 will take place at year 4 and will involve vital signs, pre and post bronchodilator&#xD;
      pulmonary function testing, pre and post bronchodilator MRI imaging, blood draw, sputum&#xD;
      induction and analysis, exercise testing and questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 7 will take place at year 5 and will involve vital signs, pre and post bronchodilator&#xD;
      pulmonary function testing, pre and post bronchodilator MRI imaging, blood draw, sputum&#xD;
      induction and analysis, exercise testing and questionnaires.&#xD;
