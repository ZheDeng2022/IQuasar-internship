  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wound is defined by the breach in dermis of the skin. It can be caused by road traffic&#xD;
      accidents, tumor excision, chronic illness like diabetes, bed sores in bedridden patients,&#xD;
      burns, insects' bites etc. Treatment goals for wound coverage includes earliest debridement,&#xD;
      dressings, local antibiotics, limb elevation, fracture fixations and wound coverage. Skin&#xD;
      graft functions both as occlusive dressing, as a skin replacement and as a stimulus for&#xD;
      healing. Even though the usage of flaps to cover the wounds has been increased recently still&#xD;
      skin grafting serves as an easiest and simplest way of covering the wound. However, skin&#xD;
      grafting introduces another wound in addition to the existing wound, the donor site wound&#xD;
      (DSW). A secondary donor-site wound (DSW) is formed after harvesting split thickness skin&#xD;
      graft which adds up with the primary wound to increase the total size of the wounds for the&#xD;
      healing process. This donor site wound cause itching, pain and cosmetic embarrassment. That&#xD;
      is why the proper and timely healing of the donor site wound is of great importance. Basic&#xD;
      management of DSWs includes conventional dressings that provides absorption of bleeding&#xD;
      solely.&#xD;

      This is a randomized control trial that will be conducted at Dr. Ruth K.M. Pfau, Civil&#xD;
      Hospital Karachi for a duration of six months after approval of the synopsis. Randomization&#xD;
      will be done using sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes (SNOSE). A sample size of&#xD;
      total 60 patients was calculated through OpenEpi. Patients will be counseled about the&#xD;
      procedure of grafting and change of dressings postoperatively. Inclusion Criteria: age&#xD;
      between 18 to 55 years, both genders, non-hypertensive patients, hemoglobin levels more than&#xD;
      10 g/dl, Platelet count above 150 to 400 × 109/L, wounds for more than 6 weeks. Exclusion&#xD;
      Criteria: Hypertensive patients, bleeding tendencies (Disorder), immune-compromised, familial&#xD;
      history of bleeding. The trial will be registered with clinical trial unit (CTU) of the Dow&#xD;
      University of Health Sciences. Statistical analyses will be done using SPSS version 21.&#xD;
      Descriptive analyses will be reported for all variables including age, gender, treatment&#xD;
      group distribution and other independent and dependent variables. Inferential statistics will&#xD;
      be reported using comparison of treatment groups using repeated measure ANOVA. P-value of&#xD;
      &lt;0.05 will be considered as significant. The expected total expenditure on the research&#xD;
      project will be twenty thousand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected with change of dressings at graft donor site wound (DSW) that is the&#xD;
      thigh. Study objectives will be discussed and explained to the patients before surgery as&#xD;
      part of their change of dressings post operatively as in routine. Potential benefits and&#xD;
      discomforts of the procedure will be explained. There is no potential adverse effects of&#xD;
      heparin on wound or patients. Participants will receive both oral and written information&#xD;
      about the study. Consent form will be filled by the participants. Questionnaire with&#xD;
      photographic assessment will be filled at every change of dressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Split-thickness skin graft will be harvested from medial side of thigh in two strips of about&#xD;
      10*6cm with a few cm break in between them, with a Humby knife adjusted on with a randomized&#xD;
      setting to harvest a fixed depth of skin graft. After harvesting the graft the donor site&#xD;
      wound will be photographed, cleaned with saline and dressed with impregnated wax gauzes and&#xD;
      sterilized cotton covered in roll gauze.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At first postoperative day, donor site cotton dressing will be opened. Heparin and&#xD;
      conventional dressing group allocation will be done through randomization in order to prevent&#xD;
      any confounding factors such as baseline differences in depth of wound. Patients will be&#xD;
      provided with paper chits to choose from, with A or B marked on it. The proximal strip of&#xD;
      donor site wound (DSW) will be dressed according to the chit chosen. Patients picking up A&#xD;
      chit will be dealt as 'control half (conventional dressing)', where by patients picking up B&#xD;
      chit will be dealt as 'intervention half'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 'control half' will be redressed with sterilized cotton covered in roll gauze whereas&#xD;
      'intervention half' of wound will be sprayed with 5000 I.U/ml concentration of the heparin&#xD;
      placed in a 5 cc syringe. Then the wound will be redressed with sterilized cotton covered in&#xD;
      roll gauze. This will be repeated on donor site 'intervention half' of wound on daily basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin graft donor site wound will be inspected by the faculty of Plastic surgery on the 7th&#xD;
      post-operative day and photographic assessment will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The visual analogue scale (VAS) will be used to access pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wound healing will be assessed by following parameters; decrease in size of wound, reduction&#xD;
      of surrounding skin edema. Senior faculty will verify the assessment of wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent Variable Demographic variable: Age, Gender, Monthly household income Medical&#xD;
      History: Blood profile, Pain Intervention: 1.Conventional dressings 2. Heparin Spray&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dependent Variable: Healing Time&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.9 Statistical Analyses: Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 21) will be&#xD;
      used for all statistical analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be reported using mean and standard deviation for all continuous&#xD;
      variables and frequencies and percentages for all categorical variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inferential Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean wound healing time (recorded in days) between two intervention groups will be compared&#xD;
      using Repeated measures ANOVA. p-value &lt;0.05 will be considered as level of significance.&#xD;
