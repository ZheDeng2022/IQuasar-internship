  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to evaluate effects of an outpatient rehabilitation program based on&#xD;
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy compared to usual care on function in patients with&#xD;
      post-concussion syndrome (PCS) and post-traumatic headache (PTH). This study builds on the&#xD;
      investigators' previous observational studies and treatment studies in this patient group.&#xD;

    <description>The patient is asked to write down activities that they have difficulty with due to their PCS/PTH. They can report up to three activities. Then they are asked to rate their current ability to complete the activity on 11-point scale from 0 &quot;unable to perform&quot; to 10 &quot;able to perform at prior level&quot;. Prior refers to the level experienced before the injury. At follow-up the activities they reported the first time are then presented to them, and they are asked to rate them on the same 11-point scale. The first activity the patient lists is used for scoring. A change of two points or more at follow-up is considered a clinically meaningful change.</description>
