  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research in acute care faces many challenges, including enrollment challenges, legal&#xD;
      limitations in data sharing, limited funding, and lack of singular ownership of the domain of&#xD;
      acute care. To overcome some of these challenges, the Center of Acute Care of the University&#xD;
      Medical Center Groningen in the Netherlands, has established a de novo data-, image- and&#xD;
      biobank named &quot;Acutelines&quot;. Acutelines is initiated to improve recognition and treatment of&#xD;
      acute diseases and obtain insight in the consequences of acute diseases, including factors&#xD;
      predicting its outcome. Thereby, Acutelines contributes to development of personalized&#xD;
      treatment and improves prediction of patient outcomes after an acute admission.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acutelines is a prospective biobank including patients with a broad spectrum of acute&#xD;
      conditions. Its aim is to facilitate interdisciplinary research on the etiology and&#xD;
      development of acute diseases with the aid of systematically collected biomaterials and&#xD;
      medical data over various timepoints, both during the course of the patient's disease and&#xD;
      after recovery. Clinical data, imaging data and biomaterial (i.e. blood, urine, feces, hair)&#xD;
      are collected for patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with a broad range of&#xD;
      acute disease presentations. A deferred consent procedure (by proxy), is in place to allow&#xD;
      collecting data and biomaterials prior to obtaining written consent. The digital&#xD;
      infrastructure in place and the software used ensures automated capturing of all bed-side&#xD;
      monitoring data (i.e. electrophysiological waveforms, vital parameters), and the secure&#xD;
      importation of data from other sources, such as the electronic health records of the&#xD;
      hospital, ambulance and general practitioner, municipal registration, health insurance&#xD;
      companies and pharmacy. Follow up data are collected for all included patients during the&#xD;
      first 72-hours of their hospitalization and 3-months, 1-year, 2-years and 5 years after their&#xD;
      ED visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and materials to be collected includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic and health data (i.e. [experiences] health, quality of life, functional&#xD;
           status)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history (i.e. co-morbidity, intoxications, medication use)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Admission reason to emergency department&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination and vital parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical diagnostic data (i.e. [point-of-care] ultrasound, X-ray, CT-scan, laboratory&#xD;
           results)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrophysiological waveforms (i.e. electrocardiogram [ECG], plethysmography)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biomaterials&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment (i.e. medication use, non-pharmacological treatment, treatment decisions,&#xD;
           length-of-stay in hospital, admission to intensive care unit [ICU])&#xD;
