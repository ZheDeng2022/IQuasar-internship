  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS) are relatively rare disorders&#xD;
      characterized by developmental delay associated to socio-communicative deficit and&#xD;
      autistic-like behaviours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WBS has been considered for a long time as the &quot;polar opposite&quot; of ASD, given their&#xD;
      hypersociable phenotype. Nonetheless, recent researches have emphasized similarities between&#xD;
      ASD and WBS phenotypes. By following some authors &quot;social abnormalities in ASD and WS can be&#xD;
      characterized in terms of analogous difficulties in social cognition), and distinct patterns&#xD;
      of social motivation which appears to be reduced in ASD and enhanced in WBS&quot;. More than&#xD;
      opposite condition, these authors suggests that WBS and ASD could share the same difficult in&#xD;
      comprehension of social relationship, with opposite pattern of social engagement (enhanced in&#xD;
      WBS and weakened ASD). Given, these similarities authors suggest testing the feasibility and&#xD;
      validity of therapy for ASD in children with WBS. Parent Mediated Therapy (PMT) is a group of&#xD;
      &quot;technique-focused interventions where the parent is the agent of change and the child is the&#xD;
      direct beneficiary of treatment&quot;. PMT demonstrated evidence of effectiveness in&#xD;
      socio-communicational improvement for children with ASD in a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some recent researchers have extended the use of PMT to children with genetic disorders and&#xD;
      autistic features, such as FXS. While showing encouraging results, the samples of research&#xD;
      were limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They main aim of this research is to to verify effectiveness of Cooperative PMT (CMPT) for&#xD;
      socio-communicative deficit in children with FXS and WBS. Our hypothesis is that CPMT, in&#xD;
      addition to conventional rehabilitation therapies (mainly speech therapy and occupational&#xD;
      therapies), could contribute to the enhancement of socio-communicative skills and the&#xD;
      reduction of behavioural problems. We also expected also an improvement in family quality of&#xD;
      life and a reduction of parental stress.&#xD;

      Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS) are relatively rare disorders&#xD;
      characterized by developmental delay associated to socio-communicative deficit and&#xD;
      autistic-like behaviours. FXS is one of the most common monogenetic cause of syndromic Autism&#xD;
      Spectrum Disorder (ASD); up to 60% of males with FXS meet criteria for ASD. Furthermore,&#xD;
      around 30%- 35% of children with WBS meet criteria for ASD. WBS has been considered for a&#xD;
      long time as the &quot;polar opposite&quot; of ASD, given their hypersociable phenotype and their&#xD;
      abnormal interest in social engagement. Nonetheless, recent researches have emphasized&#xD;
      similarities between ASD and WBS phenotypes. By following Vivanti &quot;social abnormalities in&#xD;
      ASD and WS can be characterized in terms of analogous difficulties in social cognition (the&#xD;
      ability to read others' behaviour), and distinct patterns of social motivation (the&#xD;
      propensity for social approach/engagement) which appears to be reduced in ASD and enhanced in&#xD;
      WS&quot;. More than opposite condition, VIvanti suggests that WBS and ASD could share the same&#xD;
      difficult in comprehension of social relationship, with opposite pattern of social engagement&#xD;
      (enhanced in WBS and weakened ASD). Moreover, some researches showed that children with WS&#xD;
      were similarly delayed in global adaptive functioning when compared to ones with ASD. Given,&#xD;
      these similarities authors suggest to test the feasibility and validity of therapy for ASD in&#xD;
      children with WBS. Parent Mediated Therapy (PMT) is a group of &quot;technique-focused&#xD;
      interventions where the parent is the agent of change and the child is the direct beneficiary&#xD;
      of treatment&quot;. Italian Guidelines for ASD highlight the importance of PMT for ASD treatment.&#xD;
      PMT is also strongly recommended by NICE Clinical Guideline CG170 and WHO Mental Health Gap&#xD;
      Action Program. PMT has showed evidence of effectiveness in short and long-term symptom&#xD;
      reduction in young children with ASD. A research project on the effectiveness of PMT for&#xD;
      children with ASD has been activated since 10 years at the Bambino Gesù Children Hospital&#xD;
      (BGCH) in Rome. In last years, a semi-manualized intervention called &quot;Cooperative Parent&#xD;
      Mediated Therapy&quot; (CPMT) has been systematized. Following Bearss' Parent Training taxonomy,&#xD;
      CPMT is a targeted parent-mediated intervention focused on the ASD core symptoms. CPMT is&#xD;
      based on the most significant models of parent training for ASD, in the perspective of&#xD;
      Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions-NDBI with specific attention to the&#xD;
      promotion of cooperative interactions. The aim of CPMT is to improve parental skills, to&#xD;
      enable parents promoting the following seven target skills in their child: socio-emotional&#xD;
      engagement, emotional regulation, imitation, communication, joint attention, play and&#xD;
      cognitive flexibility and cooperative interaction. An individualized treatment plan is&#xD;
      designed for each child in order to determine his developmental level and treatment goals.&#xD;
      CMPT usually last 6 months, for a total amount of 15 sessions of 90 min; twelve core sessions&#xD;
      (one session per week) are delivered in the first 3 months, followed by 3 monthly booster&#xD;
      sessions. Each weekly core session had a specific focus and specific intervention strategies&#xD;
      based on active parent coaching during parent-child interaction, and included the&#xD;
      parent-child dyad with the parent being actively coached by a trained therapist. Live active&#xD;
      coaching increases parents' competence in implementing strategies to enhance child&#xD;
      development, and at the same time increases their confidence. This intervention has&#xD;
      demonstrated evidence of effectiveness in socio-communicational improvement as measured by&#xD;
      ADOS-G in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). On this purpose, some recent researchers have&#xD;
      extended the use of PMT to children with genetic disorders and autistic features, such as&#xD;
      Fragile X Syndrome (Vismara et al., 2019). While showing encouraging results, the samples of&#xD;
      research were limited (four participants); moreover, parent coaching took place mainly&#xD;
      through digital services (e.g. video call). Authors suggest implementing RCTs with larger&#xD;
      samples in order to evaluate validity of PMT for individuals with FXS. Moreover, as far as we&#xD;
      know, there are currently no researches of PMT in patients with WBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2017, an experimental, non-pharmacological, randomized, controlled monocentric and&#xD;
      non-profit study was started at BGCH in order to verify effectiveness of CPMT for&#xD;
      socio-communicative deficit in children with FXS and WBS. Our hypothesis is that CPMT, in&#xD;
      addition to conventional rehabilitation therapies (mainly speech therapy and occupational&#xD;
      therapies), could contribute to the enhancement of socio-communicative skills and the&#xD;
      reduction of behavioural problems. We also expected also an improvement in family quality of&#xD;
      life and a reduction of parental stress. The intervention is provided by psychologists with&#xD;
      specific training and expertise in CPMT and monitored through supervision by a senior child&#xD;
      psychiatrist&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment: Children and their family will be evaluated at two time-points, pre randomization&#xD;
      (T0) and six months later, at the end of control/treatment period (T1), by means of following&#xD;
