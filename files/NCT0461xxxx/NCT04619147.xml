      This study will be a descriptive, retrospective evaluation and analysis of invasive fungal&#xD;
      infections (IFI) conducted in patients who underwent allogeneic haematopoiectic stem cell&#xD;
      transplant (aHSCT) in a single tertiary transplant centre, the Bone Marrow Transplant&#xD;
      Clinical Service across Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (PMCC) and Royal Melbourne Hospital&#xD;
      (RMH), Victoria, Australia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) remain a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in&#xD;
      immunosuppressed patients who undergo allogenic haematopoiectic stem cell transplant (aHSCT).&#xD;
      Both yeast and moulds cause serious IFIs in this cohort of patients, especially during the&#xD;
      pre-engraftment neutropenic phase, and post-engraftment period when patients need to be on&#xD;
      prolonged course of corticosteroids for severe graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). Other risk&#xD;
      factors for IFIs include environmental factors, genetic factors, and co-viral infections.&#xD;
      Candida spp accounts for most of the invasive yeast infections whereas Aspergillus spp is the&#xD;
      most common mould in aHSCT recipients. The estimated incidence of proven and probable&#xD;
      invasive Candida infections without antifungal prophylaxis ranged from 8% to 24%; on the&#xD;
      other hand the incidence of invasive aspergillosis was reported to be in between 3% to 14%.&#xD;
      IFIs are often associated with mortality rate as high as 60%, and have been identified as one&#xD;
      of the independent predictors of death in multivariate analysis. Other complications include&#xD;
      extended hospital stay from invasive fungal infections, intensive care admissions, huge&#xD;
      treatment cost and significant morbidity and reduced quality of life in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antifungal prophylaxis with fluconazole in aHSCT recipient has become a routine in the 1990s&#xD;
      after several studies demonstrated fits efficacy in reducing morbidity and mortality in this&#xD;
      group of patients. In 2007 two multi-centres, double-blinded trials, involving either aHSCT&#xD;
      patients with GVHD or non-transplantation patients with haematologic malignancy and prolonged&#xD;
      neutropenia, proved superiority of the mould-active agent with posaconazole to fluconazole in&#xD;
      preventing invasive aspergillosis and death from IFI. This finding was further confirmed by a&#xD;
      systemic review and meta-analysis in 2012 that included 20 randomised trials, comparing&#xD;
      mould-active prophylaxis with fluconazole prophylaxis in aHSCT recipients or patients with&#xD;
      haematologic malignancy receiving chemotherapy. Consequently, current Australian guideline&#xD;
      proposed that all patients at high risk of IFIs (&gt;10%) be administered mould-active&#xD;
      antifungal prophylaxis, and these patients include aHSCT recipients with expected neutropenia&#xD;
      of &gt;14 days, extensive chronic GVHD, severe steroid refractory or dependent GVHD and patients&#xD;
      with acute leukaemia or myelodysplasia who are undergoing induction or re-induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Broad-spectrum triazole posaconazole is the recommended first-line therapy,&#xD;
      with other triazoles such as voriconazole, itraconazole or echinocandin as alternative&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Australia, until 2015 posaconazole was only available in liquid form. Posaconazole&#xD;
      suspension needs to be taken with high-fat meal or supplements to enhance its absorption. The&#xD;
      unpredictable absorption of the suspension, especially in patients with mucositis or&#xD;
      neutropenic colitis from chemotherapy prompted the recommendation of monitoring the trough&#xD;
      posaconazole level. However in Victoria, this assay was not widely available and the&#xD;
      turnaround time was often long, hence it could not be performed in real-time fashion for&#xD;
      optimal management. A delayed-release tablet formulation of posaconazole was approved by TGA&#xD;
      in 2013 and it was added to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) in Australia in&#xD;
      mid-2015. At the same time an intravenous formulation was also approved by TGA. The tablet&#xD;
      formulation has improved bioavailability as its absorption was not dependent upon high fat or&#xD;
      supplement content like its liquid counterpart, and it is anticipated that its administration&#xD;
      will likely result in therapeutic drug levels. As a result routine therapeutic drug&#xD;
      monitoring is not required during prophylaxis with posaconazole tablets. The availability of&#xD;
      the intravenous and tablet formulation may have a positive impact on the rates of IFIs,&#xD;
      however this has not been formally reviewed in Australia. Patients on posaconazole&#xD;
      prophylaxis with the Bone Marrow Transplant Clinical Service are currently on either tablets&#xD;
      or the intravenous formulation (if patients have factors that impaired oral intake).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the introduction of mould-active antifungal prophylaxis has reduced the incidence of&#xD;
      IFIs significantly, there have been numerous studies reporting on the changing epidemiology&#xD;
      of these infections and concerns raised over the rates of breakthrough IFIs and emergence of&#xD;
      azole-resistant strains, including non-albicans species of invasive candidiasis. Winston et&#xD;
      al reported of a breakthrough IFI rate 7.5% while on posaconazole liquid formulation, and&#xD;
      this finding was consistent with some European studies, which found incidence of 3-14% of&#xD;
      breakthrough invasive mould disease. On the other hand, Tverdek et al reported a much&#xD;
      improved rate of breakthrough IFI of 2% in 343 patients who received intravenous or&#xD;
      delay-released tablet formulation of posaconazole, suggesting that these new formulations&#xD;
      resulted in better absorption of the medication with direct implication on rates of IFI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the studies mentioned above, that reported incidence of IFIs in the era of&#xD;
      mold-active antifungal prophylaxis, were conducted in the United States or Europe.&#xD;
      Specifically there has not been a study done locally in Australia looking at this question,&#xD;
      including breakthrough IFIs. The epidemiology of fungal isolates in Australia may be very&#xD;
      different compared to that of European or American continents. For example there have been&#xD;
      reports of higher incidence of systemic infection due to Lomentospora prolificans in&#xD;
      Australia and Spain, involving patients with acute leukemia or with aHSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The introduction of the posaconazole tablets may have improved IFI breakthrough rates in our&#xD;
      local Bone Marrow Transplant Centre, although this has not yet been examined. Anecdotal&#xD;
      evidence suggests that the rates of posaconazole therapeutic drug monitoring at our&#xD;
      institution are low, but again this has not been formally documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is imperative to evaluate the epidemiology of these infections in this cohort in the new&#xD;
      era of posaconazole prophylaxis, to monitor the rates of breakthrough IFIs and if there is&#xD;
      emergence of azole-resistance fungal isolates in the Australian context. This study aims to&#xD;
      establish an overview of IFIs in patients receiving stem cell transplant. Not only will it&#xD;
      provide invaluable information on local epidemiology and microbiology of invasive fungal&#xD;
      infections, it will also enable more appropriate planning of antifungal prophylaxis&#xD;
      strategies in these high-risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study's hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Invasive fungal infections remain an ongoing challenge and one of leading sources of&#xD;
           morbidity and mortality post allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (aHSCT)&#xD;
           despite the widespread use of anti-mould prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvements could be made in the prophylaxis, treatment and monitoring of fungal&#xD;
           infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Knowledge of local epidemiology could inform efforts to improve current practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe the epidemiology of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) in patients undergoing&#xD;
           allogeneic haematopoiectic stem cell transplant (aHSCT) in the era of antifungal&#xD;
           prophylaxis with posaconazole delay-released tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To report the incidence of IFIs, and in particular breakthrough IFIs in this cohort of&#xD;
           high-risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To identify the risk factors of acquiring IFIs in this cohort of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the current practice and use of antifungal agents as prophylaxis, the&#xD;
           reasons for selection, the frequency of therapeutic drug monitoring, adverse effects and&#xD;
           appropriateness of antifungal prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine the all-cause mortality rate and fungal infections related death following&#xD;
           aHSCT at 3, 6 and 12 months post aHSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To identify areas of current divergence from best practice in the prevention and&#xD;
           treatment of invasive fungal infections in patients receiving allogeneic HCT.&#xD;
