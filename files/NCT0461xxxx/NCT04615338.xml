      It is an observational descriptive, retrospective study. The study will be conducted in two&#xD;
      centers: the Emergency and accident unit and Head and neck surgical unit Manchester Royal&#xD;
      infirmary, Manchester, United Kingdom and Trauma unit and Otolaryngology department Assiut&#xD;
      university Hospital, Assiut, Egypt. The study will include all the patients presented to both&#xD;
      centers with open neck trauma in duration between April 2018 and October 2020. The following&#xD;
      items recorded: gender, age, type of trauma (whether it is homicidal, suicidal, accidental&#xD;
      trauma), time of the day the patients presented, Previous philological disorder in patients&#xD;
      with suicidal types of trauma, number of neck wounds, site of the wounds ( in relation to the&#xD;
      zones of the neck), size of each wound in centimeter, whether the wounds are deep or&#xD;
      superficial to platysma, length of stay in the hospital, , injuries to any neck structures&#xD;
      injuries in other parts of the body, involvement of other teams in management of the patent&#xD;
      and type of involvement. Also the need of airway support (either intubation or tracheostomy),&#xD;
      immediate and long term complications of the injury and if the patients needed neck&#xD;
      exploration or just suturing of the wounds under local anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data of the patients who needed exploration will be reviewed to detect finding in neck&#xD;
      exploration and try to find out the criteria of the patients who needed neck exploration and&#xD;
      put a clear protocol for management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The included patients will be categorized into 3 groups according to type of trauma&#xD;
      (suicidal, homicidal or accidental) all the recorded data will be compared to detect the&#xD;
      outcomes in each type of trauma and if there is a specific pattern of trauma in each&#xD;
      category.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted after obtaining an institutional review board (IRB) approval from&#xD;
      the committee of medical ethics, faculty of medicine, Assiut University. The study and all&#xD;
      interventions and surgical procedures within it were done by scientifically qualified and&#xD;
      trained personnel. The is no additional risk for participating in the study as it is a&#xD;
      descriptive study&#xD;
