      Prospective, multi-centre, open-label, single-armed, non-interventional observational&#xD;
      clinical investigation designed to enrol 2000 octo- and nonagenerian all-comer patients with&#xD;
      coro-nary artery disease in up to 37 sites in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. Patients&#xD;
      underwent PCI using at least one Supraflex Cruz Sirolimus Eluting stent as per current&#xD;
      practice and will be followed up for 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicentre, open-label, single-armed, non-interventional&#xD;
      observa-tional clinical investigation in aged patients (≥80 years) undergoing PCI using at&#xD;
      least one Supraflex sirolimus eluting stent as per current practice. The registry is an&#xD;
      observational study and patient's participation in this study has no impact on his or her&#xD;
      indication for treatment, diagnostics, or therapy. Subjects are supposed to be treated&#xD;
      according to cur-rent guidelines and the site's internal directives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion in the registry is completely independent of the medical treatment. All products&#xD;
      used for the medical treatment should be administered as stated in their SmPCs (Sum-mary of&#xD;
      Product Characteristics) and/or Instructions for Use (IFU). Treatment pattern and treatment&#xD;
      initiation, continuation, or changes are solely at the discretion of the physician and the&#xD;
      patient. There will be no attempt to influence the treatment patterns of any indi-vidual&#xD;
      treating physician. All drug subscriptions applied will be in the usual standard of care.&#xD;
      Participation in the registry will in no way influence payment or reimbursement for any&#xD;
      treatment received by subjects during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted about 37 sites in Germany, Switzerland and Austria and 2000&#xD;
      subjects will be included. A total study duration of about 39 months is assumed, of which&#xD;
      about 18 months account for enrolment and 12 months for the follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible are all patients with chronic- (CCS) or acute- Non-ST-elevation coronary syndrome&#xD;
      (NSTE-ACS) and target lesion suitable for PCI with drug-eluting stent (see section 6.3 for&#xD;
      detailed eligibility criteria) undergoing PCI using at least one SUPRAFLEX CRUZ™ Sirolimus&#xD;
      eluting coronary stent system as per current practice, who will visit consecutively a&#xD;
      partici-pating investigation site. It is planned to enroll about 2000 patients in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following discharge, patients will be treated according to clinical routine/guidelines.&#xD;
      Hence, no study-specific pre-planned procedures will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the primary endpoint, all patients will receive telephone calls at 6 and 12 months&#xD;
      following index procedure and will be interviewed by means of a standardized patient&#xD;
      interview by the investigation sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On-site monitoring will be performed (about 1.5 visits per site; risk-based approach).&#xD;
      Dur-ing on-site monitoring, the monitor will verify patient informed consent documentation&#xD;
      and perform source data verification against the patient's medical records. In addition, an&#xD;
      attempt will be made to check the consecutiveness of patient enrolment at the site, fully&#xD;
      respecting privacy and personal data of subjects who are not enrolled in the registry and&#xD;
      consequently have not given informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be captured at three time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline (e.g. site and patient characteristics, index procedure, events, etc.),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6-months FU (e.g. vital status, endpoint-related events, quality of life, adverse&#xD;
           events, etc.) and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12-months FU (e.g. vital status, endpoint-related events, quality of life, adverse&#xD;
           events, etc.)&#xD;

    <description>Investigational device: SUPRAFLEX CRUZ™ Sirolimus eluting Coronary Stent System The SUPRAFLEX CRUZ™ Sirolimus eluting coronary stent system consists of a balloon ex-pandable Sirolimus eluting stent, premounted on a stent delivery system. The active pharmaceutical ingredient in the SUPRAFLEX CRUZ™ Sirolimus eluting coronary stent is Sirolimus (also known as Rapamycin).&#xD;
The SUPRAFLEX CRUZ™ Sirolimus eluting coronary stent system is indicated for improving coronary luminal diameter in patients with symptomatic Ischemic heart disease due to discrete de-novo stenotic lesions and in-stent restenotic lesions in native coronary arter-ies with a reference vessel diameter of 2.00 mm to 4.50 mm.</description>
