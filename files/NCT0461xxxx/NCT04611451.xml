      Whole body vibration (WBV), which is a new treatment method and applied through the device,&#xD;
      is defined as mechanical repetitive motion or oscillatory motion occurring around a balance&#xD;
      point (5). Chronic nonspecific low back pain is still a serious clinical, social and economic&#xD;
      health problem. There are few studies and limited evidence evaluating the effectiveness of&#xD;
      WBV exercises in chronic nonspecific low back pain. Different protocols are used for wbv&#xD;
      exercise in studies (6). Our aim is to compare the effects of whole body vibration exercise&#xD;
      modality on pain, functional recovery, laboor impact, quality of life with control group in&#xD;
      patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a prevalent problem all over the World. low back pain prevalence is 84% by&#xD;
      lifetime Chronic low back pain prevalence is 23%. Low back pain causing disability prevalence&#xD;
      is also11% (1). Increasing sedentary lifestyle and obesity, aging of the population and&#xD;
      inappropriate ergonomic work activities and working environment in the working society&#xD;
      contribute to this increase (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic low back pain is an important cause of labor losses and also it is the most common&#xD;
      functional insufficiency under 45 years of age (3). Treatment approaches such as exercise and&#xD;
      education in which the patient is actively involved in the treatment are recommended for the&#xD;
      treatment of non-specific acute, subacute and especially chronic low back pain (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole body vibration (WBV), which is a new treatment method and applied through the device,&#xD;
      is defined as mechanical repetitive motion or oscillatory motion occurring around a balance&#xD;
      point (5). Chronic nonspecific low back pain is still a serious clinical, social and economic&#xD;
      health problem. There are few studies and limited evidence evaluating the effectiveness of&#xD;
      WBV exercises in chronic nonspecific low back pain. Different protocols are used for wbv&#xD;
      exercise in studies (6). Our aim is to compare the effects of whole body vibration exercise&#xD;
      modality on pain, functional recovery, laboor impact, quality of life with control group in&#xD;
      patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERYAL METHOD&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, randomized and controlled study include 70 patients who were diagnosed&#xD;
      chronic nonspecific low back pain. Patients were randomized into two groups using the 1:1&#xD;
      method. The first group was the treatment group in which applied the whole body vibration&#xD;
      exercise and classical lumbar home exercise program. The second group (control) only received&#xD;
      classical lumbar home exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criterias are non-specific LBP (LBP other than those excluded, see exclusion&#xD;
      criteria below) of a more than 3 months in patients aged 20 to 50 years, with average pain&#xD;
      intensity evaluated Visaual Analog Scale (VAS) (1-10) that is higher than 5 Exclusion&#xD;
      criterias are participants with likely specific causes of LBP This includes exclusion of&#xD;
      history of malignancy, history of recent spinal surgery, dislocation, fracture, rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and history of weakness of lower extremity or loss of&#xD;
      sensation in lower extremity. Additionally, current pregnancy, , lactation, uncontrolled&#xD;
      hypertension and history of diagnosed mental health conditions that would limit adherence to&#xD;
      the trial procedures will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the TVT exercise group; 24 sessions of TVT exercise 3 days a week (with at least&#xD;
      1 day of rest between each session) was performed under the supervision of a physician for a&#xD;
      total of 8 weeks. . The vibration was given by the Power Plate® (pro5TM; Power Plate North&#xD;
      America, Inc., Northbrook, IL, USA) device where a three-plan oscillation took place (most&#xD;
      vertical, Z-axis).The Istanbul Low Back Pain Disability index is a self-reported measure of&#xD;
      functional disability . The Istanbul Low Back Pain Disability index has reliability and&#xD;
      validit(7). Quality of life was assessed using Short form-36 (SF-36). SF-36 is a widely used&#xD;
      and validated scale in assessing quality of life. It is not specific to any disease group.&#xD;
      Health and Labor Questionnaire (HLQ) was used in our study to evaluate job performance. HLQ&#xD;
      is designed to collect quantitative data on the treatment of disease and its relationship to&#xD;
      work performance. Intercultural adaptation was made to Turkish. HLQ data allow to estimate&#xD;
      the production losses (costs) of paid and unpaid labor (8).&#xD;
