  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In cardiovascular surgery, the most common and serious complication is postoperative wound&#xD;
      infection. The most formidable wound complication is mediastinitis, the frequency of which&#xD;
      varies from 1 to 3%. Currently, mortality in this group of patients varies from 3.5 to 58.3%.&#xD;
      In this regard, the relevance of developing new methods for the prevention and treatment of&#xD;
      infectious wound complications is beyond doubt. In this study, it is supposed to examine and&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of the combined effects of air-plasma flow and nitric oxide in the&#xD;
      treatment of postoperative infectious complications in cardiac surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the most common and serious complications in cardiovascular surgery is sternal wound&#xD;
      infection. According to many authors, the incidence of infectious complications after&#xD;
      sternotomy ranges from 0.4% to 15% . Superficial infection of the anterior chest wall after&#xD;
      median sternotomy occurs in 0.4-15% . Typically, this complication is detected within the&#xD;
      first two weeks (on average, about seven days). The most formidable wound infectious&#xD;
      complication is mediastinitis. According to various authors, the incidence of mediastinitis&#xD;
      varies from 1 to 3%. Mortality in this group of patients reaches 39% . Until now, the only&#xD;
      effective and generally accepted method for treating patients with mediastinitis has been&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy in combination with surgical intervention. The options for antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy remain generally accepted and their effectiveness is not discussed, however, there&#xD;
      are many options for various types of surgical treatment. Their main principle is to perform&#xD;
      resternotomy, necrosectomy, followed by reosteosynthesis of the sternum and the installation&#xD;
      of permanent irrigation and aspiration, flow-through drainage. Despite this, the mortality&#xD;
      rate in this pathology remains invariably high. In this regard, issues related to the&#xD;
      development of new medical technologies, methods for prevention and treatment of infectious&#xD;
      wound complications do not lose their relevance at the present time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, it is supposed to use an original method developed for the prevention, as&#xD;
      well as for the treatment of wound infectious complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantage of the investigator's proposed original method of treating mediastinitis is in&#xD;
      the combined effect of thermal (air-plasma flow) and biochemical (effect of NO on wound&#xD;
      surfaces) by stimulating the processes of regeneration and repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, for obvious reasons, resistance cannot arise to it, which is relevant in the context of&#xD;
      the widespread transmission of nosocomial infections, especially in large hospitals, such as&#xD;
      modern cardiology dispensaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of the work, the cases of infectious wound complications in the early&#xD;
      postoperative period, the total number of bed-days spent, the time spent in the ICU, the&#xD;
      duration of mechanical ventilation, laboratory parameters: red blood cell count, coagulation&#xD;
      system, markers of infection and inflammation, state of sepsis, determination of how fast the&#xD;
      bone tissue reparation is, CT scan of the chest, sternum, examination of the bacterial flora&#xD;
      and bacterial contamination of the postoperative wound will be assessed.&#xD;
