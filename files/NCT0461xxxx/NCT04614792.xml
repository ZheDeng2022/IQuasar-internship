  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In response to &quot;conscious&quot; EEG findings related to detectable cognitive function that&#xD;
      reliably denote awareness in vegetative state patients, in the current study, we will assess&#xD;
      the covert conscious EEG activity (as well as standard clinical overt measures) and&#xD;
      neuroplasctic propensity (i.e., changes in EEG spectral power synchronization values&#xD;
      following tDCS intervention) in vegetative-state patients receiving repetitive transcranial&#xD;
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) treatment over frontal motor areas for a period of two&#xD;
      weeks. In support of this approach, a recent tDCS study with vegetative and minimally&#xD;
      conscious patients implied that a twenty minutes anodal stimulation (i.e., excitatory&#xD;
      stimulation) to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) significantly increased CRS-R&#xD;
      scores versus sham (placebo: non-active stimulation) stimulation condition. It was noted that&#xD;
      this tDCS effect was more pronounced in minimally conscious state patients versus vegetative&#xD;
      state patients excluding effects of chronicity or etiology. Thus, the investigators in this&#xD;
      study suggested that tDCS could be effective in improving cognitive recovery in severely&#xD;
      brain-injured patients. However, their findings would benefit neural activation correlates&#xD;
      that could support their conclusion regarding the effectiveness of this type of non-invasive&#xD;
      intervention in promoting neurocognitive recovery. Most importantly, tDCS is safe for use in&#xD;
      humans, has no adverse effects, is considered the most non-invasive transcranial stimulation&#xD;
      method because it uses extremely weak currents (0.5 to 2 mA), and, is known to only&#xD;
      temporarily shift the neuron's membrane potential towards excitation/inhibition. In regard to&#xD;
      the method's potential to induce functional recovery in vegetative state patients, recent&#xD;
      clinical studies indicate that tDCS could counteract the negative effects of brain damage by&#xD;
      influencing neurophysiological mechanisms, and is likely to contribute to the &quot;formation of&#xD;
      functionally meaningful connections and the maintenance of existing pathways&quot; .&#xD;

    <measure>JFK COMA RECOVERY SCALE - REVISED</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>JFK Coma recovery Scale - Revised scores for diagnosing disorders of consciousness. This cynical assessment scale examines reflexive behaviors such as response to pain and startle, and touch. The CRS consists of 25 hierarchically arranged items that comprise 6 subscales addressing auditory, visual, motor, oro- motor, communication, and arousal processes. Scoring is based on the presence or absence of specific behavioral responses to sensory stimuli administered in a standardized manner. The lowest item on each subscale represents reflexive activity, whereas the highest items represent cognitively mediated behaviors. sub scales represent motor function, auditory function, visual function sub scales and arousal sub scales. The low scores indicate low levels of functioning and the higher score indicate high levels of function an awareness. Maximum score is 23 and a minimal score is 0.</description>
