  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children born with severe brain-based developmental disabilities frequently experience&#xD;
      persistent unexplained periods of pain and irritability, often compounded by a limited&#xD;
      capacity to communicate their distress. The investigators call this entity Pain and&#xD;
      Irritability of Unknown Origin (PIUO). The rationale of this trial is to identify the&#xD;
      clinical effect size of gabapentin in reducing and resolving pain in children with&#xD;
      developmental brain disorders, specifically those with severe neurological impairment (SNI).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with SNI may experience nociceptive-inflammatory pain as a result of their specific&#xD;
      medical condition or procedures. Often, however, it is not clear what underlies the pain&#xD;
      behavior as there is no clear inciting noxious event. The investigators define this entity of&#xD;
      pain without an obvious source as Pain and Irritability of Unknown Origin (PIUO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' work to date has developed an efficient, focused clinical pathway to&#xD;
      evaluate children with SNI for all potential sources of nociceptive-inflammatory pain. Using&#xD;
      this approach the &quot;unknown&quot; element of pain in these children is reduced and a source of PIUO&#xD;
      may be found in individual cases, increasing the potential for treatment. Nevertheless there&#xD;
      are children, who at the end of a thorough evaluation guided by a clinical pathway, will&#xD;
      still have PIUO. These children may benefit from adjuvant analgesics such as gabapentin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evidence base supporting the use of gabapentin for pain and irritability in infants and&#xD;
      children with neurological impairment rests on case series publications describing a limited&#xD;
      number of retrospective cases. The lack of prospective, randomized studies, even for this&#xD;
      commonly used medication, underpins the rationale for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the pilot trial is to evaluate the clinically significant difference&#xD;
      of gabapentin to decrease pain and irritability in children with SNI, when the source of pain&#xD;
      and irritability is attributed to neurological dysregulation (nociplastic pain), as measured&#xD;
      by parent-reported pain scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will compare the gabapentin versus placebo along an escalating dose range&#xD;
      for both individual subjects and for the group. The investigators will aggregate the results&#xD;
      of the completed N-of-1 trials across all subjects to estimate the group level comparative&#xD;
      effectiveness of gabapentin in reducing pain and irritability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes from this study will help with designing larger randomized control trials,&#xD;
      especially with sample size and power calculations. It will also provide prospective&#xD;
      information on drug effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial uses a single randomized multiple-measures cross-over design (N-of-1), with&#xD;
      results aggregated over several subjects. This design is well-suited to outcomes that are&#xD;
      highly specific to each individual and not amenable to precise measurement across a large&#xD;
      cohort. The heterogenous nature of pain and irritability responses in children are more&#xD;
      likely to be personally specific and characteristic, rather than generalizable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will switch between gabapentin (G) and placebo (P) in a randomized order. The&#xD;
      sequence of whether G precedes P (GP) or P precedes G (PG) will be randomized by the study&#xD;
      pharmacist, and neither the clinician nor the subject (parent/caregiver) will know the&#xD;
      sequence. Each subject will serve as their own control and experiment, allowing for a finer&#xD;
      assessment of the treatment efficacy within each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary variable assessed is the child's pain score. Pain and irritability will be&#xD;
      measured using the Non-Communicating Children's Pain Checklist - Revised (NCCPC-R) at&#xD;
      specified intervals throughout the randomized sequence of G : P. Additional measures of&#xD;
      parent/caregiver burden and impact on their daily function will be undertaken weekly with the&#xD;
      PROMIS-57, a tool adapted to measure the impact of the child's pain and irritability on&#xD;
      parental functioning. Other measures will be of usual, known side effects (e.g., sedation)&#xD;
      and of any unexpected adverse events.&#xD;

The starting dose of gabapentin will be 5 mg/kg administered as oral liquid or via gastric or jejunal routes. On Day 1 of the study, the gabapentin will be administered once at bedtime and then increased according to a preset schedule. The dose will be increased every 3rd - 4th day in a step wise fashion of 13% - 50%, starting with the evening dose in order to accommodate sedation. The maximum dose for subjects will be as follows: &lt; 15 kg to 60 mg/kg day and ≥15 kg to 45 mg/kg/day.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Children aged 6 months to 18 years with SNI (from any cause) with unexplained pain and&#xD;
             irritability and whose cognitive or communication impairments prevent determination of&#xD;
             pain location, cause, and type will be eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible children will have cognitive impairment or be non-verbal and have severe&#xD;
             levels of disability equivalent to Gross Motor Functional Classification System&#xD;
