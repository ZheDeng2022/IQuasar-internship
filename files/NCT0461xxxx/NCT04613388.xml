      The aim is to record and document a mediastinal PT and the corresponding follow-up data&#xD;
      (effectiveness and side effects). General recommendations for planning and feasibility are&#xD;
      made within the framework of this study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Improvements in multimodal therapy have resulted in high curation rates in lymphoma patients.&#xD;
      In addition, these cancer entities (Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma) often affect&#xD;
      very young patients. Due to the high healing rates, the long-term effects of therapy are&#xD;
      increasingly coming into focus: more than 40% of patients suffer from chronic,&#xD;
      therapy-associated secondary diseases 30 years after successful therapy [1]. For this reason,&#xD;
      an important focus of current research is the reduction of therapy-associated toxicity. A&#xD;
      certain trend of dose reduction and reduction of the radiation fields (involved-field,&#xD;
      involved-node, involved-site radiation) can already be seen in the research results of the&#xD;
      last decades. Another interesting approach to protecting adjacent organs is the use of modern&#xD;
      radiation techniques such as particle therapy with protons (PT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of radiation in the mediastinal area in particular, the use of PT can greatly&#xD;
      reduce the dose in the area of the heart muscle, the lungs or the mammary gland tissue&#xD;
      compared to conventional radiation with photons. It is hoped that this will result in a&#xD;
      decrease, especially in chronic side effects, in the area of these organs. Since this is a&#xD;
      group of young patients with intensive pre-treatment with chemotherapeutic agents, a&#xD;
      reduction in long-term toxicities is of particular importance. In particular, cardiac and&#xD;
      pulmonary long-term side effects as well as a reduction in the secondary malignancy rate play&#xD;
      a major role in this collective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this prospective registry study on proton radiotherapy for mediastinal lymphomas&#xD;
      is to record the frequency, feasibility and side effects after PT in this group of patients.&#xD;
      These data should then serve as the basis for concrete therapy recommendations and assessment&#xD;
      of side effects. Close cooperation with the study groups should also enable a comparative&#xD;
      analysis of comparable patients who were not treated with protons at a later point in time.&#xD;

        Patients with mediastinal lymphoma are recorded who require consolidating mediastinal&#xD;
        radiotherapy as part of their primary therapy. Since there is no intervention in the&#xD;
        registry study, patients who are being treated in a therapy study (e.g. in the context of&#xD;
        the ongoing Hodgkin studies) can also be included.&#xD;
