    <textblock>
      The influenza virus is a significant cause of morbidity in adult solid organ transplant (SOT)&#xD;
      recipients. However, these individuals show a suboptimal response to vaccines including the&#xD;
      standard-dose (SD) inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV). Recent studies have investigated two&#xD;
      strategies to overcome poor immune responses in SOT recipients: (1) administration of&#xD;
      high-dose (HD)-IIV compared to SD-IIV and (2) two doses of SD-IIV compared to one dose of&#xD;
      SD-IIV in the same influenza season. The first study compared HD-IIV vs. SD-IIV in adult SOT&#xD;
      and noted HD-IIV was safe and reported higher immunogenicity; however, the median&#xD;
      post-transplant period was 38 months. In another phase II trial of adult SOT recipients, two&#xD;
      doses of SD-IIV a month apart compared to one-dose SD-IIV revealed increased immunogenicity,&#xD;
      with a median post-transplantation period of 18 months. Therefore, these studies lack&#xD;
      evaluation in the early post-transplantation period in this vulnerable population when&#xD;
      influenza disease is most severe. The administration of two-doses of HD-IIV in the same&#xD;
      influenza season has also not been studied in SOT recipients. Moreover, the vast majority of&#xD;
      SOT influenza vaccinations studies have not substantively evaluated prolonged immunogenicity.&#xD;
      Thus, the optimal immunization strategy for SOT recipients less than 12 months&#xD;
      post-transplant is poorly-defined. In addition, the immunologic predictors and correlates of&#xD;
      influenza vaccine immunogenicity in SOT recipients have not been defined. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that adult solid organ transplant recipients that are 1-11 months out from&#xD;
      transplant and are receiving high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine will have higher&#xD;
      hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) geometric mean titers to influenza A antigens compared to&#xD;
      adult SOT recipients receiving standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine. To test this&#xD;
      hypothesis and address the above critical knowledge gaps, The investigators propose to&#xD;
      conduct a phase II multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing either two doses HD-IIV,&#xD;
      two doses of SD-IIV, or one-dose of HD-IIV in adult kidney, heart, and liver SOT recipients&#xD;
      1-11 months post-transplantation. The results of this study will address significant gaps in&#xD;
      knowledge regarding influenza vaccine strategies and immune responses in adult SOT recipients&#xD;
      and will guide vaccine recommendations in this vulnerable population.&#xD;

      Study Design. The proposed study is a multi-center, phase II, randomized, controlled,&#xD;
      immunogenicity and safety trial comparing two doses of the trivalent HD-IIV vs. two doses of&#xD;
      the quadrivalent SD-IIV vs. one dose of HD-IIV followed by one dose of placebo in adult SOT&#xD;
      recipients (kidney, heart, and liver)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunogenicity Objective To compare the hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) geometric mean&#xD;
      titers (GMT) to influenza A antigens in adult SOT recipients after receiving either one dose&#xD;
      of high dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (HD-QIV), two doses of standard dose (SD)-QIV, or&#xD;
      two doses of HD-QIV over one influenza season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the frequency and severity of local solicited adverse events in adult SOT&#xD;
           recipients after receiving either one dose of HD-QIV, two doses of SD-QIV, or two doses&#xD;
           of HD-QIV over one influenza season.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the frequency and severity of systemic solicited adverse events in adult SOT&#xD;
           recipients after receiving either one dose of HD-QIV, two doses of SD-QIV, or two doses&#xD;
           of HD-QIV over one influenza season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunogenicity Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the GMT to influenza B antigens in adult SOT recipients after receiving&#xD;
           either one dose of HD-QIV, two doses of SD-QIV, or two doses of HD-QIV over one&#xD;
           influenza season.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the frequency of seroconversion (achieving a ≥4-fold rise in HAI titer) or&#xD;
           seroprotection (presence of ≥1:40 HAI titer) in adult SOT recipients after receiving&#xD;
           either one dose of HD-QIV, two doses of SD-QIV, or two doses of HD-QIV over one&#xD;
           influenza season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population. A target of a minimum of 396 (132 subjects per year) adult subjects≥18&#xD;
      years, who received kidney, heart, or liver SOT), and are 1-11 months post-transplant will be&#xD;
      enrolled over a three-years period. Approximately 99 subjects per site (33 subjects per year)&#xD;
      will be enrolled from the following four clinical sites: Vanderbilt University Medical&#xD;
      Center, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, University of Washington Medical&#xD;
      Center, and University Hospital, University of Alabama at Birmingham.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures. Consented and eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion to&#xD;
      one of three groups to receive either two doses of 0.5 mL HD-IIV (60µg of each influenza&#xD;
      antigen), two doses of SD-IIV (15µg of each influenza antigen), or one dose of HD-IIV (60µg&#xD;
      of each influenza antigen) followed by one dose of placebo (normal saline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HAI and microneutralization (MN) titers to influenza virus specific vaccine antigens,&#xD;
      phenotypic B and T cell responses, B and T cell specific influenza responses, and complete&#xD;
      blood count with differential and platelets (CBC d/p) will be measured prior to the first and&#xD;
      second vaccine dose, 28-42 days after the second vaccine dose, and approximately 6 months&#xD;
      after second vaccine. Quantitative CD4+/CD8+/CD19+ levels, and quantitative serum IgG and IgM&#xD;
      concentrations will only be measured prior to the first vaccine. Approximately 30-50 mLs of&#xD;
      blood will be collected at each visit. Nasal swabs will be collected at each visit. Subjects&#xD;
      will record solicited events for 7 days after each vaccination (Day 0-7). On days 1-3 and&#xD;
      8-10, telephone and/or electronic communication will be made to assess for solicited AEs&#xD;
      following each vaccination. Nasal swabs will also be collected at each study visit,&#xD;
      regardless of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Influenza Surveillance. Active surveillance for influenza-like symptoms will begin when&#xD;
      influenza season starts in each site's community. Influenza season in the specific community&#xD;
      is defined -as in previous trials- by identification of at least two positive respiratory&#xD;
      tests for influenza, with at least 10% of diagnostic tests positive during two consecutive&#xD;
      weeks in the local clinical or research laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will continue during influenza season with nasal swabs obtained during study&#xD;
      visits -regardless of influenza-like symptoms- and from symptomatic subjects to document the&#xD;
      detection of influenza virus both prior to and after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the influenza season, the study staff will attempt to do a weekly telephone and/or&#xD;
      electronic communication with the participants to detect and document any influenza-like&#xD;
      illness (ILI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If subjects meet ILI criteria and/or any specific COVID-19 like symptoms (see below), an&#xD;
      additional nasal swab will be collected*.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ILI criteria: One of the following criteria met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fever: ≥38°C (100.4°F); or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two or more of any of the following: respiratory symptoms (rhinorrhea, sinus congestion,&#xD;
           post-nasal drip, shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, sputum production, sore throat,&#xD;
           sneezing, watery eyes, ear pain, or hoarseness); or systemic symptoms (myalgias, chills,&#xD;
           chest pain, or headache); or new loss of taste or new loss of smell; or gastrointestinal&#xD;
           symptoms (diarrhea or vomiting).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Per investigators' discretion at each individual site, a swab is not needed if&#xD;
                there is a known non-respiratory cause of symptoms&#xD;

    <description>Fluzone High-Dose (Influenza Vaccine) for intramuscular injection is an inactivated influenza vaccine, prepared from influenza viruses propagated in embryonated chicken eggs. The virus-containing allantoic fluid is harvested and inactivated with formaldehyde. Influenza virus is concentrated and purified in a linear sucrose density gradient solution using a continuous flow centrifuge. The virus is then chemically disrupted using a non-ionic surfactant, octylphenol ethoxylate (Triton® X-100), producing a &quot;split virus&quot;. The split virus is further purified and then suspended in sodium phosphatebuffered isotonic sodium chloride solution. The Fluzone High-Dose process uses an additional concentration factor after the ultrafiltration step in order to obtain a higher hemagglutinin (HA) antigen concentration.</description>
