  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a rare disease mainly affecting the elderly. BP is associated with&#xD;
      significant morbidity and increased mortality secondary to increased risk of secondary&#xD;
      infections, comorbid conditions, and serious side effects from high-dose steroids and&#xD;
      immunosuppressants. The aim of this study is to investigate the use of benralizumab as a&#xD;
      treatment for patients symptomatic with Bullous Pemphigoid (BP)&#xD;
