    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted with 70 infertile women. The intervention group (n = 35) will&#xD;
      consist of infertile women who receive a psychosexual caring program, and the control group&#xD;
      will consist of infertile women who receive standard care. Standard care includes the&#xD;
      information given by the nurse about the treatment methods to be applied once. A total of 4&#xD;
      interviews will be held in the intervention group. In the first interviews, pre-test data&#xD;
      will be taken. The psychosexual caring program will be conducted online as a group&#xD;
      intervention. The psychosexual caring program includes interventions to promote body&#xD;
      awareness, the meaning of sexuality, and marital relationships by gaining communication&#xD;
      skills, sexual communication, body knowledge, information about sexual health, and its&#xD;
      dimensions. After online interviews with groups, data will be collected for primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes.&#xD;
