  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objectives are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety of trial 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose, produced by a new&#xD;
           manufacturer, by surveillance for adverse events in patients having Positron Emission&#xD;
           Tomography Computed Tomography scans in a comprehensive program for indications&#xD;
           including, but not limited to, oncology, neurology, cardiac and infectious/inflammatory&#xD;
           processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the efficacy of 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose Positron Emission Tomography&#xD;
           in differentiating benign from malignant solitary pulmonary nodules and calculate&#xD;
           sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy using pathologic confirmation as the gold&#xD;
           standard when available, or greater than 6 month follow up stability on Computed&#xD;
           Tomography scan when not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of performing this clinical trial is to provide local access of&#xD;
      18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose to the patients of Newfoundland and Labrador. This product has&#xD;
      been offered to patients over the last three years by transporting from facilities outside of&#xD;
      the province. There have been significant delays in access and in fact, times where&#xD;
      18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose has not been available through this process. This has caused&#xD;
      delays and limitations of treatments for patients who rely on Positron Emission Tomography&#xD;
      Computed Tomography scans for diagnosis.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected disease for which 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose Positron Emission&#xD;
             Tomography Computed Tomography is appropriate for the investigation of. This includes,&#xD;
