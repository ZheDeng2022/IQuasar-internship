  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching objective of this study is to investigate the use of antagonistic actions as&#xD;
      a treatment augmentation strategy for enhancing emotional processing during exposure to&#xD;
      trauma-relevant stimuli. To accomplish this, participants (N = 84) meeting DSM-5 criteria for&#xD;
      PTSD will be randomized to one of three experimental conditions: (a) Psychoeducation alone&#xD;
      (PSYED); (b) Psychoeducation followed by repeated exposure to trauma-videoclips (PSYED +&#xD;
      EXP); or (c) Psychoeducation followed by repeated exposure to trauma-videoclips while&#xD;
      engaging in antagonistic actions (PSYED + EXP + AA). Antagonistic action strategies during&#xD;
      exposure to the trauma-videoclips will include (a) adopting an open posture; (b) eating a&#xD;
      palatable snack; (c) smiling; and (d) wishing on high levels of emotional distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that (a) those randomized to receive psychoeducation alone will show&#xD;
      less improvement relative to the two groups that receive psychoeducation plus repeated&#xD;
      exposure to trauma-videoclips; (b) those receiving psychoeducation in combination with&#xD;
      repeated exposure to trauma-videoclips while performing antagonistic actions will show&#xD;
      significantly enhanced treatment outcome at the one-month follow-up relative to the other two&#xD;
      treatment arms; (c) participants with greater PTSD symptom severity are likely to have a&#xD;
      poorer treatment outcome to PSYED alone; (d) changes in trauma-related threat appraisals,&#xD;
      coping self-efficacy, and safety behaviors will each independently mediate the effects of&#xD;
      treatment; and (e) participants displaying reductions in their emotional reactivity are more&#xD;
      likely to have a reduction in PTSD symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 70% of Americans are exposed to trauma during their lifetime and approximately 5.6% will&#xD;
      meet diagnostic criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder. Posttraumatic stress disorder&#xD;
      (PTSD) can significantly interfere with social functioning, work, and increase one's risk for&#xD;
      other physical and mental health problems. Trauma-focused psychotherapies for PTSD have been&#xD;
      shown to outperform more traditional supportive psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy and have&#xD;
      become the first line of treatment for PTSD. However, the impact of trauma-focused therapy&#xD;
      such as Prolonged Exposure (PE) is reduced, due to high rates of attrition ranging from 38.5%&#xD;
      to 50%. Thus, there is a clear need to develop treatments for PTSD that are more palatable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary evidence suggests that exposure-based treatment may be enhanced by having&#xD;
      patients engage in antagonistic actions (e.g., smiling, laughing, adopting an open posture,&#xD;
      wishing on threatening outcomes) during exposure to the feared target. Prior research found&#xD;
      that these actions increased the efficacy of exposure therapy among a sample of 88 patients&#xD;
      with acrophobia. Specifically, participants were instructed to stand at the railing and look&#xD;
      over the edge while shaking their head to induce dizziness, standing at the edge without&#xD;
      holding onto the railing, or walking towards the railing with their eyes closed and hands&#xD;
      behind their back. Participants in the antagonistic action exposure group exhibited a&#xD;
      significantly greater reduction in peak fear over the course of the study compared to all&#xD;
      other groups (89% reduction versus 54%). Although promising, augmenting exposure therapy with&#xD;
      antagonistic actions has yet to be tested for enhancing exposure therapy for PTSD. For the&#xD;
      present study, antagonistic actions will include (a) adopting an open posture; (b) eating a&#xD;
      palatable snack; (c) smiling; and (d) wishing on high levels of emotional distress (e.g.,&#xD;
      &quot;come on distress hit me with your best shot&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a gap in the literature on antagonistic actions related specifically to trauma&#xD;
      exposure. By better understanding mechanisms underlying reactions to a trauma video clip and&#xD;
      trauma symptom development, the investigators can begin to reduce the debilitating effects of&#xD;
      psychopathology following exposure to traumatic events in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a 3 x 3 mixed model experimental design with treatment Condition as a&#xD;
      three-level between-subjects factor and assessment period (baseline vs posttreatment vs&#xD;
      follow-up) as a three-level within subjects factor. Participants (N = 84) meeting DSM-5&#xD;
      criteria for PTSD will complete a battery of baseline trauma-related symptom measures&#xD;
      followed by a trauma memory provocation involving watching a brief trauma-relevant videoclip,&#xD;
      during which behavioral and subjective indices of emotional reactivity will be collected.&#xD;
      Participants will be stratified based on their trauma symptom severity (PCL-5) and trauma&#xD;
      type (LEC-5) and then randomized to one of three conditions: (a) Psychoeducation alone&#xD;
      (PSYED); (b) Psychoeducation followed by repeated exposure to trauma-videoclips (PSYED +&#xD;
      EXP); or (c) Psychoeducation followed by repeated exposure to trauma-videoclips while&#xD;
      engaging in antagonistic actions (PSYED + EXP + AA). Antagonistic action strategies during&#xD;
      exposure to the trauma-videoclips will include (a) adopting an open posture; (b) eating a&#xD;
      palatable snack; (c) smiling; and (d) wishing on high levels of emotional distress (e.g.,&#xD;
      &quot;come on distress hit me with your best shot&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to the two trauma videoclip exposure arms will receive six 3-minute&#xD;
      video exposure trials with an inter-trial interval of 2 minutes, during which participants&#xD;
      will complete ratings of (a) peak subjective distress during the trauma-videoclip; (b)&#xD;
      anticipated subjective distress for the next trial; and (c) level of confidence for coping&#xD;
      with their own trauma memory.&#xD;
