  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PLAYMORE study aims to investigate the effects of two interventions focusing on a close&#xD;
      and meaningful coupling between bodily movement and academic content on early pre-reading and&#xD;
      word recognition skills in children. Further, the study aims to compare two interventions&#xD;
      involving either hand movements (i.e. using arms and hands) or whole-body movements (i.e.&#xD;
      using the whole body). Potential mediating factors underlying the potential effect of bodily&#xD;
      movement on early pre-reading and word recognition skills will be explored. The PLAYMORE&#xD;
      study will be conducted as a three-armed randomized controlled trial including children aged&#xD;
      five to six years recruited from four schools in the Copenhagen area, Denmark. Stratified by&#xD;
      class, children will be randomly allocated to one of three 8-week intervention/control&#xD;
      periods: 1) teaching involving whole-body movements, 2) teaching involving hand movements&#xD;
      (i.e. arms and hands) or 3) teaching involving minimal motor movements (i.e. seated on a&#xD;
      chair using paper and pencil). Outcome measurements, including pre-reading and word&#xD;
      recognition skills, will be collected before and after the intervention period to assess the&#xD;
      intervention effects. This study protocol follows the SPIRIT guidelines.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline in word reading speed and accuracy (reading of 18 trained words) at 8 weeks, computer-based test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This word reading test consist of 18 presentations of targets words; one target word per presentation. Below the target word are placed four pictures of which one illustrates the target word. For the children to give a correct answer, they will have to touch the picture matching the target word on the touch screen. They are asked to touch the correct picture as fast as possible. The three remaining pictures represents words (distractors) that have either the initial (two pictures) or the final (one picture) sound in common with the target word. The presentations of target words and the order of the four pictures are randomized between subjects and time points. During the test, children are allowed to ask questions concerning the pictures (e.g. what is shown on this picture?) but not regarding the target word (e.g. what is the sound of this letter?). The results from the test constitute mean response time for correct answers and number of correct answers.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in trained letter-sound correspondences accuracy (15 trials) at 8 weeks, paper and pencil test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The test consists of 15 trials. In each trial, a sound corresponding to a standard or a conditional pronunciation of a letter is said out loud by the assessor. Children are instructed to identify the correct letter matching the sound from a row of four letters. Before the test trials, children will be provided with one practice trial. The 15 sounds represent both standard and conditional pronunciations of the letters a, e, o, r, u and v. Results are numbers of correct letter-sound correspondences.</description>
