  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of more timely care for&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on adherence to positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy at three&#xD;
      months after treatment initiation. The secondary objectives are to determine if earlier care&#xD;
      improves the treatment effect of PAP on patient reported sleepiness, quality of life and&#xD;
      patient satisfaction. We will also evaluate the impact of shorter wait times on patient&#xD;
      engagement in therapy by assessing initial acceptance of PAP therapy, patient activation and&#xD;
      self-efficacy with respect to OSA treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that the early management strategy will be superior to usual care&#xD;
      with respect to the primary outcome of PAP adherence at three months.&#xD;
