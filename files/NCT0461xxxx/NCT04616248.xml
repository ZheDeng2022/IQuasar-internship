    <textblock>
      This phase I trial evaluates the side effects of radio-immunotherapy (CDX-301, radiotherapy,&#xD;
      CDX-1140 and Poly-ICLC) in treating patients with breast cancer that cannot be removed by&#xD;
      surgery (unresectable) and has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). CDX-301 may&#xD;
      induce cross-presenting dendritic cells, master regulators in the immune system. Radiation&#xD;
      therapy uses high energy to kill tumor cells and release antigens that may be picked up,&#xD;
      processed and presented by cross-presenting dendritic cells. CDX-1140 and Poly-ICLC may&#xD;
      activate tumor antigen-loaded,cross-presenting dendritic cells, and generate tumor-specific T&#xD;
      lymphocytes, a type of immune cells, that can search out and attack cancers. Giving immune&#xD;
      modulators and radiation therapy may stimulate tumor cell death and activate the immune&#xD;
      system.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety profile of in situ immunomodulation with recombinant Flt3 ligand&#xD;
      (CDX-301), radiotherapy, agonistic anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody CDX-1140, and Poly-ICLC in&#xD;
      unresectable and metastatic breast cancer patients with injectable palpable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the immune signatures in the tumor microenvironment before and after in situ&#xD;
      immunomodulation with CDX-301, radiotherapy, CDX-1140, and Poly-ICLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To record the overall response rate (ORR) (complete response [CR] and partial response&#xD;
      [PR]) of distant uninjected metastatic lesions in metastatic breast cancer patients with&#xD;
      injectable palpable disease treated with in situ immunomodulation with CDX-301, radiotherapy,&#xD;
      CDX-1140, and Poly-ICLC by immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors&#xD;
      (irRECIST) response assessment, and compare intratumoral alone versus (vs.) intratumoral +&#xD;
      intravenous administration of CDX-1140.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To record the overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) in unresectable&#xD;
      and metastatic breast cancer patients with injectable palpable disease treated with in situ&#xD;
      immunomodulation with CDX-301, radiotherapy, CDX-1140, and Poly-ICLC, and compare&#xD;
      intratumoral alone vs. intratumoral + intravenous administration of CDX-1140.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Examine changes in the levels of T-cell subsets/myeloid derived suppressor cells&#xD;
      (MDSC)/cytokines in peripheral blood (PB) of unresectable and metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
      patients with injectable palpable disease treated with in situ immunomodulation with CDX-301,&#xD;
      radiotherapy, CDX-1140, and Poly-ICLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:Cohort A will evaluate safety of intratumoral administration of CDX-1140 in&#xD;
      combination with CDX-301, radiotherapy and Poly-ICLC. Once cohort A is finished, patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled to cohort B to evaluate safety of intratumoral + intravenous administration&#xD;
      of CDX-1140 in combination with CDX-301, radiotherapy and Poly-ICLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT A: Patients receive recombinant Flt3 ligand intratumorally (IT) on days 1-5 and&#xD;
      agonistic anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody CDX-1140 IT with Poly-ICLC IT on day 9 or 10.&#xD;
      Patients also undergo radiation therapy on day 8 or 9. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT B: Patients receive recombinant Flt3 ligand IT on days 1-5 and agonistic anti-CD40&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody CDX-1140 IT and intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes with Poly-ICLC IT on&#xD;
      day 9 or 10. Patients also undergo radiation therapy on day 8 or 9. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      21 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6&#xD;
      months for 2 years.&#xD;
