      This study compares and evaluates differences in movement analysis, patient-reported outcome&#xD;
      and radiological assesment between patients undergoing robotic-assisted total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty and conventional one.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis causes the joints to become painful and stiff. Osteoarthritis of the knee is a&#xD;
      common condition that is expected to be a lot more frequent in the next two decades. As a&#xD;
      consequence, an increase of total knee replacement surgery is predicted. Total knee&#xD;
      replacement surgery is offered when knee pain and stiffness caused by osteoarthritis can no&#xD;
      longer be managed and these symptoms significantly impact on an individual's normal&#xD;
      activities of daily living. Most total knee replacements are successful but up to 34% of all&#xD;
      patients have poor functional outcomes following surgery. This leaves affected people at a&#xD;
      greater risk of reduced physical activity and thus impacts longer-term general health. Poor&#xD;
      outcomes are therefore of importance to patients and have a considerable financial and&#xD;
      service-provision impact on National Health Service (NHS) care. While patient-related&#xD;
      characteristics and their relationship to patient outcomes have been identified, few studies&#xD;
      have been undertaken to determine how kinematic outcomes (how the prosthetic knee moves) are&#xD;
      related to functional outcome and patient satisfaction. The kinematic outcome of a total knee&#xD;
      replacement is hypothesised to relate to both the structural design (shape) of the implant&#xD;
      and the surgical procedure itself. In recent years, there has been development of high&#xD;
      technology tools to help surgeon restoring proper joint biomechanics. Nowadays on the market&#xD;
      there are several robots designed to fulfill this function. To date, no studies have&#xD;
      investigated the kinematic outcomes of robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty in comparison&#xD;
      to conventional surgery. Whilst it is known that long term success of total knee replacement&#xD;
      depends largely upon correct alignment of the prosthesis components during surgery, no&#xD;
      studies have looked at the anatomical alignments of the osteoarthritic knee prior to&#xD;
      undergoing surgery (using Computerised Tomography (CT) scanning). The aim of the study is to&#xD;
      examine relationships between movement analysis (kinematic and functional outcomes), patient&#xD;
      reported outcome measures (PROMS) and CT measurement, both pre- and post-operatively, between&#xD;
      robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty and conventional surgery.&#xD;
