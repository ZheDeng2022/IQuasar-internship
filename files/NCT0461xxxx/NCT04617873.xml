    <textblock>
      Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a debilitating and fatal neurodegenerative disorder that&#xD;
      characterized pathologically by α-synuclein (aSyn) accumulation in oligodendrocytes, the&#xD;
      myelinating glial cells of the central nervous system (CNS), and symptomatic therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies are still limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parkinsonian type of multiple system atrophy (MSA-P) has parkinsonian symptoms as its&#xD;
      prominent manifestation and may have an initial but short-lived response to levodopa&#xD;
      (L-dopa). Deep brain stimulation (DBS) at the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or globus pallidus&#xD;
      interna(GPi) has been an established treatment for Parkinson's disease(PD) patients with&#xD;
      medically intractable fluctuations and has shown long-term efficacy to improve parkinsonian&#xD;
      motor symptoms, such as bradykinesia, rigidity and rest tremor. However, DBS therapy is&#xD;
      mostly ineffective in MSA patients. For the patients with MSA-P, improvement in motor&#xD;
      function is short-lasting and rapidly followed by the early appearance of freezing of gait&#xD;
      (FOG) and postural instability that counteracted DBS benefits and often leads to significant&#xD;
      disability and loss of quality of life. Dopaminergic therapy or other symptomatic medications&#xD;
      only offer limited alleviation of FOG and often lose their effect over time. Spinal cord&#xD;
      stimulation (SCS) is a well-established therapy for treating chronic lower back or low limb&#xD;
      pain neuropathic pain. Recently, some pilot studies demonstrated the safety and significant&#xD;
      therapeutic outcome of SCS for FOG in PD, MSA-P and primary progressive freezing&#xD;
      gait（PPFG）patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Can combined DBS with SCS be an alternative approach for symptomatic treatment of&#xD;
      parkinsonian symptoms and gait-associated problems in patients with MSA-P? The purpose of&#xD;
      this clinical study is to understand the combined treatment effectiveness for MSA-P.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It's a a multi-center, prospective, open label clinical study with a 12 months follow-up&#xD;
      period. The intended study population is individuals suffering from multiple system atrophy&#xD;
      with predominant parkinsonism. Each subject will complete an enrollment/screening/baseline&#xD;
      visit, an DBS&amp;SCS implant and activation visit, and 3 months, and 12months follow-up visits.&#xD;
      Data collected at the enrollment visit after the consent process includes: demographics,&#xD;
      baseline clinical status, MSA-related medical history, and inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
      assessment.Baseline assessment includes: Movement Disorder Society Sponsored Revision of the&#xD;
      Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) III,New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire&#xD;
      (NFOGQ), Gait and Fall Questionnaire (GFQ), PD-related quality of life (PDQ-39) and Berg&#xD;
      Balance Scale(BBS). The participants will proceed to implantation after satisfying implant&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. Medtronic Model 3389 DBS electrodes (Medtronic, U.S.A.)&#xD;
      will be implanted in the STN bilaterally using a stereotactic technique, connected to a&#xD;
      dual-channel ACTIVA Neurostimulator (Medtronic); Paddle-shaped SCS electrode with 16 contacts&#xD;
      (AdaptiveStim® 39, 565; Medtronic, USA) will be implanted into the epidural space at the&#xD;
      thoracic levels ranging from T10 to T12. Electrode positions of DBS will be verified by&#xD;
      postoperative CT-MRI image fusion and electrode position of SCS will be verified by X-ray.&#xD;
      The stimulators will be turned on within 1 month after electrode implantation surgery. The&#xD;
      stimulation parameters could vary freely, but medications will be kept constant during the&#xD;
      study period. At the end of month 12, participants will enter the long-term follow-up in&#xD;
      which medications could vary freely.&#xD;
