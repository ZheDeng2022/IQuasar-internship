  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prolonged sunlight exposure in swimming athletes can cause various changes in the skin; among&#xD;
      them is sunburn. The use of sunscreen can reduce sunburn effectively. However, various types&#xD;
      of physical activity that can trigger sweating, friction, washing with water, or sun exposure&#xD;
      after sunscreen use can interfere with its effectiveness in the form of a decreased SPF&#xD;
      level. The purpose of this study is to determine and compare the persistence of organic and&#xD;
      inorganic sun protection factor 30 (SPF 30) sunscreens after 1.5 hours of swimming.&#xD;

    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>SPF of inorganic and organic sunscreen were calculated before and after swimming. The difference between SPF before and after swimming will be calculated and compared between the organic and inorganic group. SPF were calculated using minimal erythemal dose (MED) test. The test itself will be conducted in 2 days. Irradiation will be conducted on the first day and minimal erythemal dose result will be collected 24 hours after the irradiation.</description>
