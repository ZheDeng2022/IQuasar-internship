  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to identify the effect of a 12-week fundamental motor skills (FMS)&#xD;
      (e.g., throwing, catching, running) intervention on the active participation in physical&#xD;
      recreation activities and a variety of other factors (child behaviors, communication, and&#xD;
      adaptive skills) and to identify patterns, benefits, constraints, and strategies to active&#xD;
      participation in physical recreation activities among families of children with autism&#xD;
      spectrum disorders (ASD) (pre-post) through in-person or via phone interviews with parents&#xD;
      and children with ASD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three protocols: 1) Workshop group, 2)&#xD;
      Home-based group, and 3) wait-listed home-based group. Participants in all groups will&#xD;
      receive an activity booklet and physical education-related activity items (e.g., ball, hoop).&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that both the workshop and home-based groups will improve in all measures&#xD;
      from pre to post compared to the wait-list control group. The investigators want to determine&#xD;
      if the differences in the workshop and home-based groups differ significantly or are&#xD;
      equitable in terms of gains in all areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Due to COVID-19 for the post-test, instead of parents attending the UW-Facilities, they&#xD;
      will be asked to videotape themselves and their children while performing the test of gross&#xD;
      motor development (TGMD) activities. For the follow-up test (Fall 2020) we will expect to&#xD;
      conduct these in person. However, if the situation due to COVID-19 remains the same, the&#xD;
      investigators will ask families to follow the same procedures (videotape themselves and their&#xD;
      children).&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Gross Motor Development as Measured by TGMD-3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 week post intervention (15 weeks), 3 months post intervention (24 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Test of Gross Motor Development - second edition (TGMD-3) is a measure of fundamental motor skills. The total possible range of scores is 47-158, where higher scores are indicative of improved gross motor development.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Whose Perceptions Qualitatively Improve as measured via semi-structured interview</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (approximately 2 weeks prior to intervention), post intervention (12 weeks), follow up (24 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Children will participate in one-on-one semi-structured interviews with the research team to explore their perception regarding communication strategies (between parent and child), patterns of physical recreation, perceived benefits, and constraints.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fidelity of Intervention reported as Number of Parents who Implements the Intervention as Intended</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fidelity checklists will be used to determine the fidelity of the intervention. Parents will be asked to email a video of 1-2 lessons per week along with a completed task analysis checklist. Parents will be asked to confirm whether or not each task was completed on the checklist. The research team will complete the same form while viewing the video to ensure whether the parent knows and is implementing the steps intended and if there are fidelity differences between the workshop and home-based group.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (approximately 2 weeks prior to intervention), post intervention (12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The SCQ is a 40-item survey where each question is a 'yes' or 'no' answer. The total possible range of scores is 0-39 (verbal children) or 0-33 (non-verbal children) with higher scores indicative of greater frequency of symptoms.</description>

    <description>Participants in the workshop group will be offered four one-day workshops (3-hours each) covering topics of 1) Sensory Integration, 2) Communication, 3) Aquatic Opportunities, and 4) Physical activity and Sports (during intervention)-[Parents and Children-Workshop Group]. In addition to the workshops, this group and the home-based group will receive information (activity booklets) and physical education (physical activity)-related equipment.</description>

This group will be instructed to continue their typical routines and activities for the duration of the intervention. They will be asked to attend the pre and posttest, as well as a follow up three weeks and 3 months after the completion of the 12-week period. Immediately following the follow-up test (3 months after the intervention), participants in the wait-list home-based group will be offered the home-based program (e.g., receiving the same intervention protocol and materials (physical education equipment and lesson plans/workbook) following all procedures as described for that group previously.</description>
