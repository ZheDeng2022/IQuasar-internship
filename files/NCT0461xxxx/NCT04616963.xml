  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) levels in&#xD;
      transgender-identifying or gender non-binary individuals taking versus not taking gender&#xD;
      affirming hormone therapy. Subjects who have previously taken F/TDF as PrEP will continue&#xD;
      with a fixed dose combination of daily oral F/TAF substituting for F/TDF. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive the iTAB text messaging adherence reminders to provide personalized, automated text&#xD;
      messages to support and monitor adherence that will vary by participant choice until 12 weeks&#xD;
      after switching medication. This study will enroll 60 individuals to take F/TAF as PrEP for&#xD;
      48 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-phased prospective switch study of 60 transgender individuals who are eligible&#xD;
      for Truvada® (Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate) F/TDF PrEP and who are willing to&#xD;
      switch to Descovy® (Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Alafenamide) F/TAF for 48 weeks. The purpose of&#xD;
      the current study is to contribute safety and efficacy data to support the use of F/TAF in&#xD;
      transgender/non-binary individuals. The current study leverages existing studies in&#xD;
      trans/non-binary populations (e.g. CCTG 603; HRPP#161807) funded by the California HIV/AIDS&#xD;
      Research Program (CHRP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosage for Phase I is FTC 200 mg / TDF 300 mg. The dosage for Phase II is FTC 200 mg /&#xD;
      TAF 25 mg. TDF/FTC is FDA approved for use as PrEP in adults and adolescents at risk for&#xD;
      HIV-1. F/TAF has received approval by the FDA for use as PrEP as of October 3rd, 2019 except&#xD;
      for those having receptive vaginal sex. The FDA has yet to approve F/TAF for use in those&#xD;
      having receptive vaginal sex due to a lack of clinical research studies specific to the&#xD;
      population. Participants will be advised that if they decide to have receptive vaginal sex&#xD;
      while taking F/TAF, they should use another method of protection such as condoms.Eligibility&#xD;
      criteria will be based on the CDC guidance for PrEP use in transgender persons. All&#xD;
      participants must be confirmed HIV-negative (either by rapid test or Ag/Ab test), must have&#xD;
      acceptable safety laboratory values, and must currently be taking or will initiate F/TDF by&#xD;
      the Screening/Baseline visit. Participants will have a 12-week lead-in period prior to&#xD;
      switching to F/TAF. At the Switch Visit, participants will be instructed to substitute F/TDF&#xD;
      with F/TAF for PrEP for 48 weeks. Regular follow-up evaluations will occur at Weeks 12, 24,&#xD;
      36, and 48.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive health education, clinical assessments, laboratory safety&#xD;
      monitoring, STI and HIV screening, standard HIV risk reduction and adherence counseling,&#xD;
      assessment of psychosocial barriers, and completion of a computer-based self-report survey&#xD;
      that includes assessments of adherence and risk behaviors. Intracellular TFV-DP&#xD;
      quantification will be performed in retrospect on batched, banked samples and additional&#xD;
      banked specimens will be frozen for future use. Adherence by TFV-DP concentrations and&#xD;
      self-reported measures will be used for the primary and secondary analyses of the study.&#xD;
      Additional outcomes for the study will include changes in risk behavior and determinants of&#xD;
      PrEP adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will continue iTAB, a daily text message support system for adherence up until 12&#xD;
      weeks after F/TAF switch. As needed, the study will provide a) subject reimbursement to pay&#xD;
      for unlimited text messaging and/or b) an appropriate cell phone if a subject does not have&#xD;
      one. Daily dosing text message reminders will be sent for the duration of the study. Both&#xD;
      reminder timing and content can be individualized. Participants have selected 15 personal&#xD;
      reminders from a list of pre-determined reminders that cover various themes shown to be&#xD;
      effective in improving adherence (e.g., social support, loss frame, health gain, etc.) as&#xD;
      developed through focus groups and targeted group feedback. These messages can be modified&#xD;
      and the patient can choose to create their own reminders if they prefer. These reminder times&#xD;
      can vary for different days of the week to accommodate for changes in schedule (e.g., 8 M-F,&#xD;
      and 10 AM on Sat/Sun). Once the time is identified, the text reminder system is automated.&#xD;
      Patients will confirm medication taking via text responses to the personalized reminders.&#xD;
