    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the effect of kangaroo mother care (KMC) applied to the healthy&#xD;
      newborns in the early postpartum period on breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the study are expected to contribute to promoting the practice of KMC in an&#xD;
      effort to encourage breastfeeding not only in Turkey's hospitals but also in other developing&#xD;
      countries where practices that negatively affect breastfeeding are prevalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses of the study were determined as: Infants administered KMC start to breastfeed&#xD;
      sooner (H1), breastfeed more frequently (H2), breastfeed for longer periods (H3), are more&#xD;
      successful at breastfeeding (H4) than infants receiving standard postpartum care (SPC).&#xD;

      Setting: The study was conducted over the period June 1 - August 25, 2016 as randomized&#xD;
      controlled experimental research at a Training and Research Hospital in Istanbul, Turkey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: The participants were 112 healthy mothers and their babies; the women were&#xD;
      between the ages 18-42, had delivered normal vaginal birth between gestational weeks 38-40,&#xD;
      met the sample inclusion criteria and consented to be a part of the study. Instrumental&#xD;
      vaginal deliveries were excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample selection criteria were determined as: normal delivery, healthy mother and child,&#xD;
      newborn being at term (in the 38th-42nd week), with a birthweight of 2500-4000 gr. The&#xD;
      inclusion criteria were determined as: no serious case of asphyxiation in the newborn, an&#xD;
      APGAR score of at least 7 at Minute 1 and Minute 5, no health problem in the newborn to&#xD;
      prevent it from breastfeeding (e.g., cleft palate, harelip, esophageal atresia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample and randomization: The researcher met with the mothers who fulfilled the selection&#xD;
      criteria prior to the birth and briefly informed them of the scope and content of the study,&#xD;
      asking them if they wished to participate. At this stage, participation was proposed to 119&#xD;
      mothers. Of these, 112 mothers and their babies were randomized into two groups with 56 in&#xD;
      the study group (KMC) and 56 in the control group (SPC). A computerized randomization method&#xD;
      was used for implementing the random selection. The newborns that exhibited a health issue&#xD;
      following the birth were excluded from the study. In their place, the same randomization&#xD;
      method was used until 56 cases were defined. The number of newborns held outside the scope of&#xD;
      the study after birth was 5 in the study group and 2 in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis was performed using the G*Power (v3.1.9) program in order to determine the&#xD;
      number in the sample. Sample size was determined on the basis of the infants' breastfeeding&#xD;
      scores obtained on LATCH. It was foreseen that a unit of difference in LATCH scores between&#xD;
      groups would be clinically significant. In a study by Yenal et al., when the LATCH mean score&#xD;
      and standard deviation were accepted as a reference for control group data, effect size was&#xD;
      calculated as d=0.566. It was calculated that at least 51 individuals would have to be&#xD;
      included in the groups, a total of 102, to realize the effect level of α=0.05 at a power of&#xD;
      80%. Taking into consideration possible losses, it was decided that the groups would each&#xD;
      comprise at least 56, meaning a total of 112 individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: The study data were collected in line with the literature using the Data&#xD;
      Collection Form developed by researchers. The infants' suckling skills were assessed with the&#xD;
      &quot;LATCH Breastfeeding Assessment Tool&quot; developed in 1994 by Jensen et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent: Permission for conduct of the study was obtained from the hospital and the ethics&#xD;
      committee (10840098-604.01.01-E.1108). At the same time, prior to the start of the study, the&#xD;
      mothers were informed about the purpose and methodology of the research and the mothers&#xD;
      agreeing to participate were asked to sign a written Subject Informed Consent Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: The NCSS (Number Cruncher Statistical System) 2007 (Kaysville, Utah, USA)&#xD;
      program was used in the statistical analysis. In the evaluation of the study data, besides&#xD;
      descriptive statistical methods (means, standard deviation, median, frequency and&#xD;
      percentages), the Shapiro-Wilk test and box plot graphs were employed in testing normality.&#xD;
      The Independent Samples T Test was used to analyze two groups of quantitative data displaying&#xD;
      normal distribution such as the newborns' weight, height, head circumference, number of&#xD;
      breastfeedings received, mother's age. The Mann-Whitney U test was used in the case of&#xD;
      variables not showing normal distribution, such as the newborns' APGAR scores at Minutes 1&#xD;
      and 5, the first interaction of the mother with her infant, the first time of breastfeeding,&#xD;
      the number of breastfeedings in the first 3 hours and their duration. The comparison of&#xD;
      qualitative data such as the infants' gender, the mother's educational status, the status of&#xD;
      being breastfed in the first half-hour and hour was undertaken with Pearson's Chi Square&#xD;
      while the Fisher-Freeman-Halton test was used to compare the mothers' eagerness to&#xD;
      breastfeed. The results were analyzed at a confidence interval of 95% with significance&#xD;
      expressed at a level of p&lt;0.05.&#xD;

    <description>The newborns' diapers were tied, their caps put on and then they were positioned on their mother's naked chest for KMC. At Minute 5, the newborns' Apgar scores were assessed and recorded during KMC. The newborn's examination and injections (Hepatitis-B and K vit) were postponed until the first breastfeeding took place. A pediatrician performed a detailed examination of the newborns under the radiant infant warmer after the first breastfeeding. Following the examination, the newborn was positioned on the mother's breast for KMC. During this KMC, the newborn was administered 1 mg K vitamin in the right leg and 0.5 ml Hepatitis-B vaccine in the left leg via intramuscular injections. The KMC session was continued for 3 hours. Care attempt of mothers such as episiotomy repair was taken that the position of KMC.</description>

    <description>Kangaroo mother care is a method of care of infants. The method involves infants being carried, usually by the mother, with skin-to-skin contact. Kangaroo mother care (KMC). early after delivery have better success at breastfeeding and achieve this success sooner. In this method The newborns' diapers were tied, their caps put on and then they were positioned on their mother's naked chest for KMC. The KMC session was continued for 3 hours.</description>
