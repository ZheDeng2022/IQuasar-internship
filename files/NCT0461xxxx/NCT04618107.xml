      Wide awake surgery for tendon repair in hand trauma To compare the functional outecomes in&#xD;
      terms of active range of motion for tendon repair surgeries performed under wide awake&#xD;
      anaesthesia versus general anaesthesia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients aged 15 or above with hand trauma resulting in tendon injuries were included.65&#xD;
      patients undergoing tendon repair in wide awake anaesthesia were grouped as approach arm and&#xD;
      another 65 patients of general anaesthesia group were kept as control arm.Range of motion of&#xD;
      corresponding tendons were measured at completion of sixth postoperative week using&#xD;
      goniometer.Total active range of motion were calculated according to criteria given by&#xD;
      Strickland method and American Society for Surgery ofthe Hand (ASSH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional outcomes were compared among two groups.&#xD;
