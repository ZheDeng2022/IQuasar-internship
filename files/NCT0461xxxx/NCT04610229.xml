  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Relapsed GBMs have a life expectancy of a few months and re-radiation has proven to be safe&#xD;
      in terms of toxicity and effective in increasing OS. One of our studies [Ciammella P, 2013,&#xD;
      8:222] reported a median survival of 9.5 months in patients with recurrent GBM and treated&#xD;
      with stereotactic radiotherapy with a total dose of 25 Gy in 5 consecutive sessions, in which&#xD;
      the dose was prescribed to 70% isodose with a homogeneous gradient towards the center of the&#xD;
      target volume. The identification with functional imaging of specific areas with higher tumor&#xD;
      cell density, and the possibility of delivering precisely, thanks to the most advanced&#xD;
      therapy units, different doses to the different sub-volumes, can lead to an increase in the&#xD;
      maximum dose that can be delivered at the expense of the most aggressive areas (with a&#xD;
      greater effect on the tumor), compared to smaller doses in areas with lower signal&#xD;
      alteration. This selectivity of the doses should allow an increase in the efficacy of the&#xD;
      therapy and therefore a hypothetical increase in local control, compared to a radio-induced&#xD;
      toxicity on the surrounding healthy tissues almost comparable to that achieved with the&#xD;
      previous hypofractionated treatments [Ciammella P, 2013]. In fact, delivering many high doses&#xD;
      to the entire volume would result in an excess of radio-induced necrosis within the&#xD;
      irradiated regions with high dose, as well as the impossibility of minimizing the doses on&#xD;
      healthy areas and / or on non-neoplastic critical areas keeping them at internal dose ranges&#xD;
      related to minimal and acceptable toxicity levels. Since there are no studies providing clear&#xD;
      indications on the acute and late toxicity of irradiated healthy tissues that have already&#xD;
      been the subject of a first course of radiotherapy (STUPP), the choice of safety is the&#xD;
      primary objective of the study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is an exploratory, prospective, experimental, monocentric study. Having identified a main&#xD;
      safety endpoint (toxicity of radiotherapy treatment) and in the absence of data currently&#xD;
      available from previous studies and useful for sizing the sample, the sample is defined&#xD;
      according to opportunity and feasibility criteria, (12 cases), with a drawing (3 cases + 3&#xD;
      cases + 6 cases) which provides for two intermediate safety assessment steps one month after&#xD;
      the end of the third and sixth patient treatment. The study will be continued only in case of&#xD;
      positive evaluation of both steps. For each individual patient the treatment is considered&#xD;
      completed if: a) the experimental radiotherapy treatment has been completed; b) the first&#xD;
      follow-up radiological assessment (NMR) was performed; c) the study treatment was prematurely&#xD;
      interrupted due to lack of efficacy (documented disease progression) or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment: the treatment foreseen by the protocol foresees the planning and the&#xD;
           execution of a hypofractionated radiotherapy (RT) treatment, administered in 5 daily&#xD;
           sessions, with intensity modulated technique and inhomogeneous distribution of the dose&#xD;
           guided by the diffusion images obtained with magnetic resonance (RM). The radiotherapy&#xD;
           treatment must start within 7 days from the date of execution of the centering MRI which&#xD;
           will include both the classic morphological sequences with administration of contrast&#xD;
           medium and functional ones. In selected cases and according to clinical judgment it will&#xD;
           be possible to request the revision of the anatomopathological and radiological&#xD;
           findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation technique: for each patient, a radiotherapy treatment plan will be performed&#xD;
           with conformed techniques such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with dose&#xD;
           redistribution: dose-painting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Positioning and immobilization of the patient: the patient must be treated in a supine&#xD;
           position. The arms must be positioned along the body. The use of a knee support is&#xD;
           recommended. The garment will be immobilized with a thermoplastic mask and corresponding&#xD;
           neck rest supports.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TC and planning RM: the planning CT should be acquired possibly with reduced layer&#xD;
           thickness that contains the entire volume of the skull and the upper part of the&#xD;
           shoulders. This is done to allow the possibility of planning non-coplanar type&#xD;
           treatments. The last follow-up MRI, or the radiotherapy centering RM, composed of&#xD;
           standard and functional sequences, is used for planning, in addition to those that the&#xD;
           neuroradiologist will have considered useful to better characterize the clinical case&#xD;
           under examination. More details on this are described in the Technical Annex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Target volume and organs at risk (OAR): the following target volumes must be identified:&#xD;
           • Gross tumor volume (GTV): it is defined using and combining the conventional and&#xD;
           advanced sequences of the NMR. • Planning target volume (PTV): it is represented by the&#xD;
           GTV with three-dimensional expansion between 0 and 5 mm according to the problems&#xD;
           highlighted during the tumor segmentation phase. See the Technical Annex in this regard.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The following risky organs (OAR) must be identified: • Optical nerves: the definition of&#xD;
           the related planning risk volume is also suggested (PRV: organ at risk with&#xD;
           three-dimensional expansion; this margin must be chosen taking into account the&#xD;
           acquisition thickness of the centering TC and the chosen GTV-PTV expansion margin). •&#xD;
           chiasm. We also suggest the definition of the relative PRV (organ at risk with&#xD;
           three-dimensional expansion; this margin must be chosen taking into account the&#xD;
           acquisition thickness of the centering CT and the chosen GTV-PTV expansion margin). •&#xD;
           retinas. We also suggest the definition of the relative PRV (organ at risk with&#xD;
           three-dimensional expansion; this margin must be chosen taking into account the&#xD;
           acquisition thickness of the centering CT and the chosen GTV-PTV expansion margin).&#xD;
           Alternatively the eye globes can be surrounded. • Encefalic trunk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The following secondary OARs must be identified: • Lenses / Crystalline. We also suggest&#xD;
           the definition of the relative PRV (organ at risk with three-dimensional expansion; this&#xD;
           margin must be chosen taking into account the acquisition thickness of the centering CT&#xD;
           and the chosen GTV-PTV expansion margin). • Healthy brain tissue. It is represented by&#xD;
           the encephalon volume minus the PTV. • Screw. We also suggest the definition of the&#xD;
           relative PRV (organ at risk with three-dimensional expansion; this margin must be chosen&#xD;
           taking into account the acquisition thickness of the centering CT and the chosen GTV-PTV&#xD;
           expansion margin).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose prescription: i) Dose to the target: the prescription dose foresees a minimum dose&#xD;
           of 30 Gy (6 Gy per session) for the areas with the highest ADC with a gradual increase&#xD;
           in the dose of the lower ADC areas. The maximum hypothesized dose is 50 Gy, with a dose&#xD;
           of 10 Gy per session to no more than 1cc of the irradiated brain tissue. The treatment&#xD;
           plan, however, will be processed in the following order of priority: 1. Compliance with&#xD;
           dose limits for primary OARs. 2. PTV coverage. 3. Compliance with dose limits for&#xD;
           secondary OARs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose limits for primary risk organs: in the scientific literature there are various&#xD;
           studies that indicate the dose limits of the organs at risk for brain radiation&#xD;
           treatments.&#xD;
