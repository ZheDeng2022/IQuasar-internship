  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-arm randomized clinical trial assessing effectiveness of somatocognitive&#xD;
      therapy versus treatment as usual for provoked vestibulodynia (PVD). PVD is a common, but&#xD;
      under-treated persistent pain condition, mostly affecting young women in their late teens and&#xD;
      early 20s. It is the most frequent cause of pain during sexual intercourse affecting around&#xD;
      10% of women in the general population. There are no generally accepted evidence-based&#xD;
      guidelines for the medical management of PVD. The most commonly used treatments are topical&#xD;
      (85%), physiotherapy (52%), and oral medications (45%). High quality randomized clinical&#xD;
      trials testing effectiveness of various therapy approaches are urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Somatocognitive therapy SCT is a multi-modal physiotherapy approach developed for alleviating&#xD;
      musculoskeletal persistent pain conditions. SCT has been previously evaluated in the&#xD;
      treatment of women with chronic pelvic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, 128 women with PVD will be randomized into SCT and treatment as usual&#xD;
      (TAU) group. Participants will be assessed at baseline, after 6 months and after 12 months.&#xD;
      The main outcome will be changes in female sexual function index scored at 12 months follow&#xD;
      up. Secondary outcomes include pain intensity as assessed by a tampon test as well as a&#xD;
      number of questionnaires recording different aspects of emotional and cognitive functioning.&#xD;
      In addition cost-effectiveness analysis of SCT versus TAU will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the SCT group will receive up to 15 therapy sessions and will additionally be&#xD;
      offered one booster session at 6 months after treatment ending. TAU group will follow&#xD;
      treatment options of their own choice based on recommendations from the Vulva clinic at Oslo&#xD;
      University Hospital, a center that is specialized in treating women with vulvar pain&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of the ProLoVe study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess clinical effectiveness of somatocognitive therapy (SCT) versus treatment as&#xD;
           usual (TAU) in provoked vestibulodynia (PVD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify prognostic factors associated with treatment outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of SCT vs TAU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a two-arm, single center randomized clinical trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio,&#xD;
      recruiting patients with PVD diagnosis. The participants will be randomized to either&#xD;
      somatocognitive therapy (SCT) or treatment as usual (TAU) group after baseline assessment.&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by type of PVD (primary or secondary), since primary PVD is&#xD;
      considered to be more treatment resistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' eligibility will be evaluated by the medical specialist in gynecology or&#xD;
      dermatology. During medical consultation an eligible patient will be verbally informed about&#xD;
      the study and receive an information leaflet about the project. Number of eligible patients&#xD;
      informed about the study, will be registered. Interested women will contact the primary&#xD;
      investigator who will set up a meeting. Detailed information about the trial, the assessment&#xD;
      instruments and existing treatment options will be provided. Women willing to pursue study&#xD;
      participation will sign an informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An administrative coordinator, not directly involved in the study, will be responsible for&#xD;
      randomization of the participants using a computer random number generator, and will be&#xD;
      responsible for the secure storage of randomization results. The participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to either somatocognitive physiotherapy (SCT) or treatment as usual group (TAU) at&#xD;
      1:1 allocation rate. Randomization will be stratified by severity (primary/secondary PVD).&#xD;
      Blinding of the participants regarding group belonging is not possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All quantitative instruments will be distributed as electronic forms (nettskjema.no) and&#xD;
      directly transferred to the Service for Sensitive Data (TSD). Choice and implementation of&#xD;
      assessment instruments is based on the Recommendations for the study of the vulvar pain in&#xD;
      women, part I: review of assessment tools (Rosen et al. 2020), feedback from participants&#xD;
      from the feasibility study and discussions with user representative (former PVD patient).&#xD;
      Three assessment time points are planned: baseline, 6 months follow up, and 12 months follow&#xD;
      up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis suggests that 128 participants split equally between two study arms will be&#xD;
      enough to reveal the between group difference in total FSFI score changes, from baseline to&#xD;
      12 months follow-up, of at least 3 points (SD = 6.0) as statistically significant, using α =&#xD;
      0.05 and 1-β = 0.8. In a feasibility study (n=10) an average of 6 points improvement on FSFI&#xD;
      in course of 8 months in patients treated with SCT was observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: To assess clinical effectiveness of somatocognitive therapy (SCT) versus&#xD;
      treatment as usual (TAU) in provoked vestibulodynia (PVD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: In treatment of PVD, the effectiveness of somatocognitive therapy is not&#xD;
      significantly different from treatment as usual as evaluated by changes in FSFI total score&#xD;
      from baseline to 12 months follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independently, a senior statistician and PhD student blinded to treatment group will perform&#xD;
      intention to treat analyses of the treatment effect on the primary outcome by using linear&#xD;
      mixed model for repeated measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup analysis (objective 1) Some of the women with PVD do not engage in penetrative sex&#xD;
      and thus score 0 at the FSFI pain sub-scale. This influences the psychometric properties of&#xD;
      FSFI and it is recommended to exclude the pain sub-scale from the analysis in those cases.&#xD;
      Therefore, additional analyzes will be performed on the subgroups of women who did and did&#xD;
      not have penetrative sex during the 4 weeks prior to FSFI completion using the same&#xD;
      statistical approaches as for hypothesis 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: To identify prognostic factors associated with treatment outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      For prognostic analyses, changes in FSFI scores between baseline and 12 months follow up as&#xD;
      the dependent variable will be used. Further, an association model to assess possible&#xD;
      associations between selected variables and the main outcome will be constructed. The&#xD;
      variables that reached the level of significance of at least 0.10 in univariate analyses will&#xD;
      be entered into multiple regression models. To avoid over-fitting, at most, one variable per&#xD;
      10 events will be included. In addition, highly correlated covariates (&gt;0.7) will not be&#xD;
      included in the final model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: To assess cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of SCT vs TAU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cost-effectiveness analysis will be carried out from a healthcare and society&#xD;
      perspective, comparing the treatment effect and health utilities by using the EuroQoL 5D&#xD;
      (EQ-5D-5L) utility index. Health gains will be expressed as quality-adjusted life years&#xD;
      (QALYs) derived from the EQ-5D-5L utility scores. Costs to the healthcare system and society&#xD;
      (production loss) due to PVD will be estimated based on data recorded at the follow-ups&#xD;
      including visits to general practitioner, medical specialist, physical therapist, manual&#xD;
      therapist or other physical therapy specialist, and other therapists (e.g. chiropractor,&#xD;
      osteopath, psychologist); number of days of hospitalization and/or rehabilitation; use of&#xD;
      medication). Data concerning production loss will include work status in terms of working&#xD;
      time (percentage of position), partial sick leave (percentage, duration, and reason),&#xD;
      complete sick leave (duration and reason), disability pension (percentage, duration, and&#xD;
      reason), unemployment (yes, no), and student/other/unknown (yes, no).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proportion comparisons of women who experienced successful treatment outcome in SCT and TAU&#xD;
      group will be analyzed using global perceived effect scale at 12 months follow up applying&#xD;
      logistic regression for repeated measures. Within and between group differences in other&#xD;
      secondary outcomes will be evaluated using linear mixed model for repeated measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory analysis in TAU group Participants in the TAU group may choose a variety of&#xD;
      different treatment options, e.g. other types of physiotherapy, osteopathy, chiropractor&#xD;
      treatment, etc. Exploratory analysis will be conducted to identify the most promising&#xD;
      treatments with respect to improvement on the FSFI using repeated measures analysis of&#xD;
      variance. The goal of these analyses is to identify candidate treatments for future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all analyses, the between-group mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CI) or&#xD;
      odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI for categorical outcomes will be reported. Missing data will be&#xD;
      replaced using multiple imputation methods.&#xD;
