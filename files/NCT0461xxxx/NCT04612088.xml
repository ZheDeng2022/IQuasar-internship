    <textblock>
      This project has a parallel randomized controlled experimental design since within the&#xD;
      methodology there will be a control of the conditions under study, that is, the selection of&#xD;
      subjects, the way the treatment will be administered, the way in which the observations will&#xD;
      be obtained, the use of instruments to perform the measurements and the interpretation of the&#xD;
      criteria will be implemented in a homogeneous manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Convenience sampling was used to obtain the subjects for the study, the sample size was 34&#xD;
      bariatric patients from a private bariatric center in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups. The group understudy or&#xD;
      experimental or the control group on the waitlist; that is, no researcher or study&#xD;
      participant made the decision of treatment that participants receive. The intervention&#xD;
      consists of two psychoeducative sessions and five cognitive dissonance sessions. All&#xD;
      participants will receive the same multivitamin for the duration of the study. Validated&#xD;
      tests for adherence, medication knowledge, self-care, self-efficacy, and psychopathological&#xD;
      symptoms were applied to both groups. Additionally, a blood sample was collected for the&#xD;
      determination of Hemoglobin, Iron, Copper, Zinc, Calcium, Phosphate, Vitamin D, and Folate.&#xD;
      Measurements using tests and blood samples will be made before and after receiving the&#xD;
      intervention [pre and post-test]. For results analysis, Repeated measures ANOVA will be used,&#xD;
      the study population shall be stratified into subgroups, by type of bariatric surgery, age,&#xD;
      and sex; this in order to restrict comparisons to participants who are part of the same&#xD;
      subgroup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess the impact of an intervention based on the cognitive&#xD;
      dissonance theory to promote adherence to the bariatric multivitamin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is: Participants exposed to Festinger's theory-based intervention&#xD;
      will exhibit changes in their attitude and behavior towards multivitamin intake as a product&#xD;
      of cognitive dissonance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2016, 650 million people around the&#xD;
      world were already obese, for their part in 2013 the Organization for Economic Cooperation&#xD;
      and Development (OCDE) indicated that globally Mexico and the United States had the highest&#xD;
      rate of overweight and obesity in adults. Mexico is the second country, after the United&#xD;
      States, with the highest obesity, almost one third of Mexican adults (32.4%) suffered from&#xD;
      obesity in that year, a significant increase from 24% in 2000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the National Health and Nutrition Survey the states of northern Mexico, as is&#xD;
      the case of Baja California, occupy the first places of obesity index nationwide. Morbid&#xD;
      Obesity (MO) poses a high health risk in those who suffer from it, as multiple complications&#xD;
      arise from it, therefore it is of uttermost importance that this disease is successfully&#xD;
      treated and controlled, however, conventional weight loss therapeutics guided by the&#xD;
      implementation of behavioral therapy, physical activity, low calorie diet and drug treatment&#xD;
      , has shown short-term unsuccessful results. A treatment alternative is Bariatric Surgery&#xD;
      (BS) which, according to recommendations issued in 1991 by the U.S. National Institutes of&#xD;
      Health (NIH), is considered the treatment of choice for this pathology. While BS has proven&#xD;
      to be a successful treatment for long-term sustained weight loss, it is accompanied by major&#xD;
      complications such as micronutrient deficiency, which is attributed to intrinsic and&#xD;
      extrinsic factors, intrinsic factors refer to deficiencies recorded prior to BS and are&#xD;
      related to MO or to the surgical technique itself that induces changes in metabolism in&#xD;
      addition to reducing the ability to food in the stomach, limit digestion and cause&#xD;
      malabsorption. For their part, extrinsic factors correspond to the lack of adherence in terms&#xD;
      of diet and prescribed multivitamin supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lack of adherence is related to the level of knowledge about the supplementation and behavior&#xD;
      of the morbid patient on decision-making, as they tend to present negative thoughts about the&#xD;
      prescribed treatment that are usually accompanied by lack of ability to make changes in both&#xD;
      attitude and behavior, which will hardly change even after surgery; this is consistent with&#xD;
      the results reported in various studies that indicate that the main behavioral factors of&#xD;
      non-adherence to treatment in this population are the low self-efficacy and attitudes that&#xD;
      the patient adopts towards treatment on self-care, as well as low self-esteem and distortion&#xD;
      of self-concept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As described, BS can be considered a process of adaptation that can pose a challenge for&#xD;
      those who experience it as the person must be aware of the impact of surgery on the body in&#xD;
      order to effectively adhere to the agreed treatment plan, making decisions in conjunction&#xD;
      with health professionals in order to reduce risk factors , focusing therefore on prevention&#xD;
      and timely intervention of them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this sense, psychology turns out to be a science that allows to develop instruments that&#xD;
      evaluate the congruence between attitudes, thought and behavior, as well as the creation of&#xD;
      strategies that promote health promoting the congruence between attitude and behavior. Leon&#xD;
      Festinger in 1957 proposed the theory of Cognitive Dissonance, which states that people tend&#xD;
      to change their attitudes and behaviors or justify them as a result of the divergence of two&#xD;
      cognitions manifested at the same time; according to this theory, the individual strives to&#xD;
      achieve consistency within himself. Opinions and attitudes tend to be present in groups that&#xD;
      are internally consistent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      POST-operated Bariatric Surgery patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Bariatric Surgery patients who permanently radiate in the Tijuana Co.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling type:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first time, non-probabilistic, convenience sampling for the selection of participants&#xD;
      and in a second time for randomization stratification will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling site:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One private bariatric center in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. Research plan&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Submission and approval of the research protocol to the bioethics committee of the&#xD;
           Faculty of Medicine and Psychology (FMYP) of the Autonomous University of Baja&#xD;
           California (UABC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Designing the manuals of psycho-educational intervention and dissonance to promote and&#xD;
           improve adherence to the multivitamin prescribed in bariatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Once obtaining the bioethics committee approval, the authorities of a private bariatric&#xD;
           center operating patients living in Tijuana were consulted to request their cooperation&#xD;
           in conducting the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (d) Data collection was carried out through the review of clinical records in accordance with&#xD;
      the Mexican Official Norm (NOM) NOM-004-SSA3-2012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (e) Persons who meet the inclusion criteria were contacted by telephone in order to recruit&#xD;
      the participants who were included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (f) Arrange a face-to-face appointment with the person who decides to participate to sign the&#xD;
      document &quot;informed consent (IC)&quot; version 1.0, in order to clarify doubts about the&#xD;
      methodology of the project and inform him that his participation is voluntary, that at any&#xD;
      time he may withdraw his consent and that the information he provides will be handled&#xD;
      confidentially, in accordance with NOM-012-SSA3-2012 on Human Research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (g) Participants were randomly assigned to the experimental group and control group on the&#xD;
      waiting list using the on-line tool GraphPad QuickCalcs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (h) For the application of the measuring instrument (MI) in order to comply with the&#xD;
      recommendations of the WHO derived from the COVID pandemic and maintain social distancing,&#xD;
      the MI containing all tests was adapted for a digital application using Google Forms and the&#xD;
      group sessions were modified to be video conferences through Google Meet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) For the sessions of cognitive dissonance and psycho-education, Psychology Bachelors were&#xD;
      trained and randomly assigned to the cognitive or psycho-educational intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (j) The pre-test and post-test blood samples are taken one day after the application of the&#xD;
      MI (before and after the intervention), according to NOM-253-SSA1-2012 for the disposal of&#xD;
      human blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (k) The determination of biomarkers was carried out according to the NOM-007-SSA3-2011 for&#xD;
      the operation of clinical laboratories. The analysis of calcium, phosphorus, and serum iron&#xD;
      was carried out within the facilities of the UABC Medical Care and Research Centre (CUMAII)&#xD;
      using colorimetric spectrophotometry; The levels of Vit-D and Folate were be analyzed by&#xD;
      Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA), the quantification of hemoglobin was performed&#xD;
      during flow cytometry. For the determination of minerals (zinc and copper) in serum, a&#xD;
      collaboration agreement will be held with the Graduate Center of the Tijuana Institute of&#xD;
      Technology; the method of analysis will be Mass Spectrometry with Inductively Coupled Plasma&#xD;
      (ICP/MS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (l) The week following sampling, 90-minute online intervention sessions will begin every two&#xD;
      weeks for three months. It is important to mention that, before the first online session&#xD;
      (second week) the participants of both groups will be given a bariatric multivitamin&#xD;
      supplement with 60 chewable tablets, dispensing a new one of the same brand as the first,&#xD;
      this in order to cover three months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (m) Participants were asked to inform through a phone call to the research team in case of&#xD;
      presenting any adverse effects such as nausea, vomit, dizziness, or diarrhea. This will be&#xD;
      noted in the corresponding document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (n) Once the post-test data have been obtained, databases will be developed in the SPSS&#xD;
      version 26.0 statistical program for Windows, which will be analyzed by repeated-measures&#xD;
      ANOVA in order to evaluate the effect of the intervention on adherence to the Multivitamin&#xD;
      evidenced by biomarker levels.&#xD;
