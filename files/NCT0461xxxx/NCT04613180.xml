    <intervention_model_description>Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups. I the group (control) included 40 patients who received standard therapy. The second group included 40 patients who received oral montelukast sodium. The therapeutic dosage of the drug was 0.2 mg/kg/day, the daily dose was prescribed once a day for the entire duration of the disease. As a prevention of repeated episodes of bronchial obstructive syndrome, the drug was prescribed at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day, the duration of anti-relapse therapy was 30 days.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Children aged 1 to 7 years with recurrent obstructive bronchitis who will be treated in the Emergency Pediatrics and pediatric intensive care departments of the Emergency hospital of Samarkand will be examined. Patients will be randomly divided into 2 groups. Group I (control) will include 40 patients who received standard therapy and placebo. Group II will include 40 patients who received oral montelukast sodium in addition to standard therapy. Modified bronchophonography will be used to determine the effectiveness of the therapy.</description>
