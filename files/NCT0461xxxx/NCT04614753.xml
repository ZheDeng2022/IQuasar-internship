  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women are the major consumers of red wine, and they are conscious about aging-related chronic&#xD;
      inflammation, skin damages, and dysbiosis. Previous studies demonstrated the antioxidant,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory, and gut microbiome protective activities of muscadine wine and grapes in&#xD;
      cell culture and mouse experiments. These activities have not been confirmed in clinical&#xD;
      trials which are the gold standard to associate a food with a health benefit. There have been&#xD;
      very few clinical trials conducted on muscadine wine compared to vinifera wine. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that a glass of red muscadine wine (150 mL) daily for 28 days will&#xD;
      significantly alleviate oxidative stress, inflammation, skin photoaging, and improve gut&#xD;
      microbiome in women compared to drinking Sprite. A randomized cross-over human intervention&#xD;
      will be conducted to test the hypothesis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aging of the skin is characterized by wrinkling, sagging, and laxity. About 80% of facial&#xD;
      skin aging is classified as extrinsic, or photoaging because it results from exposure to UV&#xD;
      light of the sun that causes oxidative stress The remaining 20% of facial aging is the&#xD;
      intrinsic type which is partially caused by the accumulation of proteins that are modified by&#xD;
      reactive carbonyls in a reaction known as protein glycation. Aging also shifts the&#xD;
      composition of the gut microbiome in at least 35 genera towards an unhealthy state of&#xD;
      dysbiosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies showed that muscadine nutraceuticals inhibited protein glycation under a&#xD;
      simulated physiological condition. Additional experiments using cell culture and mice showed&#xD;
      that muscadine wine alleviated inflammation and protected against dysbiosis in the gut. The&#xD;
      objective of this research is to confirm the health benefits of muscadine wine in a clinical&#xD;
      trial. The investigators hypothesize that muscadine wine consumption in women over 50 years&#xD;
      old will alleviate skin photoaging and skin conditions by decreasing oxidative stress and&#xD;
      inflammation. It is also expected to improve the composition of the gut microbiome.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline Skin color after UV radiation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Irradiation will be applied to dorsal skin (back, scapular region not typically exposed to the sun) with 2 times of minimal erythema dose using an FDA approved UVB phototherapy light and a UV light meter. At each time point on day 0 and 29, skin color will be measured before and 24 h after irradiation. Skin color will be evaluated by a colorimeter using the 3-dimensional color system with L-, a-, and b-values. L- and b- values assess lightness and browning effects, respectively. The a-value (red/green-axis) is a measure for reddening (erythema).</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline skin transepidermal water loss</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Skin transepidermal water loss will be measured using a Tewameter (CK Electronic GmbH, Germany) to evaluate the water barrier function of the skin. The Tewameter measures the density gradient of the water evaporation from the skin (g/h/m^2)</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Skin erythema and melanin index will be assessed with Mexameter (CK Electronic GmbH, Germany). These two components are mainly responsible for the color of the skin. They are measured by reflectance.</description>
