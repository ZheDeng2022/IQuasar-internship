  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of topiramate (TPM) in obese patients&#xD;
      with respect to weight loss and pain after total joint replacement surgery&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigator hypothesize that low dose peri-operative topiramate is superior to gabapentin in&#xD;
      reducing postoperative pain and opioid consumption after primary TJA with a more favorable&#xD;
      side effect profile that will facilitate patient optimization via pre- and postoperative&#xD;
      weight loss.&#xD;

    <measure>WOMAC score Evaluate Short-term Arthroplasty-related Outcomes and Complications while on Topiramate or Gabapentin at 6 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>6 week</time_frame>
    <description>WOMAC score will be calculated after surgery. The test questions are scored on a scale of 0-4, which correspond to: None (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2), Severe (3), and Extreme (4).&#xD;
The scores for each subscale are summed up, with a possible score range of 0-20 for Pain, 0-8 for Stiffness, and 0-68 for Physical Function. Usually a sum of the scores for all three subscales gives a total WOMAC score, however there are other methods that have been used to combine scores</description>
