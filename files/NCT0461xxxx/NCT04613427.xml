    <textblock>
      Patients admitted to Haukeland University Hospital with either UIA or aSAH underwent a&#xD;
      measurement of bioelectrical impedance and body mass composition using InBody 10. Lipids and&#xD;
      lipoproteins were collected from plasma. 60 patients in total were included in the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a condition mainly caused by the rupture of intracranial&#xD;
      aneurysms. The estimated prevalence of intracranial aneurysms in the general population is&#xD;
      1-2%, with an annual incidence of aneurysm rupture causing subarachnoid hemorrhage estimated&#xD;
      around 1% in Norway. The mortality rates for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) are as&#xD;
      high as 35%, and for the survivors the condition represents a significant morbidity with&#xD;
      long-term cognitive impairment and other challenges. With a mean age of 51-55 years at&#xD;
      presentation, the burden, both for the patients themselves and on health care resources, is&#xD;
      substantial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the risk assessment and management of patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms&#xD;
      (UIA) represents a substantial challenge. The number of patients with incidentally discovered&#xD;
      cerebral aneurysms is rapidly growing with the increasing use of non-invasive intracranial&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Therapy options are endovascular coiling, neurosurgical&#xD;
      clipping, or observation. To decide whether to perform a potentially harmful prophylactic&#xD;
      procedure or not, better tools to predict the risk of rupture in the given individual are&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some risk factors, both for the development of an intracranial aneurysm and for the rupture&#xD;
      leading to hemorrhage are identified, such as hypertension, age and smoking. Recent research&#xD;
      has shown that obesity and hypercholesterolemia is surprisingly associated with an apparent&#xD;
      lower risk of aSAH. However, underlying body composition and dyslipidemic patterns has not&#xD;
      yet been explored. Increased knowledge of predictors for aneurysm rupture is required, both&#xD;
      to improve the patient care and the decision-making concerning the neurosurgical prevention&#xD;
      of aSAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the RAPID project, the investigators aim to identify potential new risk factors for the&#xD;
      rupture of intracranial aneurysms by comparing the lipid and lipoprotein profile and the body&#xD;
      mass composition in patients with UIA and aSAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct-segmental multisegmental bioimpedance analysis (DSM-BIA) is a valid tool for the&#xD;
      assessment of total body and segmental composition and has shown excellent agreements when&#xD;
      compared with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Body composition will be analysed&#xD;
      within day 2 after intervention or surgery using a DSM-BIA scanner (InBody S10, BioSpace Ltd,&#xD;
      Seoul, South Korea).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lipids will be measured enzymatically in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) plasma/serum&#xD;
      on a Hitachi 917 system (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) using the triacylglycerol&#xD;
      (GPO-PAP), cholesterol (CHOD-PAP), HDL-cholesterol plus and LDL-cholesterol plus kit from&#xD;
      Roche Diagnostics, and the non-esterifies fatty acid (NEFA FD) kit and the phospholipids kit&#xD;
      (Phospholipids FS) from &quot;DiaSys Diagnostic Systems GmbH&quot; (Holzheim, Germany). Glucose will be&#xD;
      measured in EDTA-plasma using the Gluco-quant Glucose/HK (GLU) kit from Roche. The total&#xD;
      fatty acid composition in EDTA-plasma will be analysed using gas chromatography/mass&#xD;
      spectrometry (GC/MS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lipoprotein particle size analysis will be performed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance&#xD;
      (NMR) spectroscopy. Particle concentrations of lipoproteins of different sizes will be&#xD;
      calculated from the measured amplitudes of their spectroscopically lipid methyl group NMR&#xD;
      signals. Lipoprotein particle size will be derived from the sum of diameter of each subclass&#xD;
      multiplied by its relative mass percentage based on the amplitude of its methyl NMR signal.&#xD;
      Particle size analysis will be performed by the Norwegian University of Science and&#xD;
      Technology (NTNU).&#xD;
