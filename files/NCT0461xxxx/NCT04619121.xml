    <textblock>
      This study was designed to be a 3 year, 3 phases project, and will explore the therapeutic&#xD;
      effects from near-infrared transcranial photobiomodulation (NIR tPBM) in major depressive&#xD;
      disordered human subjects, and it's biological mechanisms in cellular and animal model.&#xD;
      However, due to shortage of funding under the pandemics, the project is now modified to start&#xD;
      from its clinical part first, and will continue to its basic parts later when funding&#xD;
      resources in place.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of the overall global burden of disease in&#xD;
      modern society, and has been estimated to move into the first place by 2030. Current&#xD;
      antidepressants and psychotherapy had proved their efficacy, but are limited by the adverse&#xD;
      effects and shortage of capable therapists worldwide. Accumulating evidence showed that&#xD;
      hypometabolism of global and specific brain regions, inflammation, oxidative stress,&#xD;
      suppression of neurogenesis and disturbed circadian rhythm all contribute to the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of MDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Paolo Cassano, MD, PhD and his team from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) of&#xD;
      Harvard University recently demonstrated in both animal and human subjects that near-infrared&#xD;
      radiation-transcranial photobiomodulation (NIR-tPBM) is a well-tolerated and effective&#xD;
      treatment modality for MDD, and hypothesized NIR-tPBM may activate brain metabolism, be&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory, reduce oxidative stress and promote neurogenesis. So far, the clinical&#xD;
      studies are either open-labeled or only of small scale (n=21), and the real antidepressant&#xD;
      mechanism of NIR-tPBM has not yet been fully understood. Adequately powered, well designed,&#xD;
      double-blind randomized-control trials of larger scale is in pressing need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this 3-year study, we will collaborate with the team from Harvard University and MGH, to&#xD;
      comprehensively evaluate from cellular mechanism, animal model, to clinical trials in human,&#xD;
      the underlying mechanism of NIR-tPBM and the clinical strategy of NIR-tPBM. In the cellular&#xD;
      study, we will culture and treat the human neuron-like cell lines with continuous NIR-PBM of&#xD;
      different dosimetry and different duration, and compare the differences in cellular circadian&#xD;
      rhythm, energy metabolism, and inflammation markers as well as the underlying gene&#xD;
      expression. In the animal study, the mice under chronic stress environment will be treated&#xD;
      with NIR-tPBM of different duration. We will compare the behavioral differences relevant to&#xD;
      anxiety, depression and cognitive performance, as well as the differences in neurogenesis,&#xD;
      neuroplasticity, energy metabolism, circadian rhythm, and inflammation markers of the mice&#xD;
      and the gene expression of the biomarkers. In both cellular and animal studies, dose-response&#xD;
      assessment will be applied. In the clinical human study, we will conduct a prospective,&#xD;
      double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial, recruiting totally 80 MDD patients, age 18&#xD;
      to 75, and apply adjunctive NIR t-PBM to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, bilaterally and&#xD;
      simultaneously, from 20 minutes and up to 80 minutes a day under the evaluation and&#xD;
      recommendation of the clinicians, for 8 consecutive weeks. The change in depressive symptoms&#xD;
      and circadian behaviors will be recorded in the 0, 2, 4, 8, 12 weeks and compared. The&#xD;
      patient's peripheral blood-based biochemistry profile, inflammatory, oxidative stress, and&#xD;
      circadian rhythm markers, as well as the gene expression of the relevant markers, will be&#xD;
      collected in week 0, 8, and 12, and be compared.&#xD;
