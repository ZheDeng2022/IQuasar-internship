  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PDE6A gene encodes a subunit of the rod phosphodiesterase. The loss of this enzyme&#xD;
      function leads to a chronically elevated cGMP level which causes an increased calcium inflow&#xD;
      into the cell and thereby the hyperactivation of cell death pathways. The goal of the PIGMENT&#xD;
      study is to develop, produce and investigate a recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV) gene&#xD;
      transfer vector for the curative therapy of PDE6A-linked retinitis pigmentosa in patients, in&#xD;
      order to counteract their disease progression and to stop further impairment of visual&#xD;
      function. The vector is given with a single subretinal injection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      &quot;PIGMENT - Subretinal PDE6A gene therapy for retinitis pigmentosa&quot; is an open mono-center,&#xD;
      phase I/IIa trial with fellow-eye comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study begins with a detailed preliminary examination (Screening), comprises a total of 13&#xD;
      visits and ends after one year. In between, after the gene therapy injection (injection of&#xD;
      the vector under the retina with one of four doses), regular controls are carried out at the&#xD;
      Center for Ophthalmology Tübingen. Monitoring will be contimued after the first year, once a&#xD;
      year two, three, four and five years after the injection. The study will take place&#xD;
      exclusively at the Center for Ophthalmology in Tübingen and involves nine patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients participating in this study receive treatment, i.e. there is no placebo or sham&#xD;
      treatment group. A 30-day safety distance is maintained between each patient and each group.&#xD;
      An independent committee will decide, after each injection of three patients, which dose the&#xD;
      following three patients will receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients can benefit from the treatment by slowing or stopping the loss of the rods and&#xD;
      allowing them to function to a certain extent. Therefore, a possible benefit for patients may&#xD;
      be that the vision problems will be improved by gene therapy. Such improvements could improve&#xD;
      the overall quality of life and well-being. However, as no experience with gene therapy for&#xD;
      retinitis pigmentosa in humans has yet been gained, we cannot promise any improvement. Within&#xD;
      the scope of this study, patients will be given particularly intensive care and psychological&#xD;
      support will also be offered in order to do everything for the patient's well-being and&#xD;
      health during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time Schedule: Start of trial Q3/2019 (FPFV), end of recruitment Q3/2020, end of trial&#xD;
      Q4/2025 (LPLV), duration of trial per patient: one year with four years of follow-up. The&#xD;
      final study report will be prepared after completion of the four year follow-up period (5&#xD;
      years after treatment).&#xD;

    <description>The first 3 patients (C1) will receive the intermediate dose 1x1010 vg. After injection of the 3rd patient of C1, the DMC will give a go/no go decision. If 'nogo', a lower dose (5x109 vg) will be given to the next group of 3 patients (C2). The DMC will give a go/no go decision. In case of a &quot;go&quot; decision, 3 further patients (C3) will be treated with the same dose. In the case of a no-go decision, the next dose will be the minimal dose 1x109 vg. In case of a 'go' decision of the DMC after the third patient, the next 3 patients will receive a subretinal injection of vector at the highest dose 5x1010 vg. The DMC will give a go/no go decision after review of all safety data available at D30 of cohort 2. If safety data is considered favourably by the DMC, then 3further patients (cohort 3) will be treated with the same dose (5x1010 vg). Should any safety concerns arise, the last three patients (cohort 3) will receive the intermediate dose (1x1010 vg).</description>
