  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ageing is associated with the development of various negative conditions, such as frailty.&#xD;
      Defined as a decreased ability to combat negative stressors (e.g. injury and illness),&#xD;
      frailty is highly prevalent in elderly adults and significantly increases an individual's&#xD;
      risk of adverse events such as falls, illness and death. The underlying physical&#xD;
      characteristics of frailty are currently incompletely understood, with many previous studies&#xD;
      focusing on one tissue (e.g. the brain) in isolation. However, frailty is known to affect&#xD;
      many tissues simultaneously, and to further our insight into the biological basis of frailty&#xD;
      and how to treat it, we must determine how different organs are affected at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will look at the physical characteristics of non-frail and frail elderly females&#xD;
      (aged 65 years and over), who are attending geriatric clinics across the Nottingham&#xD;
      University Hospitals NHS Trust. We will aim to recruit 51 participants with this cohort&#xD;
      broken down into non-frail (n=17), pre-frail (n=17) and frail (n=17) subgroups. Participants&#xD;
      will be allocated to these groups based on their Electronic Frailty Index, Clinical Frailty&#xD;
      Scale and Fried frailty phenotype scores. All participants will undergo basic muscle function&#xD;
      tests (grip strength, leg strength and muscle activity) and questionnaires on their first&#xD;
      visit to University of Nottingham laboratories. At a second visit, they will then undergo one&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanning session, at the Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre&#xD;
      within the University, to gather information about the structure and function of their heart,&#xD;
      brain and skeletal muscle. MRI scan protocols will take approximately 45-60 mins. Data&#xD;
      gathered from MRI scanning will be compared across non-frail, pre-frail and frail groups to&#xD;
      investigate differences across frailty states, with the aim of highlighting the defining&#xD;
      physical characteristics of the frail state which may help to develop future treatment&#xD;
      interventions to combat the condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesise that frail females will present with common physical characteristics, the&#xD;
      clustering of which will be indicative of frailty severity. We also hypothesise that certain&#xD;
      physical traits present in the frail will not be present in the non-frail.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will recruit females aged over 65 years (n=51), from those attending hospital&#xD;
      clinics for older people at both campuses of Nottingham University Hospitals National Health&#xD;
      Service (NHS) Trust. A member of the clinical care team working within the clinic will&#xD;
      identify potential participants who are 'frail', 'mildly frail/vulnerable' and 'non-frail'&#xD;
      using the Clinical Frailty Scale (measured as part of routine care), and the electronic&#xD;
      Frailty Index. Clinic staff will make the initial approach to patients about the study and if&#xD;
      the individual is interested in taking part, clinic staff will inform the research team. A&#xD;
      researcher will then approach the interested individual and provide a study information sheet&#xD;
      outlining study procedures. Potential participants will then be given a week to consider&#xD;
      participating in the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If individuals wish to participate, they will be invited to the David Greenfield Human&#xD;
      Physiology laboratories at the Queen's Medical Centre. Here, researchers will explain the&#xD;
      study again to volunteers and answer any questions that they may have. Volunteers will be&#xD;
      asked to sign an informed consent document prior to any other study procedures being&#xD;
      undertaken. Participants will initially have their height and body mass recorded and will&#xD;
      complete questionnaires assessing their suitability to have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      scans, their cognitive ability and independence across activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant's frailty status will be confirmed via the Fried Frailty phenotype&#xD;
      assessment which will include a timed 15ft (4.57m) walk, hand grip strength, and&#xD;
      questionnaires (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Minnesota Leisure Time&#xD;
      Activity Questionnaire). Participants who do not exhibit any frailty components will be&#xD;
      classed as non-frail, those showing one or two frailty components will be classified as&#xD;
      pre-frail, and those presenting three or more components will be classed as frail. These&#xD;
      measures of frailty severity will take approximately 30 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knee extensor strength and power measurements will then be made. They will involve&#xD;
      participants being seated in a chair and supported within the measuring apparatus (a padded&#xD;
      chair with back support at 90Â°) using straps (similar to a seat belt) which go across their&#xD;
      hips and shoulders. The participant's ankle will be positioned against a lever arm of the&#xD;
      equipment and again held in place by a padded support. The isometric strength assessment will&#xD;
      involve the participant pushing against the lever arm with maximum effort whilst it is fixed&#xD;
      and unable to move. A total of 3 contractions lasting ~2 seconds will be performed with a 1&#xD;
      min rest between each. Muscle power and fatigue will be assessed on the same machine but this&#xD;
      time the lever arm will move at a fixed rate. Participants will be asked to extend their leg&#xD;
      (as if kicking a ball) 10 times with the lever arm speed at a slow speed (60 degrees per&#xD;
      second) and 10 at a faster speed (180 degrees per second). These tests of muscle power output&#xD;
      have been administered routinely to elderly volunteers in the literature and our laboratory.&#xD;
      However, if these tests are not tolerable for participants, we will terminate the test. Knee&#xD;
      extensor measurements will take approximately 30 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of thigh muscle motor unit recruitment and motor control (a measure of the&#xD;
      electrical activity within the muscle) will then be taken. Measurements will involve placing&#xD;
      adhesive non-invasive ECG pads on to the participant's thigh, and a small (24-gauge) needle&#xD;
      inserted into the thigh muscle to a depth of ~0.5-2.5cm (depending on amount of subcutaneous&#xD;
      fat present). Participants will then be asked to gently contract their thigh muscle (the limb&#xD;
      will not be in motion) and the electrical activity of the muscle will be measured. In total,&#xD;
      this measure will take approximately 40 minutes to complete. Once completed, the electrodes&#xD;
      will be removed and the needle insertion site covered with a small adhesive dressing. Muscle&#xD;
      activity measures will take approximately 40 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On a separate day, following the visit to the physiology laboratories, participants will be&#xD;
      invited to the Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre at the University of Nottingham. Here, they&#xD;
      will undergo MRI scanning to gather images of the heart, brain, skeletal muscle and fat&#xD;
      content within the body. Participants will be made comfortable on the scan table using&#xD;
      pillows and pads to support their back, neck and joints. They will be asked to lie as still&#xD;
      as possible during the scan protocol and occasionally perform some short breath holds&#xD;
      (necessary to acquire certain scans). In total, the time spent in the scanner will be&#xD;
      approximately 60 minutes. However, lying still within the MRI scanner for ~60 minutes may be&#xD;
      burdensome for elderly participants. Therefore, we will offer short comfort breaks after 15&#xD;
      minutes and 40 minutes of scanning, during which participants may leave the scan room to use&#xD;
      the bathroom and consume refreshments if needed. This will not affect the scan procedure or&#xD;
      image collection.&#xD;
