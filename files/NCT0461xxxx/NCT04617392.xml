      The investigators' study published in 2020 (Pekar, M. et al.: The risk of sarcopenia 24&#xD;
      months after bariatric surgery - assessment by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA): a&#xD;
      prospective study; Videosurgery Miniinv 2020; https://doi.org/10.5114/wiitm.2020.93463) shows&#xD;
      that patients are at risk of sar-copenia after bariatric-metabolic (BM) surgery. BM surgery&#xD;
      leads to significant changes in body composition. Significant fat loss is followed by&#xD;
      unwanted muscle loss. The study shows that the lack of physical activity is typical for these&#xD;
      patients. To the algorithm of postoperative care the investigators plan to include controlled&#xD;
      exercise programs for these patients. The investigators do not know what the complexity and&#xD;
      time required to keep patients in good condition and reduce the risk of sarcopenia is. The&#xD;
      investigators want to find the adequate amount of physical activity while maintaining&#xD;
      long-term compliance of these patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is an important medical problem. The number of obese individuals is increasing&#xD;
      continuously in response to various environmental and genetic factors. For some morbidly&#xD;
      obese patients, surgery is the only effective type of therapy. Despite bariatric surgery&#xD;
      having good outcomes in terms of weight loss, it is associated with some adverse effects:&#xD;
      several studies have reported subsequent alterations in bone and muscle metabolism, patients&#xD;
      are getting in risk of sarcopenia. Of the surgical techniques available (laparoscopic gastric&#xD;
      banding, Roux-en-Y bypass, biliopancreatic diversion), laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG)&#xD;
      is currently the technique of choice. This type of surgery leads to significant changes in&#xD;
      body composition. Significant fat loss is followed by unwanted muscle loss. To the algorithm&#xD;
      of postoperative care the investigators plan to include controlled exercise programs for&#xD;
      these patients. The investigators do not know what the complexity and time required to keep&#xD;
      patients in good condition and reduce the risk of sarcopenia is. The investigators want to&#xD;
      find the adequate amount of physical activity while maintaining long-term compliance of these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been designed as a prospective randomized study, which is in conformity with&#xD;
      the principles and guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration, good clinical practice and will be&#xD;
      approved by the Ethical Committee of the Hospital AGEL Ostrava-Vitkovice, Czech Republic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential study participants will undergo an initial examination at the clinical department&#xD;
      of the surgical department specializing in obesity. In addition to professional surgical and&#xD;
      internal examination, the potential patient will be examined by a clinical psychologist for&#xD;
      the ability to participate in this type of study for a long time. Informed consent will be&#xD;
      provided to selected study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 patients who undergo surgery will be randomized in two cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: obese patients with LSG: 25 patients with controlled aerobic / anaerobic&#xD;
           activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: obese LSG patients 25 patients without controlled physical activity&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients enrolled in the study are followed for the period of 24 months. Individual will&#xD;
      be evaluated before the bariatric procedure and 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary goal of the study is to evaluate the Hypothesis 0 : there is no difference between&#xD;
      muscle function, volume and morphology between patients after BM operations who are no longer&#xD;
      controlled by physical activity and between patients who undergo controlled regular exercise&#xD;
      programs under professional supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: Monitoring of knee cartilage during weight reduction after bariatric&#xD;
      surgery and monitoring of gait biomechanics during weight reduction after bariatric surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo the following examinations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight: body weight will be measured on a calibrated scale. The measurement itself will be&#xD;
      performed in underwear, without shoes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Waist circumference: the circumference will be measured using a fixed tape measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body composition: measurement of body composition of obese individuals will be performed&#xD;
      using DXA (Dual-emission X-ray absorptiometry, Discovery A, Hologic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examination of muscle mass and muscle strength:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle mass: measurement of the composition and structure of skeletal muscles and fat in&#xD;
           the thigh will be performed using MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle strength: the measurement will be performed using a battery of tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      handgrip dynamometer, chair-stand-walk test, test of getting up from a chair, test of 400&#xD;
      meters walk&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  physical activity questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  controlled regular exercise programs: patients will be divided into two cohorts - with&#xD;
           and without physical intervention. Patients included in the intervention cohort with&#xD;
           physical activity will undergo three months of strength endurance training under the&#xD;
           supervision of a professional physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life: calibrated 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and The Impact of Weight&#xD;
      on Quality of Life (IWQOL) questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical analyzes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be taken from each test subject after 12 hours of fasting by venipuncture&#xD;
      before the actual bariatric procedure and then repeatedly in the follow-up period after the&#xD;
      procedure. The samples will be centrifuged under standard conditions and the concentrations&#xD;
      of the following substances will then be determined in the serum samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • glucose, glycated hemoglobin, alkaline phosphatase, total calcium, phosphates, parathyroid&#xD;
      hormone, total protein, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase,&#xD;
      gamma-glutamyltransferase, creatinine. After determination of these analytes, serum (plasma)&#xD;
      aliquots will be frozen at -80 ° C until analysis of other selected parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persons involved in the study may terminate their participation or be excluded from the study&#xD;
      at any time for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death of the subject&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Voluntary withdrawal from the study: the subject voluntarily decides not to continue in&#xD;
           the next part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Loss from follow-up: the subject does not show up for scheduled inspections more than&#xD;
           one month after the scheduled inspection or examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Risk / benefit ratio: while evaluating the results during follow-up, the clinical&#xD;
           coordinator finds that continuing the study is not in the best interests of the subject&#xD;
           with respect to the subject.&#xD;
