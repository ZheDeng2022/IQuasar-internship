      The aim of this study is to identify the knowledge , attitude and practice toward PPI use&#xD;
      among doctors in Egypt&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were developed in the '80s and their use has continuously&#xD;
      grown. They represent the first choice in the treatment of acid-related diseases and are&#xD;
      currently themost prescribed drugs in the world [1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, PPIs have become the 8th therapeutic class on the prescription list in 2013.&#xD;
      This impacted on health care costs especially in the last decade: in 2010, USA paid $13.9&#xD;
      billion for PPIs [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies described a range of adverse events related to longterm PPI use [5,6], some&#xD;
      of them are related to increased gastric pH which could alter intestinal bacterial flora and&#xD;
      drugs or electrolyteabsorption. Another issue is represented by potential pharmacological&#xD;
      interactions between PPIs and other drugs, due to interference with liver metabolic systems,&#xD;
      and competition for renal excretion [7-16].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The huge increase in PPI use cannot be justified only by increased prevalence of acid-related&#xD;
      diseases or extension of therapeutic indications. Some studies have shown that PPIs are often&#xD;
      over-administered in hospital setting, inappropriately prescribed at discharge and maintained&#xD;
      by general practitioners (GPs) [1,17,18] A recent research showed that 86% of patients who&#xD;
      were prescribed PPIs did not have appropriate indications in the general medical ward of a&#xD;
      tertiary Jordanian hospital [2]. Another study showed that PPI were taken by 25.4% of the&#xD;
      patients hospitalized in an internal medicine department of a tertiary Greek hospital, but as&#xD;
      many as 81.2% of them had no indications [11].&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the knowledge and practice of physicians in Egypt toward the use of PPI is not well&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
