  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to elucidate the factors affecting the remodeling process of&#xD;
      arteriolosclerosis under current practice recommendations. Such knowledge may improve the&#xD;
      understanding of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) mechanism, define pharmacological&#xD;
      therapy and suggest treatment target.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Around 68 patients who have acute cerebral ischemic symptoms attributed by cSVD will be&#xD;
      recruited. Stroke etiology will be determined by Neurologists based on clinical syndrome,&#xD;
      vascular imaging features and concurrent cardiovascular risks. The time window for&#xD;
      recruitment is 4 weeks from the qualifying stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an informed consent for the study, potential candidates will undergo a cranial MRI and&#xD;
      MR angiography. Patients who are found to have acute or subacute lacunar infarcts (defined as&#xD;
      an infarct diameter &lt; 15mm) in the territories supplied by the lateral lenticulostriate&#xD;
      arteries, i.e. internal capsule, putamen, external capsular or corona radiata, will proceed&#xD;
      to a 3-Dimensional rotational angiography (3DRA) at baseline and in 12 months. All recruited&#xD;
      patients will receive single antiplatelet agents and statin. Their cognition, mobility and&#xD;
      treat cardiovascular risk factors based on 4 pre-specified goals (as elaborated in Study&#xD;
      Procedures) will also be regularly reviewed.&#xD;

          2. Patient is 30 to 85 years of age, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who have an acute lacunar infarct in diffusion-weighted MRI compatible with&#xD;
             small vessel disease in territories supplied by the lateral lenticulostriate arteries&#xD;
