  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AEYE-DS is a software device developed to increase compliance with diabetic retinopathy&#xD;
      screening by automatically detecting more-than-mild diabetic retinopathy from digital fundus&#xD;
      images using AI-based software. This study has been designed to validate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of the device at primary care and other point of care sites.&#xD;

    <description>An AI software device (AEYE-DS) to be used as a diagnostic tool to assist primary care clinicians in screening for diabetic retinopathy using digital funduscopic images. The device automatically detects more than mild diabetic retinopathy (mtmDR) in adults diagnosed with diabetes who have not been previously diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy.</description>

    <description>Eligible participants will undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
Photographic imaging of each eye using a funduscopy camera device. Images obtained will be sent to the AEYE-DS software for analysis.&#xD;
Additional photographic and OCT images will be obtained using a second funduscopy/OCT camera device. Images obtained will be sent to a professional reading center for analysis.&#xD;
All study subjects will have their pupils dilated using dilation drops.</description>
