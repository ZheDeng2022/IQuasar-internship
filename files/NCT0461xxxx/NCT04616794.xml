  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching aim is to develop and deploy a multidomain intervention delivered on a mobile&#xD;
      application to help older adults reduce their risk for dementia by improving a set of&#xD;
      modifiable lifestyle risk factors associated with cognitive decline/dementia. The targeted&#xD;
      domains are physical activity, diet, and cognitively stimulating activity. This registration&#xD;
      concerns the Proof-of-concept study which will examine if individual parts of the&#xD;
      intervention program achieve a clinically significant degree of change in the targeted&#xD;
      behavioral risk outcomes. It is expected that following the program, at least 50% of&#xD;
      participants will show evidence of a clinically significant degree of change in the&#xD;
      behavioral risk outcome targeted by the intervention, when compared to baseline.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are encouraging indications from observational and prospective studies that late life&#xD;
      multidomain lifestyle interventions can reduce the risk of cognitive decline and dementia, as&#xD;
      well as improve cognition. However, these studies raise major issues related to scalability&#xD;
      and adherence which can be addressed by relying on technology. These studies mainly used&#xD;
      intensive and costly face-to-face interventions that are not easily implemented on a large&#xD;
      scale. Furthermore, there are challenges with the adherence to all the components of a&#xD;
      multi-domain lifestyle program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technology-delivered interventions have the potential to overcome some of the limitations of&#xD;
      traditional face-to-face interventions. They confer numerous advantages including scalability&#xD;
      of use in a real-world setting while limiting geographical constraints and other logistical&#xD;
      challenges such as clinic attendance requirements. Such delivery modes also offer user&#xD;
      convenience (e.g., undertaken at home and flexible schedule) and reduced costs associated&#xD;
      with large-scale deployment of studies and programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the inclusion of technology, the success of health promotion interventions may&#xD;
      also be improved by integrating models of lifestyle habit patterns and behaviour change&#xD;
      determinants. The coach-based intervention will integrate behavioural change techniques based&#xD;
      on the Behaviour Change Wheel developed by Michie. The coach intervention approach will also&#xD;
      be guided by the Transtheoretical model of behaviour change principles proposed by Prochaska&#xD;
      and DiClemente, and Motivational Interviewing techniques described by Rollnick and Miller.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Proof-of-Concept study is a 10-week pre-post within-subject parallel group treatment-only&#xD;
      study. There will be three single-domain groups (diet; physical activity or cognitive&#xD;
      engagement), and one multidomain group. Participants will receive up to 9 weekly&#xD;
      coach-assisted counselling sessions. The goal is to recruit up to 55 participants with at&#xD;
      least one of the target risk factors : unhealthy diet, low level of cognitively stimulating&#xD;
      activity or physical activity). Participants with a single risk factor will be invited to the&#xD;
      single-domain condition for which they have a risk. Participants with multiple risk factors&#xD;
      will be invited to the multidomain condition. The risk level for each domain will be examined&#xD;
      before and after the intervention to assess whether the intervention has induced a clinically&#xD;
      significant change.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The Luci intervention is a personalized lifestyle behaviour change program delivered via an interactive mobile platform with the online support of a coach. The system will allow participants to communicate with their coach through video calls and a messaging/chat system. The coaching sessions will focus on providing personalized support to help participants improve their eating habits, cognitive engagement and/or physical activity. The coach will offer assistance, feedback, information where appropriate, and motivational support throughout the trial. The Proof-of-Concept study is a 10-week pre-post within-subject parallel group treatment-only study. There will be three single-domain groups, and one multidomain group. Participants will receive coach-assisted counselling for up to 9 weeks.</intervention_model_description>
