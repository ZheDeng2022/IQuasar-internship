      A Phase 1 Open-label, Non-randomized, Single Ascending Dose Escalation Study To Evaluate The&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics, Safety, And Tolerability Of A Ralinepag Extended Release (XR) Tablet&#xD;
      Formulation In Healthy Chinese Subjects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label, fixed sequence, non-randomized study of healthy&#xD;
      subjects. The study is planned to enroll 15 subjects to ensure data for 8 evaluable subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will visit the clinical unit for a screening visit up to 28 days before dosing.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinical unit prior to investigational medicinal&#xD;
      product (IMP) administration (Day -1) and will remain onsite through the study discharge on&#xD;
      Day 19. Following an overnight fast of at least 8 hours, subjects will receive Regimen A&#xD;
      (single dose of ralinepag 50 mcg) in the morning of Day 1 and pharmacokinetic assessments&#xD;
      will be conducted pre-dose and over the 96 hours post-dose. There will be a washout period of&#xD;
      7 days between each IMP administration. Regimens B and C (single dose of ralinepag 100 mcg&#xD;
      and ralinepag 150 mcg) will be administered following an overnight fast on Day 8 and 15,&#xD;
      respectively, with 96 hours of pharmacokinetic assessments as performed with Regimen A. A&#xD;
      Follow-up phone call will take place 10±1 days post-last dose to ensure the ongoing&#xD;
      well-being of the subjects. Ralinepag (APD811) will be supplied as 50 mcg round, orange, XR&#xD;
      tablets for oral administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned that every subject will receive each of the following regimens in the fasted&#xD;
      state:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regimen A (50 mcg): 1 × 50 mcg ralinepag XR tablet&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regimen B (100 mcg): 2 × 50 mcg ralinepag XR tablets&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regimen C (150 mcg): 3 × 50 mcg ralinepag XR tablets Subjects will receive Regimens A, B&#xD;
           and C in a sequential manner in consecutive treatment periods. Subjects who have&#xD;
           tolerated the IMP in all prior regimens will continue in the study to receive each&#xD;
           subsequent dose.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study is planned to enroll 15 subjects with open-label, fixed sequence, non-randomized to take a single dose of ralinepag at 3 separate dose intervals. Ralinepag will be administered at doses of 50, 100 and 150 mcg single oral each time. Subjects will receive Regimen A (single dose of ralinepag 50 mcg) in the morning of Day 1 and pharmacokinetic assessments will be conducted pre-dose and over the 96 hours post-dose. There will be a washout period of 7 days between each IMP administration. Regimens B and C (single dose of ralinepag 100 mcg and ralinepag 150 mcg) will be administered following an overnight fast on Day 8 and 15, respectively, with 96 hours of pharmacokinetic assessments as performed with Regimen A. A Follow-up phone call will take place 10±1 days post-last dose to ensure the ongoing well-being of the subjects.</intervention_model_description>
