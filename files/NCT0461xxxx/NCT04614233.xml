  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to test if fat intake moderates the ability of Oleoylthanolamide&#xD;
      (OEA) to improve weight loss maintenance after the LEARN® weight loss program.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed work takes a precision medicine approach to obesity treatment and focuses&#xD;
      specifically on weight loss maintenance. We propose to optimize a stratification strategy,&#xD;
      using neural, metabolic and behavioral measures to identify individuals who will maintain&#xD;
      clinically significant weight loss by daily supplementation with the fatty acid amide,&#xD;
      oleoylthanolamide (OEA) following a gold-standard behavioral weight loss program. We will&#xD;
      also test a model underlying the efficacy of our intervention to provide insight for the&#xD;
      further development of therapeutic avenues. Our first aim is to conduct a randomized&#xD;
      double-blind placebo-controlled trial to determine if fat intake moderates the ability of OEA&#xD;
      to improve weight loss maintenance after the (LEARN®) weight loss program. We predict fat&#xD;
      intake will strongly moderate the ability of OEA to produce clinically significant weight&#xD;
      loss and weight loss maintenance 4- and 12-months) after LEARN and that this should not be&#xD;
      influenced by sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our second aim is to test if the Dietary Fat and Sugar intake questionnaire (DFS) is&#xD;
      associated with measures of saturated fat intake and to optimize a clinically useful&#xD;
      stratification strategy. Towards this end we will: (1) perform a neuroimaging study to assess&#xD;
      brain response to a high fat milkshake (2) assess blood-based biomarkers of fat intake and&#xD;
      synthesis; and (3) collect dietary intake records and food frequency questionnaires (FFQs).&#xD;
      We predict that (1) the DFS predicts measures of saturated fat intake (2) that baseline&#xD;
      dorsal striatal (DS) response to milkshake predicts weight loss in the OEA but not the&#xD;
      placebo group and that connectome based predictive modeling (CPM) reveals a &quot;neural&#xD;
      fingerprint&quot; that predicts weight loss on OEA; and (3) LASSO regression will identify&#xD;
      baseline measures that best predict outcome to inform selection of a practical clinical&#xD;
      stratification recommendation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our third aim is to test a model of OEA effectiveness. We predict that weight loss outcome is&#xD;
      associated with shifts in fat preference and intake and these effects are mediated by&#xD;
      increases in DS response to milkshake in the OEA but not placebo group. We will also test&#xD;
      whether HFD is associated with performance on reinforcement and cognitive measures or changes&#xD;
      in energy expenditure or substrate utilization. If so, we will test whether these&#xD;
      associations and their reversal by OEA contribute to outcome mediation.&#xD;
