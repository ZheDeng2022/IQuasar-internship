      Primary objective: To determine whether the addition of intravenous furosemide with usual&#xD;
      antihypertensives is associated with a reduction in mean systolic blood pressure from&#xD;
      baseline compared to treatment with placebo plus usual antihypertensives (intravenous&#xD;
      labetalol, intravenous hydralazine, or oral immediate release nifedipine) for the management&#xD;
      of severe antepartum hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether the addition of intravenous furosemide with usual antihypertensives is&#xD;
      associated with a reduction in mean diastolic blood pressure compared to treatment with&#xD;
      placebo plus usual antihypertensives listed above.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood pressure is a measure of blood flow and resistance in blood vessels. In normal&#xD;
      pregnancy, total blood volume increases while systemic vascular resistance decreases, thereby&#xD;
      leading to an overall reduction in blood pressure with return to baseline at term.&#xD;
      Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, including preeclampsia, are a polymorphic syndrome&#xD;
      characterized by elevated blood pressures which can affect multiple organ systems. Although&#xD;
      the exact mechanism of preeclampsia has yet to be determined, previous studies have shown&#xD;
      that there may be two distinct phenotypes - one characterized by vasoconstriction and&#xD;
      diminished micro-circulation and the other involving a hyperdynamic high cardiac output&#xD;
      state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given its potential for both significant maternal and fetal morbidity, hypertensive disorders&#xD;
      in pregnancy comprise a substantial proportion of antepartum admissions. Management of acute&#xD;
      severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 or diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure greater than or equal to 110) is important to reduce the risk of stroke,&#xD;
      hypertensive encephalopathy, placental abruption, and heart failure or myocardial infarction.&#xD;
      In the antepartum and intrapartum period, the use of antihypertensives including labetalol,&#xD;
      nifedipine, and hydralazine have been well-described. Despite these options for blood&#xD;
      pressure control, preeclampsia can be a progressive disorder that may not respond to the&#xD;
      aforementioned agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preeclampsia manifested by high blood volume due to salt and water retention rather than&#xD;
      vasoconstriction, standard antihypertensives may be less effective. Furosemide is a commonly&#xD;
      used diuretic that can lower blood pressure by inhibiting the absorption of sodium, chloride,&#xD;
      and water, thereby decreasing the volume of blood that the heart pumps. The onset of action&#xD;
      of action of IV furosemide is 5 minutes, with peak effect at 30 minutes, and duration of&#xD;
      action of 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of furosemide to treat&#xD;
      preeclampsia in the antepartum and postpartum period as well as its utility in treating heart&#xD;
      failure in pregnant women. To our knowledge, no randomized studies exist that investigate the&#xD;
      use of furosemide in treating hypertension in the antepartum period. We aim to determine the&#xD;
      utility of the addition of furosemide to usual antihypertensives in this clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective double-blinded randomized placebo control trial of women with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of preeclampsia with severe features at ≥20 weeks of gestation with persistent&#xD;
      antepartum hypertension (sustained systolic blood pressure ≥160 or diastolic blood pressure&#xD;
      ≥110 mmHg) and a wide pulse pressure (&gt;60 mmHg) who meet all inclusion criteria and have no&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. It is routine that laboratory studies are performed on admission for all&#xD;
      women with hypertensive disorders. If electrolyte disturbances exist, therapy will not be&#xD;
      initiated unless the electrolyte is normalized or repleted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent and upon meeting inclusion criteria with severe range hypertension&#xD;
      with wide pulse pressure, the study personnel will inform pharmacy personnel who will then&#xD;
      randomly assigned the patient to groups by opening the next previously prepared sequential&#xD;
      and numbered opaque study envelope. Participants will be randomized to furosemide plus an&#xD;
      antihypertensive versus placebo containing normal saline and an antihypertensive. The&#xD;
      pharmacy staff will send the assigned treatment, which will be administered by the bedside&#xD;
      nurse. The vials containing the treatment will be indistinguishable as both furosemide and&#xD;
      normal saline placebo are clear, colorless solutions. Thus, the provider, nurse, and patient&#xD;
      will be blinded to the treatment. The choice of antihypertensive will be determined by the&#xD;
      primary obstetric provider. At our institution, this will be one or more of the recommended&#xD;
      medications for urgent blood pressure control as outlined by the American College of&#xD;
      Obstetricians and Gynecologists Practice Bulletin on gestational hypertension and&#xD;
      preeclampsia. These include IV labetalol, IV hydralazine, or immediate-release oral&#xD;
      nifedipine. As meta-analyses have not shown that one of the aforementioned antihypertensives&#xD;
      is superior than another, and all are reasonable options, the choice of antihypertensive will&#xD;
      be left up to the obstetric provider. This will also improve the generalizability of the&#xD;
      study as it does not interfere with what is typically done in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a procedure of the study, patients will have their blood pressure recorded at least every&#xD;
      15 minutes up to one hour after administration of the study drug. Thereafter, as part of&#xD;
      routine care, patients in both groups will receive similar antepartum surveillance, including&#xD;
      blood pressure and pulse assessment every four hours or more frequently if vital signs are&#xD;
      abnormal, daily weight measurement, and daily urinary output measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Antepartum patient diagnosed with a hypertensive disorder in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient approached for study participation and informed consent obtained if interested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient develops severe range BP (systolic blood pressure &gt; or = 160 and/or diastolic&#xD;
           blood pressure&gt; or =10) with increased pulse pressure (&gt;60mmHg). This will be considered&#xD;
           baseline BP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. When ordering provider's choice of antihypertensive, pharmacy notified that patient is&#xD;
           study participant and randomizes patient by choosing from sequential opaque envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. a. Patient randomized to treatment arm and receives 40mg /4 milliliters IV furosemide in&#xD;
           addition to usual antihypertensive.&#xD;
&#xD;
           b. Patient randomized to placebo and receives 4 milliliters normal saline in addition to&#xD;
           usual antihypertensive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Blood pressure check every 15 minutes after administration of furosemide/placebo for&#xD;
           four recordings (15, 30, 45, 60 minutes)&#xD;
