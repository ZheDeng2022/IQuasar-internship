    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, multicenter phase II trial for 60 patients with untreated extensive&#xD;
      stage (ES) small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with asymptomatic brain metastases. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive 4 cycles of induction treatment with Atezolizumab (1200 mg on Day 1) combined with&#xD;
      carboplatin (5-6 AUC on Day 1) and etoposide (80-100 mg/m2 on Days 1-3). Each cycle equals 21&#xD;
      days. After 4 cycles of induction treatment, subjects will receive atezolizumab maintenance&#xD;
      1200 mg on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle. Subjects will receive treatment until disease&#xD;
      progression, unacceptable drug-related toxicity, or withdrawal from study for any reason.&#xD;
