      -[18F]Fluoro-L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-FDOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) is a&#xD;
      imaging marker for presynaptic dopaminergic neuronal function. The decreased uptake of&#xD;
      18F-FDOPA in the posterior putamen is demonstrated in the early course of PD, and could&#xD;
      differentiate early PD from healthy controls. The objective of this study is to investigate&#xD;
      the evidence of presynaptic dopaminergic neuronal dysfunction in the preclinical stage of PD,&#xD;
      which may be associated with HCV infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second-most neurodegenerative disease in Taiwan. It is&#xD;
      characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars&#xD;
      compacta (SNpc). The estimated incidence of PD ranging from 10-18 per 100,000 person-years&#xD;
      with a tread of increasing number over past decades. Although the exact mechanisms of PD have&#xD;
      not yet fully clear, many pathological process have shown to be involved in the pathogenesis&#xD;
      like abnormal alpha-synuclein, activation of microglia and astrocyte, mitochondrial&#xD;
      dysfunction, oxidative stress, and so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several characteristics have been considered to increase the risk of having PD. Epidemiologic&#xD;
      studies have suggested that patients with HCV infection might have higher risk of PD. It is&#xD;
      common that patients with chronic HCV infection manifest with central nervous system&#xD;
      manifestations, such as depression, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction. A previous&#xD;
      epidemiologic study in Taiwan with a total of 62,276 subjects showed that there is&#xD;
      significant correlation between PD and hepatitic C virus (HCV) infection. In the study, the&#xD;
      crude odds ratio for having PD was 1.94 for HCV patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCV is positive-stranded RNA virus of Flaviviridae family. Flaviviridae family has many&#xD;
      viruses demonstrating neurotropic character and may be associated with encephalopathy.&#xD;
      Decreased monoamine transporter binding activity had also been found in HCV infected patients&#xD;
      who had symptoms of chronic fatigue and cognitive impairment. HCV can cross blood-brain&#xD;
      barrier and has the ability to replicate in the central nervous system. Animal study has&#xD;
      shown that HCV infection may up-regulate the inflammatory cytokines, such as sICAM-1, LIX,&#xD;
      and RANTES, in the rat midbrain neuron-glia coculture and induced dopaminergic neuronal&#xD;
      toxicity. The elevation of choline/creatine ratio on proton magnetic-resonance spectroscopy&#xD;
      is also indicative of inflammatory status of brain in patients with chronic HCV infection. it&#xD;
      is possible that the direct infection of HCV into the brain induce inflammatory status by&#xD;
      microglia/macrophages and contribute to subsequent neurodegeneration. Chronic HCV infection&#xD;
      is also associated with systemic cytokine activation including interferon-α and tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor α, which may also affect the neuronal function. It has been reported that the&#xD;
      viral eradication on the patients infected by HCV had change of neurocognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6-[18F]Fluoro-L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-FDOPA) is an analog of&#xD;
      L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), which is the precursor of dopamine. L-DOPA is carried into&#xD;
      the brain through neutral amino acid transport system and converted to domapine by aromatic&#xD;
      L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) in dopaminergic neurons. Use 18F-FDOPA as a tracer of&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, the dopamine synthesis rate and presynaptic&#xD;
      dopaminergic neuronal function can be reflected by the uptake of 18F-FDOPA in dopaminergic&#xD;
      neurons. The decline of 18F-FDOPA is indicative of dopaminergic neurons dysfunction and can&#xD;
      be used as imaging marker of the severity of PD. The posterior putamen receives the&#xD;
      dopaminergic projections from the ventrolateral part of the substantia nigra and is affected&#xD;
      earliest in the disease course of PD. 18F-FDOPA has been shown its capacity in&#xD;
      differentiating early PD and healthy controls in previous study with lower metabolism in the&#xD;
      dorsal putamen even in the early course of PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, 18F-FDOPA PET is used as an imaging marker of striatal dopaminergic&#xD;
      dysfunction in patients with HCV infection. We will try to detect the subclinical and&#xD;
      preclinical stages of parkinsonism for these patients.&#xD;
