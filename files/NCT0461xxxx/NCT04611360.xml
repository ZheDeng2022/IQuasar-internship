  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is characterised as sudden onset of neurological dysfunction of central anxious&#xD;
      framework that contain cerebral infarction, intra cranial haemorrhage &amp; subarachnoid&#xD;
      haemorrhage. Around the globe stroke is the chief cause of incapacity and passing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trans-cranial direct current stimulations (tDCS) could be a non-invasive,low cost and&#xD;
      capable brain stimulator utilised within the treatment of brain disorders.Two modes of tDCS&#xD;
      is utilised is stroke patients,anodal stimulation (increased in excitability) of the lesional&#xD;
      half of the globe and cathodal stimulation (decreased in excitability) of the contralesional&#xD;
      hemisphere. The transcranial direct current stimulation induced polarity-dependent changes in&#xD;
      membrane excitability, with Anodal-tDCS causing depolarisation and cathodal-tDCS causing&#xD;
      hyper polarization of membrane potential in neurons of the stimulated area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of Trans-cranial Direct Current Stimulation as a catalyst of recovery in stroke&#xD;
      population and found that it's a safe,portable,non invasive brain stimulation technique.&#xD;
      T-DCS is able to modulate the excitability of specified brain areas by varying the neuronal&#xD;
      membrane potentials that based on the polarity of the current transmitted through the scalp&#xD;
      via sponge electrodes. Trans-cranial direct current stimulation is clinically potential for&#xD;
      use in stroke recovery because of its ease of use, non invasive-ness and safety.&#xD;

    <measure>Modified Rankin Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 week</time_frame>
    <description>It is commonly used for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other neurological disorders.The scale runs from 0-6,running from perfect no symptoms to death.The inter rater reliability of Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) for stroke is (0.95)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dynamic Gait Index</measure>
    <time_frame>6 week</time_frame>
    <description>Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) was to evaluate functional stability in older people and to evaluate their risk of falling.Its a 4 point ordinal scale,ranging from 0-3, &quot;0&quot; indicates the lowest level of function and &quot;3&quot; indicates the highest level of function.The inter rater reliability of DGI for stroke is (0.96)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>10 Meter Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 week</time_frame>
    <description>It is to be used for gait speed assesment.According this,individual walk without assistance 10 meters and the time is measured for the intermediate 6 meters. The reliability of 10 meter walk test is (0.97)</description>

    <measure>Fugl Meyer function test:</measure>
    <time_frame>6 week</time_frame>
    <description>Fugl Meyer Function (FMA) is used to assess voluntary movements,reflex activity,grasping and co-ordination of affected limb in stroke.It contain 33 task with a scale of 0-2 with maximum scoring of 66.The reliability of FMA scale is (0.95-1)</description>
