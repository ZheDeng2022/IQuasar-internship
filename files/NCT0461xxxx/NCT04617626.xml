      The aim of the study is to gather preliminary evidence on the operational feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of integrating bi-annual mass drug administration (MDA) of single-dose&#xD;
      azithromycin for children ages 1 to 11 months in high child mortality settings in Côte. The&#xD;
      cross-sectional study will be carried out in conjunction with a single trachoma MDA in&#xD;
      selected villages within one health district. Data on feasibility and acceptability will be&#xD;
      collected through three main activities:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Analyses of existing routine monitoring, process, and adverse drug reaction data from&#xD;
           the trachoma MDA platform into which the pilot activities are being integrated&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A cross-sectional, post-MDA coverage survey&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Qualitative data collection among targeting parents or primary caregivers of children&#xD;
           ages 1 to 11 months in the pilot districts, and district-level MDA implementers,&#xD;
           regarding the proposed azithromycin program.&#xD;

      Purpose: The aim of the study is to gather preliminary evidence on the operational&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of integrating bi-annual mass drug administration (MDA) of&#xD;
      single-dose azithromycin for children ages 1 to 11 months in high child mortality settings in&#xD;
      Côte d'Ivoire into the existing trachoma MDA platform to inform large scale implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The cross-sectional study will be carried out in conjunction with a single trachoma&#xD;
      MDA in selected villages within one health district. Data on feasibility and acceptability&#xD;
      will be collected through three main activities:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Analyses of existing routine monitoring, process, and adverse drug reaction data from&#xD;
           the trachoma MDA platform into which the pilot activities are being integrated&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A cross-sectional, post-MDA coverage survey&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Qualitative data collection among targeting parents or primary caregivers of children&#xD;
           ages 1 to 11 months in the pilot districts, and district-level MDA implementers,&#xD;
           regarding the proposed azithromycin program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: For expanded use of azithromycin: Infants ages 1 to 5 months who reside in one&#xD;
      pilot district in high under-5 years child mortality regions in Côte d'Ivoire (approximately&#xD;
      2,800 to be enrolled).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-MDA coverage survey and interviews for acceptability: Parents/primary caregivers of&#xD;
      infants aged 1 to 11 months who reside in the two pilot districts will be targeted for the&#xD;
      post-MDA coverage survey and in-depth interviews (n=up to 24) to explore acceptability&#xD;
      (approximately 275 to be enrolled).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility and acceptability from implementers' perspectives: Focus group discussions will&#xD;
      target community-based drug distributors (CDDs) and in-depth interviews will target CDD&#xD;
      supervisors, both to explore operational feasibility. (A maximum of 48 CDDs and 12 CDD&#xD;
      supervisors approximately) Pilot Site : Boundiali Health District in Bagoué Region, among the&#xD;
      high under-5 child mortality regions in Côte d'Ivoire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration: Planning - 6 months; Training and implementation of the pilot intervention - 3&#xD;
      weeks; Post-MDA research - 1 month; Data analysis and reporting - 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The study is designed to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examine the extent to which activities are carried out as planned (fidelity) during the&#xD;
           pilot implementation and the factors that affect the processes and results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Estimate coverage of the intervention's target population (1 to 11 month-olds) with&#xD;
           azithromycin in pilot districts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the level of understanding and acceptability of the strategy among those involved&#xD;
           in implementation and among the parents/primary caregivers of children targeted by the&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Document challenges to implementation and costs of the pilot activity to make&#xD;
           recommendations for scale-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints: A final pilot activity report summarizing findings including recommended&#xD;
      approaches for scale-up, will be developed after results are shared with the REACH technical&#xD;
      working group to inform guidance on scale-up.&#xD;
