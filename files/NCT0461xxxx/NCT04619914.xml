  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present randomized double blind study has been carried out in Gynecology and Obstetrics&#xD;
      Department, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig university on 70 women were previously received&#xD;
      clomiphene citrate alone as management of infertile anovulatory PCOS women, but giving&#xD;
      improper endometrial thickness &lt; 7mm during the period from March 2019 to September 2019&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in infertile women.&#xD;
      Infertility affects 40% of women with PCOS. Understanding the main causes of infertility and&#xD;
      selecting an appropriate treatment plan is a diagnostic and therapeutic priority The aim of&#xD;
      this work was to compare the effect of Clomiphene citrate plus Estradiol Valerate versus&#xD;
      Letrozole on endometrial thickness and pregnancy rate in infertile PCOS women underwent&#xD;
      ovulation induction&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was designed as a randomized double blind study using a computer-generated&#xD;
      randomization list and sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes, each containing the&#xD;
      allocation information written on a card. Envelopes were opened sequentially by a study nurse&#xD;
      to allocate patients to the assigned group. These patients were divided into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group A (clomiphene citrate &amp; estradiol group): included 35 anovulatory PCO patients who&#xD;
           received clomiphene citrate (Clomid; Aventis pharma S.AE, Global Napi pharmaceuticals,&#xD;
           Cairo, Egypt) 100 mg daily from cycle day 3 to 7 with estradiol valerate 4-mg (two white&#xD;
           tablets of cyclopregynova) from cycle day 8 to 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group B (Letrozole group): included 35 anovulatory PCO patients who received letrozole&#xD;
           (Femara; Novartis pharma AG, Basle, Switzerland) 5 mg daily from cycle day 3 to day 7.&#xD;
