  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease, and especially myocardial infarction, is the most common cause of&#xD;
      death globally, and is particularly common in older individuals. Practical measures that can&#xD;
      reduce both the prevalence and incidence of cardiovascular disease are of great value. It is&#xD;
      well known that regular physical activity has a protective effect against the development of&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases such as acute myocardial infarction. It has been shown that physical&#xD;
      activity can improve the function of the heart and blood vessels, but it is less well known&#xD;
      how physical activity can affect the risk of formation of dangerous blood clots, and thus the&#xD;
      risk of heart attack and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a cross-sectional study it has been shown that a physically active lifestyle can reduce&#xD;
      the risk of blood clot formation, but experimental evidence for the importance of a period of&#xD;
      physical activity for the risk of blood clot formation is lacking. New methods have been set&#xD;
      up for measuring the coagulation profile. The analyzes are performed on a blood sample and&#xD;
      allow a thorough determination of platelet reactivity as well as an innovative measure of how&#xD;
      the microstructure of a possible blood clot would develop. In this project, these methods is&#xD;
      used to examine how physical activity, in the form of team sports, affects the coagulation&#xD;
      profile of elderly men and women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increasing age-related risk of cardiovascular disease is associated with endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction and decrease in capillary density, and it has been shown that initiation of&#xD;
      capillary growth is a successful method to treat cardiovascular disease. Therefore, this&#xD;
      project will also investigate how a longer period of physical activity, in the form of team&#xD;
      sports, affects capillary density and endothelial function in men and women aged 60-70 years.&#xD;
      Both men and women will be recruited, as it is still unknown whether men and women respond&#xD;
      differently to physical activity in relation to coagulation profile, susceptibility to blood&#xD;
      clots and capillary density.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Part of the novelty of this present study consist of 1) linking the clinical measurements&#xD;
      with data on sickness absence, disease development, etc. and with data on the underlying&#xD;
      mechanisms, 2) examining the short-term effect (16 weeks) and the long-term effect (up to 2&#xD;
      years) of physical activity, in the form of team sports in a municipality setting, on&#xD;
      coagulation, risk of blood clots, capillarization and endothelial function in general in the&#xD;
      elderly, as well as 3) investigate whether there is a difference in the aforementioned&#xD;
      measurements in men and women.&#xD;
