  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with a severe mental illness (SMI) have an increased risk for premature mortality,&#xD;
      predominantly due somatic health conditions. Evidence indicates that prevention and improved&#xD;
      treatment of somatic conditions in patients with SMI could reduce this excess mortality. This&#xD;
      paper reports a protocol designed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a&#xD;
      coordinated co-produced care programme (SOFIA model) in the general practice setting to&#xD;
      reduce mortality and improve quality of life in patients with severe mental illness. The&#xD;
      primary outcomes are description of study feasibility (recruitment and retention) and&#xD;
      acceptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SOFIA trial is designed as cluster randomized controlled trial targeting general&#xD;
      practices in two regions in Denmark. 12 practices will each recruit 15 community-dwelling&#xD;
      patients aged 18 and older with severe mental illness (SMI). Practices will be randomized in&#xD;
      a ratio 2:1 to deliver a coordinated care program or care-as-usual during a 6 month period.&#xD;
      An online randomized algorithm is used to perform randomization. The coordinated care program&#xD;
      comprises enhanced educational training of general practitioners and their clinical staff,&#xD;
      and prolonged consultations focusing on individual needs and preferences of the patient with&#xD;
      SMI. Assessments are administered at baseline, and at end of study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If delivery of the intervention in the general practice setting proves feasible, a future&#xD;
      definitive trial to determine the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing mortality and&#xD;
      improving quality of life in patients with SMI can take place.&#xD;
