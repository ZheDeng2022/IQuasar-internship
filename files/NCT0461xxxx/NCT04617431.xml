      Aim: By application of wearable devices and health management platform to build&#xD;
      self-management model in CKD patients and analyze the cost of healthcare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods: The investigators plan to recruit 60 CKD patients as trial subjects.&#xD;
      The intervention group is composed of 30 participants, and the control group 30 participants.&#xD;
      The intervention group received intervention with wearable devices and health management&#xD;
      platform for 90 days. Patients record diet diary by a smartphone application, and their&#xD;
      exercise-related data are collected by wearable devices. Then, all the collected information&#xD;
      will be upload to health management platform. The investigators also create a LINE group to&#xD;
      encourage exercise in the experimental group. The investigators compare the scores of&#xD;
      self-management sheet and physical and laboratory examinations before and after the&#xD;
      intervention. The investigators also analyze the cost of healthcare within 180 days.&#xD;

      Background: End stage renal disease (ESRD) is a global public health issue. The dialysis&#xD;
      therapy brings huge economic burden to many countries. According to the report of 2015 United&#xD;
      States Renal Data System (USRDS), the incidence rate of ESRD is 458 people per million&#xD;
      populations. And the prevalence rate is 3,138 people per million populations, which is the&#xD;
      highest one in the world. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) can be classified into five stages&#xD;
      according to glomerular filtration rate. Whatever the stage it is, patients should keep&#xD;
      healthy habits about diet and exercise and good adherence to medication. If patients are able&#xD;
      to monitor their lifestyle, it not only promotes health, but also reduces the cost of health&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: By application of wearable devices and health management platform to build&#xD;
      self-management model in CKD patients and analyze the cost of healthcare.&#xD;

      Material and Methods: The investigators plan to recruit 60 CKD patients as trial subjects.&#xD;

      The intervention group received intervention with wearable devices and health management&#xD;
      platform for 90 days. Patients record their own diet diary by a smartphone application, and&#xD;
      their exercise-related data are collected by wearable devices. Then, all the collected&#xD;
      information will be upload to health management platform. The investigators also create a&#xD;

    <description>The intervention involved reminding the intervention group to upload their dietary diary every day. The researchers were trained by a dietitian and provided suggestions about diet and exercise to the intervention group. &quot;LINE &quot; is a mobile app operated by LINE Corporation. All users can use texts, images, video, and audio for contact at any time. A LINE group was created to deliver medical knowledge of diet and exercise. Each of the messages were guided by a diet manual for kidney disease (edited by Department of Dietetics, National Taiwan University Hospital Yunlin Branch). The intervention group also asked questions about CKD management, and a teleconsultation of health information was provided. A daily target of 7,500 steps was set and used to emphasize the correct concepts about exercise. Participants were inspired in the intervention group if someone achieved the target number of steps.</description>
