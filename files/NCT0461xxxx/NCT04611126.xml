  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of many cancers, ovarian cancer&#xD;
      patients have not yet benefitted from the advances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In two consecutive pilot trials at National Center for Cancer Immune Therapy (CCIT-DK), is&#xD;
      has been have shown that adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with TILs for patients with advanced&#xD;
      ovarian cancer (OC) is feasible and tolerable. In the most recent of these trials ACT was&#xD;
      combined with a CTLA-4 inhibitor, Ipilimumab and a PD1-inhibitor, Nivolumab. Only transient&#xD;
      clinical responses where observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 90-100 % of infused T-cells in our previous ovarian cancer ACT trial expressed LAG-3.&#xD;
      The interaction between LAG-3 on T-cells and MHC-II on tumor cells inhibits T-cell function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study adding the LAG-3 antibody Relatlimab to the ACT-regimen described above may&#xD;
      therefore well unleash T-cell antitumor efficacy by blocking the known LAG-3-MHC-II&#xD;
      interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this study the aim is to demonstrate that adding the lag-3-inhibitor Relatlimab to the&#xD;
      above treatment regimen is feasible and tolerable. The study will elucidate whether the&#xD;
      combination Relatlimab-Nivolumab leads to objective responses and improves progression free&#xD;
      survival (PFS).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale T-cell therapy is an experimental personalized immunotherapy where TILs are&#xD;
      isolated from the patient's own tumor tissue, expanded in vitro to billions of cells and then&#xD;
      administered to the individual patient with the purpose of eliminating the remaining cancer&#xD;
      cells. Lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine phosphate is&#xD;
      administered to the patient before TIL infusion to reduce the number of irrelevant immune&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In two consecutive pilot trials at National Center for Cancer Immune Therapy (CCIT-DK), it&#xD;
      has been shown that adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with TILs for patients with advanced ovarian&#xD;
      cancer (OC) is feasible and tolerable. In the most recent of these trials ACT was combined&#xD;
      with a CTLA-4 inhibitor, Ipilimumab and a PD1-inhibitor, Nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 90-100% of infused T-cells in these previous ovarian cancer ACT trial expressed&#xD;
      LAG-3. The interaction between LAG-3 on T-cells and MHC-II on tumor cells inhibits T-cell&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this phase I/II study 18 patients with advanced ovarian -, fallopian tube-, and primary&#xD;
      peritoneal cancer will be included. Included patients undergo surgical removal of tumor&#xD;
      tissue for tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) manufacturing. Lymphodepleting chemotherapy is&#xD;
      administered prior to TIL infusion. Hereafter the patients are treated with the programmed&#xD;
      cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody Nivolumab and the anti-lymphocyte activation gene 3&#xD;
      (anti-LAG-3) antibody Relatlimab. The study will be devided into 3 steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Step One (6 subjects): Patients are treated without prior administration of cytotoxic&#xD;
           T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) antibody Ipilimumab pre-tumor harvest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Step Two (6 subjects): If Step One proves feasible and tolerable patients in Step Two&#xD;
           will receive one dose of Ipilimumab pre-tumor harvest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Step Three (6 subjects): Patients are treated either with or without prior Ipilimumab&#xD;
           pre-tumor harvest depending on the tolerability data from Step Two.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are treated with lymphodepleting chemotherapy for 7 days followed by infusion of&#xD;
      TILs. For safety reasons no IL-2- will be administered in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to demonstrate that ACT and a combination of Relatlimab-Nivolumab&#xD;
      does not increase the toxicity compared to the same treatment regimen including Nivolumab&#xD;
      monotherapy. The study will elucidate whether the combination Relatlimab-Nivolumab lead to&#xD;
      objective responses and improves progression free survival (PFS). It is anticipated that&#xD;
      combining Relatlimab and Nivolumab with Adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) for advanced OC is safe&#xD;
      and feasible. Further, it is hypothesized that the combination will lead to improved immunity&#xD;
      in tumor and blood as well as improved antitumor efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the tolerability and safety of the treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize antitumor immune responses and clinical efficacy&#xD;
