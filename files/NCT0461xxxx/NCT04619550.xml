  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the relationship between pain, gait and activity intensity in&#xD;
      HTO patients that are healed and have had their fixation plate removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria are: unilateral HTO with no concurrent procedure performed, fixation plate&#xD;
      has since been removed, no subsequent operations performed on the lower limbs (hips to feet).&#xD;
      Control participants will be recruited through local advertisements in and around the&#xD;
      University of Winchester. Inclusion criteria for the control subjects are: no current pain in&#xD;
      the lower limbs, no previous surgery on the lower limbs. Control subjects will also be&#xD;
      age-matched to the HTO group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knee function and pain scores will first be assessed through the implementation of a Knee&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, a Visual Analogue Scale, and a further pain intensity scale.&#xD;
      Once this has been done, resting heart rate (HR) and body mass index (BMI) will also be&#xD;
      measured as part of the completion of a Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q). A&#xD;
      G-Walk gait analysis sensor, which has been validated for use in clinical settings, will then&#xD;
      be attached to participants in order to measure spatiotemporal gait parameters during&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will then conduct a series of four walking and four jogging test protocols,&#xD;
      each lasting three minutes, on a flat treadmill. The intensity at which the participant must&#xD;
      walk or jog during each test will be self-regulated and determined by a rating of perceived&#xD;
      exertion (RPE) of 9, 11, 13 or 15 on a 6-20 Borg scale. All participants will be verbally&#xD;
      anchored to the Borg scale before conducting the first walk/jog test. The order in which the&#xD;
      tests are performed will be randomised in advance of each test session. Half way through each&#xD;
      test (90 seconds), participants will be presented with a VAS and pain intensity scale to&#xD;
      indicate the current level of pain they are experiencing in their knee. At this stage, they&#xD;
      will also be asked to confirm that they are still maintaining the target RPE of that&#xD;
      particular test. Once a test is finished, participants will complete another VAS and pain&#xD;
      intensity scale and rest in a seated position until their heart rate returns to their&#xD;
      pre-determined resting level before the next test commences. The leg for which healthy&#xD;
      controls report pain levels will be chosen randomly prior to the test session.&#xD;
