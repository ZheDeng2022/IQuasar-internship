  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      African Americans with coronary artery disease who have been prescribed clopidogrel (also&#xD;
      known as Plavix), an antiplatelet drug will be enrolled. The purpose of this study is to help&#xD;
      identify why African Americans are at an increased risk of having a major heart attack or&#xD;
      stroke after a common procedure to open up blocked arteries with stents. The knowledge to be&#xD;
      gained from this study includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A better understanding of the metabolism of the antiplatelet drug, clopidogrel, and&#xD;
           abnormal platelet function in African Americans; this understanding may provide a basis&#xD;
           for potential future therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A better understanding of challenges to taking clopidogrel as prescribed by a doctor and&#xD;
           opinions about a genetic test related to this medicine.&#xD;
