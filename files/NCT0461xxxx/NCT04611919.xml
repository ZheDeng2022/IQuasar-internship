  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the beginning of the 2000s, there has been a steady increase in the incidence of STIs&#xD;
      in France. In Reunion, the few figures available seem to show the same phenomenon, especially&#xD;
      for syphilis. The unfavorable socio-economic context, which is characterized by high levels&#xD;
      of precariousness, significant population exchanges (immigration, travel) with neighboring&#xD;
      countries, behaviors around sexuality or screening for STIs different from those observed in&#xD;
      mainland France are all factors testify to the singularity of the Reunion island in relation&#xD;
      to the metropolitan France with regard to the risk factors of STIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STI management has become a priority in public health; in particular, the 2010-2014 HIV and&#xD;
      STI control plan emphasized the need for their surveillance and screening. These are often&#xD;
      asymptomatic infections that can cause serious complications if they are not treated&#xD;
      (infertility, ectopic pregnancies, maternal-fetal infections, ...). Screening them in at-risk&#xD;
      populations is therefore essential to reduce their prevalence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prison population is a vulnerable population, possibly exposed during the incarceration&#xD;
      but also upstream of it (generally low levels of education, over-represented disadvantaged&#xD;
      social categories, low access and use of care, high prevalence of risky behaviors). ). Some&#xD;
      prevalence studies of STIs in these populations have been carried out in metropolitan France,&#xD;
      indicating a prevalence higher than that observed in the general population. There is little&#xD;
      data on the subject for the prison population in Réunion; Given the local specificities, it&#xD;
      seems necessary to improve the epidemiological knowledge of STIs in this prison population in&#xD;
      Réunion, in order to be able to adapt the prevention and care measures, the conditions of&#xD;
      detention presenting potentially aggravating situations (promiscuity, confinement). ,&#xD;
      hygienic conditions, ...).&#xD;
