  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PrismaLung+ is indicated to provide extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R) as a&#xD;
      stand-alone therapy or in combination with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). This&#xD;
      study is intended for patients with increased levels of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) in their blood&#xD;
      and ≥ 18 years old, and will treat patients with mild or moderate acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome (ARDS) using PrismaLung+. The study will assess tidal volume reduction and confirm&#xD;
      the safety of PrismaLung+.&#xD;

    <description>The planned PrismaLung+ treatment period for this study is 24 hours. Neuromuscular blockade and sedation will be required for the first 24 hours of ECCO2R treatment and thereafter, will be used at the discretion of the attending physician. Patients will require systemic anticoagulation with heparin during ECCO2R treatment. Blood warming during ECCO2R treatment will occur using the TherMax blood warmer.</description>

    <description>Overall, 50 adult patients will be initiated on ECCO2R using PrismaLung+. A minimum of approximately 15 patients will be treated with ECCO2R using PrismaLung+ as stand-alone therapy and another minimum of approximately 15 patients (maximum of 20) will receive ECCO2R using PrismaLung+ in combination with CRRT.</description>
