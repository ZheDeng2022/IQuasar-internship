    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial aims to examine the efficacy of two integrative&#xD;
      body-mind-spirit interventions, compared to a health education active control, in promoting&#xD;
      adaptive emotional regulation and quality of life of children with eczema and their parent&#xD;
      caregivers in Hong Kong. It also aims to examine the interdependent associations between&#xD;
      children and their parent caregivers' baseline primary outcomes and the post-intervention&#xD;
      changes in primary outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Childhood eczema is a significant pediatric health crisis in Hong Kong. It not only has&#xD;
      adverse psychosocial impacts on children, but also poses tremendous burden for their parent&#xD;
      caregivers. The interdependence of family members calls for a systemic family-based&#xD;
      psychosocial intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An integrative body-mind-spirit (I-BMS) intervention for families with children suffering&#xD;
      from eczema has been developed, and its initial results are promising. Compared to the&#xD;
      waitlist control group, parent caregivers in the I-BSM intervention group reported&#xD;
      significantly more improvements in perceived stress, depression and well-being. Likewise,&#xD;
      children in the I-BSM intervention group reported significantly more improvements in somatic&#xD;
      eczema severity, generalized anxiety, social phobia and emotional regulation. It is not&#xD;
      clear, however, if the I-BMS intervention delivered only to the parent caregivers would be:&#xD;
      (1) as efficacious as the I-BMS intervention delivered to both the parent caregivers and&#xD;
      children, and (2) more efficacious than the health education delivered only to the parent&#xD;
      caregivers, in improving their emotional regulation and quality of life. This three-arm&#xD;
      parallel randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to examine the efficacy of two I-BMS&#xD;
      interventions (one delivered to both parents and children, one delivered to parents only),&#xD;
      compared to a health education active control (delivered to parents only), in promoting&#xD;
      adaptive emotional regulation and quality of life of children with eczema and their parent&#xD;
      caregivers. This RCT also aims to examine the interdependent associations between children&#xD;
      and their parent caregivers' baseline primary outcomes and the post-intervention changes in&#xD;
      primary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred and ninety-two parent-child dyads will be recruited through hospitals and&#xD;
      non-governmental organizations in various districts in Hong Kong. Each dyad will complete an&#xD;
      individual pre-group screening interview. Those who meet the eligibility criteria will be&#xD;
      randomized in a ratio of 1:1:1 into one of the three arms, hence, each arm will have 64&#xD;
      parent-child dyads. Arm 1 is I-BMS intervention delivered to both children and their parent&#xD;
      caregivers. Arm 2 is I-BMS intervention delivered to parent caregivers only. Arm 3 is health&#xD;
      education delivered to parent caregivers only. Each arm consists of six weekly three-hour&#xD;
      sessions. A computer-generated list of random numbers will be used to perform randomization.&#xD;
      The primary outcomes are changes over the measurement points in quality of life and emotional&#xD;
      regulation. The secondary outcomes include changes over the measurement points in depression,&#xD;
      anxiety, stress, parent-child relationship, holistic well-being, caregiver burden, and&#xD;
      perceived eczema severity. Assessments will be administered at baseline, post-intervention,&#xD;
      and 6-week follow up. Important adverse events, if any, will be documented. Mixed factorial&#xD;
      ANCOVAs based on intention-to-treat principle will be conducted to examine the efficacy of&#xD;
      the two I-BMS interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven hypotheses are generated. First, it is hypothesized that, after the intervention,&#xD;
      participants in the two I-BMS intervention groups will report significantly more improvements&#xD;
      in emotional regulation and quality of life than those in the health education active control&#xD;
      group. Second, it is hypothesized that there is no significant difference between the two&#xD;
      I-BMS intervention groups in terms of post-intervention improvements in emotional regulation&#xD;
      and quality of life. Third, it is hypothesized that the post-intervention improvements in&#xD;
      emotional regulation and quality of life will be maintained at 6-week follow-up for the two&#xD;
      I-BMS intervention groups, but not for the health education active control group. Fourth, it&#xD;
      is hypothesized that children's baseline quality of life is predicted by their own baseline&#xD;
      emotional regulation and by their parents' baseline quality of life. Fifth, it is&#xD;
      hypothesized that parents' baseline quality of life is predicted by their own baseline&#xD;
      emotional regulation and by their children's baseline quality of life. Sixth, it is&#xD;
      hypothesized that children's post-intervention improvements in quality of life are predicted&#xD;
      by their own post-intervention improvements in emotional regulation and their parents'&#xD;
      post-intervention improvements in quality of life. Seventh, it is hypothesized that parents'&#xD;
      post-intervention improvements in quality of life are predicted by their own&#xD;
      post-intervention improvements in emotional regulation and their children's post-intervention&#xD;
      improvements in quality of life.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>I-BMS for families with children suffering from eczema</intervention_name>
    <description>It is a strength-based, family system approach to aid empowerment of individuals. It focuses on the interplay between physical and emotional well-being, the spiritual transformation of adverse life experiences, and the acceptance of adversity through reflection on the philosophical concepts of forgiveness and letting go. It integrates Western therapeutic techniques and Eastern philosophies to develop spiritual transformation through suffering and pain under a meaning-oriented framework. It consists of six three-hour consecutive weekly sessions: (1) awareness of body-mind connection; (2) regulation of emotion; (3) acknowledgement of the gains and losses in the caregiving or illness experience; (4) appreciation of self and others; (5) cultivation of acceptance; and (6) meaning reconstruction of caregiving or illness experience.</description>

    <description>It focuses on practical eczema management. It serves as a control for group effect between conditions. It consists of six three-hour sessions: (1) information about the physiology of eczema and its health impact; (2) recognition and avoidance of trigger factors and daily skin care; (3) dealing with itching and scratching; (4) stage-related treatment of symptoms and unconventional therapies; (5) general child nutrition, food allergies in eczema, and different forms of diets; and (6) self-management plan and problems in integrating into daily routine.</description>
