  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present project is to evaluate in a randomised, controlled, open-label, two&#xD;
      parallel treatment groups pilot study, the efficacy of oral nutritional supplementation with&#xD;
      a high-protein-high calorie mixture containing immunonutrients compared to a standard&#xD;
      high-calorie-high-protein nutritional blend, in addition to nutritional counseling, in&#xD;
      improving tolerance to chemoradiotherapy (CT-RT) in patients with tumours of the head and&#xD;
      neck&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a recent study, we have shown that the systematic use of oral nutritional supplements&#xD;
      (ONS) in combination with counseling further favours the maintenance of nutrition status, the&#xD;
      recovery of quality of life and, more importantly, improves the practicability of CT-RT. This&#xD;
      effect would be substantially attributable to the increase in protein-energy intake&#xD;
      associated with ONS use, but also to the possible &quot;nutraceutical&quot; action of omega-3 fatty&#xD;
      acids. Therefore, modulation of the inflammatory response could play a role during cancer&#xD;
      treatments. In this context, there is an already-known high-calorie-high-protein nutritional&#xD;
      blend, enriched in immunonutrients (arginine, nucleotides and omega-3 fatty acids), which&#xD;
      could also have an application in this type of patients. This mixture has proven effective in&#xD;
      reducing the risk of post-operative complications (e.g. infections, fistulas, etc.) and the&#xD;
      length of stay of patients undergoing major cancer surgery (abdominal and head and neck&#xD;
      regions). Nevertheless, in oncology, there is a growing therapeutic interest in the&#xD;
      modulation of inflammation and immunosuppression at the tumour microenvironment level.&#xD;
