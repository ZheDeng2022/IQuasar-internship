  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive cancer with a progression-free survival (PFS) of 7 months&#xD;
      and an overall survival (OS) of 15 months. Many therapeutic approaches have failed to improve&#xD;
      the prognosis of patients to date. One of the main reasons is the presence of blood brain&#xD;
      barrier (BBB) which limits therapeutic agents uptake in the brain. GBM is also considered to&#xD;
      have a &quot;cold&quot; (unresponsive) immunological microenvironment due to factors released by the&#xD;
      tumor and the presence of BBB limiting the transit of immune cells from the systemic&#xD;
      circulation. Therefore, by-passing the BBB appears as a promising strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the Phase II clinical trial, SonoFIRST, is to evaluate if the use of&#xD;
      therapeutic ultrasound device, sonoCloud-9 (SC9) could improve the progression free survival&#xD;
      of newly diagnosed GBM patients, treated by concurrent temoradiation and adjuvant&#xD;
      temozolomide. The transient opening of the BBB by ultrasound with the SonoCloud-9 (SC9)&#xD;
      device, predicts the increase in the penetration of temozolomide (TMZ) into the brain and the&#xD;
      stimulation of cerebral immunity with the prospect of improving the survival of 160,000 new&#xD;
      brain tumor patients each year in Europe and the United States.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, Phase 2, multicenter, double arm, randomized, interventional&#xD;
      trial that will evaluate primarily the clinical efficacy of the device and will be to compare&#xD;
      Progression Free Survival (PFS) between the standard of care treatment with concomitant&#xD;
      ultrasound BBB opening versus standard of care alone. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common&#xD;
      and aggressive primary brain cancer. Currently, prognosis is very poor, with a survival of&#xD;
      about 15 months with current therapies. Although intensive treatments combining surgery,&#xD;
      radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the prognosis of GBM patients remains poor. New treatment&#xD;
      strategies are urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the brain, the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits the uptake of therapeutic&#xD;
      agents. To encounter this BBB issue, Professor Alexandre Carpentier and his team developed an&#xD;
      ultrasound medical device (SonoCloud), implanted in the skull during surgery. This highly&#xD;
      innovative technique temporarily permeates the BBB, increasing drug delivery to the brain by&#xD;
      five times. The SonoCloud, a low-intensity pulsed ultrasound device developed by CarThera, is&#xD;
      one of the major innovations in this field, as shown by the encouraging results obtained in&#xD;
      studies in recurrent GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected benefits of using the SonoCloud-9 experimental device prior to TMZ chemotherapy&#xD;
      are the stabilization or reduction of GBM tumor volume on the one hand, and stabilization or&#xD;
      improvement of the patient's neurological status on the other hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the clinical trial will contribute to a better understanding of the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of opening the BBB. It will be possible to determine whether the BBB opening&#xD;
      using low-intensity pulsed ultrasound can be effective in treating GBM, in addition to the&#xD;
      standard of care protocol.&#xD;
