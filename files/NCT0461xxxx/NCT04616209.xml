      Objectives: To determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of allogeneic PB103 in&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PB103 is allogeneic NK cells derived from a healthy donor. In this phase I/IIa trial,&#xD;
      patients with IIIb/IV and refractory non-small cell lung cancer will be enrolled for testing&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of PB103 (NK cells). For assessment of safety and&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PB103, three-dose levels of PB103 will be administered to&#xD;
      enrolled patients based on the 3+3 dose-escalation design. MTD is deﬁned as one dose level&#xD;
      below the dose at which dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) is observed in &lt;33% of the&#xD;
      participants. DLT is deﬁned as grade 4 toxicities (hematological toxicities), grade 3&#xD;
      toxicities (non-hematological toxicities), or acute GvHD more than grade 2. Once MTD is&#xD;
      determined, 12 patients at MTD dose will be enrolled for assessment of safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      PB103 at phase IIa.&#xD;
