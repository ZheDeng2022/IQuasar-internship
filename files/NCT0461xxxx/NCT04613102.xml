  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is rare, devastating, and currently incurable genetic blistering&#xD;
      disorders characterized by fragility of skin and mucosal membranes. Therapeutic options for&#xD;
      EB are limited. Acute and chronic wounds cause pain, itching and infection, altering quality&#xD;
      of life and impair wound healing. In absence of a cure, wound care is paramount to alleviate&#xD;
      suffering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anecdotal experience suggest that CBD application alleviates the pain and itching and&#xD;
      improves wound healing by controlling the inflammatory process. We propose to undertake a&#xD;
      phase II/III study exploring the safety, tolerability and efficacy of topical application of&#xD;
      3% Cannabidiol cream (CBD) on acute and chronic wounds affecting patients with EB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are doing this trial to determine safety and tolerability of topical CBD cream in a cohort&#xD;
      of RDEB patients with chronic wounds (phase II trial), and to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of CBD cream in EB with acute and chronic wounds in promoting wound healing, decrease&#xD;
      blister formation, pain, itching and improve overall quality of life (phase III trial)&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase II is an open-label part of the study. We are planning to enroll in this phase 10&#xD;
      patients, diagnosed with Epidermolysis Bullosa with chronic wounds , and treat them with&#xD;
      topical application of 3% Cannabidiol cream (AVCN583601) for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full study procedures (phase II of the trial), see below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Screening Visit: A screening form will be completed and patients who are willing to&#xD;
      enroll and meet the eligibility criteria will be asked to sign the consent/assent form .&#xD;
      Patients already on cannabinoids will be instructed to discontinue their treatment two weeks&#xD;
      prior to the next visit (wash-out period). Subjects who were not treated with antibiotics or&#xD;
      corticosteroids in the previous 2 weeks for topical and 4 weeks for systemic agents will&#xD;
      start the trial at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Baseline Visit: A baseline data collection form will be completed. We will select&#xD;
      for the study treatment a chronic wound (present for more than 4 weeks), not measuring more&#xD;
      than 1000 cm2. The surface area of the wound and quality of the wounds will be assessed and&#xD;
      documented using the SWIFT medical wound assessment app, a validated tool that allows serial&#xD;
      estimates and measurements of the wound surface areas. Bacterial swabs of selected target&#xD;
      wound and medical photographs of the target wounds will be taken. For the pain intensity&#xD;
      assessment, we will use a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS), where 0 is no pain and 10- the&#xD;
      worst pain ever experienced, while the DN4 scale will be used for assessment of neuropathic&#xD;
      pain. For itch assessments, we will ask patients to determine the degree of itching&#xD;
      experienced that day using a 100 mm horizontal VAS for itch. Patients will be provided with&#xD;
      the study medication during this study visit and instructed to apply the cream twice a day&#xD;
      for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sample (3 ml) will be taken to measure cannabinoid level in the blood. Visit 3: End of&#xD;
      study visit: Patients will be assessed at 4 weeks when we will evaluate tolerability of the&#xD;
      CBD oil and safety (e.g. burning sensation, pain, itch, local irritation, systemic symptoms).&#xD;
      In addition, we will calculate the surface area change from previous visit as well as the&#xD;
      characteristics of the wounds using the SWIFT medical wound assessment app. Patients will&#xD;
      also be asked to score the average pain (VAS and DN4) and itching at the wound site for the&#xD;
      prior 2 weeks and to complete a 100 mm VAS of wound change where -100 is the wound is double&#xD;
      in size, 0- no change, and +100, wound is completely closed. Medical photographs of the&#xD;
      target wounds will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sample (3 ml) will be taken to measure cannabinoid level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants, completed phase II , who are willing to take part in phase III, will&#xD;
      be able to participate , if eligible ( after appropriate wash out period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III will be a randomized, placebo controlled, blinded study ( Right versus Left side&#xD;
      extremity), assessing the efficacy and safety CBD cream in EB patients with acute and chronic&#xD;
      wounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 EB patients with chronic or/and acute wounds, will participate in phase III. Randomization&#xD;
      and Blinding: The name of each patient will be submitted to the research pharmacist. He will&#xD;
      prepare a randomization scheme and will allocate patients' extremity to either placebo or CBD&#xD;
      cream. Families and patients, as well as investigators will be blinded to the type of&#xD;
      intervention throughout the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is CBD 3% cream / placebo. The study medications will be dispensed as 100 g&#xD;
      jars. The study treatment will be applied to the entire or selected area of the extremity&#xD;
      twice a day for 8 weeks (a drawing will be provided to the patients and to the assessors for&#xD;
      the purpose of consistency).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;placebo&quot; will consist of a cream formulation with same color, consistency and smell as&#xD;
      the intervention which will be applied on the other extremity (the application will mirror&#xD;
      the process for the active medication).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both jars will be labeled appropriately with the location and dosage instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allowable therapies: Patients will continue the same skin care routine and dressings with the&#xD;
      exceptions of use of topical corticosteroids and topical antibiotics. Dressings that are&#xD;
      impregnated with antimicrobials (silver, PHMB, honey, etc) are allowed if previously used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: For the purpose of this phase we will select 2 different patient populations: A:&#xD;
      acute wounds group (wounds that have been present for less than 4 weeks; B: chronic wounds&#xD;
      group (wounds that have been present for &gt;4 weeks) seen in patients with more severe types of&#xD;
      EB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who have more than one chronic wound in the selected extremity we will add the&#xD;
      individual wounds' surface areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Screening Visit: A screening form will be completed and patients who are willing to&#xD;
      enroll and meet the inclusion criteria will be asked to sign the consent/assent form by our&#xD;
      study nurse. Patients already on topical or systemic cannabinoids will be instructed to&#xD;
      discontinue their treatment two weeks prior to the next visit (Wash-out period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Baseline Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the demographic and clinical, disease specific characteristics we will collect&#xD;
      the following data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blister count, open and closed wound count, evidence of infection, dyspigmentation, EB nevi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with chronic wounds: surface area, wound characteristics , wound swab for&#xD;
      culture and sensitivity, Current wound care regimen Pain score (VAS and DN4) Itch score&#xD;
      iscorEB (clinician and patient) EBQOL CBD level (blood sample 3 ml)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: Mid study visit (4 weeks): We will collect the same information as for baseline&#xD;
      visit (Visit 2) and additional data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      VAS improvement patient Adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4: End of study visit (8 weeks): We will collect the same information as for previous&#xD;
      visit (Visit 3) , plus - the CBD level in the blood will be measured again ( 3 ml sample).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wound swab will be taken ( group B), if the study investigator deems it is necessary.&#xD;

It evaluates the cutaneous, mucosal and other organ impact of EB and includes clinician and patient reported outcomes in a single instrument. Score ranges between 0-120 for both reported outcomes. Patient portion of this instrument contains 15 questions. Each question has a score range from 0-8.Total score range for iscorEB patient portion is between 0 and 120. Reduction in iscorEB scores indicates improvement. An increase in score indicates deterioration. The difference in total patient and clinician scores between baseline and Week 4 ,8 visits will be divided by 120 ( max score for each portion)and multiplied by 100, to get the results in percents.</description>
