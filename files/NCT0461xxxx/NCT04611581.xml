  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to measure behavioural disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD)&#xD;
      patients in a more objective way, in order to facilitate the detection of those symptoms and&#xD;
      improve the treatment of non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Apathy and impulse control disorders (ICDs) are frequent non-motor symptoms of PD and&#xD;
      negatively affect the quality of life of patients. Although healthcare professionals have&#xD;
      begun to understand the extent of the problem faced by those suffering apathy or ICDs,&#xD;
      accurate diagnosis is still difficult, as behavioural symptoms are often multidimensional,&#xD;
      develop gradually over the course of months and clinical staff have to rely on the&#xD;
      self-report of the patient or the report of a family member to assess them. To overcome this&#xD;
      issue, the investigators aim to use information and communication technologies to measure&#xD;
      apathy and hyperdopaminergic behaviours in PD patients in an objective way, with the ultimate&#xD;
      goal of improving the management of PD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do so, the investigators will use three computer-based tasks that measure effort-based&#xD;
      decision making, reward processing and emotion processing in PD patients, and assess motor,&#xD;
      cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms in parallel with scales and tests. In some select&#xD;
      patients, motor symptoms and activity patterns will be monitored with an in-home sensor&#xD;
      system before and after deep brain stimulation (DBS), and the above mentioned procedures will&#xD;
      be repeated in a longitudinal design.&#xD;
