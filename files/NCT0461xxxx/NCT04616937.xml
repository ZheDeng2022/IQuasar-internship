      Research suggests that modifying microbial ecology therapeutically via the intake of&#xD;
      so-called 'psychobiotics' could help reduce stress responses and symptoms of anxiety and&#xD;
      depression (Burnet &amp; Cowen, 2013; Dinan, Stanton, &amp; Cryan, 2013; Tang, Reddy, &amp; Saier, 2014).&#xD;
      The term psychobiotics refers to both, beneficial gut bacteria (probiotics), as well as&#xD;
      prebiotics, which enhance the growth of beneficial gut bacteria (Sarkar et al., 2016). In a&#xD;
      recent study, Schmidt and colleagues explored the effects of prebiotics on the secretion of&#xD;
      the stress hormone cortisol and emotional processing in healthy volunteers (Schmidt et al.,&#xD;
      2015). They found that cortical awakening response was significantly lower after&#xD;
      Bimuno√í-galacto-oligosaccharides (Bimuno) intake over 4 weeks compared with placebo.&#xD;
      Moreover, participants exhibited decreased attentional vigilance to negative information in a&#xD;
      dot-probe task. Given that anxious people show increased biases towards negative information&#xD;
      (Bar-Haim, Lamy, Pergamin, Bakermans-Kranenburg, &amp; van, 2007), this suggests that prebiotic&#xD;
      intake may be useful in modifying anxiety-related cognitive mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings will be extended to a sample of late adolescents in order to investigate how&#xD;
      prebiotic intake for 4 weeks affects cognitive functioning, psychological well-being and gut&#xD;
      microbiota a sample of 60 undergraduate students (aged 18-25 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At time 1 (pre-assessment), participants in both groups will undergo comprehensive&#xD;
      behavioural and psychological testing to establish baseline measures of cognitive functioning&#xD;
      and psychological well-being (such as anxiety levels) and asked to collect a stool sample at&#xD;
      home for 16s rRNA sequencing of the microbiome. Group 1 will then receive a daily dosage of a&#xD;
      galactooligosaccharide (GOS) prebiotic over 4 weeks, whereas group 2 will receive a placebo&#xD;
      over the same period. At time 2 (post-assessment), both groups will again undergo cognitive&#xD;
      and psychological testing and stool sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: It is predicted that the treatment group (GOS) will show improvements in&#xD;
      behavioural indices of emotion regulation (e.g. dot probe task) and in self reported&#xD;
      psychological measures related to emotion regulation (e.g. anxiety) in comparison to the&#xD;
      placebo group. Changes/differences in gut microbiome samples will be explored.&#xD;
