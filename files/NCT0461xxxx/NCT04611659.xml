  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to test the efficacy of a Motivational Interviewing&#xD;
      and Educational Training intervention with immediate linkage to long acting reversible&#xD;
      contraception (LARC) (hereafter known as MIET). MIET will be delivered to women of&#xD;
      childbearing age (18-44) through the Meharry Addiction Clinic to women residing in Nashville,&#xD;
      Tennessee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two aims associated with this study. The primary aim is to determine the efficacy&#xD;
      of MIET, to promote insertion of LARC among young, urban dwelling, low income women living&#xD;
      with OUD and at-risk of unplanned pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this aim are: 1) meeting with a provider regarding initial assessment&#xD;
      for LARC, 2) having a LARC implant. Because of potential contraindication for LARC insertion&#xD;
      (i.e. obesity) the first endpoint of meeting with a LARC provider is most proximal to aim 1.&#xD;
      However, determining the number of willing women that go on to receive the implant is also&#xD;
      critical in that it reflects potential decreases in cost to the health care system through&#xD;
      reduction of unintended pregnancy and related subsequent NAS in the newborn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim for the study is to utilize qualitative and quantitative data collected for&#xD;
      the study to modify the MIET intervention to more effectively meet the needs of the women in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey data for the study will be collected at baseline, one and six months. Of note, the&#xD;
      baseline, one and six month survey data collections will provide potential co-variates to&#xD;
      consider in analysis of aim one and two. The primary endpoints however will come from the six&#xD;
      month records review. We will gain consent to access records at the baseline consent, and&#xD;
      will gather these data from the Meharry Electronic Health Record.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an efficacy trial of the Motivational Interviewing (MI) and Educational Training&#xD;
      (MIET) program. The approach includes LARC education and brief MI to encourage LARC adoption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized trial design with pre- and post-assessments will be used to meet study aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in both the control and treatment conditions will complete a baseline survey that&#xD;
      includes the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), a contraceptive use&#xD;
      survey, and the WHO Quality of Life-Brief (WHO-QOL-B). Women in the control group will be&#xD;
      provided a color brochure with easy-to-read information about the advantages of LARC. Via&#xD;
      this brochure, control group women will be provided no-cost options and corresponding&#xD;
      referral information for receiving LARC. Women randomized to the treatment group will&#xD;
      complete the baseline survey and receive the same brochure; however, they also will receive&#xD;
      structured education regarding unintended pregnancies among women using opioids, potential&#xD;
      complications associated with opioid, alcohol, and other drug use, and education on&#xD;
      contraceptive use (with an emphasis on LARC). This structured education will be coupled with&#xD;
      a brief, initial MI conversation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consistent with the peak years for having unplanned pregnancies, we will recruit women 18-44&#xD;
      years of age, who are reproductively capable (intact uterus, not sterilized), who are&#xD;
      classified with opioid use disorder (OUD) based on a &gt;3 MINI score, and who indicate having&#xD;
      male sex partner(s). Women will be excluded if they: (1) are knowingly pregnant; (2) are&#xD;
      identified as pregnant from an administered pregnancy test; (3) express a current intent to&#xD;
      conceive; (4) are currently using Depo-Provera to avert pregnancy; or (5) already have LARC&#xD;
      insertion. Recruitment and intervention will occur sequentially and will be delivered in the&#xD;
      office-based opioid treatment (OBOT) clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be approached for recruitment during the&#xD;
      fifth week of their induction into MAT. The research coordinator will recruit patients,&#xD;
      gathering informed consent and baseline data, as well as randomizing patients to the control&#xD;
      or treatment conditions. She will electronically forward screens to the treatment group&#xD;
      interventionist to expedite the intervention by providing data on opioid use, pregnancy risk,&#xD;
      and participant quality of life. The control group interventionist will know only that the&#xD;
      patient is eligible for LARC and will not receive the baseline data. The research coordinator&#xD;
      will collect all survey data at baseline and up to five days before, or seven days after, the&#xD;
      one- and six-month follow-up time points. The consent form will request permission to acquire&#xD;
      Electronic Health Record (EHR) data from the clinic for a one- and six-month extraction to&#xD;
      determine whether the women experienced unplanned pregnancies, had contraceptive&#xD;
      consultations, and received LARC implant/insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Flow. Figure 1 provides a flow diagram describing the study. Women in both&#xD;
      conditions will be notified that they are eligible for a free LARC implant/insertion if they&#xD;
      have interest. Upon consent, women will be provided pregnancy tests, and those who are&#xD;
      pregnant will be informed and referred for prenatal services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate 90% retention at month one (i.e., N = 36 per group). This figure is consistent&#xD;
      with current retention rates for patients in the clinic who are retained for four weeks. As&#xD;
      primary one- and six-month endpoints are collected via chart extraction, loss to follow-up is&#xD;
      not an issue for the outcomes of interest, receipt of contraception consultation, and LARC&#xD;
      implantation (i.e., the available N for this final assessment will be 80), as this data is&#xD;
      maintained in the EHR and represents the primary set of dependent variables for the RCT.&#xD;
      Self-reported measures serve as study covariates and data from follow-up assessments (one and&#xD;
      six months) will serve as dependent variables for a sensitivity analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be achieved by using a stratified method described by Suresh.42 The strata&#xD;
      will include women who have insurance, opposed to those who do not; the &quot;strata&quot; will be one&#xD;
      of two blocks. We chose to stratify, as women without insurance will have the added step of&#xD;
      seeking an implant from a local provider that offers free LARC implant/insertion, thus adding&#xD;
      an additional step to the process and perhaps affecting the outcomes. Within strata, women&#xD;
      will be randomized to one of the two study conditions using a computer-generated allocation&#xD;
      procedure and a concealment of allocation technique.43,44 The concealment of allocation will&#xD;
      be conducted by the data manager generating a random assignment list. Once the sequence has&#xD;
      been assembled, it will be uploaded to the REDCap randomization module and employed after the&#xD;
      baseline assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical and Power Analysis Power Analysis. We are planning a study examining LARC uptake&#xD;
      with 40 experimental and 40 control subjects. For Aim 1 the anticipated percentage point&#xD;
      differences in LARC uptake are based on the following estimates. Data from a large&#xD;
      retrospective cohort analysis of LARC adoption comparing women with SUDs to those without&#xD;
      found that ~6% of women adopted LARC.49 We predict a slightly higher adoption rate among&#xD;
      women in the control group (10%) in this study due to their exposure to educational materials&#xD;
      in the clinic, including posters and brochures, and their awareness of free access to this&#xD;
      services. Preliminary data from our pilot study support a projection of a conservative (40%)&#xD;
      uptake probability. If the true probability of uptake among the intervention group is 40% (or&#xD;
      a 30-percentage point increase), we will be able to reject the null hypothesis that uptake&#xD;
      rates for the intervention and control groups are equal with a power of ~91%. The type I&#xD;
      error probability associated with this one-tailed test of the null hypothesis is 0.05. Figure&#xD;
      2 illustrates the power curve for Aim 1 and the expected power given the sample size.&#xD;
      Further, estimates are provided given increases or decreases in projected differences in&#xD;
      control and intervention. For instance, if the true difference is only 25%, as opposed to the&#xD;
      projected 30%, we would still have sufficient power at ~81% power to reject the null&#xD;
      hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 Analysis Plan. As previously noted, the study has one dependent variable, LARC&#xD;
      insertion. In Aim 1, this binary outcome will be evaluated using multivariable generalized&#xD;
      estimating equations in conjunction with robust (sandwich) variance procedures. All models&#xD;
      will include randomization to MIET versus the control group, and we will adjust for any&#xD;
      baseline characteristics that may be distributed differentially between the two study groups&#xD;
      (which is unexpected with an effective randomization scheme). To account for the clustering&#xD;
      of observations within individuals and the lack of independence of the observations, we will&#xD;
      use random effects models. In addition to main effects models, we will explore modifiers of&#xD;
      the treatment effect by introducing interaction terms into multivariable models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding missingness, we will exercise two options. First, missingness from the primary&#xD;
      analyses will be partly alleviated by using self-reported values from the one-month follow-up&#xD;
      assessment, used to inform imputation. Second, we will determine whether missingness is&#xD;
      associated with observed data. If we identify predictors of missingness, multiple imputations&#xD;
      will evaluate robustness of the primary outcome analyses and report estimates based on&#xD;
      imputations that would be valid under the assumption of random missing data. We will impute&#xD;
      using chained equations and produce at least five imputed datasets and derive point and&#xD;
      standard error estimates for treatment effects and other parameters from the distribution of&#xD;
      estimates with imputed datasets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sub-analysis will address the question of whether LARC insertion may lead to subsequent&#xD;
      retention in MAT. Although not a specific aim of the study, this question is important, as an&#xD;
      affirmative answer would provide added evidence that LARC may be a &quot;gateway&quot; into stabilizing&#xD;
      the lives of women with OUD. Conversely, it is possible that uptake and adherence to MAT may&#xD;
      stabilize women's lives to the point whereby they begin using LARC. Furthermore, we are&#xD;
      interested in examining exploratory aims regarding short-term contraceptive-method retention.&#xD;
      If women opt not to have LARC, we will monitor retention on shorter-term methods, including&#xD;
      birth control pills and Depo-Provera shots. An appropriate regression-based sub-analysis will&#xD;
      detect whether LARC uptake predicts MAT uptake and vice versa (depending on the time&#xD;
      sequence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 Analysis Plan. Aim 2 consists of tailoring the MIET intervention to the needs of urban&#xD;
      women receiving MAT using the ADAPT ITT model. This aim involves data collection from both&#xD;
      review of the interventionist's sessions with patients and qualitative data collection from&#xD;
      the patients. The first step, tailoring the interventionist's performance to the patient&#xD;
      group, will be achieved by applying a nominal group process, with the group consisting of the&#xD;
      research team. The process will occur in two rounds: (1) each team member independently will&#xD;
      view a video demonstration of MIET delivered by the two staff members trained to implement&#xD;
      the treatment group intervention and provide a written critique of the content and delivery;&#xD;
      and (2) the second round will occur through a two-day work meeting, with the goal of sharing&#xD;
      these written critiques and proposing adaptations to the intervention until the group comes&#xD;
      to full consensus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will collect patient data for the second step including: (1) satisfaction (e.g., was&#xD;
      session interesting to you?); (2) reaction (e.g., how did it change the way you think about&#xD;
      using LARC?); and (3) understandability (e.g., did the wording and pacing of the program meet&#xD;
      your needs?). Data will be collected in one-to-one, in-depth interviews with 10&#xD;
      study-eligible women post-intervention. Every fifth woman in the treatment and control groups&#xD;
      will be asked to participate in these interviews. If a woman refuses, we will ask each&#xD;
      subsequent woman until we identify a woman who is willing to participate. All interviews will&#xD;
      be conducted and audio-recorded by the research coordinator. A semi-structured interview&#xD;
      guide will be used, and standard coding/analytic procedures will be applied. Interview&#xD;
      questions will be designed by the research team to elicit participants' reactions to the core&#xD;
      elements of the intervention. Whether reactions are positive, neutral, or negative, each&#xD;
      elicitation question will conclude by asking for suggestions as to how the content and/or&#xD;
      delivery could be improved for greater relevance. Using standard methods of qualitative data&#xD;
      analysis, the transcribed data will be analyzed by members of the research team. First, these&#xD;
      data will be analyzed with Atlas T.I. using thematic content analysis to describe and code&#xD;
      key themes. Second, open coding will occur through line-by-line reading to identify salient&#xD;
      themes through the development of a codebook. Third, using this codebook, each person&#xD;
      independently will code five interviews. Finally, the team collectively will verify the codes&#xD;
      assigned by the original reviewers to allow for inter-rater reliability and use a&#xD;
      consensus-building approach when disagreements occur. Once the themes have been identified,&#xD;
      the committee will convene to use the study findings as a basis for refining the brief&#xD;
      intervention and tailoring content as needed. Findings from the nominal group process&#xD;
      involving staff implementation of the intervention and the qualitative data collected from&#xD;
      patients will inform intervention adaptation, leading to an intervention tailored for urban,&#xD;
      low-income, opioid-using women, and will be tested in a larger study.&#xD;
