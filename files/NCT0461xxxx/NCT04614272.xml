      With this study the investigators wish to examine the effect of prayer on pain intensity and&#xD;
      on the conditioned pain modulation in healthy religious university students.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There has been a call for a model that incorporate spirituality in the biopsychosocial&#xD;
      framework .The biopsychosocial- spiritual model recognizes the impact of the religious&#xD;
      factors in modulating the biology of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to measure the effect of praying as an intervention on conditioned&#xD;
      pain modulation and on pain intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that prayer would increase conditioned pain modulation compared&#xD;
      to a no prayer control group in a healthy religious population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that participants engaging in active prayer will show a higher&#xD;
      increase in conditioned pain modulation compared to those engaging in passive prayer or no&#xD;
      prayer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is a randomized controlled trial comparing the effect of two types of&#xD;
      prayer, the passive and the active prayer and no prayer, on conditioned pain modulation using&#xD;
      the heat protocol and on pain intensity. Participants are to be randomly assigned to 2&#xD;
      groups: the prayer group and the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group is of (n=50) participants and the prayer group is (n=150) participants to&#xD;
      be divided according to the style of praying identified by the prayer function scale into&#xD;
      active and passive prayer group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate statistical analyses will be performed to evaluate and compare treatment effects.&#xD;

    <description>1.The religiosity level will be measured using the Duke University Religiosity scale, it is a 5-item self-report measure of religious involvement scored on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (almost never) to 5 (a great deal). It assesses the three major dimensions of religiosity, organizational religious activity, non-organizational religious activity, and intrinsic religiosity .</description>

    <time_frame>the prayer function scale is assessed at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>is a self-report instrument that assesses the motivation or purpose behind an individual's prayer while she or he is coping with difficult circumstances.&#xD;
The scale consists of 58 items that are scored on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (almost never) to 5 (a great deal).&#xD;
The measure contains four scales: Provides Acceptance (17 items), Provides Calm and Focus (11 items), Deferring/Avoiding , and Provides Assistance (14 items).&#xD;
The deferring/avoiding scale represent a passive type of prayer The assistance scale represent an active type of prayer.</description>
