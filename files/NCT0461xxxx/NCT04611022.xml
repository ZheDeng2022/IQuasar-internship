  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The educational intervention to be delivered by the CHE(Community Health Educator) consists&#xD;
      of &quot;toolkit education materials&quot; developed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and a small&#xD;
      media intervention (i.e., video) that our research team has developed. The NCI-produced&#xD;
      toolkit education materials consist of Power Point presentations, flyers, and posters that&#xD;
      contain information about HPV(Human Papilloma Virus), HPV-related cancers, and the importance&#xD;
      of the HPV vaccine series for adolescents (9-17 years old) and young adults (18-26 year old)&#xD;
      who are eligible for the vaccine.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      The investigator will use a one-group pre- and post-test design to assess the effects of the&#xD;
      intervention on the primary outcomes. The educational intervention will be delivered to 200&#xD;
      participants by a trained CHE who will conduct educational workshops to deliver the&#xD;
      educational materials at DHHA outpatient clinics. The CHE will administer the pre- and&#xD;
      post-intervention survey to workshop participants. The follow-up survey will occur over the&#xD;
      phone at 3 months post baseline only for parent participants that indicate having&#xD;
      unvaccinated children or are a young adult participant and indicated not being vaccinated at&#xD;
      baseline. The last follow up survey will occur over the phone at 6 months only for those&#xD;
      parent participants that indicated having unvaccinated children at the 3 month follow up&#xD;
      call, or are a young adult participant and indicated not being vaccinated at the 3 month&#xD;
      follow up call. Additionally, the investigator will use a one-group post-test design to&#xD;
      assess the impact of the intervention on the secondary outcomes. At the patient-level, the&#xD;
      investigator will track participants that receive (a) 1st dose, 2nd dose, or 3rd dose of the&#xD;
      HPV vaccine; and the number of referrals to care by recording the number of patients received&#xD;
      (b) referrals to health insurance, discount or no-cost HPV vaccine programs; or (c) to other&#xD;
      services to facilitate HPV vaccine dose completion. To assess clinic-level impact, the&#xD;
      investigator will track each clinic's HPV vaccine rates for adolescents (9-17 years old) and&#xD;
      young adults (18-26), and compare rates from before the investigator started the intervention&#xD;
      and then quarterly there after the investigator had introduced the intervention to each&#xD;
      respective Denver Health clinic.&#xD;

    <description>The videos are 8-minute narrative films created using an entertainment-education (E-E) approach that embeds an educational narrative message into an entertainment format such as media. E-E narratives have demonstrated a significant effect (r = .12, p &lt; .001) on health behavior change. Evidence-based small media interventions that Dr. Borrayo has produced include videos that are highly verbal, visual, and entertaining (e.g., acted fictional stories). The aims of the video will be to model uptake of the HPV vaccine, but also to reinforce self-efficacy, subjective norms, and behavioral intentions, all significant precursors to behavior change.</description>
