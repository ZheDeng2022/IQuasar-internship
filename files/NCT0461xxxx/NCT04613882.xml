        Subjects will only be eligible for the study if:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. They are of legal age between 18 and 40 years.&#xD;

          2. They understand their rights as a research subject and are willing and able to sign a&#xD;
             Statement of Informed Consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. They are willing and able to follow the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. They are current wearers of any soft contact lens (i.e. have worn lenses in the last&#xD;
             six months).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. They have refractive ocular astigmatism between 0.00DC and -1.50DC in one or both&#xD;
             eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. They have a spherical component to their ocular refractive error between 0.00 and -&#xD;
             6.00 DS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. They could attain at least 0.10 logMAR distance high contrast visual acuity in one eye&#xD;
             with the study lenses within the available power range.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. They can be fitted satisfactorily with both lens types.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. They own an acceptable pair of spectacles.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. They agree not to participate in other clinical research for the duration of this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will not be eligible to take part in the study if:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. They have an ocular disorder which would normally contra-indicate contact lens wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. They have a systemic disorder which would normally contra-indicate contact lens wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. They are using any topical medication such as eye drops or ointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. They have had corneal refractive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. They have any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid lens wear or&#xD;
             have keratoconus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. They are pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. They have any ocular abnormality which would, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             normally contraindicate contact lens wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. They have an amblyopic eye, in which case only dominant eye will be assessed for that&#xD;
             subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. They have an infectious disease (e.g. hepatitis), any immunosuppressive disease (e.g.&#xD;
             HIV) or diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. They have a history of severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. They have taken part in any other contact lens clinical trial or research, within two&#xD;
             weeks prior to starting this study.&#xD;
