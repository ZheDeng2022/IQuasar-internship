  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anlotinib is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor under domestic research and&#xD;
      development. It can inhibit angiogenesis-related kinases, such as VEGFR, FGFR, PDGFR and&#xD;
      tumor cell proliferation related kinase c-Kit kinase. In the Phase III study, patients who&#xD;
      failed at least two systemic chemotherapy (third-line or above) or were intolerant of the&#xD;
      drugs were treated with anlotinib or placebo. The PFS and OS in the anlotinib group were 5.37&#xD;
      months and 9.63 months, respectively. The placebo group PFS and OS were 1.4 months and 6.3&#xD;
      months. Therefore, it is envisaged to use anlotinib combined with docetaxel to treat&#xD;
      wild-type advanced non-squamous non small cell lung cancer to further improve the patient's&#xD;
      PFS or OS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm clinical trial conducted in China. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy and safety of Anlotinib Hydrochloride (12mg, QD PO d1-14, 21days per&#xD;
      cycle) combined with Docetaxel (75mg/m2 IV d1) in the treatment of wild-type advanced&#xD;
      non-squamous non small cell lung cancer patients with progression after immunotherapy plus&#xD;
      chemotherapy as first-line treatment. After being informed about the study and potential&#xD;
      risks, all patients giving written informed consent will undergo a 4-week screening period to&#xD;
      determine eligibility for study entry. The expected sample size is 42.&#xD;
