  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional disorder of the gastrointestinal tract diagnosed&#xD;
      with the Rome criteria. The Rome IV criteria are based on abdominal pain symptoms and stool&#xD;
      habits including stool frequency and stool forms [1]. They define 3 main subtypes based on&#xD;
      symptoms: 1) IBS with diarrhea; 2) IBS with constipation: and 3) mixed symptoms of&#xD;
      constipation and diarrhea. The IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D) subtype has the highest prevalence.&#xD;
      Currently, treatment of IBS-D includes antidiarrheals, bile acid sequestrants,&#xD;
      antispasmodics, tricyclic antidepressants, and FODMAP diet. However, many patients are&#xD;
      intolerant or unresponsive to the above treatments. Outside of IBS, chronic diarrhea affects&#xD;
      about 5% of adults. We have described a syndrome in a subset of IBS patients presenting with&#xD;
      post prandial diarrhea, flushing and dermatographia whose symptoms are prevented by&#xD;
      pre-treatment with combined H1 and H2 antihistamines [2]. However, the prevalence of this&#xD;
      syndrome among the IBS + D patients is not known nor have the clinical characteristics or&#xD;
      predictors of antihistamine responsive IBS + D been defined.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We have published a series of 5 patients with chronic post prandial diarrhea (PPD) that&#xD;
      begins within 3 hours after eating, associated with dermatographia, responsive to&#xD;
      antihistamines [2]. In these cases, no underlying causes were identified to explain PPD;&#xD;
      diagnoses of food allergy, lactose intolerance, celiac disease, dumping syndromes,&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease, systemic mastocytosis were excluded. Patients with the syndrome&#xD;
      have prior histories of chronic urticaria and experience associated transient symptoms of&#xD;
      flushing, headache, tachycardia, and abdominal bloating during PPD episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This syndrome, except for our published report, have not been previously described in the&#xD;
      medical literature. Patients with systemic mastocytosis and mast cell activation syndrome&#xD;
      experience PPD but along with anaphylactic manifestations (e.g. wheezing, hypotension) and&#xD;
      measurable mast cell biomarkers are identifiable in affected patients (i.e. serum mast cell&#xD;
      tryptase or 24 hour urine methylhistamine, PGF2a). Therefore, it is important to characterize&#xD;
      PPD responsive to antihistamines in a general GI patient population and to publish our&#xD;
      findings. The impact on human health will be substantial; we found that these patients are&#xD;
      undiagnosed and untreated for many years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim is to recruit 50-100 patients from the UC Health affiliated gastroenterology clinics&#xD;
      with access UC health which has 300-500 potential subjects. We would need to recruit 10-20%&#xD;
      percentage of these potential subjects. Kris Ramprasad MD, a faculty member in the Division&#xD;
      of Gastroenterology, David Bernstein MD, a faculty member in the Division of Allergy and&#xD;
      Rheumatology, allergy fellows and GI fellows will direct and implement subject screening and&#xD;
      consenting.&#xD;

    <description>≥50 point in reduction of symptoms with antihistamines based on the IBS symptom severity scale (IBS-SSS). This validated scale contains 5 questions that measures on a 100 point scale (for a total of 500 points) the severity of abdominal pain, frequency of abdominal pain, severity of abdominal distension, dissatisfaction with bowel habits, and interference with quality of life.</description>

The IBS-QOL is a 34-item questionnaire which assesses the degree to which IBS interferes with the patient's quality of life. The IBS-GAI asks one question that assesses the overall improvement in symptoms in the past 7 days.</description>
