      To investigate the efficacy and safety of nivolumab for patients with advanced HCC undergoing&#xD;
      EBRT&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      &lt;Treatment phase&gt; Nivolumab 3mg/kg IV is administered as 30-minute IV infusion every 2 weeks.&#xD;
      External beam radiotherapy begins 2-7 days after the first dose of nivolumab. The study drug&#xD;
      is continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or study&#xD;
      closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Follow-Up phase &gt; After the treatment phase, subjects will undergo follow up for survival&#xD;
      every 12 weeks (± 7 days) from the last dose or the use of other anticancer treatments and/or&#xD;
      therapies, and the survival follow up will be performed for at least 18 months after the&#xD;
      enrollment of the last subject. The patient will be followed for survival follow up and the&#xD;
      use of other anticancer treatments and/or therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the assumed dropout rate of 12%, a total of 50 subjects need to perform the study&#xD;
      (50=44/(1-0.12))&#xD;
