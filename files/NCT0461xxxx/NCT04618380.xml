  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of premium monovision with Restor&#xD;
      and Panoptix, against other prevalent monovision techniques and against bilateral Panoptix&#xD;
      implantation in a sample of patients following lens-extraction surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Four study groups were formed according to the procedure and the intraocular lens technology&#xD;
      that was used: a) Monovision Group (MoG), b) Multifocal Lens Group (MfG), c) Hybrid&#xD;
      Monovision Group (HmG), and, d) Premium Monovision Group (PmG). Patients who have undergone&#xD;
      one of the above categories of presbyopia correction surgery were selected to compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness of these techniques by evaluating the uncorrected near, intermediate and&#xD;
      distant visual acuity as well as the degree of subjective patient satisfaction, contrast&#xD;
      sensitivity, dysphotopsia symptoms and spectacle independence .&#xD;

    <description>Dysphotopsia is evaluated with two direct 4-scale, Likert-type questions (Always, Most of the times, Sometimes, Never) pertaining on the subjective perception of glare and unwanted shadows.

    <description>Spectacle dependence is also evaluated for both distant and near vision by two direct 4-scale Likert-type questions (Always, Most of the times, Sometimes, Never). This parameter is obtained six months following the operation of the second eye.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective satisfaction using Visual Function Index (VF-14 instrument) (total score, VF14-NV score &amp; VF14-DV score)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 2.5years</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective satisfaction rates are assessed using the prevalent VF-14 instrument. Further to the total VF-14 score assessment, two additional scores are calculated: a) Near vision VF score (VF14-NV) derived from items that assess the perceived difficulty in near vision activities (items 1,2,3,7,8,9 and 11), and, b) Distant vision VF score (VF14-DV) derived from items that assess the perceived difficulty of distant vision activities (items 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 13 and 14).&#xD;
VF-14 has a final score from 0 to 100. A score of 100 indicates able to do all applicable activities. A score of 0 indicates unable to do all applicable activities because of vision.</description>
