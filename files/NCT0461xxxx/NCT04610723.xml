  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Graves' disease is characterized by the combination of anti-TSH receptor antibodies&#xD;
      (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone or thyroidotropic hormone), specific to this disease, with&#xD;
      inconsistent symptoms such as hyperthyroidism, orbitopathy, goiter, or myxedema&#xD;
      dermatological involvement. The activation of TSH receptors (RTSH) by these antibodies (known&#xD;
      as &quot;TRAK&quot;) causes the secretion of thyroid hormones as well as the development of the thyroid&#xD;
      gland, responsible for a goiter. The cellular infiltrate responsible for the goiter consists&#xD;
      mainly of T-lymphocytes but also of activated B lymphocytes secreting TRAK. Although Graves'&#xD;
      disease is antibody mediated, cytokine secretion by Th1 therefore seems essential to&#xD;
      pathogenesis. The treatment of orbitopathy requires primarily euthyroidism and the&#xD;
      discontinuation of smoking. Despite these measures, moderate to severe attacks may require&#xD;
      immunomodulatory treatment to limit local inflammation. This treatment is currently based on&#xD;
      a first-line corticosteroid treatment (per os or preferably by weekly intravenous infusions).&#xD;
      In the context of inadequate response, the therapeutic strategy is not very well established&#xD;
      since some immunosuppressive treatments targeting B-cells or T- cells have been studied but&#xD;
      with little benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many new concepts concerning immune tolerance and autoimmunity have emerged in recent years,&#xD;
      particularly in Graves' disease, with sometimes complex cellular interactions. Certain&#xD;
      mechanisms could occur either independently or in combination: i) modulation of T cell&#xD;
      activation, differentiation and apoptosis; ii) inhibition of BL maturation and immunoglobulin&#xD;
      production; iii) alteration of the balance between T helper (Th)-17 and T regulatory&#xD;
      lymphocytes (Treg), by promoting Treg differentiation and inhibiting Th17 differentiation.&#xD;
