  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low-carbohydrate diets (less than approximately 130 grams per day) are emerging as an&#xD;
      efficacious treatment option with several studies supporting weight loss and remission of&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes. Many physicians are now implementing this strategy but the time it takes to&#xD;
      educate patients on nutrition is a barrier. The research team is working with physicians to&#xD;
      develop a solution whereby the nutrition education and intervention is delivered via&#xD;
      mobile/online technology (i.e., an app). This study will test whether it is feasible and&#xD;
      efficacious for physicians to recommend this app to their patients with obesity and type 2&#xD;
      diabetes to help them lose weight and improve their condition.&#xD;

      The study is a non-experimental feasibility study to explore the acceptability, practicality&#xD;
      and demand for the use of a 12-week, personalized, online program to teach and coach patients&#xD;
      about therapeutic carbohydrate restriction for individuals with obesity and/or at risk for&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes/with type 2 diabetes. The program is intended to enhance the usual clinical&#xD;
      care provided for patients with these conditions and will allow for physicians to monitor&#xD;
      patient progress through the program. Both physician and patient perspectives will be&#xD;
      explored.&#xD;
