      The objective of this trial is to evaluate clinical healing outcomes of microsurfaced&#xD;
      cadaveric ADM (Markman Biologics) used in sites with &lt; 1 mm of attached gingiva requiring&#xD;
      soft tissue grafting without root coverage as compared to control cadaveric ADM (AlloDerm,&#xD;
      LifeCell) over 180-day post-op period. During the treatment period, each site will be&#xD;
      monitored for soft tissue healing and augmentation of keratinized tissue width. All subjects&#xD;
      will be seen at post-op day 7, 14, 30, 90, and 180.&#xD;
