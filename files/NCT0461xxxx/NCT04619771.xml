    <measure>Treatment Acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>Follow Up (week 15)</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment Acceptability Questionnaire will measure acceptability with patient-reported treatment satisfaction, and open-ended questions about satisfaction with both CBT-I and telemedicine (e.g., &quot;What did you think about treating sleep as part of your Bariatric care?&quot;; &quot;How did you feel about getting treatment without being face-to-face?&quot;; &quot;What could we do to improve your treatment experience?&quot;).</description>

    <description>Measured weight data will be extracted from electronic medical records. The following formula will be used to calculate % excess weight loss. %EWL = [(Initial Weight) - (Post Intervention Weight)] / [(Initial Weight) - (Ideal Weight)]. Ideal weight will be extracted from the EMR.</description>

    <description>CBT-I has a specific protocol with behavioral targets that differ significantly from standard CBT. This approach focuses on implementing sleep restriction and stimulus control interventions which are fully deployed during the first session. We will deliver 5 CBT-I sessions over the course of 8 weeks. Key recommendations include: 1) reduce time in bed; 2) get up at the same time every day; 3) do not go to bed unless sleepy; 4) do not stay in bed awake for more than 15 minutes; and 5) avoid napping. Participants are also taught relaxation strategies and cognitive therapy addresses arousal and catastrophizing.</description>
