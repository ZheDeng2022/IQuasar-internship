  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our overall hypothesis is that Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and Shear Wave&#xD;
      Elastography (SWE) will allow for high diagnostic accuracy of benign and malignant thyroid&#xD;
      nodules, which will correlate with and complement the ACR TI-RADS classification system,&#xD;
      allowing for more accurate diagnosis of benign and malignant thyroid nodules.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid nodules are an exceedingly common clinical entity, however, only a small percentage&#xD;
      of nodules are malignant. Conventional ultrasound is the current standard for the initial&#xD;
      evaluation of thyroid nodules, yet due to several overlapping characteristics between benign&#xD;
      and malignant nodules its utility in diagnosis has been limited, leading to a high rate of&#xD;
      negative biopsies. To overcome these challenges the American College of Radiology has&#xD;
      proposed a Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) in an effort to decrease&#xD;
      unnecessary biopsies [5]. While these efforts have shown encouraging results, further work is&#xD;
      still needed. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and Shear Wave Elastography (SWE) are two&#xD;
      emerging non-invasive imaging techniques which have shown promising results in the evaluation&#xD;
      of thyroid nodules. However, data is limited and how these imaging modalities could&#xD;
      potentially compliment ACR TI-RADS is unknown.&#xD;
