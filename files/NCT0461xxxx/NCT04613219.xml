  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs in Clinically Amyopathic&#xD;
      Dermatomyisitis(CADM) combined with Rapidly Progressive Interstitial Lung Disease(RPILD)&#xD;
      within 1-3 months, which leads to death of patients and is difficult to treat. Even if high&#xD;
      doses of glucocorticoids are ineffective, there is no recommended treatment for such&#xD;
      patients, which is a huge medical challenge.Lymphopenia is an independent risk factor for&#xD;
      death in CADM-RPILD, but the cause of lymphopenia is unclear.In this study, the level of&#xD;
      lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood was detected by flow cytometer, in order to further&#xD;
      clarify the pathogenesis of the disease, to facilitate clinical guidance of treatment, and to&#xD;
      improve the survival rate of patients.In addition, studies have shown that INF-α levels are&#xD;
      significantly increased in CADM patients combined with RPILD and are a poor prognostic factor&#xD;
      for CADM-RPILD, suggesting that the interferon system plays a role in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      CADM and can be used as an evaluation index of the severity of CADM-RPILD.In this study, the&#xD;
      levels of relevant cytokines including INF and IL-2, IL-17, IL-18, IL-6 were detected&#xD;
      simultaneously, and the relationship between disease activity and lymphocyte subsets was&#xD;
      analyzed, and the changes of lymphocyte subsets after Tofacitinib treatment were determined&#xD;
      in order to facilitate clinical guidance of treatment.&#xD;
