  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hispanic/Latino (HL) and American Indian (AI) patients are more likely than whites to have&#xD;
      end stage kidney disease (ESKD), but less likely to complete transplant evaluation or receive&#xD;
      a kidney transplant (KT), the best treatment for end-stage kidney disease ESKD. Using&#xD;
      comparative effectiveness research methods, we will conduct a pragmatic randomized trial to&#xD;
      compare the efficacy and cost- effectiveness of two approaches to help HL and AI patients&#xD;
      overcome barriers to completing transplant evaluation and receiving a KT: a streamlined KT&#xD;
      evaluation process and a peer-assisted evaluation program; and, we will determine best&#xD;
      practices to assist other transplant centers in implementing the better program. Findings&#xD;
      from this work may help reduce disparities in transplant evaluation and KT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The AKT-MP study will assess whether Kidney Transplant Fast Track (KTFT), a streamlined KT&#xD;
      evaluation process, or peer navigators (PN) who were former KT patients to help patients&#xD;
      &quot;navigate&quot; their way through KT evaluation, can help vulnerable patients with ESKD overcome&#xD;
      barriers to transplant listing. After culturally and contextually adapting the two&#xD;
      interventions, we will use a comparative effectiveness (CER) approach to conduct a pragmatic&#xD;
      randomized trial of 398 ESKD patients to compare the efficacy and effectiveness of the two&#xD;
      approaches in disadvantaged groups at a university-affiliated transplant center with large HL&#xD;
      and AI ESKD patient populations, and we will compare results to historic comparison&#xD;
      populations (local and national). We will assess facilitators and barriers to widespread&#xD;
      implementation and conduct a cost effectiveness analysis. Although it is expected that KTFT&#xD;
      will be more effective than PN, KTFT may also be more costly, requiring significant&#xD;
      administrative and clinical changes in the transplant center, which may be impractical to&#xD;
      maintain. Further, KTFT may lead to more patient ambivalence because the shortened evaluation&#xD;
      period will give them less time to consider their treatment options. Thus, an important&#xD;
      aspect of the proposed study is to comparative the effectiveness of the two methods.&#xD;
      Ultimately, our study will inform transplant programs faced with disparities in KT about&#xD;
      which disparity-reducing intervention to use given their particular needs and resources.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  eGFR&lt;20 or on dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Undergoing kidney transplant evaluation at the University of New Mexico&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Greater than or equal to 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mentally competent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children less than 18 years of age are excluded because all research-related&#xD;
             measurements are designed for patients over the age of 18. Children less than 18 years&#xD;
             of age have dissimilar decision-making authority as a result of their developmental&#xD;
             stage and dependency on adult guardians who must make all their transplant-related&#xD;
             decisions, as required by all pediatric transplant centers. The proposed study focuses&#xD;
             only on adult transplant patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior pre-transplant workup&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior kidney transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Incarcerated patients&#xD;
