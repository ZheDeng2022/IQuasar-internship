  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity are highly prevalent conditions worldwide, despite active research of&#xD;
      new interventions over decades. Current interventions include medications or bariatric&#xD;
      surgery, but these approaches cannot be used in all patients and require clear indications&#xD;
      and a close multidisciplinary management. Therefore most patients and physicians rely on&#xD;
      lifestyle interventions, focusing on a balanced diet and physical exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have uncovered that energy metabolism is also regulated by circadian rhythms,&#xD;
      which depend on spontaneous diurnal oscillations of the central clock, retinal sensing of&#xD;
      ambient light, and daily feeding-fasting cycles. The chronotype has an influence on&#xD;
      behavioral patterns, where some people describe that they are more alert in the morning or in&#xD;
      the evening: The morning or evening chronotypes, respectively. However, in modern societies,&#xD;
      many people are exposed to external cues in misalignment with their circadians clocks. The&#xD;
      mismatch between the individual chronotype and the social/work life can lead to metabolic&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time-restricted eating (TRE), i.e. energy intake limited to certain windows of time without&#xD;
      restricting calories, is an appealing approach because it proposes to realign the circadian&#xD;
      clocks with external cues provided by the timing of food intake, thus leading to better&#xD;
      metabolic outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators speculate that the TRE intervention needs to be personalized to reach&#xD;
      efficacy in a broader population. To tailor the TRE intervention to each individual and&#xD;
      harmonize their eating patterns in accordance to their chronotype, the investigators plan to&#xD;
      test early TRE vs. late TRE vs. active control in overweight and obese individuals with&#xD;
      morning chronotype.&#xD;
