    <intervention_name>PILATES EXERCISES</intervention_name>
    <description>The experimental group will receive Pilates exercises focusing on lower limb strength, flexibility and coordination in addition to exercises given to control group. Exercises or movements were done on a mat, on an exercise ball or in standing position while emphasizing on spinal and pelvic alignment, maintaining core contraction and the rhythm of respiration. All exercises were done for 10 repetitions with a rest period of two minutes before commencing the next exercise, and lasted for about 45 minutes. All the groups will receive the above mentioned interventions thrice in a week for a period of 10 week</description>
