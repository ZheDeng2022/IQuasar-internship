  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine, using a randomized trial with two parallel arms, whether&#xD;
      hedonic rewards (Arm 1) can be more effective than their cash equivalent (Arm 2) in&#xD;
      motivating participants to meet step goals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The evidence is overwhelming that sustained physical activity reduces risks for&#xD;
      non-communicable diseases, increases longevity, and reduces medical costs. Yet, the rates of&#xD;
      physical activity have been steadily decreasing such that physical inactivity is now the&#xD;
      fourth leading cause of death worldwide. In Singapore, 33% of adults are insufficiently&#xD;
      active despite Singapore being a highly walkable city with numerous subsidized&#xD;
      community-based physical activity programs. A review of the literature shows that, to date,&#xD;
      no study has directly compared cash versus hedonic rewards for health behavior change despite&#xD;
      theory suggesting hedonic rewards may work better. Furthermore, hedonic rewards can often be&#xD;
      purchased at lower cost than their cash equivalent. This makes hedonic rewards potentially&#xD;
      more cost-effective if they are proven to be at least as effective at increasing positive&#xD;
      behavior change compared to giving the same value in cash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, we aim to determine, using a randomized trial with two parallel arms, whether hedonic&#xD;
      rewards (Arm 1) can be more effective than their cash equivalent (Arm 2) in promoting&#xD;
      increases in physical activity, assessed via step counts measured by Fitbit, during a 6&#xD;
      calendar month intervention. We hypothesize that the average proportion of months meeting the&#xD;
      incentivized step target across participants will be greater for those in the hedonic&#xD;
      incentive arm as compared to those in the cash incentive arm (primary outcome).&#xD;
