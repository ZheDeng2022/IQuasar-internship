      For breast cancer patients who are candidates to receive chemotherapy, concurrent use of&#xD;
      temporary ovarian suppression with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) can be&#xD;
      offered as ovarian protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because ovarian stimulation for oocyte cryopreservation is usually performed using a GnRH&#xD;
      antagonist protocol and typically involves final oocyte maturation triggering with a GnRH&#xD;
      agonist, the investigators designed this study to explore the feasibility of combining the&#xD;
      final oocyte maturation trigger and the start of ovarian suppression. Short-term cotreatment&#xD;
      with GnRH antagonists is needed to induce rapid luteolysis (in view of prevention of ovarian&#xD;
      hyperstimulation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate the safety of GnRH agonist depot triggering followed by daily GnRH antagonist&#xD;
      luteolysis, this pilot study is set out to analyse the endocrine profile and ovarian&#xD;
      morphology of this novel protocol.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      For breast cancer patients who are candidates to receive chemotherapy, concurrent use of&#xD;
      temporary ovarian suppression with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) can be&#xD;
      offered as ovarian protection. A recent meta-analysis of individual patient data from the&#xD;
      largest randomised clinical trials in women with early breast cancer indicated beneficial&#xD;
      effects of GnRHa ovarian suppression in reducing POI risk and increasing post-chemotherapy&#xD;
      pregnancy rates with no negative effect on patients' outcomes. However, it should not be&#xD;
      considered as an alternative to cryopreservation strategies in fertility preservation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because ovarian stimulation for oocyte cryopreservation is usually performed using a GnRH&#xD;
      antagonist protocol and typically involves final oocyte maturation triggering with a GnRH&#xD;
      agonist, the investigators designed this study to explore the feasibility of combining the&#xD;
      final oocyte maturation trigger and the start of ovarian suppression. Replacement of the&#xD;
      0,2mg triptorelin trigger by a GnRH agonist depot has potential to provide this dual action.&#xD;
      However, the protracted action of the GnRH agonist depot will result in prolonged stimulation&#xD;
      of multiple corpora lutea, which will lead to enhanced production of steroids (estradiol and&#xD;
      progesterone) and growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor. Consequently,&#xD;
      GnRH agonist-induced stimulation of multiple corpora lutea is potentially unsafe in a patient&#xD;
      with breast cancer because of the impact of estradiol and progesterone on breast tumour&#xD;
      cells. In addition, VEGF may increase the risk of OHSS, which will lead to postponement of&#xD;
      cancer treatment. Therefore, short-term cotreatment with GnRH antagonists is needed to induce&#xD;
      rapid luteolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate the safety of GnRH agonist depot triggering followed by daily GnRH antagonist&#xD;
      luteolysis, this pilot study is set out to analyse the endocrine profile and ovarian&#xD;
      morphology of this novel protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized before start of stimulation to either DEPOT group (group A) or&#xD;
      control group (group B), only after patient eligibility has been established and patient&#xD;
      consent has been obtained.&#xD;

    <description>Ovarian stimulation will be performed using a fixed antagonist protocol with Follitropin Alfa (daily in the evening) and Ganirelix or Cetrorelix (daily in the morning). Selection of the daily gonadotropin dose will be based on ovarian reserve parameters (AMH and AFC) and BMI. Co-administration of 5 mg of letrozole daily (in the morning) commencing on the first day of gonadotropin administration and continuing throughout the ovarian stimulation will be performed as this reduces oestradiol concentrations. GnRH agonist Triptorelin 3.75 mg Depot form will be used for final oocyte maturation. Ganirelix/Cetrorelix 0.25mg daily (in the morning) will resume for 7 days from the evening of the day of oocyte retrieval onwards. Hormone analysis, analysis of haematology and biochemistry and a pelvic ultrasound scan will be done on days 3, 5 and 7 after oocyte retrieval.</description>

The first administration of Triptorelin 3.75mg depot will be scheduled on the first day of the menstrual cycle after oocyte retrieval. To prevent the flare-up produced by the GnRH agonist, daily doses of 0.25mg of Ganirelix/Cetrorelix will be given for seven days.</description>
