    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have histologically confirmed MIBC (T2-T4a, N0-N1, M0 per American&#xD;
             Joint Commission on Cancer [AJCC]) pure or mixed histology urothelial carcinoma.&#xD;
             Clinical node- positive (N1) patients are eligible provided the lymph nodes (LNs) are&#xD;
             within the planned surgical LN dissection template.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The initial TURBT that showed muscularis propria invasion should be within 90 days&#xD;
             prior to beginning study therapy. Participants must have sufficient baseline tumor&#xD;
             tissue from either initial or repeat TURBTs. The local site pathologist will be asked&#xD;

             sample (initial or repeat TURBT with highest tumor content) to document at least 20%&#xD;
             viable tumor content prior to registration. This is to ensure adequate tissue is&#xD;
             available to perform tumor infiltrating CD8+ T-cell assessment. (The actual CD8+ T&#xD;
             cell analysis will be done by a Central Laboratory and will not be done prior to&#xD;
             registration.)&#xD;

             clinical trial. Usage of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDS) for the&#xD;
             treatment of osteoarthritis and uric acid synthesis inhibitors for the treatment of&#xD;

             with other investigational agents not included in this trial throughout the duration&#xD;
             of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of excluded antiviral medication that cannot be suspended at least 14 days prior&#xD;
