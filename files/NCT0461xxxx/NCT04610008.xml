  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acquired pits of the optic nerve (APONs) are an area of focal loss of neural tissue&#xD;
      associated with a discrete area of depression/excavation within the optic cup at the level of&#xD;
      the lamina cribrosa. It is commonly associated with glaucoma and can be seen on the optic&#xD;
      disc when examining the back of a patient's eye. It causes a characteristic visual field&#xD;
      defect in the central 5-10 degrees of vision which has a significant impact of a patient's&#xD;
      daily activities. There is no treatment to restore vision once it has formed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies suggest mechanical stress across this part of the eye may have role in the&#xD;
      formation of APONs. The investigators therefore hypothesise that if a patient has a more&#xD;
      elliptical shaped optic disc, which would have more irregular mechanical stress across it, it&#xD;
      may have a higher risk of an APON forming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with glaucoma attending the ophthalmology department at University Hospital of Wales&#xD;
      have regular photographs taken of the optic nerve/optic disc as part of their routine&#xD;
      clinical care in order to monitor the condition. The research team, who are all practicing&#xD;
      ophthalmologists in the department, will review anonymised photographs to find optic discs&#xD;
      with APONs, and another group with glaucoma but no APONs to use as a control. The research&#xD;
      team will then measure the dimensions of the optic disc to determine if APONs are more common&#xD;
      in optic discs with a more elliptical shape. The patients' clinical notes will then need to&#xD;
      be accessed to collect data on the age, sex and diagnosis. This data will be anonymised using&#xD;
      ID numbers once collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final outcomes of the study will the average measured dimensions of the optic disc in&#xD;
      each group, and the position that the APON occurs.&#xD;
