  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this three-party collaboration, which includes The Texas Center for Pediatric and&#xD;
      Congenital Heart Disease, the Value Institute for Health and Care, and the Design Institute&#xD;
      for Health, all from University of Texas (UT) Dell Medical School, the investigators will&#xD;
      explore how patient insights, data, storytelling, ideation, and prototyping can be employed&#xD;
      to design a care delivery solution that enables patient outcome improvement. The goal of this&#xD;
      project is to understand the life journey of patients with single-ventricle congenital heart&#xD;
      disease and understand areas of that journey that can be improved. As such, the project&#xD;
      intentionally does not start with a hypothesis, but instead seeks to gain insight of&#xD;
      single-ventricle patients' care journey and based on that understanding identify&#xD;
      opportunities for improvement.&#xD;

      This collaborative research will utilize the Experience Group and Contextual Interview, two&#xD;
      qualitative research methodologies, in order to understand and improve patients' and families&#xD;
      with single-ventricle congenital heart disease (CHD) journey in care. There will be six main&#xD;
      groups participating in the study: 1. Patients age 6 and older with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      single-ventricle congenital heart disease; 2. Siblings (age 6 and older) of patients with&#xD;
      single-ventricle CHD; 3. Parents or legal guardians of patients with single-ventricle CHD&#xD;
      (regardless of patient age); 4. Pregnant parents who have a received a prenatal diagnosis of&#xD;
      single-ventricle CHD; 5. Parents of deceased patients with single-ventricle CHD; 6. Adult&#xD;
      partners of adult single-ventricle CHD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take part in an Experience Group. The Experience Group methodology is a&#xD;
      form of qualitative research that brings together a group of 4-8 people who share similar&#xD;
      medical circumstances for a conversation. This methodology has been successfully used by&#xD;
      researchers from the Value Institute for Health and Care to gain insights in different&#xD;
      patient populations. The groups will take place at Dell Medical School, The Dell Pediatric&#xD;
      Research Institute (across the street from Dell Children's Medical Center), or other&#xD;
      convenient public location as needed to allow for the least amount of travel for&#xD;
      participants. Each group lasts 60-90 minutes and encourages participants to discuss their&#xD;
      conditions and experiences outside the hospital/clinic, specifically. Focusing on the&#xD;
      lifestyle aspect of the patient experience enables insight into both the successes and the&#xD;
      challenges faced outside the health care system and in unobservable situations. Conversation&#xD;
      is encouraged by the facilitator, who offers topics such as &quot;what makes a good/bad day?&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;what are your aspirations, what are your fears?&quot;, and &quot;what are some of the obstacles and&#xD;
      burdens you face on a regular basis?&quot; Using a research approach that employs semi-structured,&#xD;
      open-ended questions directed towards the group as a whole, the investigators hope to learn&#xD;
      about the unarticulated, unmet needs of these patients, both physical and emotional, and&#xD;
      ranging both within and outside of the clinic. Participants will not be asked to take part in&#xD;
      more than one Experience Group session. Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, Experience&#xD;
      Group sessions will be held virtually via Zoom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can elect to participate in a follow-up Contextual Interview following the&#xD;
      Experience Groups. If the participants provide consent, they may be contacted for an&#xD;
      interview. Not every patient that consents for participation will be asked to participate.&#xD;
      Contextual Interviews will take place in participant's homes, or any other place of their&#xD;
      choosing where they feel comfortable. Contextual Interviews will be performed by up to three&#xD;
      personnel from the Design Institute for Health. The Design Institute has used this&#xD;
      methodology extensively to identify needs and insights from patients to redesign care. Upon&#xD;
      completion and approval of the optional model release part of the informed consent, audio&#xD;
      recordings and photos may be taken. The Contextual Interviews do not follow a rigid question&#xD;
      / answer scheme. Instead, their tone is conversational. Interview prompts will center around&#xD;
      challenges the patients and families faced in their journey with CHD. Example questions may&#xD;
      include, &quot;When did you first receive the diagnosis?&quot;, &quot;How do you feel about the care you&#xD;
      were receiving?&quot;, &quot;What, if anything, did the care team do to make you feel cared for?&quot;, &quot;How&#xD;
      did you feel about the location/environment?&quot;, and &quot;What, if anything could have been&#xD;
      different, improved or better for you?&quot; Participants will not be asked to take part in more&#xD;
      than one Contextual Interview session. Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, Contextual&#xD;
      Interviews will take place virtually via Zoom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, some participants will have the opportunity to take part in virtual workshops to&#xD;
      discuss the challenges uncovered in the Experience Groups and Contextual Interviews and&#xD;
      ideate potential solutions to such challenges. Workshops are ideation meetings lasting from a&#xD;
      few hours to a full day and would include stakeholders from all three collaborators and&#xD;
      patient and family representatives, if appropriate. Participants in workshops will be asked&#xD;
      to comment on research insights, participate in ideation sessions (brainstorms), sketch and&#xD;
      write up ideas and evaluate different service design concepts.&#xD;

    <description>This is a qualitative research study. The investigators are using a combination of Experience Group sessions, Contextual Interviews and workshops with patients and their family members to obtain information to identify areas of the lifelong journey of patient with single-ventricle congenital heart disease and their families that can be redesigned to improve the outcomes that matter most to the patients and their families</description>
