  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical trial, an un-controlled, repeated measures open design with within-subject&#xD;
      comparison will be used to evaluate the effect of the device under investigation on sound&#xD;
      perception. This design was shown to be successful in previous studies for the evaluation of&#xD;
      sound coding strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, a within-subject comparison decreases the variance in the results allowing for&#xD;
      fewer subjects when the population using the investigational device is not large in general.&#xD;

      The primary endpoint of this clinical investigation is the difference in speech&#xD;
      intelligibility measured in percent correct with AutoZoomControl compared to an&#xD;
      omnidirectional microphone on Naída M hearing devices.The Naída CI M90 sound processor is a&#xD;
      behind-the-ear (BTE) sound processor based on the Phonak Marvel hearing aid platform. It&#xD;
      replaces the market approved Naída CI Q-Series processors. The Naída Link M90 hearing aid is&#xD;
      a behind-the-ear (BTE) hearing aid based on the Phonak Marvel hearing aid platform. It is&#xD;
      especially designed to be used for bimodal CI users equipped with a Naída CI M90 sound&#xD;
      processor.&#xD;

        The intended users of the Naída M hearing system are people who suffer from profound&#xD;
        sensorineural hearing losses up to complete deafness. The users could be recipients that&#xD;
        are already users of an Advanced Bionics CI but also people who suffer from deafness or&#xD;
        profound hearing loss and were not previously equipped with a hearing device. In case of&#xD;
        contralateral acoustic hearing, the user might use a Naída CI M90 on the side with profound&#xD;
        sensorineural hearing loss and a Naída Link M90 as a hearing aid on the contralateral side&#xD;
        to aid the residual acoustic hearing.&#xD;
