  <brief_summary>

      A randomized controlled trial will be performed in geriatric inpatients to investigate the&#xD;
      impact of a multifaceted clinical pharmacy intervention on health related outcomes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since drug-related harm remains persistently prevalent in older adults, there is an urgent&#xD;
      and unmet clinical need to optimize pharmacotherapy both during hospital stay and after&#xD;
      discharge Therefore, we aim to perform a randomized controlled trial in geriatric inpatients&#xD;
      to investigate the impact of a multifaceted clinical pharmacy intervention on health related&#xD;
      outcomes. The primary objective is to reduce all-cause unplanned hospital visits in geriatric&#xD;
      inpatients. Secondary objective are to optimize drug therapy in geriatric inpatients and&#xD;
      improve their health; To empower and educate patients, caregivers,community pharmacists and&#xD;
      physicians regarding drug regimen decisions to maximize therapy adherence and the&#xD;
      understanding of the (de)prescribing process and to enhance healthy ageing; To optimize&#xD;
      transitional care from the hospital to primary care.&#xD;

    <description>No pharmacist will be actively involved in the medication review, counseling or discharge and post-discharge procedure. In both groups the best possible preadmission drug list will be compiled for inpatients within 72 hours after admission to the geriatric ward. If potentially dangerous or life-threatening drug errors are observed in the usual care group, this will be communicated to the treating physician</description>

    <description>The clinical pharmacist-collaborative service in the intervention group comprises six steps based on the clinical pharmacy intervention proposal of Van der Linden et al (Drugs Aging 2020).&#xD;
The first three steps focus on optimizing the drug therapy of geriatric inpatients. The remaining steps target a safe transition from the hospital to the community.</description>
