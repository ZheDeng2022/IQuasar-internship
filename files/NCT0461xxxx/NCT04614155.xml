    <textblock>
      This trial studies if Project Self can improve the rate of cervical cancer screening in&#xD;
      Hispanic and African American women living in Houston, Texas. Project Self may help to&#xD;
      improve cervical cancer screening rates by providing human papillomavirus (HPV)&#xD;
      self-collection kits, education, counseling, and navigation.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine the feasibility of conducting an education intervention trial regarding&#xD;
      cervical cancer screening among women of Hispanic and African American origin living in&#xD;
      public housing units in Houston, Texas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Document cervical screening associated knowledge, attitudes and practices among Hispanic&#xD;
      and African American women living in public housing units in Houston, Texas at pre- and&#xD;
      post-health education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Document Pap smear screening rate in last 3 years among participants. III. Document HPV&#xD;
      positive rate among participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants complete questionnaires, take part in a health education session, and receive an&#xD;
      HPV self-collection kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 1 month.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cervical screening associated knowledge, attitudes and practices score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests will be used to examine the change of the scores difference for cervical screening associated knowledge, attitudes and practices. For every participant, 'Knowledge' will be measured using a 12-question scale, which will have a 'Yes/No/Unsure' response. Each 'correct' response will be scored as 1, while 'incorrect' and 'unsure' as 0. A score 50% (â‰¥6 correct responses) will be considered as optimal. 'Attitude' will be measured using a 6-question scale which will have 'Disagree/Neutral/Agree response. Attitude will be considered as favorable if we have three or more &quot;Agree&quot; responses. Being screened, before our education-intervention, for cervical cancer with Pap-smear, and after our intervention either with HPV self-sampling or Pap-smear, will be regarded as having good practice. Changes in Knowledge, Attitude and Practice, pre- and post-education intervention will be examined using Paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.</description>
