  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesizes that mothers who are both breastfeeding and pumping in the first days&#xD;
      report improved comfort levels with the new Symphony program card INITIATE 2.0 compared to&#xD;
      the standard of care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate whether the proposed changes to the INITIATE 2.0 program card&#xD;
      lead to an improvement in comfort during pumping as well as increased milk removal during a&#xD;
      pumping session. The results of this study will provide important information that a)&#xD;
      validates the proposed changes as well as b) builds clear recommendations for which vacuum&#xD;
      level should be used for Symphony program cards in this population.&#xD;
