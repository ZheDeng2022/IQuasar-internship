      Our primary aim of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of a teacher training&#xD;
      programme to teach mindfulness as part of regular classroom teaching in the total population&#xD;
      of students in Danish upper secondary schools and schools of health and social care,&#xD;
      respectively, on students' self-reported mental health at six-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our secondary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the teacher training programme to teach&#xD;
      mindfulness in a vulnerable subgroup of students on their self-reported mental health at&#xD;
      three and six months after baseline.&#xD;

      The study is designed as a pragmatic cluster randomised two-arm trial including 43 Danish&#xD;
      schools (30 upper secondary schools and 13 schools of health and social care). The schools&#xD;
      included a total of 76 school teachers for teacher training (44 teachers from upper secondary&#xD;
      schools and 32 teachers from schools of health and social care). Each included teacher will&#xD;
      be asked to recruit a class of students (15-30 students) to test the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      modified MBSR programme (in total approx. 1.000 students).&#xD;
