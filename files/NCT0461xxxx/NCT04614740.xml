    <textblock>
      Dose-escalation study will be conducted in patients with locally advanced/metastatic solid&#xD;
      tumors who have failed standard treatment, or cannot tolerate standard treatment, or have no&#xD;
      recommended standard treatment, or do not apply standard treatment, to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      PK, tolerability and effectiveness of VC004. According to the efficacy, safety and PK of&#xD;
      dose-escalation study , the investigator and the sponsor jointly determine the dose for dose&#xD;
      extension, and evaluate the anti-tumor effect of VC004 on NTRK fusion-positive subjects, and&#xD;
      provide more information for RP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the tolerability and pharmacokinetic results of dose-escalation study , an&#xD;
      appropriate dose or MTD will be selected, namely RP2D, to further assess anti-tumor efficacy&#xD;
      and safety in patients with NTRK fusion-positive locally advanced/metastatic solid tumors .&#xD;
      ORR will be chosen as the main efficacy indicator to evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of VC004 .&#xD;
