      The aim of this study is to measure the additional effects of thoracic manipulation on pain&#xD;
      and restricted shoulder mobility and reducing disability in patients with adhesive&#xD;
      capsulitis. A randomized control trail is conducting at Helping hand institute of&#xD;
      rehabilitation sciences Mansehra. Patients diagnosed with frozen shoulder were randomized&#xD;
      into 2 groups i.e. Group A (n=16) and Group B(n=16) with the help of lottery method. Group A&#xD;
      would receive conventional therapy including hot pack, transcutaneous electrical nerve&#xD;
      stimulation, stretches and facilitation techniques Group B would receive thoracic&#xD;
      manipulation along with hot pack and TENS, stretches and facilitation techniques. The total&#xD;
      treatment time is 2 weeks with three sessions per week making a total of 6 sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment on 1st visit. 2nd assessment on 6th visit. 3rd assessment on follow up&#xD;
      after 3 weeks would be done. The study duration is 6 months. Purposive non probability&#xD;
      sampling technique applied. Only 40 to 60 years participants with adhesive capsulitis are&#xD;
      including in this trial. Tools use in this study are visual analogue scale (VAS), bubble&#xD;
      inclinometer and (disability of arm, shoulder and hand) questionnaire. Data analyzed through&#xD;
      statistical package of social sciences version 25.&#xD;

      Frozen shoulder is a widespread disabling condition which causes significant disability. In&#xD;
      spite of hundred years of treating this condition the clarity, diagnosis, pathology and most&#xD;
      effectual treatments are still need to be explored.It is characterized by the impulsive onset&#xD;
      of pain, inflexibility and restricted range of motion at the shoulder joint. The&#xD;
      pathophysiology of frozen shoulder is not exactly known. However it is generally supposed&#xD;
      that a combination of contracture of capsule, rotator cuff tendon fibrosis, sub-scapular&#xD;
      depression and the coraco-humeral ligament lead to comprehensive movement restriction at the&#xD;
      glenohumeral joint. Frozen shoulder is considered to have an occurrence of 3%-5% in the&#xD;
      common population and up to 20% in those with diabetes mellitus. Between the ages of 40 and&#xD;
      60 it is most prevalent and is almost not found in ages below that and in persons who work&#xD;
      manually. It is somewhat more common in women then man. Bilateral frozen shoulder occurs in&#xD;
      14% of population and up to 20% of population will develop some degree of related symptoms in&#xD;
      the other shoulder. the most common associated risk factor for developing the frozen shoulder&#xD;
      is diabetes mellitus, and a patient with diabetes has 10%-20% risk of developing frozen&#xD;
      shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thoracic spine manipulation has received growing attention in treating the patients with&#xD;
      shoulder pain. Recent studies have shown that thoracic manipulation is an effective&#xD;
      combination therapy for patients with shoulder pain. The position of thoracic spine&#xD;
      significantly have an effect on shoulder joint and shoulder kinematics during movement on&#xD;
      different planes as there is decreased muscle force when a person is in a slouch position.&#xD;
      Thoracic Spine manipulation is a treatment choice by the number of health professionals&#xD;
      especially the physical therapist. Literature defines thoracic manipulation as highly&#xD;
      practiced and skilled passive thrust to joints and adjacent structures and soft tissues at&#xD;
      variable intensity consisting of small amplitude and high velocity therapeutic movements at&#xD;
      thoracic spine including cervicothoracic junction. Much of the recent studies are focusing on&#xD;
      the relationship of thoracic spine to other body regions such as neck and shoulder rather&#xD;
      than thoracic spine itself this phenomenon is described as regional interdependence.although&#xD;
      cervical spine manipulation has also improve pain and disability in patients with&#xD;
      non-specific shoulder pain but have some evidence of thrust complications relating to&#xD;
      cervical spine. Similar neurophysiologic associations are documented with thoracic spine&#xD;
      manipulation in relation with shoulder pain with less complications and thrust risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal manipulation of the thoracic spine can be an effective intervention for treating&#xD;
      patients with shoulder pain or dysfunctions. Treatment protocols focusing the thoracic spine&#xD;
      must be added to the intervention of rehabilitation of patients with shoulder pain in&#xD;
      clinical practice. In common clinical practice a series of thoracic hypomobility has been&#xD;
      noticed at the T1-T3 spinal segments or the T3-T5 segments in patients with shoulder&#xD;
      pathologies. In literature manipulation of thoracic regions has been shown to produce&#xD;
      improvement in upper extremity blood flow and circulation. Researches related to thoracic&#xD;
      spine manipulation is signifying a association between manipulation of the thoracic spine and&#xD;
      enhancement in shoulder function and potency. Thus the purpose of the study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the possible effect of thoracic manipulation on shoulder range of motion and function in&#xD;
      combination with conventional intervention for the individuals with frozen shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thoracic spine thrust manipulation provided a statistically significant decrease in&#xD;
      self-reported pain measures and disability in patients with Shoulder impingement syndrome.&#xD;
      Thoracic spine and upper rib manipulative therapy is associated with improvement in shoulder&#xD;
      pain and ROM immediately following intervention in patients with a primary complaint of&#xD;
      shoulder pain. Thoracic spine manual therapy accelerated recovery and reduced pain and&#xD;
      disability in patients having nonspecific shoulder pain (NSSP). Thoracic and rib manipulation&#xD;
      is effective in relieving pain and improving range of motions and reducing disability in&#xD;
      frozen shoulder patients. Cervical thoracic junction and upper thoracic spine manipulations&#xD;
      in combination with traditional physical therapy will decrease pain, increase range of&#xD;
      motion, and increase function in patients suffering from internal impingement syndrome more&#xD;
      than patients who received traditional physical therapy treatment and posterior and inferior&#xD;
      mobilization.&#xD;
