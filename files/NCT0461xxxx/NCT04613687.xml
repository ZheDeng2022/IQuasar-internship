  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and the safety of the new&#xD;
      compression system URGO BD001 in the management of venous or mixed predominantly venous leg&#xD;
      ulcers. The therapeutic efficacy will be the reduction in wound surface area during a six&#xD;
      weeks study treatment period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The compression bandage URGO BD001 is indicated for the management of venous leg ulcers with&#xD;
      ABPI (Ankle Brachial Pressure Index) ≥ 0.8, venous oedema and lymphedema justifying strong&#xD;
      compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pressure applied with the compression system URGO BD001 help to improve venous return and&#xD;
      to reduce venous oedema. The expected clinical benefits from the compression system URGO&#xD;
      BD001 in patient with a VLU are to increase healing rate and time to healing, and to improve&#xD;
      patient quality of life.&#xD;
