  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assessment of common carotid artery flow is more easily done and can be taught more broadly&#xD;
      than transthoracic echocardiography, providing a greater number of clinicians a tool to&#xD;
      assess volume responsiveness. These assessments are of great importance to patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19, who often present with hypotension requiring fluids, which must be balanced against&#xD;
      limiting fluid administration to minimize pulmonary edema.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Optimizing volume status for patients in shock is of critical importance to their outcomes,&#xD;
      both in the provision of helpful, and avoidance of harmful fluid volumes. As such, much work&#xD;
      has been done to develop and assess measures of volume responsiveness; that is, tests that&#xD;
      indicate whether additional fluid administration will increase cardiac output by at least&#xD;
      10%. The passive leg raise (PLR) providing a reversible &quot;auto-bolus&quot; has been demonstrated to&#xD;
      be the most predictive assessment of fluid responsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies of changes in carotid artery blood flow suggest it can be used as a surrogate&#xD;
      for changes in cardiac output with moderate reliability. This has been assessed in several&#xD;
      populations with anticipated changes in volume status (e.g. before/after blood donation), and&#xD;
      more recently assessed by Sidor et al. against several preload augmenting maneuvers.&#xD;
      Interestingly, while decreasing preload resulted in a decrease in cardiac output and systolic&#xD;
      carotid blood flow, it did not result in a decrease in corrected carotid flow time, although&#xD;
      a PLR produced an expected increase in all measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study we seek to validate these results, questioning if there is a lower limit of&#xD;
      corrected carotid flow time that de-couples the relationship between carotid systolic flow&#xD;
      and corrected carotid flow time.&#xD;

    <description>Cardiac output will be assessed by measuring the LVOT diameter in parasternal long-axis window and the LVOT VTI in apical-four window. Carotid artery flow will be measured on the right neck 1-2cm from the bifurcation of the common carotid artery. All measurements will be taken with participants supine and the head of the bed elevated to 45°. measures all at 3 minute intervals.&#xD;
One-leg compression test: Thigh-sized blood pressure cuff inflated to 60mmHg on middle part of one thigh for 60 seconds. LVOT and CCA measurements taken separately.&#xD;
Two-leg compression test: Thigh-sized blood pressure cuff inflated on middle part of both thighs for 60 seconds. LVOT and CCA measurements taken separately.&#xD;
Passive leg raise test: Bed adjusted to place participant at 0° and legs elevated at 45° by use of pillows. After 1 minute, measurements repeated. LVOT and CCA measurements taken separately.</description>
