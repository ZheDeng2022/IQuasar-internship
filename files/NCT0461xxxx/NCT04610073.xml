    <textblock>
      In this single blind randomized controlled trial, 153 eligible nurses working in hospitals&#xD;
      during 2019 were enrolled. The participants were randomly allocated into three parallel&#xD;
      groups: interactive multimedia (n=55), illustrated booklet (n= 55), and the control (n= 43).&#xD;
      The study samples were blinded to intervention and control groups. A researcher-made&#xD;
      questionnaire was completed by the eligible subjects before, after, and four weeks after the&#xD;
      intervention to assess their knowledge, attitude and behavior in preventing chronic lower&#xD;
      back pain amongst working nurses.&#xD;
