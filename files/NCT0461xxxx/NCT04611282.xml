  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of microsurgical and macrosurgical&#xD;
      approaches on CPFs plus SCTGs for the treatment of localized gingival recession defects&#xD;
      (Miller class I or II) over the course of 6 months based on clinical periodontal parameters,&#xD;
      periodontal phenotypes, and the postoperative complaints and satisfaction levels of the&#xD;
      patients. We hypothesized that root coverage achieved through microsurgery in Miller I or II&#xD;
      gingival recessions would improve clinical periodontal outcomes and the periodontal&#xD;
      phenotype, with greater postoperative comfort and aesthetic satisfaction in comparison with&#xD;
      conventional macrosurgical techniques. Miller Class I and II gingival recession defects, at&#xD;
      least 3.0 mm deep, were selected and randomly assigned to receive micro or macrosurgical&#xD;
      techniques. Both techniques were performed using a coronally positioned flap with a&#xD;
      subepithelial connective tissue graft. Plaque and gingival indices, gingival recession depth&#xD;
      and width, probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing, clinical attachment level, width of&#xD;
      keratinized gingiva, aesthetic score and percentage of root coverage, postoperative&#xD;
      complaints, and satisfaction of the participants completing the study were evaluated at&#xD;
      follow-up 1st, 3rd and 6th months.&#xD;

    <description>A visual analog scale was used to evaluate postoperative complaints regarding the recipient and donor sites according to graft size and postoperative satisfaction values (level of the gingival margin, gingival tissue color, dentin hypersensitivity, and root coverage) during the follow-up period. A 10 cm VAS, with &quot;none&quot; / &quot;unhappy&quot; at the left end and &quot;unbearable&quot; / &quot;happy&quot; at the right end was prepared for each patient.</description>
