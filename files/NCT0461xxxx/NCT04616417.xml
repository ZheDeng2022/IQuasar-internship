      This is a prospective study to assess the long term benefits and outcomes of the existing&#xD;
      oocyte cryopreservation methods for fertility preservation in women with a potential medical&#xD;
      or non medical risk of loss of fertility. Women wishing to preserve their oocytes using&#xD;
      cryopreservation will be informed of the risk and limitations of the procedures involved in&#xD;
      ovarian hyperstimulation, oocyte recovery, cryopreservation and subsequent viability after&#xD;
      warming. Women who consent to the procedure will undergo standard controlled ovarian&#xD;
      hyperstimulation (COH) and oocyte retrieval procedures currently in use for IVF. Following&#xD;
      harvest all eggs obtained will be evaluated for degree of fragmentation and maturation&#xD;
      status. The oocytes will be cryopreserved using kits of media and devices currently approved&#xD;
      for use in the vitrification of fertilized eggs and embryos, and the cryopreserved oocytes&#xD;
      will be stored for future patient use in a long term storage facility in Minnesota (Reprotech&#xD;
      Ltd.). Patients with stored oocytes will be contacted annually to determine the outcome of&#xD;
      any oocyte warming procedures (oocyte thawing, fertilization and embryo transfer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will obtain a structured fertility focused quality of life questionnaire (FertiQol) and&#xD;
      survey to assess one year after harvest the impact of the process. We will compare cancer&#xD;
      patients to those patients undergoing oocyte cryopreservation for non-medical reasons&#xD;

    <description>All subjects will undergo controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. They will be treated with variable dosages of injectable gonadotrophins over a period of 8 to 12 days. Response will be monitored using vaginal ultrasound and serum estradiol levels. When appropriate follicle maturation has been achieved, a single dose of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) will be administered to induce final oocyte maturation. Thirty-six hours after hCG administration, the subject will undergo standard transvaginal oocyte retrieval under ultrasound guidance. The procedure takes approximately 20 minutes and is carried out under conscious sedation with Fentanyl and Versed. The oocytes are immediately handed off to the embryology technicians in the IVF laboratory.</description>
