      This mixed-methods, two-arm, randomized controlled trial will evaluate the impact of&#xD;
      Motivational Interviewing (MI) as a follow-up care to patients who received fall prevention&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this mixed-methods, two-arm, randomized controlled trial of MI intervention for&#xD;
      fall prevention is to evaluate the impact of Motivational Interviewing (MI) as a follow-up&#xD;
      care to patients who received fall prevention recommendations at Oregon Health &amp; Science&#xD;
      University Internal Medicine and Geriatrics Clinic provided over 12-months. Older adult&#xD;
      participants (older than 65) who are at increased risk for falling will be enrolled into the&#xD;
      study. Patients will be randomly assigned to two groups: MI and the standard of care group.&#xD;
      All participants will have a baseline and 6-months study visit that will include self-report&#xD;
      and physiologic assessment. In addition, all participants will receive study measurement&#xD;
      phone call at 3-, and 12-months. MI will be provided via video, phone, or in-person one week&#xD;
      after the initial visit and then monthly for 6 months. All MI sessions will be recorded and&#xD;
      encounter notes will be completed. Purposefully selected participants' MI sessions will be&#xD;
      transcribed for qualitative analysis.&#xD;

    <measure>Measure change with patient engagement with fall prevention recommendations questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3-months, 6-months, and 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>A 64-item, 1-10 self-report rating to measure patient engagement with fall prevention recommendations (medication, exercise, blood pressure, vision, and environment). Higher value indicates more confidence in making change in the future.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure change with Falls Self-Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3-months, 6-months, and 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>A 7-item scale, 1-4 self-report rating, widely used to measure levels of concern related to preventing falls. Minimum value is 0 and maximum value is 28. Higher FES-I scores is a worse value since it has been positively correlated with decreased activities, future falls, and injury.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure change with Fall Behavioral (FAB) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3-months, 6-months, and 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>A 24-item, 1-4 self-report rating to measure frequency of protective strategies to prevent falling and risky behaviors that facilitate a fall. Minimum value is 0 and maximum value is 4. Higher FAB score is a better value since it indicates more consistent fall protective behaviors.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure change with 4-stage balance physiologic assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-months, 6-months, and 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>Duration that participants can hold 4 different standing positions will be measured. Minimum value is 0 seconds and maximum score is 10 seconds. Higher value is a better value since it is indicative of participants' ability to hold balance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure change with 30-second sit-to-stand physiologic assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-months, 6-months, and 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>Instances that participants can stand from a sitting position will be measured. Minimum value is 0 times. Higher value is a better value since it is indicative of participants' ability to sit-to-stand.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure change with Patient Activation Measure scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-months, 6-months, and 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>100-point, quantifiable scale determining patient engagement in healthcare. Minimum value is 0 and the maximum value is 100. Higher value is a better value since it is indicative of participant's activation with their healthcare.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure change with self-reported fall rates</measure>
    <time_frame>Monthly for 1-year</time_frame>
    <description>Mail-in monthly fall dairy. Count of falls per month. Minimum value is 0. Higher value is worse value since it is indicative that participants are falling frequently.</description>

    <description>The MI experimental group will receive all the same measurements as the control group, and in addition, receive MI-based communication about fall prevention at eight occasions during the 12-month period. MI is an evidence-based communication approach for various health behavior change.</description>

    <description>The PI and two study staff members (interventionists) will conduct study visits and phone calls. The same person will complete participant follow-ups to establish rapport and consistency. All of the study encounters will be audio recorded with participants' permission and study encounter notes will be completed by the interventionist. Interventionists will facilitate MI sessions using the MI guide and a participant handout. The goal of each MI session is to identify a specific fall prevention behavior, the participant's goal with this behavior, readiness to change, specific plan to move toward the goal, barriers and facilitators, and the participant's commitment level to change.</description>
