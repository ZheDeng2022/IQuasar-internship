  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study intervention provides an innovative way of making exercise training and other&#xD;
      recommended lifestyle modifications as accessible as possible for knee and hip OA&#xD;
      participants by introducing a home-based exercise training program with a motion track&#xD;
      feedback technology. Self-management of the pain for the patients suffering osteoarthritis,&#xD;
      in the form of lifestyle modification, implementation of coping strategies and exercise is&#xD;
      part of recommendations of recent international guidelines such as those by the&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI). Cost and resource constraints&#xD;
      typically limit the access to these recommended therapies. Moreover, the study intervention&#xD;
      is focused on maintaining and adapting everyday physical activity, as required, in comparison&#xD;
      to the control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful, degenerative disease of the affected joints. According to&#xD;
      surveys by the World Health Organization (WHO) knee and hip joint OA is one of the diseases&#xD;
      that make up the largest proportion of all disability diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the individual patient level, there is a pronounced limitation of the quality of life,&#xD;
      which can also lead to the development of secondary diseases. There are numerous methods&#xD;
      available for the treatment of OA, the spectrum of which ranges from conservative measures&#xD;
      such as physical therapy or medical procedures up to surgical procedures, especially joint&#xD;
      replacement. In recent years, the number of prostheses implanted in knee and hip joints has&#xD;
      increased significantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      International guidelines such as those of the American College of Rheumatologists recommend&#xD;
      conservative treatment of OA of the knee and hip joint with physical therapy.&#xD;
      Multidisciplinary approaches include aerobic and anaerobic exercise training, in particular&#xD;
      with the aim of weight loss in overweight participants, participant education for&#xD;
      self-management of the disease and the consideration of psychosocial factors. This&#xD;
      comprehensive, structured, conservative program for the treatment of OA achieves&#xD;
      significantly better results than the standard treatment. However, comparable programs, which&#xD;
      offer comprehensive management of OA are not widely available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital therapies represent a novel approach to help patients manage themselves and their&#xD;
      diseases in a home setting and even show better results than current standard therapies. An&#xD;
      analysis of a smartphone intervention providing a multidisciplinary approach for&#xD;
      self-management of lower back pain, the Kaia Back Pain Relief app, shows promising results in&#xD;
      180 users with a significant and clinically relevant reduction of pain levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these promising results, this study will evaluate the effectiveness of the Kaia Knee&#xD;
      and Hip pain app intervention in comparison to usual medical care in reducing pain and&#xD;
      disease-related symptoms in participants with OA over 3 months.&#xD;

    <description>The Kaia Knee and Hip pain app software, when loaded onto a smartphone, recommends to the participant specific exercises for the lower extremity. Using the camera on a smartphone, the software then tracks the participant's movements as the participant performs the exercises, analyzes those movements using machine learning, and provides audio-visual feedback to the participant. The exercise therapy is augmented by educational content and cognitive behavioral therapy to provide a multidisciplinary approach to self-management of osteoarthritis. Behavioral Health Coaches ensure participant motivation throughout the program based on a predefined curriculum.</description>
