&#xD;
        2. Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The study is designed as a single arm and opened phase IIa clinical trial, so as to&#xD;
                investigate the safety and efficacy of CN128.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A total of 50 eligible subjects are planned to be enrolled, and orally&#xD;
                administration of CN128 for 24 weeks or 48 weeks according to the administration&#xD;
                plan. The treatment period is from day 0 to 24 weeks, and the extended treatment&#xD;
                period was from 25 weeks to 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Administration plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The trial will start with the lower dose of CN128 (10 mg/kg body weight [bw], bid) for&#xD;
           two weeks, then the subjects will return to the study center. If no unacceptable&#xD;
           toxicity associated with CN128 is found, the subjects will be given the higher dose (15&#xD;
           mg/kg body weight [bw], bid). If unacceptable toxicity associated with CN128 is found,&#xD;
           the subjects will be suspended or stopped administration. If the adverse event turns to&#xD;
           normal or abnormal but no clinical significance after suspension administration, the&#xD;
           subjects will be given the lower dose of CN128 (10 mg/kg body weight [bw], bid). After&#xD;
           taking CN128 at 15 mg/kg, if unacceptable toxicity associated with CN128 is found, the&#xD;
           dosage will be reduce to 10 mg/kg. If no symptoms appear, the dose can be increased to&#xD;
           15 mg/kg. If the unacceptable toxicity related to CN128 still occurs, the subjects will&#xD;
           be suspended or stopped administration. If the adverse event turns to normal or abnormal&#xD;
           but no clinical significance after suspension administration, the subjects will be given&#xD;
           the lower dose of CN128 (10 mg/kg body weight [bw], bid). The dose will be assessed once&#xD;
           every two or four weeks.&#xD;
