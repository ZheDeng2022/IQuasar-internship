             of hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT), ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC), endometrioid&#xD;
             ovarian carcinoma (EOC) or endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (EEC) with confirmed&#xD;
             mutations in one of the SWI/SNF genes (SMARCA4, ARID1A) will be enrolled in this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;

             lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have provided archival tumor tissue sample or a newly obtained core or excisional&#xD;
