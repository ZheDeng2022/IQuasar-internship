      This study will comprise of two phases, an observational phase and a treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the observational phase the specific aims are: 1. To determine the presence and regional&#xD;
      distribution of microglial activation, as assessed by 18F-PBR06 PET, in subjects with MSA as&#xD;
      compared to healthy controls, at baseline and at 6-9 months' follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. To assess the relationship between microglial activation and clinical progression at&#xD;
      baseline and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the treatment phase the specific aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess whether verdiperstat (BHV-3241) reduces 18F-PBR06 PET signal, and thus&#xD;
           microglial activation and inflammation, in well-characterized MSA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the relationship between PET changes and clinical progression at baseline and&#xD;
           follow-up in patients treated with verdiperstat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the relationship between PET changes and volumetric brain MRI at baseline and&#xD;
           follow-up in patients treated with verdiperstat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there is no known disease modifying therapy for MSA. Recently, the drug&#xD;
      verdiperstat (BHV-3241) has appeared in the investigational arena specifically for the&#xD;
      indication of Multiple System Atrophy. Verdiperstat (BHV-3241) is currently being used in a&#xD;
      phase 3 active drug trial at Massachusetts Hospital. Verdiperstat (BHV-3241) is known to&#xD;
      target Myeloperoxidase, an enzyme implicated in neuroinflammation, a major driver in disease&#xD;
      pathogenesis. Our previous study (IRB protocol #2016P002373) demonstrated that applying TSPO&#xD;
      (translator protein) PET imaging enabled us to track changes in neuroinflammation and thus&#xD;
      provide a viable biomarker for disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study, the investigators aim to assess the effect of an investigational drug,&#xD;
      verdiperstat (BHV-3241) on microglial activation in MSA patients using [F-18]PBR06 and to&#xD;
      link it with clinical and morphometric MRI brain changes following treatment.&#xD;

      The investigators propose to use a novel TSPO PET ligand, 18F-PBR06&#xD;
      ((18)F-N-fluoroacetyl-N-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-2-phenoxyaniline), to assess microglial&#xD;
      activation in MSA subjects in response to treatment with verdiperstat.16 [F-18]PBR06 is an&#xD;
      arlyoxyanilide-based, second generation TSPO PET ligand that has been demonstrated to have&#xD;
      &gt;90% specific binding to their TSPO target in monkey brain.11 It has already been used in&#xD;
      humans in dosimetry studies17 and for studies assessing its pharmacokinetic and imaging&#xD;
      characteristics in humans16 but has never before been used in MSA subjects until our previous&#xD;
      study, IRB protocol #2016P002373. This study will provide a unique opportunity to assess the&#xD;
      utility of a novel TSPO PET ligand that has a longer radioisotope half life (approximately,&#xD;
      110 minutes) and hence, has the potential for widespread use depending upon the results of&#xD;
      this study. Assessing clinical response in chronic neurodegenerative diseases can be&#xD;
      challenging and objective biomarkers are urgently needed. This study would provide pilot data&#xD;
      to inform future potential studies using [F-18]PBR06-PET for assessing prognostication,&#xD;
      treatment response and drug development for MSA subjects.The investigators intend to recruit&#xD;
      MSA patients, one subset for whom the investigators know the longitudinal trajectory of&#xD;
      microglial activation changes because of prior participation in IRB protocol # 2016P002373.&#xD;
      This will allow us to compare the effects of verdiperstat (BHV-3241) in a well characterized&#xD;
      population with each patient serving as his/her own control. To be clear, patients who were&#xD;
      not a part of the IRB protocol #2016P002373 will also be offered the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to recruit MSA patients in whom the longitudinal trajectory of&#xD;
      microglial activation changes has already been determined in IRB protocol # 2016P002373. This&#xD;
      will allow us to compare the effects of verdiperstat (BHV-3241) in a well characterized&#xD;
      population with each patient serving as his/her own control. However, patients who were not a&#xD;
      part of the IRB protocol #2016P002373 will also be offered the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit 8 MSA subjects with previously completed [F-18]PBR06 PET&#xD;
      imaging (for protocol #2016P002373) to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to include patients with probable MSA as defined by the following&#xD;
      criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Autonomic failure involving urinary incontinence (inability to control the release of&#xD;
           urine form the bladder, with erectile dysfunction in males) or an orthostatic decrease&#xD;
           of blood pressure within 3 min of standing by at least 30 mmHg systolic or 15 mm Hg&#xD;
           diastolic and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Poorly levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism (bradykinesia with rigidity, tremor, or postural&#xD;
           instability) or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A cerebellar syndrome (gait ataxia with cerebellar dysarthria, limb ataxia, or&#xD;
           cerebellar oculomotor dysfunction) Subjects will be recruited during routine clinical&#xD;
           appointments by their physician or one of the other co-investigators listed on the&#xD;
           protocol at the Movement Disorders Clinic, 60 Fenwood Road, Boston, MA. All established&#xD;
           MSA patients of the Movement Disorders Clinic will be sent a letter describing the study&#xD;
           and a copy of the consent form.&#xD;
