  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Implant placement in the posterior part of the maxilla is frequently compromised or&#xD;
      impossible due to atrophy of the alveolar process and pneumatisation of the maxillary sinus.&#xD;
      Therefore, alveolar ridge augmentation is frequently necessary before or in conjunction with&#xD;
      implant placement. The most commonly used method to augment the maxillary premolar and molar&#xD;
      region involves the maxillary sinus floor augmentation applying the lateral window technique&#xD;
      with a grafting material. However, the lateral window technique is associated with prolonged&#xD;
      patient treatment time and increased morbidity. Thus, osteotome-mediated sinus floor&#xD;
      elevation (OSFE) with or without the use of a grafting material has been advocated, when the&#xD;
      residual bone height is more than 6 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OSFE involves preparation of implant site through the use of concave osteotomes and elevation&#xD;
      of the maxillary sinus floor. The survival of suprastructure and implants after OSFE with or&#xD;
      without the use of a grafting material has never been assessed in long-term randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials. A long-term study concluded that OSFE with no grafting material is a&#xD;
      predictable treatment modality. High short-term implant survival rates after OSFE with or&#xD;
      without the use of a grafting material have been reported in systematic reviews. However, the&#xD;
      amount of new bone formation after OSFE with the use of a grafting material is significantly&#xD;
      higher compared to the use of no grafting material, as documented in a systematic review.&#xD;
      Harvesting of autogenous bone graft is associated with risk of donor site morbidity and bone&#xD;
      substitutes of natural transplants involves a risk of contamination, activation of host&#xD;
      immune system and disease transmission as well as they can be refused by patients for&#xD;
      religious reasons or because they are in contrast with chosen lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the objective of the present study is to test the H0-hypothesis of no difference&#xD;
      in the long-term implant treatment outcome after OSFE with Bio-Oss Collagen compared with the&#xD;
      use of no grafting material. A total of 40 consecutively healthy patients with a missing&#xD;
      posterior tooth in the maxilla will be allocated at random to OSFE with Bio-Oss Collagen or&#xD;
      no grafting material and simultaneous implant placement. Clinical and/or radiographical&#xD;
      evaluation using periapical radiographs and Cone Beam Computer Tomography (CBCT) will be&#xD;
      performed preoperatively, immediate postoperatively, after abutment connection, after&#xD;
      prosthetic rehabilitation, one year, three years and five years after loading to assess the&#xD;
      long-term implant treatment outcome and the volumetric changes of the augmented area. The&#xD;
      primary outcome will include survival of suprastructures, survival of implants, volumetric&#xD;
      stability of the augmented area, peri-implant marginal bone level, oral health related&#xD;
      quality of life, and complications related to the two treatment modalities.&#xD;

      Implant placement in the posterior part of the maxilla is frequently compromised or&#xD;
      impossible due to atrophy of the alveolar process and pneumatisation of the maxillary sinus.&#xD;
      Therefore, alveolar ridge augmentation is frequently necessary before or in conjunction with&#xD;
      implant placement. The most commonly used method to augment the maxillary premolar and molar&#xD;
      region involves the maxillary sinus floor augmentation applying the lateral window technique&#xD;
      with autogenous bone graft or bone substitutes and the treatment outcome has been reported in&#xD;
      systematic reviews. However, maxillary sinus floor augmentation with the lateral window&#xD;
      technique and bone harvesting is associated with prolonged patient treatment time and risk of&#xD;
      donor site morbidity. Hence, OSFE with or without the use of a grafting material is commonly&#xD;
      used to simplify the surgical procedure, when the residual alveolar bone height is more than&#xD;
      6 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OSFE with simultaneous implant placement was originally described by Summers in 1994. The&#xD;
      surgical procedure involves a transalveolar up-fracture and elevation of the maxillary sinus&#xD;
      floor and Schneiderian membrane using concave osteotomes. Implants are inserted&#xD;
      simultaneously to support the elevated floor of the maxillary sinus. The created compartment&#xD;
      between the elevated floor of the maxillary sinus and the original sinus floor is filled with&#xD;
      either particulated autogenous bone graft, a bone substitute or without a grafting material.&#xD;
      The final implant treatment outcome after OSFE with or without the use of a grafting material&#xD;
      have previous been assessed in systematic reviews and meta-analyses disclosing high implant&#xD;
      survival rates with few complications. However, the included studies are often characterized&#xD;
      by a moderate to high risk of bias and the conclusions are based on short-term non-randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials, whereas long-term randomized controlled trials assessing OSFE with or&#xD;
      without the use of a grafting material is sparse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OSFE with autogenous bone graft or a bone substitute is considered the golden standard and&#xD;
      the gain in alveolar bone height is enhanced with the use of a grafting material compared to&#xD;
      the use of no grafting material. Bio-Oss (Geistlich Pharma AG, Wolhusen, Switzerland) is a&#xD;
      deproteinized bone substitute of bovine bone origin and several studies have documented that&#xD;
      Bio-Oss possesses important properties when used as a membrane-supporting material and as a&#xD;
      scaffold for in-growth of host cells including biocompatibility and osteoconductivity.&#xD;
      Bio-Oss has been used for different bone augmentation procedures for more than 30 years and&#xD;
      OSFE with Bio-Oss is a safe and very predictable surgical procedure with few complications&#xD;
      and minimal morbidity, as documented in systematic reviews and long-term studies. However,&#xD;
      bone substitutes of natural transplants involves a risk of contamination, activation of host&#xD;
      immune system and disease transmission as well as they can be refused by patients for&#xD;
      religious reasons or because they are in contrast with chosen lifestyle. Thus, OSFE without a&#xD;
      grafting material is associated with obvious advantages for the patient, including reduced&#xD;
      risk of infection, less cost, reduced length of operation time and no risk of disease&#xD;
      transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival of suprastructures and implants are the most important measures for the assessment&#xD;
      of the long-term implant treatment outcome. However, long-term survival of suprastructures&#xD;
      after OSFE with or without the use of a grafting material has never been compared within a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial. Moreover, patient-reported outcome measures after OSFE have&#xD;
      never previously been assessed. A long-term randomized controlled trial revealed no&#xD;
      significant differences in implant survival after OSFE with Bio-Oss compared with the use of&#xD;
      no grafting material after five years. A newly published systematic review and meta-analysis&#xD;
      disclosed no significant differences in the short-term implant survival after OSFE with or&#xD;
      without the use of a grafting material and a long-term retrospective study assessing OSFE&#xD;
      without the use of a grafting material reported an implant survival rate 97.7% after 15&#xD;
      years. Moreover, long-term studies assessing OSFE without a graft material revealed high&#xD;
      implant survival after 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, OSFE without the use of a grafting material seems to be a predictable&#xD;
      treatment modality with high implant survival. However, the long-term survival of&#xD;
      suprastructure and implants after OSFE with or without the use of a graft material is&#xD;
      presently not sufficient clarified and has not been assessed in long-term randomized trial.&#xD;
