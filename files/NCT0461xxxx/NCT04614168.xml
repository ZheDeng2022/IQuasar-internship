  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Almost all people who have had type 1 diabetes for 5 years have a defect in secretion of the&#xD;
      hormone Glucagon. This hormone is involved in the body's response to low blood glucose&#xD;
      (hypoglycaemia). It works by releasing glucose stores from the liver to bring the blood&#xD;
      glucose back to normal. This defect therefore increases the risk of severe hypoglycaemia. The&#xD;
      reason for this Glucagon defect in people with Type 1 diabetes is currently unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to look at the Glucagon response to hypoglycaemia in 24 people with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes to ascertain whether tight blood glucose control over a period of time improves this&#xD;
      response. The investigators aim to achieve good blood glucose control using new generation&#xD;
      Automated Insulin Delivery systems (AIDs). This system is made of: an insulin pump, a&#xD;
      continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and an algorithm that allows adjustment of insulin delivery&#xD;
      based on the blood glucose readings from the CGM. This is the most up to date technology that&#xD;
      there is in the management of type 1 diabetes. However, people using this technology often&#xD;
      still have problems with high blood glucose after eating. To ensure a very good blood glucose&#xD;
      control participants will also follow a low carbohydrate diet to prevent this blood glucose&#xD;
      rise after meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Glucagon response to low blood glucose will be measured at zero and eight months using&#xD;
      the hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemic clamp technique.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility pilot study involving 24 participants with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from the local type 1 diabetes clinic and insulin pump waiting&#xD;
      list. Each participant will enter the trial for a period of 8 months. The investigators aim&#xD;
      to test if maximising time in glycaemic range (blood glucose 3.9-10 mmol/L) will restore the&#xD;
      glucagon response to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing informed consent participants will be screened for eligibility against the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who are eligible will have an initial 20-day period of baseline blood glucose data&#xD;
      collection. This will be achieved using a blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device.&#xD;
      Participants will continue on their pre-trial diabetes care during this period and will be&#xD;
      required to monitor their own blood glucose as normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be split into two groups using stratified sampling to match for: age,&#xD;
      gender and BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will be the control group. Participants in this group will continue on standard&#xD;
      diabetes care for the duration of the trial. Participants will be required to undertake two&#xD;
      further periods of blinded CGM monitoring at 4 and 8 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 will be the intervention group. Participants in this group will be placed on the&#xD;
      automated insulin delivery (AID) system and asked to follow a low carbohydrate diet of 30-40g&#xD;
      of carbohydrate per main meal portion. The AID system will consist of: a Tandem t:slim X2&#xD;
      insulin pump with control IQ technology and a Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitor. After&#xD;
      receiving training on the use of the devices these participants will enter a 2 week study&#xD;
      run-in period to become accustomed to the devices and so that device settings can be&#xD;
      optimised. As a safety measure these participants will be asked to measure blood ketones at&#xD;
      least once daily throughout the trial. Study staff will monitor the data from the&#xD;
      participants study devices throughout the trial and adjust settings as required to maximise&#xD;
      time in glycaemic range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning and end of the trial all participants will undergo a hyperinsulinaemic&#xD;
      hypoglycaemic clamp study to measure their counterregulatory hormone response to&#xD;
      hypoglycaemic. Participants will also undergo cognitive tests and assessment of hypoglycaemic&#xD;
      awareness during each clamp study.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will commence on a primed insulin infusion at a constant rate of 60mU/m2/min along with a variable rate 20% glucose infusion. Participants will have their blood glucose monitored every 5 minutes. The glucose infusion will be altered to achieve the desired blood glucose plateaus of: 5mmol/l, 3mmol/l and 2.5mmol/l. Each plateau will be held for 40 minutes. During each plateau blood samples will be taken on three occasions for: glucagon, cortisol, adrenaline, noradrenaline, D2 glucose and D5 glycerol. On two occasions during each plateau participants will complete the Edinburgh hypoglycaemia scale and the following cognitive tests: trail making test, digit span test, digit symbol substitution test and four choice reaction time test. At the end of the clamp study the insulin infusion will be discontinued and the blood glucose will be allowed to rise to the normal range. Participants will consume lunch before leaving the clinical research facility.</description>
