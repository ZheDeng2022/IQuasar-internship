    <description>Number of participants with presence and size of induration in active versus control at the Candin injection site compared to the intra-individual saline control injection site approximately 48 hours after Candin challenge will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) in the Active Arm Versus the Control Arm</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study. TEAEs are defined as AEs with onset or worsening on or after date of first dose of study treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Treatment-Emergent Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) in the Active Arm Versus the Control Arm</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>A SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a body mass index (BMI) between 18.0 and 30.0 kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2,&#xD;
             inclusive (BMI = weight/height^2), and body weight of no less than 50 kilograms (kg)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, and vital signs&#xD;
             performed at screening. Any abnormalities, must be considered not clinically&#xD;
             significant and this determination must be recorded in the participant's source&#xD;
             documents and initialed by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be a non-smoker (not smoked for at least 6 months prior to screening) and has not&#xD;
             used nicotine-containing products (example, nicotine patch) for 3 months prior to&#xD;
             screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)&#xD;
             coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
             (RT-PCR) test within 72 hours prior to administration of study intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A woman must be: a) not of childbearing potential; or b) of childbearing potential and&#xD;
             practicing a highly effective method of contraception (failure rate of less than [&lt;] 1&#xD;
             percent [%] per year when used consistently and correctly) and agrees to remain on a&#xD;
             highly effective method while receiving study intervention and until 4 months after&#xD;
             study intervention administration - the end of relevant systemic exposure. The&#xD;
             investigator should evaluate the potential for contraceptive method failure (example,&#xD;
             noncompliance, recently initiated) in relationship to the study intervention&#xD;
             administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of liver or renal insufficiency, significant cardiac, vascular, pulmonary,&#xD;

             metabolic, or mucocutaneous disturbances&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to Candin or its excipients&#xD;
&#xD;
