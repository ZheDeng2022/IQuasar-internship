  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to assess a new type of Augmented Reality Patient Information leaflet, in&#xD;
      order to demonstrate that it is a beneficial information resource to patients when facing the&#xD;
      diagnosis of sarcoma, breast cancer or to explain difficult concepts such as cleft lip&#xD;
      repair. There are no published studies on the use of AR in patient leaflets.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, the traditional approach to patient education regarding diseases such as a new&#xD;
      cancer diagnosis, is the patient information leaflet. Patient information leaflets often fail&#xD;
      to convey the required medical information due to poor levels of literacy in the population,&#xD;
      with 20% patients in the UK having the lowest level of adult literacy (equivalent to an&#xD;
      individual who is unable to determine how much medicine to give a child from information&#xD;
      printed on the package). &quot;Health literacy&quot; - the ability to obtain, understand, act on and&#xD;
      communicate health information - is even lower, with estimates that 40% of patients have&#xD;
      inadequate levels of health literacy. Additionally, there is a large knowledge gap between&#xD;
      what doctors perceive patients understand about an illness, medication, or operation, and&#xD;
      what patients actually comprehend and retain during consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plethora of problems of inadequate information, poor health literacy and patient-doctor&#xD;
      knowledge disconnect, may be addressed with an approach to patient information leaflets using&#xD;
      a platform that is entirely simulative and visual, thereby overcoming the problem of health&#xD;
      literacy. The study builds upon pilot work by this research team on patient leaflets using AR&#xD;
      to aid in patient education, visualisation and retention of information (Lo et al 2019).&#xD;
