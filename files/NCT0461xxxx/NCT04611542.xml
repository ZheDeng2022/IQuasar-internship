  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of men experiencing opioid use disorder and receiving treatment are fathers.&#xD;
      Substance use, transitions between in-patient and out-patient treatment, and reunification as&#xD;
      a family, all create considerable strain and are predictive of a host of negative long-term&#xD;
      outcomes including increased rates of relapse for fathers and elevated risk for behavioral,&#xD;
      emotional, and substance use problems in their children. Evidence-based parenting&#xD;
      interventions for fathers are lacking in general, yet are exceedingly rare for fathers&#xD;
      participating in opioid use disorder treatment, even though the extant research literature&#xD;
      suggests the integration of services is not only timely but may help engage and retain&#xD;
      fathers in treatment and produce protective factors for children. The goal of this project is&#xD;
      to develop and evaluate a prototype of a usable innovative web-based program that integrates&#xD;
      existing evidence-based parenting programs, yet tailored specifically to fathers with opioid&#xD;
      use disorder and designed for the opioid treatment context in order to promote the&#xD;
      implementation and dissemination of father specific empirically-supported treatment.&#xD;

      Investigators will recruit participants for this project through substance use treatment&#xD;
      centers in Oregon. Recruitment for the 30 fathers for the evaluation testing will be&#xD;
      coordinated in collaboration with substance use treatment center staff members who will&#xD;
      contact potentially eligible fathers to give a brief description of the project and ask for&#xD;
      permission for Oregon Research Behavioral Intervention Strategies (ORBIS) staff to contact&#xD;
      them to provide further information about the study. Fathers that do not give permission for&#xD;
      treatment center staff will not be contacted by ORBIS, though they can contact ORBIS directly&#xD;
      using the contact information in a brochure that they will receive from treatment centers.&#xD;
      Once treatment center staff receive permission from a father for ORBIS to contact them,&#xD;
      project staff will call to further explain the details of the project, confirm eligibility&#xD;
      requirements and discuss confidentiality. If the father expresses interest in participating,&#xD;
      we will send him an information packet and schedule an interview (or a visit if we feel that&#xD;
      is necessary to ensure that he understands the project and what we are asking of him).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 30 individual fathers that are eligible and consent to participate will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. Over a 5-week period (1 week for pretest assessments, 3 weeks for&#xD;
      training and skills practice, 1 week for posttest assessments) fathers will participate in&#xD;
      using the Fathering In Recovery (FIR) program. To address promise of efficacy, the primary&#xD;
      approach for the evaluation of the phase I prototype will be by assessing improvements on&#xD;
      pre-intervention to post-intervention outcomes including, parenting knowledge, parenting&#xD;
      efficacy, parenting skill, and pre-post reductions in substance use. Fathers will receive a&#xD;
      total of $200 for participation in the study.&#xD;
