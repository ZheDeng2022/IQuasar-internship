  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for this study is to investigate whether in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients&#xD;
      in stable remission a reduction or complete discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy can&#xD;
      be achieved in a treat-to-target approach while maintaining in remission. Due to the lack of&#xD;
      reliable data that answers the question of how to safely reduce medication in which patients,&#xD;
      this study will test a pragmatic treatment algorithm that can be applied in clinical practice&#xD;
      and that offers a gradual reduction with escape strategies in order to facilitate the&#xD;
      maintenance of remission.&#xD;

    <measure>Presence of MDA (minimal disease activity) 12 months after baseline.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The MDA status comprises the assessment of different domains of PsA, consisting of the following individual components:&#xD;
swollen and tender joint count&#xD;
tender entheseal point count&#xD;
skin involvement (PASI)patient self-assessment of pain (VAS)&#xD;
global disease activity status&#xD;
subject's self-assessment of functional ability using Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index, (HAQ-DI)&#xD;
MDA is defined as the presence of 5 of the following 7 criteria:&#xD;
tender joint count ≤1&#xD;
swollen joint count ≤1&#xD;
tender entheseal point count ≤1 (means: remission)&#xD;
PASI ≤1 OR body surface area (BSA) ≤3%&#xD;
patient pain VAS ≤15&#xD;
patient global activity VAS ≤20&#xD;
HAQ-DI ≤0.5</description>

    <measure>Key secondary endpoint: PASDAS (Psoriatic Arthritis Disease Activity Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PASDAS is a composite disease activity index (range 0-10) for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) incorporating seven domains: patient and physician global activity VAS scores, tender and swollen joint counts (arthritis), dactylitis, enthesitis (Leeds), health-related QoL (SF-36), and CRP level. PASDAS has demonstrated to have a better discriminate capacity in distinguishing high and low disease activity. The PASDAS is computed by the following equation: PASDAS = (((0, 18 ∗&#xD;
∗√(PhGA) + 0.159 ∗ ∗√(PtGA) - 0.253 ∗ ∗√(SF36 -PCS) + 0.101 ∗ lognat(SJC66 + 1)) + 0.048 ∗ lognat(SJC68 +1)) + 0.23 ∗ lognat (Leeds enthesitis index + 1)) + 0.37 ∗lognat (tender dactylitis count + 1) + 0.102 ∗ lognat (CRP +1) + 2 ∗ 1.5.</description>

    <measure>Key secondary endpoint: DAPSA (Disease Activity in PSoriatic Arthritis)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The DAPSA score determines changes in the disease activity of subjects diagnosed with PsA. DAPSA is a composite score which is calculated from the sum of: number of tender joints (0-68), number of swollen joints (0-66, hips are not taken into account), CRP (mg/dl), subject's assessment of global status of disease activity using VAS (0-10) and patient's self-assessment of pain using VAS (0-10). A value of the composite score DAPSA 0-≤ 4 marks remission, 5-14 marks low, 15-28 moderate and &gt;28 high disease activity</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Key secondary endpoint: CPDAI (Composite Psoriatic Disease Activity Index)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The composite psoriatic disease activity index (CPDAI) assesses disease activity under five domains using well established and validated instruments of PsA disease documentation as proposed by GRAPPA. The domains and the respective instrument are as follows: joint disease (SJC/TJC, HAQ), skin involvement (PASI, DLQI), enthesitis (LEI, HAQ), dactylitis (dactylitis digit count, HAQ) and spinal involvement (BASDAI and ASQoL). Using the instruments and ranges of values, disease activity under each domain is graded as none (0) -mild (1) -moderate (2) and severe (3) giving a range attainable CPDAI scores of between 0 and 15. The CPDAI correlates well with patient and physician global disease activity assessments and is an effective tool that clearly distinguishes those who require a treatment change from those who do not.</description>

    <measure>Number of tender entheseal points: SPARCC (Spondyloarthritis Consortium of Canada)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SPARCC enthesitis score is based on the counting of the presence or absence of tenderness on 16 entheseal sites (eight sites on each body side, respectively): lateral epicondyle, medial epicondyle, supraspinatus insertion into greater tuberosity of humerus, greater trochanter, quadriceps insertion into superior borders of patella, patellar ligament insertion into inferior pole of patella or tibial tubercle, Achilles tendon insertion into calcaneum, and plantar fascia insertion into calcaneum. Tenderness on examination is recorded as either present (1) or absent (0) for each of the 16 sites, summarized in an overall score ranging from 0 to 16. A higher count represents a greater enthesitis burden</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of tender entheseal Points: LEI (Leeds Enthesitis Index)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The LEI includes 3 entheseal sites on each body side, respectively: lateral epicondyles, medial condyles of the femur, and Achilles tendons. Tenderness on examination is recorded as either present (1) or absent (0) for each of the 6 sites, for in an overall score ranging from 0 to 6. A higher count represents a greater enthesitis burden</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activity of psoriasis: BSA (body surface area)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>For the BSA assessment of psoriatic skin involvement the size of the subject's hand is used as a scale to estimate the size of the skin surface covered by psoriasis. The subject's palm covers roughly 1% of body's surface area. An involved area of &lt;3% of the skin is considered as mild, of 3 10% as moderate, and &gt;10% as severe psoriasis</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activity of axial Involvement: BASDAI (Disease Activity of Ankylosing Spondylitis)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BASDAI consists of a one through 10 scale (one being no problem and 10 being the worst problem) which is used to answer 6 questions pertaining to the 5 major symptoms of AS: Fatigue, Spinal pain, Joint pain / swelling, areas of localized tenderness (also called enthesitis, or inflammation of tendons and ligaments), morning stiffness duration, morning stiffness severity.&#xD;
To give each symptom equal weighting, the mean (average) of the two scores relating to morning stiffness is taken. The resulting 0 to 50 score is divided by 5 to give a final 0 - 10 BASDAI score. Scores of 4 or greater suggest suboptimal control of disease, and patients with scores of 4 or greater are usually good candidates for either a change in their medical therapy or for enrollment in clinical trials evaluating new drug therapies directed at Ankylosing Spondylitis</description>

    <measure>Quality of life and health/disability: PsAID-12 (Psoriatic Arthritis Impact of Disease)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PsAID-12 is a score based on a subject's self-assessment questionnaire and used to measure the impact of psoriatic arthritis on a person's life. The questionnaire comprises 12 numeric rating scale questions covering the following topics: pain, fatigue, skin problems, work/leisure activities, functional capacity, discomfort, sleep disturbance, coping with PsA, anxiety and fear and uncertainty, embarrassment and/or shame, social participation, depression. Each question receives a score from 0 to 10. For evaluation these are weighted by factors and then summarized. The range of the final PsAID-score will be 0-10 where higher figures indicate worse status.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life and health/disability: HAQ-DI (Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire is based on a subject's self-assessment questionnaire for persons diagnosed with PsA. The HAQ-DI assesses a patient's level of functional ability and includes questions of fine movements of the upper extremity, locomotor activities of the lower extremity, and activities that involve both upper and lower extremities. There are 20 questions in eight categories of functioning which represent a comprehensive set of functional activities - dressing, rising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. The stem of each item asks for the past week &quot;Are you able to …&quot; perform a particular task. The patient's responses are made on a scale from zero (no disability) to three (completely disabled). Each category contains at least two specific component questions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life and health/disability: DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a score based on a subject's self-assessment questionnaire and used to measure the impact of the skin disease (psoriasis) on the quality of life of an affected person. The questionnaire contains 10 questions covering the following topics: symptoms, embarrassment, shopping and home care, clothes, social and leisure, sport, work or study, close relationships, sex, and treatment. Each question refers to the impact of the skin disease on the patient's life over the previous week. Each question receives a score from 0 to 3. These are summarized to a final score with a possible range from 0 (meaning no impact on quality of life) to 30 (meaning maximum impact on quality of life).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life and health/disability: ASQoL (Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ASQoL is a scale based on a subject's self-assessment questionnaire to measure the impact of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) on the quality of life of a diseased person with emphasis on the ability of the person to fulfill his or her needs. It consists of 18 items requesting a yes or no response to questions related to the impact of pain on sleep, mood, motivation, ability to cope, activities of daily living, independence, relationships, and social life. The score range is 0-18. High scores indicate worse quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life and health/Disability: SF-36 (Short Form Health)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a set of generic, coherent, and easily administered quality-of-life measures. These measures rely upon patient self-reporting and are now widely utilized for routine monitoring and assessment of care outcomes in adult patients. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. The eight sections are: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pains, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, mental health. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
