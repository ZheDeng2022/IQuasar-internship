  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the current public health crisis the use of telehealth consultation visits including&#xD;
      phone-only and video visits has exponentially increased. This study will investigate if the&#xD;
      conduct of telehealth phone only visits is non-inferior in terms of patient&#xD;
      satisfaction/experience, adherence to post-visit recommendations such as medications, blood&#xD;
      work and other medical testing, follow up care, when compared to the conduct of video&#xD;
      delivered telehealth visits. Patients will be randomized to receive a routine care visit via&#xD;
      phone only vs. video.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Telemedicine and an emerging field of novel care delivery modalities, which encompasses all&#xD;
      forms of remote-based care. These include asynchronous (store-and-forward) and consultative&#xD;
      care by specialists, mobile-device based care, and real-time video chat, and synchronous&#xD;
      telemedicine. Health care services delivered remotely through telecommunications and video&#xD;
      technology is steadily increasing as technology evolves and access becomes more widely&#xD;
      available. The increasing availability of personal technology - 89% Americans have internet&#xD;
      access, 77% are online daily - offers patients and clinicians the opportunity to utilize&#xD;
      real-time virtual communication to enhance access for patients when transportation&#xD;
      challenges, schedules, or physical disability make office visits difficult in any geography.&#xD;
      With the increased use of technology in healthcare, much emphasis has been placed on&#xD;
      telemedicine as it can extend the services of providers to remote locations and overcome the&#xD;
      barrier of proximity. This expands access to care and has the potential of making healthcare&#xD;
      services more convenient for many patients who otherwise might suffer access barriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is increasingly evident that telehealth can improve access to healthcare services and&#xD;
      specialists; prevent unnecessary delays in receiving care, and facilitate coordinated care&#xD;
      and interprofessional collaboration. The World Health Organization affirms the efficacy of&#xD;
      telehealth as an effective service delivery model for professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telemedicine has been shown to improve health outcomes, increase communication with&#xD;
      providers, increase access to high-quality service, decrease travel time, decrease missed&#xD;
      appointments, decrease wait time, decrease repeat admissions, increase self-awareness,&#xD;
      increase medication adherence, and increase self-monitoring of chronic conditions. The&#xD;
      technical quality of telehealth consultation (e.g. audio and visual quality of a&#xD;
      videoconference) has been shown to influence clinicians' willingness to practice in this&#xD;
      manner and the satisfaction of users. A recent systematic review on patient satisfaction with&#xD;
      telemedicine found that patient satisfaction can be associated with the modality of&#xD;
      telehealth, but factors of effectiveness and efficiency are mixed. Telehealth is a feasible&#xD;
      option to expand practices to remote areas without having to relocate or expand.&#xD;
      Understanding the perceived relative value of different modes of healthcare services may help&#xD;
      to shape the use of virtual or remote healthcare technologies. System learning that&#xD;
      demonstrates the value of different types of &quot;visits&quot; for the system and the patient is&#xD;
      essential.&#xD;
