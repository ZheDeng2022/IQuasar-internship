    <textblock>
      Depression is seen more often in people with asthma, and may lead to increased development&#xD;
      and severity of asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate whether children with depression and asthma have less allergic&#xD;
      disease and less inflammation than children with asthma who do not have symptoms of&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also investigate whether the lungs of children with depression and asthma&#xD;
      respond to an anticholinergic inhaler called ipratropium more than the lungs of non-depressed&#xD;
      asthmatic children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well accepted that asthma is not a single uniform disease, but rather many different&#xD;
      disease sub-entities with different etiologies and pathophysiologies. The term &quot;endotype&quot; was&#xD;
      coined to delineate distinct subtypes of asthma; an &quot;endotype&quot; specifically is as &quot;a subtype&#xD;
      of a condition, which is defined by a distinct functional or pathophysiological mechanism&quot;.&#xD;
      The division of asthma into endotypes is critical to the development of targeted&#xD;
      immunomodulators and other specific treatment modalities to more effectively treat the&#xD;
      diverse asthmatics encountered in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a clear association between depression and asthma, with evidence suggesting that&#xD;
      depression leads to increased development of asthma rather than the reverse. If, as&#xD;
      suggested, depression truly mediates a subset of asthma, this depression-related asthma&#xD;
      &quot;endotype&quot; has not been well characterized to date. A promising theory of the&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanism of depression-related asthma is that of autonomic nervous system&#xD;
      dysregulation associated with depression leading to airway compromise (Miller and Wood,&#xD;
      2003). Specifically, depression is associated with excess parasympathetic (cholinergic)&#xD;
      activation, and cholinergic activation can mediate bronchoconstriction through the action of&#xD;
      acetylcholine on the muscarinic receptors on bronchial smooth muscle. It has been&#xD;
      demonstrated that during emotional stimuli, depressed children with asthma have increased&#xD;
      parasympathetic activation, which associates with increased airway resistance. In contrast,&#xD;
      when experiencing these same emotional stimuli, non-depressed children with asthma have&#xD;
      increased sympathetic activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that depressed child asthmatics have cholinergically-mediated&#xD;
      bronchoconstriction as a major mediator of their disease activity. Based upon studies of&#xD;
      depressed asthmatic children showing increased parasympathetic/cholinergic reactivity in&#xD;
      response to laboratory based emotional stimuli, along with a recent study showing that&#xD;
      depressed asthmatic adults have decreased bronchodilatory response to beta-agonists, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that asthmatic children with higher depressive indices will have&#xD;
      more bronchodilatory response on spirometry following treatment with a short-acting inhaled&#xD;
      anticholinergic, and less additional bronchodilation with an inhaled beta-agonist, compared&#xD;
      to children with lower depressive indices. The investigators will set out to demonstrate if&#xD;
      during an episode of bronchoconstriction, depressed child asthmatics will achieve more&#xD;
      bronchodilation from a short-acting inhaled anticholinergic than will non-depressed child&#xD;
      asthmatics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators next predict that with excess cholinergic activation as a cause of&#xD;
      bronchoconstriction in depressed pediatric asthmatics, there will be less atopic&#xD;
      sensitization and Th2-mediated inflammation driving the airway disease in this subset of&#xD;
      asthmatics. The investigators hypothesize that, compared to non-depressed child asthmatics,&#xD;
      depressed pediatric asthmatics during an episode of bronchoconstriction will show less&#xD;
      evidence of airway inflammation as measured by fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and&#xD;
      peripheral blood eosinophilia, and will have lower rates of atopic sensitization measured by&#xD;
      skin prick testing to environmental allergens and/or elevated total serum immunoglobulin E&#xD;
      (IgE). In addition, the investigators will assess patient-identified asthma triggers, which&#xD;
      are anticipated to be different in the depressed asthmatic group, with increased&#xD;
      identification of emotions and cold weather as triggers, and less identification of allergens&#xD;
      as triggers.&#xD;
