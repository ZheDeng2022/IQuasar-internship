    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, comparative, randomized, controlled, open-label, single-surgeon,&#xD;
      single-center PMCF clinical study whereby presbyopic patients undergoing refractive surgery&#xD;
      will receive a SUPRACOR treatment for the correction in the non-dominant eye and a PROSCAN&#xD;
      refractive treatment in the dominant eye to correct for ametropia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be randomized to either a SUPRACOR regular (100%) or SUPRACOR strong&#xD;
      (130%) treatment with a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;

    <time_frame>3 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the visual acuity for different distances, defocus curves under photopic light conditions will be measured using Clinical Trial Suite (M&amp;S Technologies, Niles, IL, USA) device at 4m.

    <time_frame>3 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The contrast sensitivity test consists in assessing the possibility to distinguish the alternation of white and grey fringes of difference contrast with difference frequency.

    <measure>Halo Photic phenomena</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The amount and disturbance of photic halo side effects will be assessed by two methods: 1) Halo and Glare simulator: With this software tool the particant mimics the individual vision perception by adjusting a typical night scene image with the intensity and size of glare and halo; 2) Siepser Glarometer (Gulden Ophthalmics, Elkins Park, PA 19027). This is a target-like device that measures and quantifies post-operative glare. The measurement is of the participants' actual scope and range of monocular glare and halo.</description>

    <measure>Patient-Reported Spectacle Independence Questionnaire (PRSIQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient-Reported Spectacle Independence Questionnaire (PRSIQ) is comprised of 3 questions about the need for glasses or contacts in the past 7 days for distance vision (at least 1.5 meters (m) away), intermediate vision (0.5 m to 1.5 m away), and near vision (&lt; 0.5 m away). Possible scores range from 1 to 5, with 1 = All of the time and 5 = None of the time for six of the questions; 3 of these questions ask the question in a positive way and 3 of the question ask the question in a negative way, so the higher scores are better for the negative question and are worse for the positive question. There are also 3 questions whether glasses or contacts were needed in the past 7 days with scores of Yes = 1 and No = 2. The results for each question will be summarized separately.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Near Activity Visual Questionnaire (NAVQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The Near Activity Visual Questionnaire (NAVQ) is comprised of 10 questions about performing activities without extra reading spectacles. Each question has responses of 0 to 4, with 0 indicating 'No difficulty' and 4 indicating 'Extreme difficulty'. Any 'Not applicable' responses are scored according to the median overall score for the subject. The scores are summed with total score ranging from 0 to 30. Higher scores indicate more difficulty performing specified activities without spectacles.</description>
