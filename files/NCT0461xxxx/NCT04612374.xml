  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite increasing recognition of misophonia, there are currently no evidence-based&#xD;
      treatments to help those who are suffering. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of a treatment for&#xD;
      misophonia. This study will be conducted in two phases. In the Phase 1, participants will&#xD;
      receive a treatment the investigators believe can help manage symptoms of misophonia: The&#xD;
      Unified Protocol. This treatment uses evidence-based psychological principles (e.g., managing&#xD;
      attention or behavior) in a flexible manner and will focus on developing skills to help&#xD;
      reduce the distress and impairment associated with Misophonia. After treatment, patients will&#xD;
      provide feedback about their experience. The investigators will use this feedback to revise&#xD;
      the treatment as indicated. In Phase 2, participants will receive the revised treatment and&#xD;
      provide feedback on their experience. Throughout treatment in either phase, participants will&#xD;
      provide daily and weekly information about their symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are (1) to explore the acceptability and feasibility of the Unified&#xD;
      Protocol for individuals who experience Misophonia and (2) to examine whether this treatment&#xD;
      helps reduce symptoms associated with Misophonia.&#xD;

The severity subscale is a single item that asks an individual to provide a rating of their sound sensitivity on a scale from 0 (no sound sensitivities) to 15 (very severe sound sensitivities).</description>
