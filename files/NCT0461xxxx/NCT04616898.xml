      The Primary Objectives of this protocol are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment&#xD;
      with 1060nm diode laser and radio frequency for use in aesthetic dermatological procedures&#xD;
      requiring the ablation, excision, incision, or coagulation of soft tissue. Efficacy will be&#xD;
      analyzed through histological and molecular analysis. Safety will be analyzed by monitoring&#xD;
      the occurrence of any adverse events.&#xD;

These patients will receive laser treatment every four weeks for twelve weeks on the sites labelled Multiple Tx below (sites 1 and 2) on Days -90, -60, and -30 prior to abdominoplasty. At the final treatment (Day -30), two additional diodes will be placed on the sites labelled Single Tx below (sites 3 and 4). 4 diodes total will be used at this visit. Four weeks following this last treatment, the scheduled abdominoplasty will be performed and the pannus containing the treated tissue will be excised.</description>

    <intervention_name>Venus Bliss</intervention_name>
    <description>The Venus Blissâ„¢ system is an aesthetic medical device designed to non-invasively reduce subcutaneous adipose tissue of the abdominal area and flanks. It is intended for use in individuals with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or less. The device consists of an external treatment component and an internal control component. The treatment console is a 1060nm diode laser applicator and a radio frequency applicator. In addition, a Bliss Belt is provided with the system to properly secure one or more applicators to the patient's body during treatment. Finally, the touchscreen monitor is used by the clinician to control the setting display on the main console. It also keeps the clinician informed of the device's status and operating parameters.</description>
