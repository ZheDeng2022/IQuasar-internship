      Background: Vulvovaginal health, directly linked to sexual health, is a key factor for female&#xD;
      pleasure. BCS receiving AI are likely to present severe GSM and sexual complaints. Innovative&#xD;
      options, as vaginal laser therapy, are emerging to treat GSM and sexual dysfunctions.&#xD;
      Nowadays, data in BCS is scarce, moreover, few studies included patients receiving AI [16].&#xD;
      Different meta-analysis [17-23] found GSM [24, 25] and sexual function [9, 10] may improve&#xD;
      significantly at short-term, however, the body of evidence is of low quality. Therefore,&#xD;
      before recommendation of laser therapy for sexual complaints in BCS with GSM, there are unmet&#xD;
      needs to be solved: efficacy and safety at long-term, biases related to patients'&#xD;
      expectations and a detailed assessment of the complex underpinnings of sexuality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: To evaluate sexual and vaginal health in BCS receiving AI with GSM, before and after&#xD;
      CO2 laser therapy compared to a sham-controlled group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Prospective, randomized, double-blind controlled study with two parallel study arms:&#xD;
      1) Fractional CO2 laser therapy (5monthly sessions). 2) Sham laser therapy (5monthly&#xD;
      sessions). After end-treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month and 6 months. BCS treated&#xD;
      or undergoing AI with GSM and sexual function impairment, will be suitable. All patients will&#xD;
      maintain first-line non-hormonal treatment and sexual assessment (PLISSIT Model) according&#xD;
      with usual care. The primary outcome is improvement in sexual function (FSFI total score). As&#xD;
      secondary outcomes: resumption sexual activity, sexual activity frequency, dyspareunia (VAS),&#xD;
      female sexual dysfunction, sexual dimensions (FSFI), body image (S-BIS), quality of life&#xD;
      (SF-12), vaginal pH acidification, maturation index and Vaginal Health Index of Gloria&#xD;
      Backmann, adverse events, satisfaction (Likert scale) and adherence to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected impact: Emergent, non-invasive, laser therapy has significant benefit for BCS with&#xD;
      AI, improving subjective and objective sexual and vaginal health outcomes and adding value to&#xD;
      the usual care multidisciplinary approach.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sexuality is a central aspect of being human throughout life encompasses sex, gender&#xD;
      identities and roles, sexual orientation, eroticism, pleasure, intimacy and reproduction.&#xD;
      Most of these aspects may be affected in breast cancer survivors (BCS). In a recent&#xD;
      meta-analysis, focused on sexual function through Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) among&#xD;
      BCS, female sexual dysfunction prevalence was 73,4% (95 % CI 64-82.8 %, I2 = 96.8 %) and mean&#xD;
      FSFI 19.28 (95 % CI 17.39-21.16, I2 = 97.6 %). Several modifiable risk factors for sexual&#xD;
      dysfunction in BCS may be optimum targets for intervention: amelioration of vaginal&#xD;
      discomfort and urinary incontinence, the benefits of breast conserving surgery on body image&#xD;
      or the evaluation of relationship quality. Due to the multifaceted nature of the factors&#xD;
      affecting sexuality in BCS, most authors encouraged the need for comprehensive assessment and&#xD;
      for a multidisciplinary approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BC diagnosis and/or its treatments (surgery, chemoradiotherapy, hormonal therapy) may altered&#xD;
      sexual health. Vulvovaginal health, directly linked to sexual health, is a key factor for&#xD;
      female pleasure. Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) is caused by decline in estrogen&#xD;
      at menopause, which may also appear or worsen after systemic cancer treatments as aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitors (AI). GSM is associated with sexual symptoms (lack of lubrication, discomfort or&#xD;
      pain, impaired function), genital symptoms (dryness, burning, irritation) and urinary&#xD;
      symptoms (urgency, dysuria, recurrent urinary tract infections). BCS receiving AI are one of&#xD;
      the groups most likely to present severe GSM and sexual complaints. A cross-sectional study&#xD;
      on 129 BCS during the first 2 years of adjuvant AI therapy, found 3 out of 4 women were&#xD;
      distressed about their sexual problems. Only 52% of women had been sexually active when&#xD;
      endocrine therapy began, but 79% of that group developed new sexual problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first line of treatment for GSM is non-hormonal therapy (regular sexual activity,&#xD;
      moisturizers-lubricants, pelvic-floor relaxation techniques, dilators) although in many women&#xD;
      these options will not adequately control symptoms. Hormonal therapies must be used with&#xD;
      caution in women with estrogen-dependent cancers. So, alternative options are emerging for&#xD;
      this subset of patients, such as vaginal laser therapy. Different studies provided short-term&#xD;
      data on non-cancer patients that showed laser therapy was feasible, safe and improved&#xD;
      objective and subjective GSM. Data regarding sexuality derived from secondary endpoints and&#xD;
      suggested that laser therapy may improve sexual function, mainly decreasing sexual pain. To&#xD;
      date, data on laser therapy in BCS is scarce, moreover, few studies included patients&#xD;
      receiving ongoing AI. The CO2 laser was the most frequently used device. Different reviews&#xD;
      and meta-analysis found GSM and sexual function may improve significantly at short-term,&#xD;
      however, the body of evidence is of low quality. Therefore, before recommendation for the use&#xD;
      of laser therapy for sexual complaints in BCS with GSM, there are unmet needs to be solved as&#xD;
      efficacy and safety at long-term, biases related to patients' expectations of therapy and a&#xD;
      detailed assessment of the complex underpinnings of sexuality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer the unmet needs previously mentioned, the aim of the current study is to verify the&#xD;
      outcomes of sexual and vaginal health in breast cancer women receiving AI, who were&#xD;
      experiencing symptoms of GSM, before and after CO2 laser therapy compared to a&#xD;
      sham-controlled group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, we will compare the following subjective and objective measurements of sexual&#xD;
      and vaginal health:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAIN GOAL: Report an improvement in sexuality:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary outcome: sexual function (FSFI total score)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary sexual outcomes: resumption sexual activity (sexually active vs non-sexually&#xD;
           active), sexual activity frequency (nº sexual activity/week), dyspareunia (VAS), female&#xD;
           sexual dysfunction (VAS sexual life distress), sexual dimensions: desire, arousal,&#xD;
           lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction and pain (FSFI) and body image (S-BIS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OTHER OBJECTIVES: Report an improvement on GSM symptoms (efficacy) and quality of life,&#xD;
      feasibility and safety of laser therapy in BCS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Secondary non-sexual outcomes: quality of life (SF-12). Verify an acidification of the&#xD;
      vaginal pH, an improvement in the maturation index and an improvement in the Gloria Backmann&#xD;
      Index: Vaginal Health Index. To evaluate toxicity associated with vaginal laser therapy in&#xD;
      this population (AEs and SAEs). To determine how many women with the defined patient&#xD;
      eligibility will complete all treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind controlled study with two parallel study arms:&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients undergo fractional CO2 laser therapy at 5 times points 30 days apart. ARM II:&#xD;
      Patients undergo sham laser therapy at 5 time points 30 days apart. After completion of the&#xD;
      treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION PROCESS: A randomization list will be generated in multiple blocks of 2 and 1:&#xD;
      1 ratio with STATA version 15.1 or higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY SUBJECTS: Patients treated or undergoing AI for BC in the Breast Cancer Unit of the&#xD;
      Hospital Clínic and who present symptoms related to GSM that condition their sexual function&#xD;
      and quality of life, despite receiving first-line non-hormonal treatment: regular sexual&#xD;
      activity (such as mutual and self-touch masturbation, manual or vibrator stimulation, oral&#xD;
      sex, sexual intercourse, massage and other forms of physical intimacy), moisturizers,&#xD;
      lubricants, pelvic-floor relaxation techniques and/or dilators. Inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria are summarized in Table 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY GROUPS: All patients will receive instructions to maintain first-line non-hormonal&#xD;
      treatment, as well as sexual assessment using the PLISSIT Model according with usual care in&#xD;
      our hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study group will be treated with a vaginal fractionated CO2 laser protocol (The SMARTXIDE&#xD;
      TOUCH (Deka) equipment with an autoclavable vaginal probe following the manufacturer's&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will receive treatment with a sham-CO2 laser using a double-blinded&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY STRUCTURE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE CALCULATION Considering FSFI score as the main variable of the study, we performed a&#xD;
      calculation of the hypothesis contrast study sample with the comparison of two independent&#xD;
      means. Accepting an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of less than 0.1 in a bilateral&#xD;
      contrast, 44 subjects in the first group and 44 in the second. The common standard deviation&#xD;
      is assumed to be 1. A follow-up loss rate of 15% has been estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTIC ANALYSIS Descriptive statistics will be used according to standard calculation&#xD;
      methods. The comparison between the two treatments at the end of the study will be evaluated&#xD;
      through the change with the baseline using a mixed repeated measures model (MMRM) adjusted&#xD;
      for the baseline value and including the treatment and the time in the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variables of repetitive evaluation over time are analyzed according to the following&#xD;
      strategy: (a) continuous variables with a repeated measures mixed longitudinal model (MMRM);&#xD;
      (b) binary or non-normal variables with marginal models (Generalized Estimating Equation:&#xD;
      GEE). Other variables will be studied as follows: Fisher's exact test for categorical&#xD;
      variables, Student's t test for continuous variables between 2 groups. Non-parametric methods&#xD;
      for independent data (Mann-Whitney U for 2 groups or Kruskall-Wallis test for more than 2&#xD;
      groups) will be used if necessary. The level of statistical significance will be 5%&#xD;
      bilateral. The main analysis will be by Intention to Treat (ITT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPACT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      What would be the impact of the project on sexual medicine field when it is successfully&#xD;
      completed? Please explain how your project fits to the specific call&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BCS receiving AI are at higher risk of developing GSM symptoms. Sexual issues are common,&#xD;
      either secondary to painful sex or as a direct effect of estrogen deprivation in the brain.&#xD;
      However, addressing sexual health issues in BCS still meets several barriers from both,&#xD;
      patient and health care professionals. GSM symptoms do not put survival at risk, however,&#xD;
      have a significant impact in the quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first-line treatment for GSM symptoms should be non-hormonal therapies according clinical&#xD;
      guidelines, although frequently it will be insufficient to alleviate symptoms. Hormonal&#xD;
      therapies are not currently recommended and must be used with caution in BCS. So,&#xD;
      energy-based treatments have emerged as a promising option in this subgroup of patients.&#xD;
      However, the body of evidence is lacking to make decisive recommendations [18], specially to&#xD;
      treat sexual complaints. There is an urgent need to carry out RCT with larger sample size,&#xD;
      long-term follow-up and blinded control group for answer various unmet needs in this field:&#xD;
      short/mid and long-term safety issues and efficacy, treatment modalities (type of laser) and&#xD;
      protocols (laser parameters, sessions numbers, repetitions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to demonstrate that emergent, non-invasive, non-anesthetic laser therapy&#xD;
      has significant benefit for BCS with AI, measured in a prospective, randomized, double-blind&#xD;
      controlled trial using validated tools for subjective and objective sexual and vaginal health&#xD;
      outcomes and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, sexual health is a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in&#xD;
      relation to sexuality which requires the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual&#xD;
      experiences. So, both arms of study groups will benefit from multidisciplinary approach&#xD;
      including non-hormonal therapies (regular sexual activity, moisturizers, lubricants, pelvic&#xD;
      floor relaxation techniques and/or dilators) and sexual assessment using the PLISSIT Model&#xD;
      according with usual care in our hospital and with international recommendations.&#xD;
