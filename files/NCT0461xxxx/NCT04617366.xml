  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke patients do not respond well to the traditional repetitive transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (rTMS) strategy based on the competitive model. The studies found that the&#xD;
      contralesional motion cortex has a compensatory effect on the realization of the motor&#xD;
      function of the affected side-the compensatory model, and the degree of compensation will&#xD;
      change as the function changes. The optimal neural regulation strategies under different&#xD;
      models are opposite, so it is important to accurately evaluate which of the two models plays&#xD;
      the leading role. And functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) may accurately and&#xD;
      quickly assess cortical function in order to determine the degree of participation of the&#xD;
      contralesional motion cortex. We propose that the dynamic individualized strategy which&#xD;
      adjust the rTMS parameters promptly based on the results of fNIRS will be better than the&#xD;
      traditional stimulation strategy. This project will apply a blinded-assessment randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial. The test group selects either the high-frequency rTMS to the contralesional&#xD;
      dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) or the low-frequency rTMS to the contralesional primary motor&#xD;
      cortex (M1) based on the lateralization index of the PMd measured by fNIRS. And the control&#xD;
      group will always be given low-frequency rTMS to contralesional M1. The difference in the&#xD;
      improvement of upper limb function between the two groups of patients was compared.&#xD;
