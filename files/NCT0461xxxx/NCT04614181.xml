    <textblock>
      Pre-operative carbohydrate and protein loading among older people with hip fractures could&#xD;
      potentially influence patient outcomes. This mode of intervention has seen good outcomes in a&#xD;
      general surgical setting as part of its enhanced recovery pathway. However, its effectiveness&#xD;
      and ease of implementation in a hip fracture setting is uncertain. This study aims to study&#xD;
      the feasibility of protein and carbohydrate loading as part of hip fracture management&#xD;
      compared to usual care.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative carbohydrate loading is one of the many components of enhanced recovery after&#xD;
      surgery (ERAS) protocol. It has been identified as one of the independent predictors among&#xD;
      ERAS components to improve peri-operative well-being and reduce post-operative complications.&#xD;
      While well-being is a subjective outcome, several surrogate outcomes have been used to&#xD;
      quantify some of the aspects. These surrogate outcomes of well-being include post-operative&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting, pain, and preservation of muscle strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the exact mechanism of how pre-operative carbohydrate loading improves these&#xD;
      outcomes is unclear, there appears to be an anabolic effect by increasing insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity, improving glucose control and reducing catabolism. Patients in anabolic state&#xD;
      undergo less post-operative nitrogen and protein loss, which translates to preservation of&#xD;
      muscle strength. Carbohydrate loading keeps the body in a fed state during the fasting period&#xD;
      before surgery. This abolishes the starvation effects which causes reduced insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity commonly seen with conventional fasting practice. This is an independent&#xD;
      predictor which prolongs length of hospital stay, preservation of muscle mass and handgrip&#xD;
      strength post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While most studies have demonstrated benefits of carbohydrate loading in patients undergoing&#xD;
      abdominal surgeries, the number of studies conducted in the orthopedic hip fracture&#xD;
      population are limited. In addition, there may also be barriers to introducing a new protocol&#xD;
      with carbohydrate loading to replace the existing conventional fasting practice. Studies&#xD;
      showed diverse feasibility in terms of implementation, which seemed to be multifactorial.&#xD;
      More studies are therefore required to identify the factors promoting or impeding such a&#xD;
      practice in respective centres. Given that a significant number of the hip fracture&#xD;
      population are malnourished elderly who may benefit from this intervention, the gap in&#xD;
      literature in this population deserves a thorough attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The University Malaya Medical Centre is a tertiary hospital with an average of 200 hip&#xD;
      fracture cases annually. To date, these cases are subjected to conventional fasting starting&#xD;
      from midnight. They are usually fasted up to extended hours, putting them in a starved state&#xD;
      before surgery. It is therefore the great interest of the current multidisciplinary teams&#xD;
      involved in the clinical care of hip fracture patients to introduce carbohydrate loading as&#xD;
      part of the fasting practice. This study aims to introduce the concept and assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of such a practice. The results from this pilot study may be used to&#xD;
      revolutionize the fasting practice in our hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study the feasibility of implementing pre-operative carbohydrate loading in patients&#xD;
           undergoing hip surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study the safety of pre-operative carbohydrate loading in patients undergoing hip&#xD;
           surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To evaluate the effect of pre-operative carbohydrate loading among patients undergoing hip&#xD;
      fracture surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study to collect data on feasibility of implementing carbohydrate loading&#xD;
      before orthopaedic hip fracture surgery. It is also an open labelled, randomized controlled&#xD;
      study to identify correlation between pre-operative carbohydrate loading and surrogate&#xD;
      outcomes of well-being. A computer generated randomization method will be used to allocate&#xD;
      participants to each arm (intervention vs control) on a 1:1 ratio basis. The randomization&#xD;
      allocation will be revealed after consent and baseline assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of carbohydrate load required to induce an effect must be enough to shift the body&#xD;
      from a fasted to a fed state. A 50g oral carbohydrate ingestion has been shown to stimulate&#xD;
      insulin release resembling post-prandial state. Therefore, the ERAS society recommendation is&#xD;
      based on the following dose: a loading dose of 100g carbohydrate the day before surgery (as&#xD;
      glycogen store) followed by a 50g dose 2 hours before surgery (to keep patients in a fed&#xD;
      state).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, the intervention group will receive the carbohydrate beverage (Nestle&#xD;
      RESOURCE). Each serving is 237ml containing 53.6g of carbohydrate and 9g of protein.&#xD;
      Intervention group will consume two servings of the carbohydrate beverage (53.6g each, total&#xD;
      of approximately 100g) on the day before surgery and one serving 6 hours prior to scheduled&#xD;
      surgery time. The control group will receive usual hip fracture care as determined by the&#xD;
      clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this pilot study, a sample size of 40 is targeted. 20 will be randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention group receiving the supplement drink, while 20 will be randomized to the control&#xD;
      group who will not be receiving any supplements. No formal sample size calculation was used.&#xD;
      One of the objectives of this feasibility study is to provide estimates of recruitment and&#xD;
      retention rates for a larger study. The number of participants for this study will be&#xD;
      determined by resources and the recruitment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline demographic data will be presented as mean Â± SEM. Feasibility outcomes will be&#xD;
      reported as numbers and percentages. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, and&#xD;
      median for continuous variables; frequencies and percentages for categorical variables) will&#xD;
      be calculated separately by group. For the group comparison, appropriate tests based on their&#xD;
      distribution will be performed.&#xD;
