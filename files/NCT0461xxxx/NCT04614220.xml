    <textblock>
      Patient's safety and satisfaction are major concerns of anesthesiologists and obstetricians.&#xD;
      According to evidence guidelines, and quality markers, regional anesthesia is preferred over&#xD;
      general in obstetric surgery. Already a high level of anxiety is present in obstetric&#xD;
      patients preoperatively.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hospital anxiety is commonly encountered, and it is reported to be seen in 60%-80% of&#xD;
      patients who undergo surgery. There are many causes of preoperative anxiety including fear of&#xD;
      death due to anesthesia or surgical procedure and fear of preoperative or postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative anxiety varies according to the patient's age, gender, educational status,&#xD;
      history of previous operations, and medical status as well as the type of surgery and type of&#xD;
      anesthesia. Patient's safety and satisfaction are major concerns of anesthesiologists and&#xD;
      obstetricians. According to evidence guidelines, and quality markers, regional anesthesia is&#xD;
      preferred over general in obstetric surgery. Already a high level of anxiety is present in&#xD;
      obstetric patients preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anxious patients tend to prefer general anesthesia (GA) for cesarean section (CS). The&#xD;
      patient refusal is the main contraindication for applying spinal anesthesia (SA) during CS.&#xD;
      The anxiety can be reduced variably by non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic methods including&#xD;
      preoperative visit, information, and music, listening to Holy Quran recitation, hypnosis,&#xD;
      nitrous oxide, and benzodiazepines. Intravenous sedation can control the anxiety in 90% of&#xD;
      patients subjected to spinal procedures. While the evidence supports the benefits of&#xD;
      procedural sedation for distressed, anxious pregnant women.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>The surgeon and the anesthetist will discuss the exclusion criteria, and then discuss the information about spinal and general anesthesia with the illegible patients. The first decision for anesthesia, either spinal or general, will be recorded.&#xD;
Then, patients who refuse SA and prefer general anesthesia (GA) will be consulted again as regards SA with presence of close relative for comfortable spinal procedure. Their last choice is the second decision that determines the final type of anesthesia to be implemented. The acceptance rate of SA with presence of close relative will be the primary outcome. A written consent will be taken. The number of crying patients and anxiety causes will be documented just before SA. The anxiety score will be assessed by the visual analog score (VAS) from 0- 10, where 10 is the maximum anxiety level .</ipd_description>
