  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laryngomalacia (LM) is the most common cause of stridor in infants. Symptoms of&#xD;
      gastroesophageal reflux (GER) are often seen in the setting of LM; therefore, acid&#xD;
      suppression therapy (AST) has been empirically used in the management of this disorder. The&#xD;
      investigators recently performed a retrospective chart review assessing improvement of airway&#xD;
      and dysphagia symptoms, weight gain, and need for surgery with AST. It was found that there&#xD;
      was a similar improvement between LM severity groups and most patients received AST (96.6%).&#xD;
      It is unclear if these improvements are due to AST or natural resolution of the disease. With&#xD;
      heightened concerns of side effects related to AST in infants, particularly among those born&#xD;
      prematurely, judicious use of these medications is needed. The investigators are now&#xD;
      performing a prospective study looking at the outcome differences in patients with&#xD;
      laryngomalacia who are evaluated by speech language therapy (SLP) alone versus those with SLP&#xD;
      evaluation and acid suppression therapy (famotidine).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: To determine the outcome differences in patients 6 months and younger with&#xD;
      laryngomalacia and dysphagia who are evaluated by speech language therapy (SLP) alone versus&#xD;
      those with both SLP evaluation and acid suppression therapy (AST) (famotidine)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: There will be no differences in outcomes between those that had SLP alone versus&#xD;
      those that had both SLP and AST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laryngomalacia (LM) is the most common cause of stridor in infants. Symptoms of&#xD;
      gastroesophageal reflux (GER) are often seen in the setting of LM; therefore, acid&#xD;
      suppression therapy (AST) has been empirically used in the management of this disorder.&#xD;
      However, there is no gold standard in treating mild and moderate LM patients and therefore&#xD;
      this study will help establish guidelines for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A medical chart review will be performed to assess airway and dysphagia symptom improvement&#xD;
      from consult to the 3-month follow up appointment and then up to a year. The Pittsburgh&#xD;
      Airway Symptom Score (PASS) questionnaire and the Infant Gastroesophageal Reflux&#xD;
      Questionnaire (I-GERQ-R) will be given to families at the consult and at the 3-month follow&#xD;
      up appointment for caregiver assessment. The physician will then perform the standard&#xD;
      procedures at the clinic appointment. The Flexible Laryngoscopy Findings sheet will be filled&#xD;
      out in conjunction with the clinic procedures for objective data. The surveys will then be&#xD;
      scored to determine true GERD (score &gt;=16) and severe laryngomalacia (LM) (RED questions on&#xD;
      the PASS), which would further exclude these patients. There are 12 total questions on the&#xD;
      I-GERQ-R. On the PASS, questions 1 &amp; 2 are in the GREEN category and signifies mild LM,&#xD;
      YELLOW signifies moderate LM, and RED is severe LM. On the PASS questionnaire, &quot;Yes&quot; to&#xD;
      either #1 or #2 and nothing else is mild LM, &quot;yes&quot; to at least one #3-5 and none of #6-10 is&#xD;
      moderate LM, and &quot;yes&quot; to any of the #6-10&quot; indicates severe LM. There are 10 total questions&#xD;
      on the PASS. Mild and moderate LM patients will be block randomized the day before the&#xD;
      appointment to receive speech language therapy alone or speech language therapy with&#xD;
      famotidine (Pepcid). Both treatments are standard of care in these patients. Speech language&#xD;
      therapy (feeding therapy) is part of the normal clinic visit for LM patients. These patients&#xD;
      will then be re-evaluated at their follow up appointment in 3 months (+/- 1 month). The&#xD;
      families will take the PASS and I-GERQ-R surveys again to determine LM severity.&#xD;
