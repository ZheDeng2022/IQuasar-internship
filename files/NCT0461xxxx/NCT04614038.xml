  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between wound alkalinity and the&#xD;
      non-healing status of chronic ulcer wounds. It is hypothesized that wounds with an alkaline&#xD;
      environment as indicated by DETEC pH will have a high chance of not healing over 12 weeks of&#xD;
      wound care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic wounds fail to progress through normal wound healing phases in a timely manner which&#xD;
      makes them non-healing over time. The inability to identify a slowly healing or non-healing&#xD;
      wound early on can be detrimental to the patient's well-being. Currently, determination of&#xD;
      non-healing wounds is based on the clinician's visual observation of wound size changes for 4&#xD;
      weeks. Many early studies have documented that chronic, non-healing, or infected wounds often&#xD;
      reside in an alkaline state (pH &gt; 7.2) while healing wounds are habitually associated with a&#xD;
      non-alkaline and even acidic environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reliably and continuously monitor wound alkalinity objectively, a portable, disposable,&#xD;
      non-invasive, and non-contact device - DETEC® pH - was developed to indirectly assess the&#xD;
      alkalinity of wounds by analyzing the wound exudate adsorbed on to freshly discarded wound&#xD;
      dressings during the participants' routine follow-up visit. A follow-up visit and 7-21 days&#xD;
      after the initial wound diagnosis and care, subjects will be screened and enrolled in this&#xD;
      investigation based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Their wound dressings will be&#xD;
      tested using the device. The device outputs and wound conditions will be recorded. The&#xD;
      subjects' wounds will be managed using standard care by the provider at each visit. The&#xD;
      device output will not be used to inform the treatment decision in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 12 weeks after initial wound diagnosis, the subjects will be required to present&#xD;
      themselves for a follow-up/end of study wound healing status assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device outputs will then be compared to the clinical healing status of the wounds (healed&#xD;
      or not healed) at week 12. For the study, a healed wound is defined as one that has achieved&#xD;
      complete wound closure that is defined as skin re-epithelialization without drainage or&#xD;
      dressing requirements (100% of the wound is covered and the surface is intact), as assessed&#xD;
      by the treating clinician.&#xD;
