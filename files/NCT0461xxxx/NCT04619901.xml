  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Palliative care is now an accepted principle in most maternity and neonatology wards, however&#xD;
      not much is known about its psychological and social consequences on families. Some children&#xD;
      continue their life after a palliative care decision has been taken. In France, quality of&#xD;
      life and the neuro-developmental evolution of newborns who continue their life after a&#xD;
      palliative care decision has been taken, have never been studied.&#xD;
