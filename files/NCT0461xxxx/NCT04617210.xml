  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to establish the risk factors, in particular the modifiable risk factors,&#xD;
      for the development of POD in elderly patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery in a&#xD;
      tertiary hospital in Singapore.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To establish the incidence of POD in elderly patients in Singapore, including the&#xD;
           proportions that develop hypoactive, hyperactive and mixed delirium, as well as dementia&#xD;
           within a one-year follow-up period;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To understand the timeline of the development and peak incidence of POD, from the&#xD;
           post-anaesthesia care unit till 3 days postoperatively;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the utility and accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of two simplified&#xD;
           delirium detection tools, 3D CAM and NuDESC, against the gold standard DSM-5 criteria,&#xD;
           in our population as a means for monitoring POD as standard of care in the future;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To collect data for holistic evaluation of neurobehavioural and daily functioning status&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Singapore's population is growing older and increasingly burdened with systemic disease. It&#xD;
      is estimated that over 320 million people underwent surgery worldwide in 2010, with Asia&#xD;
      being the fastest growing region. Elderly patients aged &gt;65 years are presenting for surgery&#xD;
      at an ever-increasing rate. In the United States, studies have estimated that approximately&#xD;
      53% of all surgical procedures are performed on patients over the age of 65. Projections&#xD;
      estimate that approximately half of the population over the age of 65 will require surgery&#xD;
      once in their lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We often hear from our elderly patients that they value their quality of life more than&#xD;
      prolonging it. Therefore it is essential that we optimize the care in the perioperative&#xD;
      period to allow patients to fully benefit from surgery, as this period profoundly impacts&#xD;
      survival and quality of life of patients after surgery. There is a current focus on enhanced&#xD;
      recovery after surgery (ERAS) where surgeons implement protocols such as improved analgesia,&#xD;
      less invasive procedures and early mobilisation to encourage earlier discharge of post op&#xD;
      patients. In the best practice guidelines for care of elderly surgical patients put forward&#xD;
      by the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP)&#xD;
      and the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) published in 2012, anaesthesia plays a role in more&#xD;
      than half of the 13 recommendations put forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of these recommendations is to reduce postoperative delirium (POD). The anaesthetic&#xD;
      agents we use is toxic to the brain, and deep anaesthesia causes POD, which is linked to&#xD;
      increased hospital length of stay, increased 30-day mortality, and dementia. POD is one of&#xD;
      the leading causes of why patients fall at home after surgery. Up to 10% will develop&#xD;
      long-term neurocognitive deficits, which in turn diminish the quality of life and levy a&#xD;
      tremendous socio-economic burden on family and care-givers, and shortens life. The topic of&#xD;
      POD has dominated the anaesthesia literature in the last year, with both the US and European&#xD;
      societies issuing best practice guidelines such as the Brain Health Initiative and the Safe&#xD;
      Brain Initiative, as well as harmonization of the definitions of postoperative neurological&#xD;
      outcomes with that used by neurologists in compliance with DSM-5 definitions to allow for&#xD;
      collaborative solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Awareness of POD remains poor amongst both doctors and the public. The reason for this is&#xD;
      that POD requires specialized neurological testing and currently, there are no established&#xD;
      biomarkers or monitors to detect it. Yet when patients are assessed for POD, it has been&#xD;
      reported that it occurs in as many as 11-50% of patients undergoing major non-cardiac&#xD;
      surgery. Studies have shown that up to 40% of POD is preventable. Anecdotally, POD is one of&#xD;
      the leading reasons for in-hospital (blue letter) psychiatric referrals after surgery in&#xD;
      NUHS, as delirious patients will refuse to comply with physiotherapy, medications and wound&#xD;
      care, leading to delayed healing, infection and delayed discharge. Patients are not routinely&#xD;
      assessed for POD, and can be discharged with it. Patients who are still delirious can end up&#xD;
      with poor feeding and self-care, and even hurt themselves leading to rehospitalisation. In&#xD;
      short, POD is a common yet under-diagnosed, and potentially preventable, complication of&#xD;
      anaesthesia and surgery in the elderly that has significant long-term effects on the&#xD;
      independence of patients after surgery and their quality of life.&#xD;
