    <textblock>
      The quality control index based on artificial intelligence is put forward to monitor the&#xD;
      quality of enteroscopy. And we will verify the correlation between the detection rate of&#xD;
      adenomas and the percentage of endoscopic overspeed mirrors, the number of times of&#xD;
      no-return/successful return, the real-time Bowel preparation provided by EndoAngel. What's&#xD;
      more, it is expected that the standard range of quality control index for standard operation&#xD;
      of colonoscopy can be proposed according to the detection rate of adenomas.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is a key technique for detection and diagnosis of Lower Gastrointestinal&#xD;
      Diseases. High-quality endoscopy leads to better outcomes, However, the skill level of&#xD;
      different endoscopists is quite different. The rate of missed diagnosis of colorectal&#xD;
      ADENOMAS was 22%, the rate of missed diagnosis ranged from 7.4% to 52.5% . A series of&#xD;
      studies showed that 12.1% of patients did not have cancer during colonoscopy but were&#xD;
      diagnosed with colorectal cancer (post-colonoscopy Colorectal Cancer, PCCRC) within 5 years,&#xD;
      of which 71%-86% could be attributed to the negligence of the endoscopist 6, seven.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is very important to improve the quality of routine endoscopic examination&#xD;
      while expanding the endoscopic technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality control index of colonoscope can reflect the operation level of endoscopy&#xD;
      doctors, and it is a very important tool to ensure the quality of colonoscope. The&#xD;
      examination and feedback of the quality control data of the endoscopist can effectively&#xD;
      improve the detection rate of lesions and guarantee the high level of endoscopic quality. It&#xD;
      is the key to guarantee the quality of enteroscopy to put forward the quality control index&#xD;
      which can reflect the quality of endoscopist operation. Barclay proposed in 2006 that there&#xD;
      was a significant correlation between colonoscopy withdrawal time and the rate of Adenomas in&#xD;
      patients, and their findings were published in the The New England Journal of Medicine, with&#xD;
      an impact factor of 70.67. Then, there were 367 papers on the study of the speed of&#xD;
      enteroscopy withdrawal. Aslinia made a retrospective analysis of the correlation between the&#xD;
      incidence of blindness reached by enteroscopy and the prognosis of patients, and proposed the&#xD;
      incidence of blindness reached as a quality control index for enteroscopy. Other quality&#xD;
      control indicators, such as bowel cleanliness and polyp detection rate, have been published&#xD;
      in international well-known journals and included in the guidelines to regulate the quality&#xD;
      of daily work of endoscopic physicians, which has great clinical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, despite the above-mentioned quality control indicators, the existing endoscopic&#xD;
      quality control indicators are seriously inadequate. According to a multicenter clinical&#xD;
      study, current quality control indicators only reflect about 40% of the difference in lesion&#xD;
      detection levels between endoscopic physicians. The existence of this phenomenon indicated&#xD;
      that more quality control indexes are needed to fully reflect the quality of endoscopic&#xD;
      procedures. As a quality control index reflecting intestinal preparation, intestinal&#xD;
      cleanliness is a fatal defect with strong subjectivity and poor consistency among observers,&#xD;
      therefore, the existing colonoscopy need more comprehensive, objective quality control&#xD;
      indicators to reflect the level of endoscopic doctors, so as to ensure the quality of&#xD;
      colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI) has made remarkable progress in the medical&#xD;
      field. Andre Esteva used a deep neural network (DNN) to classify skin cancer with&#xD;
      expert-level accuracy. In the field of digestive endoscopy, the project team in the early is&#xD;
      made a huge breakthrough. In 2018, the artificial intelligence gastroscopy blind spot&#xD;
      monitoring model developed by the project team significantly reduced the endoscopy blind spot&#xD;
      in randomized controlled clinical trials, the findings were published in the journal Gut with&#xD;
      an impact factor of 17.94. In 2019, the team's artificial intelligence model for evaluating&#xD;
      gut cleanliness, published in the journal gastrogastrotestinal endoscopy with an impact&#xD;
      factor of 7.23, showed better picture accuracy than that of the endoscopist in the human&#xD;
      computer competition. In the same year, the project developed a model for colonoscopy speed&#xD;
      monitoring based on Hasche perception algorithm and a model for colonoscopy slide mirror&#xD;
      monitoring based on image classification, and conducted randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      trials, the model significantly improved The ability of colonoscopists to detect lesions, The&#xD;
      study was published in The Lancet Gastroenterology 18 with an impact factor of 12.87.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above-mentioned rich foundation of early work, as well as the current great&#xD;
      demand in the field of quality control of enteroscopy, we intend to validate the artificial&#xD;
      intelligence-based enteroscopy exit velocity, bowel cleanliness, and enteroscopy slide model&#xD;
      developed by the project team through a multi-center clinical study, to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility and accuracy of doctor's operation quality as a quality control index.&#xD;
