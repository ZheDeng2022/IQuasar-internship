      To compare dentoskeletal changes in patients with skeletal class II malocclusion induced due&#xD;
      to treatment with orthodontic appliances; removable twin block appliance and fixed AdvanSync2&#xD;
      appliance in two different age group patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      41% of total orthodontic cases in Pakistani population are of class II malocclusion. Class II&#xD;
      malocclusion is referred as maxillary protrusion, or mandibular retrusion, or combination of&#xD;
      both, which can be corrected by treating the skeletal and dento-alveolar discrepancies. Out&#xD;
      of many recommended treatment options, one can make use of either removable and/or fixed&#xD;
      functional appliances. In the past, headgear has been used as a classic appliance for the&#xD;
      correction of class II malocclusion. Other removable functional appliances (RFA) include&#xD;
      Frankel, bionator and sander bite jumping appliances. Jasper jumper, Herbst appliance and&#xD;
      mandibular protraction appliance (MPA) are the some of the fixed functional appliances (FFA)&#xD;
      used. All these modalities are designed to modify the arches by re-orienting their position&#xD;
      in both sagittal and vertical dimensions to bring about correction of main features of class&#xD;
      II malocclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AdvanSync2 (Ormco Co., Glendora, Calif) is a FFA being introduced recently as an advancement&#xD;
      of Herbst appliance. It is a molar-to-molar appliance, connected by a telescopic rod, which&#xD;
      allow for simultaneous treatment with braces. It is much smaller in size than the&#xD;
      conventional Herbst appliance and reduces treatment duration up to six to nine months. It is&#xD;
      much more acceptable by the patients as they complain less about sores and discomfort, and is&#xD;
      esthetically pleasant since it's not visible in the mouth. Short arms of this appliance help&#xD;
      to decrease irritation and discomfort of the patient, and helps to advance the mandible in a&#xD;
      constant forward direction to encourage growth, and reduce malocclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twin block appliance (RFA) was introduced by William Clark in 1988. Many modifications for&#xD;
      this appliance have been introduced lately. It has been named twin block for the&#xD;
      characteristic of two unattached maxillary and mandibular plates with acrylic bite blocks,&#xD;
      which makes 70o angle when come in contact with each other. This appliance is another&#xD;
      treatment modality for cases with class II malocclusions, which can be carried out at an&#xD;
      early age as well as the delayed treatment. However, delayed treatment was found to be much&#xD;
      better for the patients in terms of less orthodontic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AdvanSync2 appliance is a new treatment modality in orthodontics, and through thorough&#xD;
      literature search, no study could be found in regard to this appliance in Pakistani&#xD;
      population yet.Hence, the objective of this study was to compare dentoskeletal changes in&#xD;
      skeletal class II malocclusion induced due to treatment with removable twin block appliance&#xD;
      and fixed advanSync2 appliance in Pakistani population.&#xD;
