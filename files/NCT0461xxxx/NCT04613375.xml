  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multicenter, prospective, epidemiological, hospital-based surveillance study involving adults&#xD;
      60 years of age and older hospitalized with CAP in the participating hospital sites.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      PCV13 efficacy for the prevention of vaccine-type community-acquired pneumonia (VT-CAP) and&#xD;
      invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) was established in the Community-acquired Pneumonia&#xD;
      Immunization Trial in Adults (CAPITA) aged 65 and older. However, there are still few&#xD;
      available real-life effectiveness estimates in adults. The aim of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the PCV13 vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospitalised VT-pneumococcal CAP among adults&#xD;
      aged ≥60 years in the Region of Madrid (Spain). Determination of the effectiveness of PCV13&#xD;
      to prevent hospitalised vaccine-type (VT)-pneumococcal CAP among adults aged ≥60 years in&#xD;
      Madrid will be evaluated using a test- negative design study, overall and among&#xD;
      immunocompetent persons only.&#xD;
