    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study designed to evaluate the safety and performance of the HiResTM&#xD;
      Ultra Cl HiFocusTM MS Electrode and HiResTM Ultra 3D Cl HiFocusTM MS Electrode (Ultra X)&#xD;
      under normal conditions of use as it is approved for this device.&#xD;

      This study is set up to document any adverse events and comparing pre- to post-implant&#xD;
      benefit to subjects. Any adverse events associated with the device will be documented via&#xD;
      Advanced Bionics complaint handling system for the lifetime of the device. A within-subjects&#xD;
      repeated-measures design will be employed. Speech perception will be evaluated preoperatively&#xD;
      with conventional amplification to determine candidacy and to establish baseline performance.&#xD;
      Efficacy parameters are speech perception data which will be collected according to clinical&#xD;
      routine with a 6 month follow up period. Subjects will be implanted unilaterally with the&#xD;
      Ultra X according to standard clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy objective is to demonstrate that mean monosyllabic word recognition&#xD;
      score with the Ultra X used in combination with a sound processor programmed with the latest&#xD;
      fitting software six months after activation is at least 20% better than the mean word score&#xD;
      at baseline with conventional amplification in the same ear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint is reached six months after device activation.&#xD;
