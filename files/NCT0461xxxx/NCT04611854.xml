  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) shows promise as a method of treating&#xD;
      alcohol misuse. In this form of treatment, patients complete online lessons over several&#xD;
      weeks that assist patients in developing skills to address alcohol misuse. ICBT can be&#xD;
      offered to patients in a self-guided format or with guidance. Self-guided ICBT allows users&#xD;
      to complete lessons by themselves without any contact with a guide. Guided ICBT involves&#xD;
      having support from a guide in the form of emails, online messages and/or brief telephone&#xD;
      calls. In some studies, guided-ICBT has shown greater reductions in alcohol consumption than&#xD;
      self-guided ICBT. To date, there has been limited research on patient preferences for these&#xD;
      varying levels of support when ICBT is offered as part of routine health care. This&#xD;
      represents an important research direction as there is some past research showing that&#xD;
      patients' treatment preferences can affect study enrollment, attrition, adherence,&#xD;
      satisfaction, and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate patient preferences for self-guided ICBT versus guided-ICBT and&#xD;
      compare enrollment, attrition, adherence, and outcomes of the two approaches when patients&#xD;
      select their treatment preferences. The study will also explore the extent to which&#xD;
      preferences are related to patient background variables (e.g., duration, severity of&#xD;
      problems, treatment goals in terms of patients wanting to cut-down on alcohol use versus to&#xD;
      abstain from alcohol use). Furthermore, this study seeks to identify how ratings of effort&#xD;
      and helpfulness throughout treatment vary depending on whether patients select self-guided&#xD;
      versus guided ICBT. This study represents a pragmatic observational trial conducted in&#xD;
      routine care and aims to increase understanding of how to implement ICBT within routine care.&#xD;

    <description>Participants who select this arm will receive the 8-week internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) course for alcohol misuse. Participants are able to contact the Online Therapy Unit regarding any technical issues with logging onto the site. However, no guidance from a health educator will be provided. Clients will be monitored by providing brief measures on alcohol each week and measures of depression and anxiety administered at the beginning of week 5. However, clients will only be contacted if there is a significant clinical issue requiring attention (e.g., sudden increase in symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation).</description>
