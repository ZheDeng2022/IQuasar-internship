  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to enhance the care of older metastatic gastric cancer (mGC)&#xD;
      patients by increasing awareness among oncology providers of the unique aspects of care&#xD;
      required for older patients. The goal of the study is to educate providers on the utility of&#xD;
      geriatric assessment in guiding therapy of older mGC patients. The investigators will also&#xD;
      assess the feasibility and benefit of incorporating geriatric self-assessments into clinical&#xD;
      practice. The study will include four phases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older oncology patients pose a significant treatment challenge due to poor chemotherapy&#xD;
      tolerance as a result of underlying co-morbidities, lack of social support, and diminished&#xD;
      functional reserve. Oncologists are faced with the challenge of differentiating between&#xD;
      patients that can and cannot tolerate chemotherapy, and tailoring therapy to the patient's&#xD;
      biologic rather than chronologic age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant challenge that surrounds the treatment of the older metastatic gastric cancer&#xD;
      (mGC) patient in particular, lies in the lack of evidence based clinical data to guide the&#xD;
      oncologist in determination of a treatment plan. This is a result of under representation of&#xD;
      older patients in clinical trials. Due to these challenges, a thorough evaluation of the&#xD;
      older patient is recommended prior to initiation of anti-cancer therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to enhance the care of the older mGC patient by&#xD;
      increasing awareness among oncology providers of the unique aspects of care required for&#xD;
      older patients. The goal of the study is to educate providers on the utility of geriatric&#xD;
      assessment in guiding therapy of older metastatic gastric cancer patients. The investigators&#xD;
      will also assess the feasibility and benefit of incorporating geriatric self-assessments into&#xD;
      clinical practice. The study will include four phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Needs assessments - to understand the population of older gastric cancer patients seen&#xD;
           in routine practice at community and academic centers, and assess their treatment&#xD;
           approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Educational programming about management of older metastatic gastric cancer patients,&#xD;
           and geriatric assessment of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Active testing of the use of geriatric assessment in clinical practice, including an&#xD;
           exploratory analysis to evaluate the use of fitness trackers for evaluation of&#xD;
           functional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Short-term follow-up chart reviews (2-3 months post intervention) to assess for actual&#xD;
           implementation of recommended interventions identified by the geriatric assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate goal is to expand this educational intervention to other oncology practices&#xD;
      beyond those participating in this study, and for all older cancer patients regardless of&#xD;
      their disease site. During this study period we will identify the specific gaps that exist in&#xD;
      each practice for the care of older patients with mGC. This information is crucial to&#xD;
      understand the needs of this patient population and will inform future trials with possible&#xD;
      intervention. The second phase of our study will expose the practices to the use of a&#xD;
      geriatric assessment through a patient's self-assessment tool and demonstrate its&#xD;
      feasibility. Our hope is that all involved practices will find benefit from incorporating a&#xD;
      geriatric assessment into their practice and will continue to use it in the future.&#xD;
