    <textblock>
      This phase I trial identifies the best dose, possible benefits and/or side effects of&#xD;
      gemcitabine in combination with BAY 1895344 in treating patients with pancreatic, ovarian,&#xD;
      and other solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body (advanced). Gemcitabine&#xD;
      is a chemotherapy drug that blocks the cell from making DNA and may kill tumor cells. BAY&#xD;
      1895344 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth. Giving gemcitabine and BAY 1895344 in combination may shrink or stabilize cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of gemcitabine in combination with elimusertib (BAY&#xD;
      1895344), as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 5.0. (Dose&#xD;
      Escalation and Expansion Cohort) II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      gemcitabine in combination with BAY 1895344. (Dose Escalation Cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. Analyze the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of&#xD;
      the gemcitabine and BAY 1895344 combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assessing whether immunohistochemical markers of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage,&#xD;
      gamma-H2AX and phosphorylated (p)NBS1, increase in on-treatment biopsies compared to the&#xD;
      levels seen in pre-treatment biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Explore biomarkers that predict response to this combination. II. Evaluate mechanisms of&#xD;
      acquired resistance to this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of gemcitabine followed by a dose expansion study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive gemcitabine intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and BAY&#xD;
      1895344 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-3 and 8-10. Cycles repeat every 21 days in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;

             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this&#xD;
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled&#xD;
             on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation, and 6 months after completion of BAY 1895344&#xD;
             administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) with the exception of alopecia and&#xD;
             lymphopenia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must not have received investigational therapy administered =&lt; 4 weeks or&#xD;
             within a time interval less than at least five half-lives of the investigational&#xD;

             therapeutic window, or strong inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible, if they&#xD;
             cannot be transferred to alternative medication. Because the lists of these agents are&#xD;
             constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical&#xD;
             reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be&#xD;
             counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new&#xD;
             medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new&#xD;
             over-the-counter medicine or herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to ongoing&#xD;
             or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;
             clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia, uncontrolled major seizure disorder,&#xD;
             unstable spinal cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements are&#xD;
             excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because BAY 1895344 as a DNA-damage&#xD;
             response inhibitor, and gemcitabine may have the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with BAY 1895344&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with BAY 1895344 and for&#xD;
             4 months after end of treatment. These potential risks may also apply to other agents&#xD;
             used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have successfully undergone treatment for another, unrelated clinically&#xD;
             relevant cancer, &gt;= 3 years post final treatment, are eligible to participate in this&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients cannot have received radiation to more than 25% of their hematopoietically&#xD;
             active bone marrow. Pelvic radiation is considered to affect 25% of the&#xD;
             haematopoietically active bone marrow, and only one prior course of pelvic radiation&#xD;
             is allowed (Hayman et al., 2011)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients previously treated with an ATR inhibitor are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have undergone major surgery =&lt; 4 weeks before initiating protocol&#xD;
             therapy must have sufficiently recovered from adverse events caused by the procedure,&#xD;
             as judged by the treating investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a gastrointestinal disorder or malabsorption that could potentially&#xD;
             affect the absorption of the study drug are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a history of a clinically relevant second primary malignancy within&#xD;
             the past 2 years are excluded. Exceptions include resected basal and squamous cell&#xD;
             carcinomas of the skin and completely resected carcinoma in situ of any type&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients not able to swallow tablets&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the Dose Expansion Cohort, patients who cannot safely undergo tumor biopsies are&#xD;
             excluded&#xD;
