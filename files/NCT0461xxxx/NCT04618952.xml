    <textblock>
      Triple-blind randomized clinical trial were performed on 98 hypertensive women of&#xD;
      postmenopausal ages in 2019. They were randomly divided into a control group of 50 members&#xD;
      and a treatment group of 48 members. Randomization was based on block randomization method&#xD;
      with block size=2 and ratio 2:2 for drug and placebo. To achieve triple blinding, patients&#xD;
      were divided into &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; groups(by the mentioned randomization method). &quot;A&quot; was assigned&#xD;
      to treatment and &quot;B&quot; to placebo but this assignment was not revealed to the patients, trial&#xD;
      conductors and result assessors till the end of data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral calcium-D supplements were given to the treatment group in the form of tablets named&#xD;
      Vana FlexÂ® from Vana Darou Gostar Co. (VDG Co.). Each tablet contained 500 milligrams of&#xD;
      calcium carbonate and 200 international units (IU) of vitamin D3(cholecalciferol). The&#xD;
      placebo pills for the control group were chose in a way that looked similar to the calcium-D&#xD;
      tablets in shape and color. The placebo tablets we used in this trial were made up of&#xD;
      magnesium stearate 0.2 %, starch 10%, avicel 30%, and lactose 60%. The calcium-D and placebo&#xD;
      tablets were both packed identically in order to assure blindness and the patients were told&#xD;
      to take one tablet per day. The treatment and placebo group started drugs beside their&#xD;
      previous hypertension medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      24-hour Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was done primarily for all of the&#xD;
      participants to record the initial blood pressure of patients and after completion of study&#xD;
      period&#xD;
