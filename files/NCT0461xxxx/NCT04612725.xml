      The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of benralizumab is effective in the&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to investigate the use of benralizumab as treatment for patients&#xD;
      with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) who are symptomatic despite the use of&#xD;
      antihistamines. It is proposed that benralizumab will deplete eosinophils and basophils from&#xD;
      affected skin, improve symptoms of CSU, and improve CSU-related quality of life. This Phase&#xD;
      2b study is designed to evaluate induction and maintenance dosing regimens.&#xD;

                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal&#xD;

             participation in the study, or may influence the results of the study, or the&#xD;
             participant's ability to complete entire duration of the study.&#xD;
