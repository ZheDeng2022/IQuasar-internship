      We will be assessing for improvement in reported symptoms as well as reported quality of life&#xD;
      in pediatric patients with functional constipation using a constipation action plan and an&#xD;
      adherence log.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional Constipation is one of the most common chief complaints for both the general&#xD;
      pediatrician and the pediatric gastroenterologist. Treatment for this disorder is&#xD;
      multifactorial, and usually involves different medications combined with behavioral&#xD;
      techniques, depending on the severity of the underlying constipation. Studies have shown that&#xD;
      medication compliance is one of the strongest predictors of successful treatment, but&#xD;
      maintaining good medication adherence at home is uncommon for a variety of reasons. In this&#xD;
      study, the investigators are aiming to improve home medication adherence for functional&#xD;
      constipation to improve treatment outcomes. The investigators will be administering surveys&#xD;
      for all enrolled participants to determine the child's and family's overall quality of life&#xD;
      related to functional constipation. For the treatment group, the investigators will be&#xD;
      providing tools to help with medication adherence. This will include a daily log to determine&#xD;
      symptom severity, along with an &quot;action plan&quot; with instructions for how to adjust medicines,&#xD;
      if necessary, depending on symptoms. By empowering families with this knowledge and&#xD;
      medication roadmap, the investigators hypothesize that there will be overall symptomatic&#xD;
      improvement in functional constipation, along with improved quality of life for both the&#xD;
      patient and their family. The investigators will measure adherence (by reviewing symptom log&#xD;
      and action plan at 2-month and 4-month follow up appointments.) with the treatment group. The&#xD;
      investigators will be measuring overall quality of life and symptom improvement using a&#xD;
      validated pediatric constipation quality of life survey (PedsQL GI) with both the treatment&#xD;
      group and the control group at follow up appointments.&#xD;
