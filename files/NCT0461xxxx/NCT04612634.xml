    <textblock>
      Subjects will be recruited and divided into 3 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hepatitis A（Live）Vaccine，Freeze-dried produced by Changchun Institute of Biological&#xD;
           Products Co., Ltd&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hepatitis A（Live）Vaccine，Freeze-dried produced by Zhejiang Pukang Biotechnology Co.,&#xD;
           Ltd., and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hepatitis A（Live）Vaccine，Freeze-dried produced by Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese&#xD;
           Academy of Medical Sciences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After immunization, the immunogenicity and safety of three different manufacturers will be&#xD;
      compared and the data will be analyzed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Hepatitis A (Live) Vaccine, Freeze-dried&#xD;
      produced by Changchhun Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd, we design this randomized,&#xD;
      parallel controlled study. 450 subjects are divided into 3 groups, including 1 experimental&#xD;
      group and 2 control groups (Research Group 1, 2, and 3), each group assigned 150 subjects&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects are aged 18-24 months old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      150 subjects from Research Group 1 will be administrated with one dose of Hepatitis A (Live)&#xD;
      Vaccine, Freeze-dried produced by Changchhun Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd. Blood&#xD;
      samples are collected before vaccination and one month (30 days) later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      150 subjects from Research Group 2 will be administrated with one dose of Hepatitis&#xD;
      A（Live）Vaccine，Freeze-dried produced by Zhejiang Pukang Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Blood samples&#xD;
      are collected before vaccination and one month (30 days) later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      150 subjects from Research Group 3 will be administrated with one dose of Hepatitis A (Live)&#xD;
      Vaccine, Freeze-dried produced by Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical&#xD;
      Sciences. Blood samples are collected before vaccination and one month (30 days) later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the immunogenicity, we will detect and compare the seroconversion rates, and&#xD;
      antibody geometric mean concentrations. The safety of all groups will be monitored as well.&#xD;
