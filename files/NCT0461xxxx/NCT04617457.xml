      This is an interventional, open-label, non-randomised, multicentre, single-arm phase II&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients with hepatic oligometastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas will receive&#xD;
      neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy (liposomal irinotecan, oxaliplatin, 5-fluouracil,&#xD;
      folinic acid (NAPOX)) in cycles of 14 days. Patients with tumour response or stable disease&#xD;
      and a resectable primary tumour after the first 4 cycles will undergo explorative laparotomy&#xD;
      and synchronous resection of the tumour and hepatic metastases, if feasible; these patients&#xD;
      may receive 4 more cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy 2-4 weeks after the explorative&#xD;
      laparotomy if the surgeon rated the primary tumour as non-resectable during the explorative&#xD;
      laparotomy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an interventional, open-label, non-randomised, multicentre, single-arm phase II&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients with hepatic oligometastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas will receive&#xD;
      neoadjuvant NAPOX chemotherapy in cycles of 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with progressive disease during or after the first 4 cycles, neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy will be permanently discontinued. Patients with tumour response or stable&#xD;
      disease after the first 4 cycles according to RECIST v1.1 but a non-resectable primary tumour&#xD;
      according to the evaluation of an interdisciplinary tumour board will receive 4 more cycles&#xD;
      of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with tumour response or stable disease and a resectable&#xD;
      primary tumour after the first 4 cycles will undergo explorative laparotomy and synchronous&#xD;
      resection of the tumour and hepatic metastases, if feasible; these patients may receive 4&#xD;
      more cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy 2-4 weeks after the explorative laparotomy if the&#xD;
      surgeon rated the primary tumour as non-resectable during the explorative laparotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who receive a total of 8 cycles and who then have tumour response or stable&#xD;
      disease according to RECIST v1.1 will undergo exploratory laparotomy surgery and synchronous&#xD;
      resection of the tumour and hepatic metastases, if feasible according to the surgeon, 2-6&#xD;
      weeks after the last investigational medicinal product (IMP) treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the clinical trial is overall survival of patients with an R0/R1&#xD;
      resection after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IMP treatment will be discontinued if tumour progression or inacceptable toxicity occurs&#xD;
      or other termination criteria apply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjuvant treatment will not be part of the trial treatment and may be given at the&#xD;
      investigator's discretion in accordance with the Onkopedia guideline for pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumour, stool and blood samples will be collected before start and during the clinical trial&#xD;
      for translational research if the patient gives his/her consent to participating in the&#xD;
      translational research programme.&#xD;

             inclusion criterion if a hepatic metastasis was partly or entirely removed as part of&#xD;
             the diagnosis and is thus not detectable by CT/MRI and/or contrast-enhanced ultrasound&#xD;
             scan at screening. Note 2: If more than 5 metastases are unexpectedly detected during&#xD;
             surgery, it is not a violation of this inclusion criterion if the excess metastases&#xD;
