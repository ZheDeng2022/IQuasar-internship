      Preprocedural predictors of outcome in patients with acute basilar artery occlusion (ABAO)&#xD;
      who underwent endovascular treatment (EVT) remain controversial. Our aim was to analyze if&#xD;
      pre-EVT diffusion-weighted images cerebellar infarct volume (CIV) was a predictor of 90-day&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute basilar artery occlusion (ABAO) is a rare and devastating type of stroke. Endovascular&#xD;
      treatment (EVT) is routinely performed in real-world practice, encouraged by guidelines from&#xD;
      learned societies, and the recent result of the basilar artery international cooperation&#xD;
      study (BASICS), a randomized controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABAO may result in infarcts in the brainstem, cerebellar lobes, thalamus and subthalamic&#xD;
      area, or occipitotemporal lobes. Previously, studies using the DWI Posterior-circulation&#xD;
      Alberta Stroke Program Early CT (Pc-ASPECT) Score or brainstem score, for predicting outcome&#xD;
      in patients with ABAO showed conflicting results. The rational for the brainstem scoring&#xD;
      system was based on the anatomic architecture and the regional eloquence of brainstem, which&#xD;
      may negatively influence functional outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, one of the most significant and immediate dreaded complication, in patients&#xD;
      with ABAO and cerebellar infarcts, is the development of a space-occupying edema. Due to the&#xD;
      small volume of posterior fossa, cerebellar infarct with mass effect (CIMASS) contribute to a&#xD;
      risk of catastrophic herniation with direct brainstem compression, hydrocephalus due to&#xD;
      blockage of the fourth ventricle, or both. Up to 25% of patients with CIMASS deteriorate&#xD;
      clinically resulting in morbidity and in mortality in 85% of patients without intervention.&#xD;
      This potential risk of CIMASS, lead clinicians to strengthen clinical and radiological&#xD;
      monitoring and modify therapeutic management with the recourse of live-saving suboccipital&#xD;
      decompressive craniectomy (SDC), as recommended by learned societies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now, little is known about predicting factors of outcomes in patients with ABAO treated&#xD;
      by EVT and associated cerebellar infarct. In fact, there are no focusing research to assess&#xD;
      if baseline cerebellar infarct volume (CIV) may correlate with 90-day clinical outcome and&#xD;
      mortality, nor if such lesions would affect a reperfusion decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using data of our prospective registry, the investigators analyzed consecutive MRI selected,&#xD;
      endovascularly treated ABAO patients within the first 24h after symptom-onset. Using the&#xD;
      initial Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), baseline CIV was calculated in mL, on an apparent&#xD;
      diffusion-coefficient map reconstruction (Olea sphere software).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CIV was analyzed in univariate and multivariable models as a predictor of 90-day functional&#xD;
      independence (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 0-2) and mortality. According to received operating&#xD;
      characteristic (ROC) analysis, the optimal cut-off was determined by maximizing the youden&#xD;
      index, to evaluate the prognostic value of CIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim was to evaluate the frequency, the clinical, and radiological characteristics of&#xD;
      cerebellar infarct, in a large cohort of ABAO selected by MRI prior to EVT, and to&#xD;
      investigate the baseline CIV as a predictor of 90-day functional outcome and mortality.&#xD;
