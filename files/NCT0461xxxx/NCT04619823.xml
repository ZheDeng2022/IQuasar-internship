  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arboviruses, diseases transmitted to humans by the bite of an insect vector, are a major&#xD;
      public health problem, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical countries. In New Caledonia,&#xD;
      dengue epidemics are recurrent and may be associated with the co-circulation of other&#xD;
      arboviruses such as Zika or chikungunya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The virological determinants which condition the occurrence of these epidemics may be linked&#xD;
      to an increased vectorial competence of the vector mosquito Aedes aegypti for a particular&#xD;
      viral isolate. In fact, the Aedes aegypti mosquito is infected by making a blood meal on a&#xD;
      person infected with an arbovirus. The virus infects its digestive tract, then spreads&#xD;
      throughout the mosquito's body until it reaches its salivary glands. The virus is then&#xD;
      present in the saliva and will be injected into the human host during a new blood meal. Some&#xD;
      viral variants are best transmitted by Aedes aegypti. In general, the study of this vectorial&#xD;
      competence is carried out by experiments in the laboratory during which an artificial blood&#xD;
      meal composed of mammalian blood (human, rabbit, etc.) is mixed with a viral stock. Carrying&#xD;
      out deported blood meals during which blood collected from patients infected with an&#xD;
      arbovirus is used to gorge mosquitoes makes it possible to place oneself in experimental&#xD;
      conditions as close as possible to the natural cycle of transmission of arboviruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the human host, cells of the myeloid lineage present in the peripheral blood constitute&#xD;
      preferred targets of replication for arboviruses. At the same time, the peripheral blood&#xD;
      cells of patients are activated in response to infection and secrete many soluble factors&#xD;
      released into the blood of patients. The study of blood samples from patients infected with&#xD;
      arboviruses is therefore of prime importance for understanding both the replicative&#xD;
      mechanisms of arboviruses but also the immune response they induce.&#xD;

      Collection of blood samples from adult patients with clinical signs suggestive of arbovirus&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a interventional study that present minimal risks and constraints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will improve :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the reliability of the results of vector competence experiments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the understanding of the mechanisms of infection and replication of arboviruses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the knowledge of the immune mechanisms involved in the response to infection by an&#xD;
           arbovirus&#xD;
