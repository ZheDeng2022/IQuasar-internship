    <textblock>
      Interleukin (IL)-5 is the main cytokine responsible for the activation of eosinophils, hence&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies have been investigated and developed for clinical use. Biologics&#xD;
      targeting IL-5 and its receptor (first mepolizumab and subsequently, reslizumab and&#xD;
      benralizumab), have been recently approved and used as add-on therapy for severe eosinophilic&#xD;
      asthma resulting in a reduction in the circulating eosinophil count, improvement in lung&#xD;
      function and exacerbation reduction in patients with severe asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response to biologic therapies in severe asthma is variable, with patients being either&#xD;
      non-responders, responders or super-responders. There is currently no explanation for this&#xD;
      broad variation in response. It is important to examine whether these patients have distinct&#xD;
      characteristics that could help the treating physician in making the correct diagnosis in&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this clinical study is to evaluate the efficacy of mepolizumab, a humanized IL-5&#xD;
      antagonist monoclonal antibody in patients with late-onset severe eosinophilic asthma with&#xD;
      fixed obstruction and to identify the characteristics of non-responders and super-responders&#xD;
      under mepolizumab treatment. This study is considered as non-interventional and every&#xD;
      procedure included is happening in a clinical routine for the diagnosis and phenotyping of&#xD;
      the asthmatic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis includes the efficacy of mepolizumab treatment in late-onset severe eosinophilic&#xD;
      asthmatic patients with fixed obstruction and relation to clinical and inflammatory&#xD;
      biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be collected from the outpatient clinics of bronchial asthma from each site&#xD;
      included (8 in number) which cover the whole population of Greece.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, this is a prospective multicenter study including eight Pulmonary Clinics. Five&#xD;
      Pulmonary University Clinics, two of National Health System and one Army General Hospital in&#xD;
      Thessaloniki. The study will include a screening period of up to 2 weeks to assess&#xD;
      eligibility and obtain written informed consent, a mepolizumab treatment period of 52 weeks,&#xD;
      once every 4 weeks, including follow up visits every 3 months during treatment. The study&#xD;
      population will consist of 45 patients with late-onset severe eosinophilic asthma and fixed&#xD;
      obstruction receiving mepolizumab, aged 20 and above.&#xD;

      Scientific rationale Interleukin (IL)-5 is the main cytokine responsible for the activation&#xD;
      of eosinophils, hence therapeutic strategies have been investigated and developed for&#xD;
      clinical use. Biologics targeting IL-5 and its receptor (first mepolizumab and subsequently,&#xD;
      reslizumab and benralizumab), have been recently approved and used as add-on therapy for&#xD;
      severe eosinophilic asthma resulting in a reduction in the circulating eosinophil count,&#xD;
      improvement in lung function and exacerbation reduction in patients with severe asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response to biologic therapies in severe asthma is variable, with patients being either&#xD;
      non-responders, responders or super-responders. There is currently no explanation for this&#xD;
      broad variation in response. It is important to examine whether these patients have distinct&#xD;
      characteristics that could help the treating physician in making the correct diagnosis in&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this clinical study is to evaluate the efficacy of mepolizumab, a humanized IL-5&#xD;
      antagonist monoclonal antibody in patients with late-onset severe eosinophilic asthma with&#xD;
      fixed obstruction and to identify the characteristics of non-responders and super-responders&#xD;
      under mepolizumab treatment. This study is considered as non-interventional and every&#xD;
      procedure included is happening in a clinical routine for the diagnosis and phenotyping of&#xD;
      the asthmatic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several methods are used to investigate airway inflammation: direct measurements (like&#xD;
      bronchial biopsies or bronchoalveolar lavages) and indirect methods (like symptom assessment,&#xD;
      blood sample analysis and lung function tests). The direct techniques have the advantage of&#xD;
      reliably assessing the airway inflammation, but they are invasive and not feasible at large&#xD;
      scale because of patient discomfort and the risk incurred. As for the indirect methods, they&#xD;
      poorly correlate with the direct assessment of airway inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, among patients' clinical characteristics spirometry, biomarkers of&#xD;
      inflammation (blood eosinophils, FeNO, IgE levels), impulse oscillometry (IOS) and the&#xD;
      thickening of basement membrane via bronchoscopy will be evaluated. It is suggested that&#xD;
      late-onset severe eosinophilic asthmatic patients with fixed obstruction who do not respond&#xD;
      to the usual treatment (ICS/LABA/LAMA) appear with increased smooth muscle mass. However, the&#xD;
      precise effects of increased airway smooth muscle mass on airway narrowing are not known and&#xD;
      may vary with disease severity. In addition, biomarkers of inflammation will also be&#xD;
      evaluated before and after 52-week mepolizumab treatment in biological fluids (serum, sputum,&#xD;
      sputum supernatant and bronchial samples). Biomarkers of inflammation are very important to&#xD;
      identify responders to non-responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More specific, IOS has been introduced as an alternative technique to assess lung function&#xD;
      with particular application to asthma. This technique is noninvasive, easily performed during&#xD;
      tidal breathing and requires only minimal patient cooperation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sputum collection is another way to sample cells from the airways and allows the direct&#xD;
      assessment of airway inflammation. Furthermore, examples with sputum supernatant include the&#xD;
      analysis of mediators and the assessment of the chemotactic activity of the sample for&#xD;
      eosinophils. The sputum cells can also be analyzed by flow cytometry which allows, among&#xD;
      others, immunophenotyping and sorting cells. Furthermore, sputum cells can be cultured, and&#xD;
      their mediator production can be measured in vitro. It is worth noting that in this case, the&#xD;
      mediator content is different from what can be found in sputum supernatant. Indeed, mediators&#xD;
      in sputum supernatant may be influenced by secretions from airway resident cells and by&#xD;
      plasma exudation, contrary to the sputum cell culture model. Finally, immunocytochemistry and&#xD;
      in situ hybridization can also be performed using sputum cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although phenotypes, blood eosinophils, and serum IgE levels have been proposed for use as a&#xD;
      reference, there is a dissociation between the blood immune-cell level and the airway&#xD;
      epithelium immune reaction, as confirmed in previous studies. Airway epithelium&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry staining for targeted immune cells has been used to determine various&#xD;
      types of airway inflammation; however, this technique is rarely used in a clinical setting.&#xD;
      Previous studies have revealed the relative safety of performing bronchoscopy biopsies for&#xD;
      patients with severe asthma. Among the sampling techniques used for tissue diagnosis,&#xD;
      including nasal biopsies, nasal or bronchial brushing, and bronchoalveolar lavage,&#xD;
      bronchoscopy-guided bronchial epithelium sampling provides more accurate information about&#xD;
      the epithelial and inflammatory cells in the tissue context. It is thus a powerful tool for&#xD;
      selecting the most suitable biologics in difficult clinical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides, asthmatic disease is characterized by a chronic mucosal inflammatory process, which&#xD;
      results in irreversible changes of the bronchial wall, known today as &quot;bronchial remodeling&quot;.&#xD;
      Glandular and smooth muscle fibers hyperplasia and/or hypertrophy, goblet cells hyperplasia,&#xD;
      and variable thickening of basement membrane (BM) present under the respiratory epithelium&#xD;
      are part of these morphological changes. the changes generated at the epithelium-connective&#xD;
      interface account for an &quot;adaptive response&quot; to inflammatory stress and sporadic&#xD;
      bronchoconstriction. However, current data on BM reactivity in asthmatic patient are still&#xD;
      incomplete for an accurate assessment of its involvement in pathogenesis and specifically in&#xD;
      bronchial wall remodeling, mainly as collagen deposits in lamina reticularis are not&#xD;
      correlated to the degree of disease severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, it is increasingly evident that severe asthma is not a single disease, as evidenced&#xD;
      by the variety of clinical presentations, physiologic characteristics, and outcomes seen in&#xD;
      patients with asthma. To better understand this heterogeneity, the concept of asthma&#xD;
      phenotyping and endotyping has emerged. Phenotyping integrates both biological and clinical&#xD;
      features, from molecular, cellular, morphologic, and functional to patient-oriented&#xD;
      characteristics with the goal to improve therapy. Ultimately, these phenotypes evolve into&#xD;
      asthma &quot;endotypes,&quot; which combine clinical characteristics with identifiable mechanistic&#xD;
      pathways. Biomarkers, defined as characteristics that can be objectively measured and serve&#xD;
      as an indicator of underlying biological processes or pathogenesis, are crucial in defining&#xD;
      phenotypes and endotypes. In asthma, genetic polymorphisms, measures of airway physiology,&#xD;
      and levels of inflammatory mediators in urine, blood, sputum, tissue, exhaled gas, and breath&#xD;
      condensate have all been studied as potential markers to improve and objectify asthma&#xD;
      diagnosis and management. Developing such tools will allow us to phenotype and endotype the&#xD;
      various clinical patterns described in asthma, with the ultimate goal of tailoring therapy&#xD;
      based on a specific biomarker profile. Biomarkers can then be used to help better understand&#xD;
      the pharmacologic response to an intervention and adjust therapy accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers have been critical for studies of disease pathogenesis and the development of new&#xD;
      therapies in severe asthma. In particular, biomarkers of type 2 inflammation have proven&#xD;
      valuable for endotyping and targeting new biological agents. Because of these successes in&#xD;
      understanding and marking type 2 inflammation, lack of knowledge regarding non-type 2&#xD;
      inflammatory mechanisms in asthma will soon be the major obstacle to the development of new&#xD;
      treatments and management strategies in severe asthma. Other potential biomarkers include&#xD;
      innate lymphoid cells, IL-33 or thymic stromal lymphopoietin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent publications confirmed crucial regulatory role of miRNAs in the pathomechanism of&#xD;
      asthma. Some single miRNAs or their sets hold the promise for their use as asthma biomarkers&#xD;
      facilitating diagnosis or prediction of treatment outcomes. They are also possible target of&#xD;
      future therapies. The studies in this field are lacking though. Recently it has been shown&#xD;
      that most of the involved miRNAs increase secretion of Th2 cytokines, decrease secretion of&#xD;
      Th1 cytokines, promote differentiation of T cells towards Th2 or play a role in hyperplasia&#xD;
      and hypertrophy of bronchial smooth muscle cells. The profiles of miRNAs correlate with&#xD;
      clinical characteristics, including lung function, phenotype and severity of asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most industry sponsored biologic clinical trials have effectively used the above approach by&#xD;
      selecting study subjects that resemble the severe asthma clinical phenotypes of SARP&#xD;
      (high-intensity controller medication regimens, frequent exacerbations, and low lung&#xD;
      function), but then require an elevated biomarker (in blood, exhaled gas, or sputum) that&#xD;
      should identify patients most likely to be responders to a specific immunomodulator within&#xD;
      those clinical phenotypes. The biologics in recently published clinical trials target type 2&#xD;
      inflammatory pathways and restrict participation to subjects with elevated type 2 biomarkers&#xD;
      (blood or sputum eosinophils or FeNO). Post hoc responder analyses to &quot;group&quot; biomarkers to&#xD;
      better understand which patients have the greatest benefit from a biologic immunomodulator&#xD;
      will lead to an understanding that concurrent elevations in more than 1 type 2 inflammatory&#xD;
      biomarker may further identify &quot;high responder&quot; patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis includes the efficacy of mepolizumab treatment in late-onset severe eosinophilic&#xD;
      asthmatic patients with fixed obstruction and relation to clinical and inflammatory&#xD;
      biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions Is there any improvement in exacerbation rate in late-onset severe&#xD;
      eosinophilic asthmatic patients under mepolizumab treatment during their 1st year of&#xD;
      treatment and what are the characteristics of non-responders and super-responders? Is there&#xD;
      any improvement in smooth muscle cells remodeling? Are there any biomarkers to predict&#xD;
      response to mepolizumab treatment in late-onset severe eosinophilic asthmatic patients? Is&#xD;
      there any improvement in respiratory parameters? Is there any improvement in asthma control&#xD;
      and patients' quality of life? Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To demonstrate the effect of mepolizumab treatment in exacerbation rate in late-onset&#xD;
           severe eosinophilic asthmatic patients with fixed obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify characteristics of non-responders and super-responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key secondary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Any improvement in remodeling (thickening of bronchial smooth muscle cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Any possible biomarkers of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Any improvement in respiratory parameters in asthma control and in patients' quality of&#xD;
           life during mepolizumab treatment in late-onset severe eosinophilic asthmatic patients&#xD;
           with fixed obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and Methods Patients will be collected from the outpatient clinics of bronchial&#xD;
      asthma from each site (8 in number) which cover the population of Greece. All these Clinics&#xD;
      are included to reinforce the recruitment as well as to include bronchoscopist experts with&#xD;
      international impact. Due to the current situation concerning Covid-19 pandemic, the&#xD;
      investigators assume that this clinical study does not interfere with the workload in our&#xD;
      Clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, this is a prospective multicenter study including eight Pulmonary Clinics. Five&#xD;
      Pulmonary University Clinics, two of National Health System and one Army General Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include a screening period of up to 2 weeks to assess eligibility and obtain&#xD;
      written informed consent, a mepolizumab treatment period of 52 weeks, once every 4 weeks,&#xD;
      including follow up visits every 3 months during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of 45 patients with late-onset severe eosinophilic asthma&#xD;
      and fixed obstruction receiving mepolizumab aged 20 and above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participation, assessment and follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening: Investigators will screen selected subjects to the participated clinics (Severe&#xD;
      Asthma outpatient clinics). Subjects will come in to sign consent. Clinical assessment and&#xD;
      procedures and structural interviews will be performed during screening. Subjects that are&#xD;
      eligible/able to complete the screening Visit may do so, on the same day, and if necessary,&#xD;
      they will complete their baseline assessment within 2 weeks. Subjects with an ongoing asthma&#xD;
      exacerbation should have their screening and treatment initiation visit delayed until the&#xD;
      investigator considers the subject has returned to their baseline asthma status. If the&#xD;
      2-week screening period has elapsed then the subject should be considered a screening&#xD;
      failure. Subjects will remain on their current maintenance therapy throughout screening&#xD;
      periods. Eligibility of the patients will be based on the criteria listed in the next&#xD;
      sections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma exacerbation history for the last 12 months will be reported at screening visit. Also,&#xD;
      exacerbations will be evaluated at each visit as reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital signs will be performed at screening visit, at baseline and every 3 months.&#xD;
      Measurements will include systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate and body&#xD;
      temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Height in centimeters (cm) and body weight in kilograms (kg) will be measured at screening&#xD;
      visits. Body Mass Index (BMI) will be calculated as the weight in kg divided by the height in&#xD;
      meters squared&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory evaluation (Hematology, Blood chemistry, Urinalysis):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous blood and urine will be collected at baseline. Hematology: Hemoglobin, hematocrit, red&#xD;
      blood cell count, white blood cell count with differential, and platelet will be measured in&#xD;
      the laboratory of each site's hospital. Basic clinical chemistry and urinalysis will be&#xD;
      evaluated. Collection of urine for female subjects will also evaluate pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IgE levels will be evaluated at screening visit using immunoCAP tests and will be reported as&#xD;
      IU/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following Questionnaires will be administered: 1) the Asthma Control Questionnaire&#xD;
      (ACQ-5) and Asthma Control Test (ACT) to assess current asthma control; 2) the Asthma Quality&#xD;
      of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ+12) to assess quality of life and psychological morbidity. To&#xD;
      further asses sleeping quality 1) Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), 2) Epworth Sleepiness Scale&#xD;
      (ESS), 3) St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and 4) WHO (Five) Well-Being Index&#xD;
      (WHO-5), 5) Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exhaled nitric oxide (NO) will be measured at baseline and every 3 months according to the&#xD;
      American Thoracic Society Guidelines and as specified by the manufacturer. FeNO levels will&#xD;
      be reported as parts per billion. Measurements will be made before spirometry is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous blood samples will be retrieved between 8 to 10 am, at baseline and every 3 months&#xD;
      during the 52-week period with mepolizumab treatment. Absolute blood eosinophil count will be&#xD;
      reported as cells/μl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spirometry: Spirometry A will be conducted, using the site's own equipment at the visits&#xD;
      (baseline and every 3 months). All clinic visits must occur in the morning. During the&#xD;
      treatment period the spirometry will meet the current ATS/ERS guidelines and the spirometer&#xD;
      must produce a printout of all data generated, which should be stored in the subject's notes.&#xD;
      The spirometer will be calibrated in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
      Spirometry must be performed at the same time (±1 hour) of the Visit 0 spirometry. Subjects&#xD;
      should try to withhold short-acting beta-2-agonists (SABAs) for ≥4 hours and LABAs for ≥15&#xD;
      hours prior to clinic visit, if possible (GINA 2019). Assessments to be recorded will include&#xD;
      FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC%, PEF and FEF25-75. Post-bronchodilator measurements will be taken at&#xD;
      every visit, using 200-400mcg albuterol or equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spirometry B will be conducted, using the site's own equipment at the visits (baseline, after&#xD;
      6 months and after treatment at 52 weeks timepoint). Spirometry B includes diffusion,&#xD;
      pulmonary volumes and capacities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impulse oscillometry (optional):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impulse Osillometry (IOS) will be conducted at baseline and after 52 weeks of treatment. IOS&#xD;
      includes resistance at 5 Hz-resistance at 20 Hz (R5-R20), a measure reflecting respiratory&#xD;
      resistance of small to midsized conductive and peripheral airways, AX, a measure reflecting&#xD;
      distensibility of the peripheral lungs (namely the parenchyma and small peripheral airways),&#xD;
      and the respiratory system reactance (X5), a measure reflecting inertance and elasticity or&#xD;
      capacitance (including small peripheral airways).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy with biologics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the screening visits the participant may initiate treatment with biologic&#xD;
      therapy (mepolizumab) within a month. During therapy subjects will be under the care of the&#xD;
      pulmonologist who had referred them to the research group for taking part into the study.&#xD;
      These pulmonologists will be termed as 'associate pulmonologists. Treatment will be provided&#xD;
      as per product manufacturer instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Associate pulmonologists providing biologic treatment during the study will require to sign&#xD;
      an agreement to conduct the study in compliance with the protocol, to acknowledge that he/she&#xD;
      is responsible for medical conduct and for study conduct, and to ensure that the associate&#xD;
      (and their colleagues and employees) assisting in the conduct of the study are informed about&#xD;
      their obligations. Mechanisms will be in place to ensure that associate staff receives the&#xD;
      appropriate information and support by the research group throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up during biologic therapy: At initiation and at every visit for biologic therapy&#xD;
      administration collection of information will be performed by the associate pulmonologist,&#xD;
      and with support by the research group if requested by the associate pulmonologist e.g.,&#xD;
      researchers via telephone or face-to-face contact will interview the patient. Furthermore,&#xD;
      compliance will be recorded form the physician based on patient's oral confirmation. Date&#xD;
      form of drug administration will be recorded at every visit, as well as immediate and delayed&#xD;
      adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recorded adverse events (AEs) will be monitored and collated as required in study reports. An&#xD;
      adverse event is the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or medical&#xD;
      condition occurring after starting the study entry. Medical conditions/diseases present&#xD;
      before starting study drug are only considered adverse events if they worsen after starting&#xD;
      study drug. Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they&#xD;
      induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically significant, or require therapy.&#xD;
      Also, adverse events related to Covid-19 are included. If a partner pulmonologist or research&#xD;
      staff becomes aware of an AE associated with a product, it can be reported to the&#xD;
      manufacturer according to their local standard practice for spontaneous AE reporting. A copy&#xD;
      of the report should also be sent to the study coordinator. Serious adverse events (SAE) will&#xD;
      be reported in the eCRF pages and within 24 hours all the investigators will have the&#xD;
      responsibility to inform the Central Committee in Thessaloniki. Then the Central Committee&#xD;
      will inform the scientific board and the Greek Medical Agency. Also, medical and scientific&#xD;
      judgment will be exercised by the principal investigator of each center with the Central&#xD;
      Committee, in deciding whether the subject should stop the treatment or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy report:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, female patients at screening will have to do a pregnancy test. During treatment,&#xD;
      if a female subject reports a pregnancy to us, she will be asked to withdraw from the study&#xD;
      (to prevent bias) Then, she will be asked if she would like to keep getting the treatment&#xD;
      outside of this protocol and be monitored at each center's outpatient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-screening and Screening Failures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be assigned a study number at the time of signing the consent. Subjects who&#xD;
      signed but do not progress to the screening visits assessment will be deemed a pre-screen&#xD;
      failure. No data will be captured in the database for these subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects that complete at least one of the two screening visits, but do not initiate biologic&#xD;
      therapy will be designated as screening failures. Information to be collected for&#xD;
      pre-screening and screening failures will be detailed in the database completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant decides to withdraw from the study during follow-up (for any reason other&#xD;
      than loss to follow up), they may be asked to attend a withdrawal visit (if deemed necessary&#xD;
      by investigator and subject to consent). During the visit, the participant may be asked&#xD;
      questions about their current conditions as part of clinical information collection such as:&#xD;
      asthma and nasal symptoms, exacerbations and the progression of treatment being received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples' collection and processing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected at baseline visit, at 6 months and after treatment&#xD;
      completion. After collecting the blood samples, they will be left undisturbed for about half&#xD;
      an hour for complete clot formation. The sample will then be centrifuged to separate the&#xD;
      serum from the clot. After centrifugation the serum will be stored at -20° C in eppendorf&#xD;
      tubes till the analysis was done. Blood phenotyping will also be evaluated by flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induced sputum (optional):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induced sputum will be performed at baseline before treatment initiation and after completion&#xD;
      of treatment according to the ERS Task Force report where a detailed expert consensus-based&#xD;
      recommendation for induced sputum processing is suggested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the visits, sputum induction will be performed after the routine spirometric assessments&#xD;
      have been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The induced sputum will be processed within two hours of the end of the induction procedure&#xD;
      at the research site. Sputum cells and cell suspension supernatant will be stored at -80ºC&#xD;
      for analysis. After collecting the induced sputum, the supernatant of the sample will be&#xD;
      stored at -20° C in eppendorf tubes till the analysis was done. Following these procedures,&#xD;
      laboratory evaluation of the sputum is next according to guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchoscopy, bronchial biopsies and washing samples' collection and processing (optional):&#xD;
      At the visits, endoscopy with bronchial biopsies, bronchial washing sample (Visit 0b) will be&#xD;
      performed upon patient's written consent. In specific, a separate inform consent will be&#xD;
      included to be signed from each patient. Bronchoscopy will be performed at two time-points&#xD;
      (baseline before treatment initiation and after the completion of treatment). Flexible&#xD;
      bronchoscopy and diagnostic techniques were performed under monitored anesthesia care as&#xD;
      recommended by the American Thoracic Society and the British Thoracic Society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue samples will be fixed in inflation or immersion using formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde&#xD;
      and embedded in paraffin. Airways will be systematically sampled or obtained during&#xD;
      diagnostic dissection at the discretion of the pathologist. Consecutive sections of 0.5, 5&#xD;
      and 30 μm thickness were cut from each block and stained using the Masson's trichrome&#xD;
      technique, haematoxylin and eosin, and haematoxylin, respectively. Immunohistochemical&#xD;
      staining will be done done with the following mAbs: anti-mast cell tryptase clone AA1 (Dako&#xD;
      UK), anti-alpha smooth muscle actin clone 1A4 (Dako UK), anti-eosinophil major basic protein&#xD;
      clone BMK-13 (Monosan, Netherlands), anti-neutrophil elastase clone NP57 (Dako UK), and&#xD;
      anti-endothelium clone EN4 (Monosan, Netherlands) or appropriate isotype controls were used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endobronchial biopsies will be assessed by a single observer blinded to the clinical&#xD;
      characteristics (ZEN 2012 image analysis software for light microscopy, Carl Zeiss AG,&#xD;
      Germany) and will be expressed as the mean of measurements undertaken from a minimum of two&#xD;
      sections either from independent biopsies or as non-contiguous tissue sections at least 20μm&#xD;
      apart from the same biopsy. Epithelial integrity will be assessed by measuring the lengths of&#xD;
      intact and denuded epithelium. These will be expressed as percentage of all the reticular&#xD;
      basement membrane (RBM) length. Vascularity will be measured using the Chalkley count, a&#xD;
      surrogate of both vessel density and vascular area. A Chalkley eyepiece graticule (NG52&#xD;
      Chalkley Point Array, Pyser-SGI Ltd, UK) will be used at x200 to measure Chalkley counts in&#xD;
      four non-overlapping vascular hotspots (6). Airway smooth muscle content will be determined&#xD;
      as the proportion of the total area. Inflammatory cells were expressed as the number of&#xD;
      nucleated cells/area of lamina propria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchial washing samples will be immediately transported to the laboratory, to be stored at&#xD;
      -80 degrees. Examination of bronchial washing fluids will be performed at a later stage to&#xD;
      determine several biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of biomarkers of inflammation with Flow Cytometry Analysis (FACS) or ELIZA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers included before and after treatment with mepolizumab in two or three timepoints,&#xD;
      (at baseline, at 6 months treatment and after treatment completion visit): lymphocyte&#xD;
      subsets, Th2/Th17 cytokines, chemokines, microRNAs expression to be quantitated by flow&#xD;
      cytometry or ELISA) in biological fluids (blood, serum, bronchial washing, sputum and sputum&#xD;
      supernatant).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Panel kits and appropriate antibodies will be tested by Flow Cytometer Analysis using a BD&#xD;
      FACS Calibur system (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), according to the manufacturer's&#xD;
      recommendations and instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) is a plate-based assay technique designed for&#xD;
      detecting and quantifying substances such as peptides, proteins, antibodies and hormones.&#xD;
      ELISA kits will be analyzed using VICTOR X3 spectrophotometer according to the manufacturer's&#xD;
      recommendations and instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allergy testing (If applicable) The patients' atopic status will be evaluated (if not&#xD;
      available) at screening visit by the skin prick test (SPT) to a standard panel of&#xD;
      aeroallergens for detecting total IgE antibodies against various common inhalant allergens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Database An electronic data collection platform will be the method used at baseline every 3&#xD;
      months until 1 year follow up for this database. During treatment visits paper&#xD;
      forms/questionnaires will be completed by the associate pulmonologist. Each site will entry&#xD;
      specific data in an electronic database. Each patient is uniquely identified by a Subject&#xD;
      number which is composed by the site number assigned by the responsible monitoring site and a&#xD;
      sequential number assigned by the investigator. Upon signing the informed consent form, the&#xD;
      patient is assigned the next sequential number by the investigator. The site must contact the&#xD;
      central research personnel and provide the requested identifying information for the patient&#xD;
      as registered into the electronic database. The treatment visit forms will also be sent to&#xD;
      the central research personnel. The authorized study personnel will be responsible for data&#xD;
      collection, editing, and also protecting the data being collected at their own site and the&#xD;
      database is backed up on a daily basis. Quality review/control will be the joint&#xD;
      responsibility of all individuals involved and the central research personnel [data&#xD;
      custodian].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation G power analysis Sample size is calculated using the G*Power software&#xD;
      (Die Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, Germany). The difference in annual exacerbation&#xD;
      rate of the patients with late onset severe eosinophilic asthmatics before and after&#xD;
      Mepolizumab treatment with is the primary endpoint of the study. In the DREAM study (one of&#xD;
      the only two studies that has reported results similar to our primary endpoint so far) it was&#xD;
      reported that the annual exacerbation rate of patients with severe Asthma declined from 3.6&#xD;
      to 1.33 after the initiation of treatment with Mepolizumab. Using this data and a two-sided&#xD;
      test, with a power at 0.95 and a level of statistical significance at 0.05, the investigators&#xD;
      calculated an effect size of 0.556, which indicated a total sample size of 45 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Plan Analysis Statistical analysis will be performed using the SPSS (version 21.0&#xD;
      IBM SPSS statistical software, Armonk, NY, USA). Categorical variables will be stated as&#xD;
      numbers (n) and percentages (%), continuous variables as mean ± SD if normally distributed,&#xD;
      or median and interquartile ranges if otherwise. Where necessary variables without a normal&#xD;
      distribution will be transformed. P &lt; 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant.&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilk test will be performed in order to separate parametric from non-parametric&#xD;
      variables. Paired-Samples T Test for parametric or Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test for&#xD;
      non-parametric variables will be used to detect differences in the variables measured before&#xD;
      and after Mepolizumab treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no comparator arm as every patient is control to himself. There are baseline&#xD;
      characteristics (clinical and laboratory biomarkers) that are going to be measured at&#xD;
      baseline, every 3 months and after 52-week treatment completion. Study endpoints include the&#xD;
      analysis of all those biomarkers as the identification of the characteristics of&#xD;
      non-responders and super-responders. Also, secondary endpoints include the evaluation of the&#xD;
      biomarkers mentioned in the methods as assessments. Statistical analysis will be performed&#xD;
      initially with the number of patients that have completed the 52-week period of treatment.&#xD;
      Secondly, patients that have not completed the 52-week treatment will be analyzed separately&#xD;
      and finally these two groups are going to be compared to each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More specifically, with univariate analysis (two-sided independent sample tests) the&#xD;
      investigators will test for associations/correlations between all baseline outcomes compared&#xD;
      with the ones after mepolizumab treatments (every 3 months until 1 year of treatment):&#xD;
      biomarkers in sputum and in blood, clinical outcomes. Similarly, univariate associations&#xD;
      between outcomes and personal/demographic characteristics will be tested for identifying&#xD;
      potential confounders. Significant associations will be then tested with adjusted regression&#xD;
      models. Associations/correlations will be evaluated separately at baseline clinical&#xD;
      characteristics and every 3 months follow up during treatment as well as at baseline and&#xD;
      after 1 year of mepolizumab treatment. Besides, subgrouping analysis will be performed for&#xD;
      each biomarker for the identification of biomarker level to treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paired-Samples T Test for parametric or Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test for non-parametric&#xD;
      variables will be used to detect differences in the variables measured before and after&#xD;
      Mepolizumab treatment. In specific, levels of biomarkers at baseline will be compared to&#xD;
      levels after 1-year of mepolizumab treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall response to treatment in one year (from baseline to 1-year post treatment initiation)&#xD;
      for each outcome will be measured with paired test of dependent samples (parametric and&#xD;
      non-parametric paired tests) in each patient. Then response to treatment will be defined as&#xD;
      the change (absolute and % change) of the outcome in one year. The investigators will assess&#xD;
      predictors influencing response to treatment (change) such as biomarkers by using multiple&#xD;
      regression models for each clinicopathological outcome. For outcomes with more than 2&#xD;
      observations per subject during the study period the investigators will use mixed models&#xD;
      using the repeated measurements of the outcome. All tests will be 2-sided with a statistical&#xD;
      significance level at 5%.&#xD;
