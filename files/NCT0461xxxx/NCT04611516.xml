  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Ear-Nose-Throat (ENT) Prospective International Cohort of patients with Primary Ciliary&#xD;
      Dyskinesia (EPIC-PCD) is a prospective observational clinical cohort study, set up as a&#xD;
      multinational multi-centre study. It is embedded into routine patient care of participating&#xD;
      reference centres for PCD and patients keep being managed according to local procedures and&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The EPICD-PCD is hosted at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM) at the&#xD;
      University of Bern, Switzerland. Research is performed in close collaboration with all data&#xD;
      contributors. This study aims to characterise ENT disease in PCD patients and its association&#xD;
      with lower respiratory disease, and to identify determinants of its prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the prevalence and severity of sinonasal and otologic symptoms and the frequency&#xD;
           and range of signs and physiological findings assessed during standardised ENT physical&#xD;
           examination, and describe differences by age;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study the association of sinonasal and otologic disease with lower respiratory disease&#xD;
           in PCD patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identify determinants of disease course and prognosis of sinonasal and otologic disease&#xD;
           in PCD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EPIC-PCD is a prospective observational clinical cohort study, set up as a multinational&#xD;
      multi-centre study. It is embedded into routine patient care of participating reference&#xD;
      centres for PCD and patients will keep being managed according to local procedures and&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with PCD are followed regularly at each centre, at 3-month to 6-month intervals.&#xD;
      Each patient undergoes a detailed ENT sinonasal and otologic examination by ENT specialists,&#xD;
      at minimum once a year, during a programmed follow-up visit. Additional ENT examinations are&#xD;
      performed if indicated during in-between follow-up visits. Patients will not be subjected to&#xD;
      additional invasive measurements solely for the purposes of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What information is collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study collect clinical data from patients assessment at regular consultations at the&#xD;
      outpatient clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the collection of clinical data, participating centres will use FOLLOW-PCD, a&#xD;
      disease-specific form for standardised prospective data collection during routine clinical&#xD;
      follow-up of PCD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study database:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EPIC-PCD database is web-based, using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)&#xD;
      platform developed at Vanderbilt University. REDCap is widely used in academic research and&#xD;
      allows data entry and extraction in various formats.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How to participate:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Centres that wish to participate to the project and contribute data can contact the EPIC-PCD&#xD;
      managing centre to sign a data delivery agreement. They then will receive a password to&#xD;
      access the online software REDCap and they will be able to enter their data directly. They&#xD;
      can also upload follow-up data or add additional patients at a later time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The setting up of the EPIC-PCD (salaries, consumables and equipment) was funded by the Swiss&#xD;
      National Science Foundation. Data collection and management at each site was funded according&#xD;
      to local arrangements. Most participating researchers and data contributors participate in&#xD;
      the European Respiratory Society Clinical Research collaboration &quot;Better Evidence to Advance&#xD;
      Therapeutic options for PCD&quot; (BEAT-PCD) (https://beat-pcd.squarespace.com/). Infrastructure&#xD;
      is provided for free by the University of Bern, where the data are pooled and stored.&#xD;

Researchers wanting to use the dataset can propose a research topic and draft a concept sheet describing the planned analyses and publication. All concept sheets have to be approved by all participating centres contributing data to the proposed analysis under question. After the participating centres agree to contribute their data and sign a publication agreement, the EPIC-PCD managing centre (University of Bern) will prepare a partial dataset for the proposed analysis and will work closely with the lead researchers offering methodological input and support. In case additional data is collected to complete the partial dataset for a specific project, this will be added to the EPIC-PCD dataset to enrich it after each project.</ipd_description>
