    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the tooth movement with and without piezocision with&#xD;
      regard to the levels of osteocalcin and cross-linked C-terminal telopeptides of type I&#xD;
      collagen in the gingival crevicular fluid.&#xD;

      15 systemically healthy subjects requiring extraction of the maxillary 1. premolars with&#xD;
      distalization of the maxillary canines were enrolled to the study. Piezocisions were&#xD;
      performed on the distal and mesial sides of the right maxillary canines while the left&#xD;
      maxillary canines served as controls. Canine distalization was performed via closed-coil&#xD;
      springs applying 150 g of force per side by using miniscrews as anchorage. Gingival&#xD;
      crevicular fluid samples were collected from both mesial and distal sides of right and left&#xD;
      maxillary canines at 0, 1, 7, 14 and 28 days. The gingival crevicular fluid levels of&#xD;
      osteocalcin and cross-linked C-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen were determined by&#xD;
      using ELISA. The rate of tooth movement was measured on 14 and 28 days.&#xD;

    <description>All measurements were performed on the dental cast model using a digital caliper. The amount of space closure was based on the measurements of the distance between the contact points of the distal surface of canine and the mesial surface of second premolar. The change of distance between the three observation periods represented the amount of canine movement.</description>

The amount of space closure was based on the measurements of the distance between the contact points of the distal surface of canine and the mesial surface of second premolar. The change of distance between the three observation periods represented the amount of canine movement, which was divided by the number of days between two sessions to obtain the retraction rate on daily basis</description>
