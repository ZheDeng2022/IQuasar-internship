      to find the clinical relation between caries experience in primary teeth and first permanent&#xD;
      molar in mixed dentition stage using def index for primary teeth , DMF index for first&#xD;
      permanent molars and to find the clinical relation between caries prevalence in the selected&#xD;
      children in relation with other associated factors such as age, sex tooth brushing frequency,&#xD;
      dietary habits and mother's attitude toward child's oral health.&#xD;

      the problem for which the study held is lacking of data about relation between prevalence of&#xD;
      dental caries in primary teeth and first permanent molar of the same child in mixed dentition&#xD;
      stage, incidence of dental caries is influenced by number of risk factors such as age, sex&#xD;
      dietary and oral hygiene habits identifying high risk individuals helps development of&#xD;
      systemic approaches for preventive oral care programs world wide Dental caries is the major&#xD;
      public health problem in most high income countries, affecting 60-90%of school children and&#xD;
      the vast majority of adults. it also the most prevalent oral disease in several Asian and&#xD;
      Latin American countries Although for the moment it appears to be less common and less severe&#xD;
      in the greater part of Africa, the WHO report 2003 anticipates that in light of changing&#xD;
      living conditions and dietary habits, the incidence of dental caries will increase in many of&#xD;
      that continent's low income countries(WHO,2006)&#xD;
