  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, multicenter study to compare the efficacy and safety of ATRA for the treatment&#xD;
      of adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are undertaking an open-label, single-arm, multicenter trial of adults&#xD;
      patients with ITP in China. Patients with treatmant naive ITP were given ATRA treatment.&#xD;
      Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms were evaluated before and after treatment.&#xD;
      Adverse events are also recorded throughout the study.&#xD;
