  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will primarily identify longitudinal associations between cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      fitness (CRF) and cognitive function pre- (baseline) to post-chemotherapy (~3 months). This&#xD;
      will be a prospective study of 50 BCS. We hypothesize that breast cancer patients undergoing&#xD;
      chemotherapy who have higher levels of CRF at baseline will have significantly improved&#xD;
      measures of attention, executive function, and memory post-chemotherapy. In addition, the&#xD;
      exploratory aims will examine the longitudinal associations between physical activity (PA)&#xD;
      and cognitive function from pre- to post-chemotherapy and explore the associations between&#xD;
      inflammatory and non-inflammatory biomarkers and CRF with cognitive function.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairments are reported as a chief quality of life (QoL) complaint by&#xD;
      approximately 75% of breast cancer survivors (BCS). Women who have undergone adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy are at the highest risk for cognitive impairments, that may affect BCS up to 20&#xD;
      years post-treatment.Despite the prevalence and significance, it is largely underdiagnosed&#xD;
      and there are no proven treatments beyond symptom management. Several studies have assessed&#xD;
      cognitive function in cancer populations. Increasing evidence highlights the role of&#xD;
      lifestyle behaviours on cancer-related outcomes, ranging from QoL to prognosis. However, very&#xD;
      few studies have examined the associations of lifestyle factors and cognitive function in&#xD;
      BCS.One of the most important mediators of CRCI in BCS may be cardiorespiratory fitness&#xD;
      (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our overall objective is to examine the behavioral and biological mechanisms that contribute&#xD;
      to cognitive decline in BCS undergoing chemotherapy using an epidemiologic, prospective&#xD;
      cohort design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments taken at baseline (pre-chemotherapy) and post-chemotherapy (month 3). Cognitive&#xD;
      Function will be assessed using the NIH toolbox cognition battery. Physical Activity. PA will&#xD;
      be assessed by accelerometers and through self-report using the Godin-Leisure Time Exercise&#xD;
      Questionnaire. Cardiorespiratory Fitness will be assessed using the 6-minute walk test to&#xD;
      estimate maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max).Cancer Biomarkers will be assessed using venous blood&#xD;
      (2 microtubes) will be drawn from the antecubital vein by a trained phlebotomist. Biological&#xD;
      markers analyzed in blood will include a multiplex panel of inflammatory cytokines (i.e.,&#xD;
      IL1, IL6, TNFÎ±), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our proposed study will be instrumental in designing future targeted translational lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions to improve cognitive health in BCS. In addition, understanding the trajectory&#xD;
      of cognitive function as it relates to these factors will determine the opportune timeframe&#xD;
      to intervene during the cancer care continuum for the greatest impact&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change in from baseline (pre-chemotherapy) and post-chemotherapy (month 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive function will be assessed using the NIH toolbox cognition battery. The NIH toolbox cognition battery with computerized cognitive tasks and automated scoring was used (Weintraub et al., 2013). The Picture Sequence Memory Test involves a presentation of stimuli which are pictured objects and activities, thematically related but with no inherent order. For each trial, pictures appear in the center of the screen and then are moved 1 at a time into a fixed spatial order, as an audio file simultaneously describes the content of each. The score is based on the cumulative number of adjacent pairs of pictures remembered correctly over 3 learning trials. The test takes approximately 10 minutes. Higher scores indicate better episodic memory.</description>

    <description>Cognitive function will be assessed using the NIH toolbox cognition battery. The NIH toolbox cognition battery with computerized cognitive tasks and automated scoring was used (Weintraub et al., 2013). The Oral Reading Recognition Test measures the ability to pronounce single printed words and/or to recognize letters. Items are administered by computer adaptive testing (CAT) and participant responses are entered by the tester. The CAT item bank contains approximately 250 items with only 30 to 40 that will be presented, depending on performance. Average administration time is 4 minutes. A higher Computed Score for Reading would mean that the participant is able to correctly identify more difficult words on the subsequent assessment, which may indicate developmental growth or a return to a previous level of functioning.</description>

    <description>Cognitive function will be assessed using the NIH toolbox cognition battery. The NIH toolbox cognition battery with computerized cognitive tasks and automated scoring was used (Weintraub et al., 2013). The Picture Vocabulary Test involves single words that are presented via an audio file, paired simultaneously with 4 screen images of objects, actions, and/or depictions of concepts. The participant will pick the picture that matches the spoken word. Total administration time is approximately 5 minutes. To interpret individual performance, one can evaluate all three types of scale scores. A participant's age-adjusted scale score at or near 100 indicates vocabulary ability that is average for the age level. Scores around 115 suggest above-average vocabulary ability, while scores around 130 suggest superior ability - in the top 2 percent nationally for age, based on Toolbox normative data.</description>

    <measure>Objectively-assessed physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in from baseline (pre-chemotherapy) and post-chemotherapy (month 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Objectively assessed PA was measured using Actigraph GTX3+ accelerometers (Pensacola, FL). Participants will wear the accelerometer on their non-dominant hip during waking hours for 7 consecutive days. Data will be downloaded in 60-s epochs and processed and converted to mean counts per minute in ActiLife software package (Version 6; Actigraph) to estimate daily minutes of light (101-1951 counts min-1), moderate (1952-5724 counts min-1), vigorous (â¥ 5725 counts min-1), and total moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA; â¥ 1952 counts min-1) based on established cut-points (Freedson, Melanson, &amp; Sirard, 1998). Estimated average daily minutes spent in each activity intensity category was calculated by dividing the number of minutes spent in each category by the total number of valid days worn.</description>

    <measure>Self-reported physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in from baseline (pre-chemotherapy) and post-chemotherapy (month 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity will be assessed using a modified version of the validated leisure score index (LSI) from the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ). Participants are asked to recall the average number of times per week and average duration they performed light (minimal effort, no perspiration), moderate (not exhausting, light perspiration), and vigorous (heart beats rapidly, sweating) physical activity during free time in the past month. The percentage of participants meeting the public health aerobic physical activity guidelines was calculated based on the physical activity guidelines recommended for cancer survivors by the American College of Sports Medicine. These guidelines recommend that individuals obtain 75 min of vigorous aerobic physical activity per week, 150 min of moderate aerobic physical activity per week, or an equivalent combination. Thus, will calculated physical activity minutes as moderate minutes plus two times the vigorous minutes.</description>
