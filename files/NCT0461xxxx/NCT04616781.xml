  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to study how a nutritional ketone ester may effect brain&#xD;
      function and alcohol consumption in regular alcohol users. The study will see how the brain&#xD;
      responds, once after drinking the ketone ester and once after drinking a &quot;placebo&quot;, which&#xD;
      will look and taste the same as the ketone ester drink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic ketosis induced by a ketogenic diet has been previously shown to elevate brain&#xD;
      ketone bodies and reduce alcohol withdrawal symptoms in humans with AUD, and reduce alcohol&#xD;
      consumption in alcohol-dependent rats. The study investigates whether metabolic ketosis&#xD;
      induced by a one-dose nutritional ketone ester (KE) reduces brain reactivity to alcohol cues&#xD;
      (fMRI), alcohol craving and alcohol consumption in humans with AUD, and if KE elevates ketone&#xD;
      bodies using proton spectroscopy. This study uses a double blind, random ordered, 2-way&#xD;
      crossover design in n=20 non-treatment seeking AUD who come in on two separate testing days:&#xD;
      on one testing day the participants consume KE ((R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate),&#xD;
      and on another testing day a drink with isocaloric dextrose (DEXT), after which participants&#xD;
      are scanned for 1H-MRS and fMRI and complete an alcohol consumption paradigm each day after&#xD;
      scanning.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a one month, prospective, double-blind, randomized, 2-way crossover design in n=20&#xD;
      non-treatment seeking AUD who come in for a screening day and two separate testing days: on&#xD;
      one testing day the participants consume a drink with 1.9 kcal/kg of nutritional ketone ester&#xD;
      (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (KE), and on another testing day a drink with&#xD;
      isocaloric dextrose (DEXT), after which participants are scanned for 1H-MRS and fMRI (20&#xD;
      subjects are scanned twice; 40 scans in total) and complete an alcohol consumption paradigm&#xD;
      each day after scanning (40 in total). Blood labs for ketone bodies, ghrelin and leptin will&#xD;
      be drawn during the study visists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The KE &quot;(R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate&quot; is a safe, effective, and non-invasive way&#xD;
      to increases ketone levels within 1 hr to concentrations similar to KD, and does not require&#xD;
      a study IND. KE-induced ketone levels remain heightened for 4 hrs, and one dose of KE has&#xD;
      shown to increase athletes' performances, improve mood, and cognitive and daily activity&#xD;
      performance in Alzheimer's disease, and decrease ghrelin levels and subjective appetite in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers. The latter finding is relevant to AUD, since ghrelin has been positively&#xD;
      associated with alcohol craving and alcohol self-administration in AUD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before study participation, subjects are screened for psychiatric and medical problems,&#xD;
      fasting glucose, urine drug screen, pregnancy test if female.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each testing day, both before and 30 min after the drink, ketone bodies, leptin and&#xD;
      ghrelin are measured in blood. After 15 minutes of KE, participants undergo a 1-hour MRI scan&#xD;
      during which, after standard structural scans, the investigators measure ketone body&#xD;
      metabolites using 1H-MRS, reactivity to alcohol cues using functional MRI, resting state MRI,&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow using perfusion and brain iron measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each study visit, four blood draws will be analyzed for ketone bodies, ghrelin and leptin&#xD;
      at KE intake (t0), 15 minutes after when the MRI starts (t15), 10 after the MRI is done and&#xD;
      after the priming drink (t85), and then at 140, and 200 minutes after (i.e., t140 and t200).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Directly after MRI scanning, participants perform an alcohol self-administation &quot;bar-lab&quot;&#xD;
      paradigm. Alcohol craving and alcohol effects will be measured before and during the alcohol&#xD;
      self-administration. Participants will then be asked what they thought the study was about,&#xD;
      and whether they thought the experimental drink influenced them in any way. After this,&#xD;
      participants will be breathalyzed, and receive a meal.&#xD;
