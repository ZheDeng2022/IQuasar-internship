  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether Chinese Herb supplements lead to a&#xD;
      measurable improvement in symptoms commonly experienced by patients with advanced stage lung&#xD;
      cancer and an improvement in quality of life. In our previously conducted single-arm&#xD;
      observational study we found significant improvement in physical well-being, tiredness and&#xD;
      drowsiness with no evidence of increased toxicity even in those on cytotoxic chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Based on the encouraging results of this study we plan to move to a placebo-controlled study&#xD;
      using the same Chinese Herb formula.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in the design and administration of anti-cancer therapies over recent years,&#xD;
      the overall 5-year survival rate for patients with advanced stage lung cancer is 2-4%. These&#xD;
      patients frequently suffer a range of different symptoms related to both their disease and&#xD;
      it's treatment. As a result, there is a pressing need for research into treatments that may&#xD;
      improve their symptoms as well as their quality of life (QOL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An increasing body of evidence suggests that complementary medicine, including carefully&#xD;
      selected combinations of Chinese Herbs (CH), may exert beneficial effects for cancer patients&#xD;
      in many ways. The literature suggests that CH combined with chemotherapy can improve survival&#xD;
      rates, immediate tumor response, performance status and QOL for those with locally advanced&#xD;
      and metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Shu Yu Wan (SYW) formula used in the feasibility study which demonstrated a significant&#xD;
      improvement in symptoms and quality of life will also be employed in this interventional&#xD;
      study. THe SYW formula consists of 23 natural Chinese herbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm clinical trial with a&#xD;
      1:1 allocation ratio for investigating the efficacy and safety of SYW formula for the&#xD;
      treatment of lung cancer symptoms. Patients in both groups will receive formula or placebo at&#xD;
      a fixed dose for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study medication, the treatment will be unblinded and patients randomized&#xD;
      to placebo will be offered to cross-over to SYW and will repeat visits Week 0 &amp; Week 6.&#xD;
      Patients will be closely monitored for safety and tolerability throughout the study.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective is to compare the change in patient reported Physical Well-Being (PWB) subscale of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung (FACT-L) questionnaire. The Physical well-being (PWB) subscale has 7 questions with the range of the score from 0 to 4 each. The range of the total score is 0 to 28. The higher the score the better the physical well-being.</description>

    <measure>Fatigue scores at Baseline and 6 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary objective is to compare change in Fatigue subscale on the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy- Fatigue (FACIT-F) questionnaire. Symptoms and health status will be assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-lung (FACT-L), and Functional Assessment for Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT-F). The FACT-L is a 36-item self-report questionnaire that evaluates quality of life in lung cancer patients. Twenty-nine items measure physical, social, emotional and functional well-being; The final 7 items constitute the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS). The FACIT-F Scale is a short, 13-item, easy to administer tool that measures an individual's level of fatigue during their usual daily activities over the past week. The level of fatigue is measured on a four point Likert scale (4 = not at all fatigued to 0 = very much fatigued).</description>
