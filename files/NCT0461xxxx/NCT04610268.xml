  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation(tDCS) is a non-invasive Neuromodulation method.The&#xD;
      weak direct current produced by tDCS can be transmitted through the skull and induce biphase,&#xD;
      polarization-related changes in the cortex. Related clinical studies have found that tDCS has&#xD;
      a corresponding therapeutic effect on neurological and psychiatric diseases such as stroke&#xD;
      rehabilitation, depression, pain, epilepsy, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic electroencephalography(sEEG) implants a set of deep electrodes into the brain&#xD;
      that use stereotactic localization to detect electrical activity, locate epileptic foci and&#xD;
      functional areas, and detect changes in electrical fields caused by tDCS in the deep brain.&#xD;
      This direct measurement technology will provide validation and optimization for the electric&#xD;
      field simulation method based on finite element analysis (FEM), also complement the latest&#xD;
      indirect current density intensity measurement technology based on MRI phase measurement,&#xD;
      providing support for the targeting and personalized treatment of tDCS technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve this goal and study the mechanism and function of tDCS better , this&#xD;
      project aims to realize the clinical use of sEEG to measure the electric field information&#xD;
      generated by tDCS in the human brain in vivo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The core research objective of this project is to measure the distribution of electric field&#xD;
      generated by tDCS in the human brain in vivo using clinical sEEG technology, and to study the&#xD;
      influence of different tDCS stimulation parameters on the distribution of intracranial&#xD;
      electric field intensity, so as to provide scientific basis for evaluating the effectiveness&#xD;
      of tDCS, optimizing the stimulation parameters of tDCS, and realizing the individuation of&#xD;
      tDCS. The project involves many scientific issues and key technologies such as &quot;stimulus&#xD;
      recording platform construction -- clinical trial design -- comparative research method&quot;. The&#xD;
      main research contents are as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Transcranial electrical stimulation and intracranial space electric field measurement&#xD;
           system based on sEEG and tDCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Multi-channel transcranial direct current stimulation technology is studied to realize&#xD;
           the integration of parameters setting, constant current output, overcurrent protection,&#xD;
           electrode connection status detection and other modules. Based on sEEG intracranial&#xD;
           electric field measurement system, weak electric field measurement with spatial&#xD;
           positioning information can be realized accurately. The integrated control system of&#xD;
           transcranial electric stimulation and intracranial space electric field recording was&#xD;
           studied to realize the linkage control of multi-channel tDCS and space electric field&#xD;
           recording and data processing and analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical implementation protocol design of tDCS combined with sEEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To study the implementation protocol of tDCS combined sEEG applicable to clinical&#xD;
           practice, and to develop inclusion and exclusion criteria for clinical volunteers, based&#xD;
           on MRI data and actual disease conditions of volunteers, individual differentiation&#xD;
           planning of sEEG implantation and stimulation parameters and stimulation sites of&#xD;
           combined tDCS; Intraoperative sEEG-based intracranial spatial electric field measurement&#xD;
           protocols were studied, including implementation procedures for tDCS stimulation and&#xD;
           sEEG recording, individualized experimental paradigm design, practical procedures and&#xD;
           data recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Individual head model electric field simulation analysis method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An electric field distribution simulation model based on individual head model was&#xD;
      established to realize the finite element simulation calculation of spatial electric field&#xD;
      distribution under different individual head model structure, different electrical properties&#xD;
      of tissues, different tDCS stimulation combinations and stimulation parameters. According to&#xD;
      the electric field data recorded by sEEG and MRI data, the actual electric field distribution&#xD;
      model of individual head model was established. The spatial electric field distribution&#xD;
      characteristics of tDCS acting on different intracranial depths and distances were analyzed&#xD;
      under different external stimulation parameters, and compared with the simulation model. The&#xD;
      existing simulation model is optimized based on the measured data.&#xD;
