  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Forensic patients often display cognitive deficits, particularly in the domain of executive&#xD;
      functions, that represent a challenge to forensic rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One empirically-validated method to train executive functions is cognitive remediation, which&#xD;
      consists of cognitive exercises combined with coaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial investigates whether cognitive remediation can improve cognitive, functional, and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes in forensic inpatients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forensic patients often display deficits in executive functions, namely difficulties in&#xD;
      planning, strategic thinking, problem-solving, and inhibiting inappropriate behavior. Such&#xD;
      deficits are transdiagnostic and often underlie behavioral incidents, undermine reintegration&#xD;
      into the community, and increase recidivism risk. Despite this, forensic programs usually do&#xD;
      not include executive function training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One approach to train executive functions is cognitive remediation, which consists of&#xD;
      behavioral exercises engaging cognitive skills, supported by coaching. In various mental&#xD;
      health conditions, cognitive remediation has been repeatedly associated with improvements in&#xD;
      cognitive, functional, and clinical outcomes, with small-to-moderate effect sizes. Thus, it&#xD;
      should be clarified whether this approach can lead to similar improvements in forensic&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present trial, we will investigate whether 12 hours over 6 weeks of computerised&#xD;
      cognitive remediation administered using tele-health can improve executive functions relative&#xD;
      to an active control condition in a sample of 30 forensic inpatients (Aim 1). We will further&#xD;
      examine the effect of cognitive remediation (vs. active control) on other variables that are&#xD;
      critical for forensic rehabilitation, namely oppositional behaviour, functional capacity, and&#xD;
      mental health symptoms (Aim 2). Lastly, we will explore whether any effects persist 12 weeks&#xD;
      following cognitive remediation (Aim 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive remediation is an evidence-based inexpensive training method that could be&#xD;
      integrated into forensic healthcare practice. In the long term, the expected cognitive,&#xD;
      functional, and clinical improvements associated with cognitive remediation have the&#xD;
      potential to result in shorter hospitalisations and reduced recidivism rates.&#xD;
