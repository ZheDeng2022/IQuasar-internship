    <textblock>
      We aim to identify the diagnostic role of a lung ultrasonography (LUS) score to predict the&#xD;
      severity and the need for surfactant therapy in newborns with respiratory distress syndrome&#xD;
      (RDS), and to compare it with a chest X-ray score.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a common problem in preterm infants. This condition is&#xD;
      caused by deficiency of pulmonary surfactant in an immature lung and is related to morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality in preterm infants. The incidence of RDS increases with the decreasing of&#xD;
      gestational age (GA). The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal&#xD;
      Research Network reports a 93 percent incidence of RDS in a cohort of extremely preterm&#xD;
      infants (GA 28 weeks or below)1. Although the risk is lower, RDS occurs even in a significant&#xD;
      number of late preterm infants2. Diagnosis of RDS is based on clinical manifestations,&#xD;
      arterial blood gas and chest X-ray findings. Chest X-ray is considered a first-line imaging&#xD;
      test for diagnosis of RDS2. Chest X-ray findings, however, are not related to the respiratory&#xD;
      prognosis3 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, lung ultrasonography (LUS) has been used in critically ill patient and it has&#xD;
      become an important tool for neonatologists4. Specific LUS patterns have been described for&#xD;
      typical neonatal respiratory conditions such as RDS5, transient tachypnea of the newborn&#xD;
      (TTN)6, meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS)7, and pneumothorax8,9.As reported in The Consensus&#xD;
      Conference on lung ultrasound, both LUS and chest X-ray are accurate in the diagnosis of RDS&#xD;
      and TTN in neonates10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surfactant replacement therapy is crucial in the management of RDS. Recent guidelines&#xD;
      recommend to treat affected babies with early nasal continuous positive airway pressure&#xD;
      (nCPAP) and early selective surfactant administration10. The European Association of&#xD;
      Perinatal Medicine and the American Academy of Pediatrics advise surfactant administration&#xD;
      when oxygen requirement increases despite early nCPAP treatment11,12. Some studies have&#xD;
      recently highlighted the usefulness of LUS in predicting neonatal intensive care unit&#xD;
      admission or the need for mechanical ventilation13,14 or nCPAP failure15. Many scores based&#xD;
      on LUS findings have proved their reliability in adult critical care16,17. In the neonatal&#xD;
      field few studies presented chest X-ray derived scores18 or directly compared LUS with chest&#xD;
      ray. There are no data, to our knowledge, that compare the accuracy of LUS with chest X-ray&#xD;
      in predicting the need for surfactant administration in infants with RDS18-20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basically, each lung was divided into 3 areas (upper anterior, lower anterior, and lateral)&#xD;
      and examined using a linear microprobe through both transverse and longitudinal scans. For&#xD;
      each lung area, a 0- to 3-point score was given (total score ranging from 0-18). The LUS&#xD;
      score encompassed signs typical of TTN and RDS21-22 . and described the total spectrum of&#xD;
      possible conditions (a normal aerated lung, an interstitial pattern, an alveolar pattern, and&#xD;
      consolidation). In details, the LUS score was assigned as follows:0 indicates A-pattern&#xD;
      (defined by the presence of the only A-lines); 1, B-pattern (defined as the presence of ≥3&#xD;
      well-spaced B-lines); 2, severe B pattern (defined as the presence of crowded and coalescent&#xD;
      B lines with or without consolidations limited to the subpleural space); and 3, extended&#xD;
      consolidations. A-lines represent reflection of pleura due to ultrasound diffusing through an&#xD;
      airfilled lung; B-lines are due to fluid filling the interstitium (and the alveolar space if&#xD;
      they become confluent)23,24.&#xD;
