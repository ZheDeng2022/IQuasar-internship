  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reliability of the Australian Spasticity Assessment Scale (ASAS) has been reported to be&#xD;
      not high enough in adult patients with acquired brain damage. The low number of patients and&#xD;
      the heterogeneous study population have been reported as important limitations in the&#xD;
      reliability study of this measure. Therefore, the reliability of the ASAS needs to be&#xD;
      confirmed in stroke patients with spasticity. This study aims to investigate the inter-rater&#xD;
      reliability of the ASAS in a study population consisting of a larger and more homogeneous&#xD;
      patient population (those with post-stroke spasticity).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spasticity is a motor disorder characterized by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic&#xD;
      stretch reflex due to upper motor neuron lesion. The prevalence of post-stroke spasticity is&#xD;
      between 17-40%. In the assessment of spasticity, although biomechanical and&#xD;
      neurophysiological methods provide quantitative data, semi-quantitative methods are mostly&#xD;
      used clinically. The most frequently used spasticity measures are the Modified Ashworth Scale&#xD;
      and the Modified Tardieu Scale. However, these methods have significant disadvantages.&#xD;
      Therefore, the search for more reliable clinical measures continues. One of the newly&#xD;
      developed clinical scales is called the Australian Spasticity Assessment Scale (ASAS).&#xD;
      Although ASAS has been reported to have a high level of reliability in children with cerebral&#xD;
      palsy, the same has not been detected in adult patients with acquired brain damage. The low&#xD;
      number of patients and the heterogeneous study population have been reported as two of the&#xD;
      important limitations in the reliability study of this measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, researchers aim to investigate the inter-rater reliability of the ASAS in a&#xD;
      study population consisting of a larger and more homogeneous patient population (those with&#xD;
      post-stroke spasticity).&#xD;

    <description>The ASAS is an ordinal scale with five levels (0, 1, 2, 3, 4). The severity of spasticity increases as the level-ups.The contracture is assessed separately. Level 0 means no catch on rapid passive stretch (no spasticity), and level 4 means that the body part is fixed on the rapid passive stretch but moves on the slow passive stretch. In level 1, a catch followed by a release occurs on the rapid passive stretch. In level 2, the catch is in the second half of the range, and there is a resistance in the remaining range of motion. In level 3, the catch is in the first half of the range, and there is a resistance in the remaining range of motion.</description>
