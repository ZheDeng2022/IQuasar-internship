  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis results in activation of the coagulation system, which is commonly described as&#xD;
      disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The DIC score, which is commonly used to define&#xD;
      this syndrome, does not allow to delineate between hypercoagulation and hypocoagulation. The&#xD;
      aim of this prospective observational study is to evaluate data from automated rotational&#xD;
      thromboelastometry and compare These with the DIC score regarding intensive care unit&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis results in an intensive interaction between Inflammation and the coagulation system.&#xD;
      The activation of the coagulation system leads to consumption of procoagulatory as well as&#xD;
      anticoagulatory proteins and platelets. This process may induce microcirculatory thrombosis&#xD;
      as well as hemorrhagic diathesis, which is commonly described as disseminated intravascular&#xD;
      coagulation (DIC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) recommends the use of the DIC&#xD;
      score to describe this syndrome. A score of at least 5 points is defined as an overt DIC.&#xD;
      However, the DIC score does not allow to differentiate between a hypercoagulation and&#xD;
      hypocoagulation states and whether there could be a difference regarding outcome between the&#xD;
      two states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective observational study, patients admitted to a medical intensive care unit&#xD;
      will be included. The DIC score as well as rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) will be&#xD;
      evaluated within the first 24 hours after the diagnosis of sepsis as well as on day 3 and 5.&#xD;
