  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodic Limb Movements during Sleep (PLMs) are episodes of repetitive, stereotypical, hallux&#xD;
      or foot movements. They could induce sleep disturbance, fatigue, daytime sleepiness and&#xD;
      impaired quality of life but also increased cardiovascular risk by rising heart rate and&#xD;
      blood pressure at night. Gold standard for PLMs diagnosis is based on electromyographic&#xD;
      recording of tibialis anterior muscle during full night polysomnography (PSG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLMs prevalence is higher in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) possibly due to a loss of&#xD;
      encephalic inhibition on a spinal motion generator. In these patients, PLMs can also be&#xD;
      wrongly considered as spasms sometimes leading to the unjustified implantation of an&#xD;
      intrathecal Lioresal pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the general population, drug treatments for PLMs, particularly dopamine agonists, limit&#xD;
      the impact of these abnormal movements on sleep fragmentation, daytime alertness and quality&#xD;
      of life. Underdiagnosed PLMs in SCI patients can lead to exacerbate cognitive, mood and&#xD;
      painful disorders due to the close interaction between sleep disorders and neurocognitive,&#xD;
      psychological and painful manifestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLMs appropriate diagnosis appeared mandatory in those patients but accessibility and delayed&#xD;
      availability remain challenging. In addition, sleep laboratories are often unable to&#xD;
      accommodate with SCI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, actigraphy, an easy-to-use, cheaper and easily renewable diagnostic tool&#xD;
      would be interesting. In the general population, sensitivity to diagnose PLMs was between&#xD;
      0.79 and 1 and specificity between 0.6 and 0.83. Due to lower limbs impairment, increased&#xD;
      specificity is expected SCI patients (decrease voluntary activity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new generation of actigraph (MotionWatchR) could have better characteristics thanks to&#xD;
      the development of a specific software which integrate both lower limbs in the same analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As primary objective, this prospective monocentric study aims to evaluate the performances of&#xD;
      lower limbs actigraphy for PLMs diagnosis versus gold standard.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As secondary objectives, the study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate positive and negative predictive values;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the diagnostic threshold of PLMs index with actigraphy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study concordance between actigraphy and polysomnography to detect lower limbs&#xD;
           movements;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate reproducibility between 2 readers and with the new PLMs software;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study actigraphy reproducibility for this indication over 3 consecutive nights in the&#xD;
           same patients (ancillary study);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare diagnostic performance according to SCI completeness (AIS-A vs AIS-B, C, D) and&#xD;
           underlying pathology (MS, SCI);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare installation and interpretation times between actigraphy and PSG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLMs appropriate diagnosis appeared mandatory in SCI patients however the accessibility and&#xD;
      the delay of availability remain challenging for severe SCI complications in care management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team hypothesize that actigraphy could be able to diagnose PLMs with sufficient&#xD;
      reliability (AUC (area under the curve) around 80%) compared to the gold standard&#xD;
      (polysomnography) in patients with spinal cord injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: During a scheduled night recording (polysomnography) 3 actigraphs will be added&#xD;
      (1 on the wrist, and 1 on each foot).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equipment: MotionWatch8®, CamNtech® (marking CE Class 1 device; accord FDA (K132764)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consecutive eligible patients followed in our tertiary care center (for whom a full night&#xD;
      polysomnography is already scheduled) will be informed of the study and proposed to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the informed consent form, all subjects will undergo a full-night examinations:&#xD;
      polysomnography (already scheduled in usual care) and actigraphy (addition of 3 devices):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 classic actigraph on the wrist to detect light and identify inactivity periods&#xD;
           compatible with sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 new generation Actiwatch actigraphs (MotionWatch) placed on the feet. Polysomnography&#xD;
           will incorporate tibialis anterior EMG recording and will be scored by one sleep&#xD;
           specialist following American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) scoring criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actigraphy analysis will be provided by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An automated software specially developed for this indication (PLMsanalysis software,&#xD;
           camNtechR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A nurse reading unaware of both software's and PSG results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A second reading will be provided by a second nurse, also unaware of the result of the&#xD;
           polysomnography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actigraphy results will not be communicated to patients or physicians and therefore will not&#xD;
      affect patient management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the evaluation period, each patient will be offered, if needed, treatment and&#xD;
      follow-up in the sleep unit as in usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study of actigraphy reproducibility will be carried out in a sample of 33 subjects. This&#xD;
      study will take place over three consecutive nights during an already scheduled&#xD;
      hospitalization (no additional hospitalization night for patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: as described in Outcome Measures.&#xD;
