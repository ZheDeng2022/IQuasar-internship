  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this education program is to increase breast and cervical cancer&#xD;
      screening in low-income women in Puerto Rico through implementation of an evidence-based&#xD;
      educational program that addresses both health professionals (promotoras or community health&#xD;
      workers) and public audiences of low-income women living in Canóvanas, Puerto Rico who have&#xD;
      either never been screened for breast and/or cervical cancer, or are under-screened according&#xD;
      recommended guidelines. To evaluate promotoras' delivery of the CLS screening education&#xD;
      program we used a randomized pre-post comparison group study design that will provide data to&#xD;
      determine the effectiveness of the CLS intervention program compared with usual practice (no&#xD;
      intervention).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed promotora and community based breast and cervical screening education program&#xD;
      includes the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To train community health workers (promotoras) from Taller Salud to implement the CLS&#xD;
      breast and cervical cancer screening program. Taller Salud staff train and build capacity of&#xD;
      promotoras to implement the CLS community-based education and navigation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To deliver the CLS intervention program to at least 600 women in Canóvanas&#xD;
      municipality, Puerto Rico.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. To evaluate the impact of the program on increasing mammography and cervical cancer&#xD;
      screening among participating women in Canóvanas, Puerto Rico.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4. To adapt and update intervention materials&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A randomized controlled trial using a pre-post comparison group design. Eligibility criteria included ages 21 and older for the Pap cohort and 40 and older for the mammography cohort, non-adherence to recommended Pap test screening and/or mammography screening guidelines according to the American Cancer Society, no hysterectomy, no diagnosis of cancer, and not currently pregnant. Trained data collectors administered a baseline survey to eligible women and randomly assigned them to the intervention or to a comparison condition. Lay Health Workers delivered the intervention in women's homes, and administered the follow-up survey by phone 4 to 6 months following baseline.</intervention_model_description>
