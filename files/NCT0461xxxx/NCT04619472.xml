  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a multicenter, single group target value clinical trial to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation for peripheral lung tumors under the conjunction of&#xD;
      the pulmonary radiofrequency ablation system with the disposable pulmonary radiofrequency&#xD;
      ablation catheter developed by Hangzhou Broncus Medical Co., Ltd.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects will first undergo interventional bronchoscopy to reach the target lesion&#xD;
      through the bronchial pathway. Then the lung lesions will be treated with radiofrequency&#xD;
      ablation using the pulmonary radiofrequency ablation system and the disposable pulmonary&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation catheter. During the study, eligible subjects will be followed up&#xD;
      intraoperatively, 24 hours after operation, before discharge/ 7 days after operation&#xD;
      (whichever occurs first), 30 days (±7 days) after operation, 3 months (±7 days) after&#xD;
      operation, 6 months (±15 days) after operation, 9 months (±15 days) after operation, and 12&#xD;
      months (±15 days) after operation.&#xD;
