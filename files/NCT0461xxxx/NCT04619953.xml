  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical features of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) vary widely from patient to other. About the 60%&#xD;
      of patients with MS presents cognitive deficits associated with motor disability. The&#xD;
      principal consequences of the motor disabilities concern difficult in gait and balance. The&#xD;
      principal cognitive deficits concern the speed in elaborating information, the complex&#xD;
      attention and the memory. During walking in daily life, it is often required to turn the head&#xD;
      for looking something happening in the surrounding environment, for example when a sudden&#xD;
      noise is heard, while crossing the street, when there's something interesting around or when&#xD;
      is required to verbally answer to someone without stopping walking. All these examples are&#xD;
      referred to a common daily life mechanism that has been defined as dual task (DT).&#xD;
      Considering that the attention is a limited function, divide it in two different and&#xD;
      simultaneous tasks (motor and cognitive), cause a cognitive-motor interference (CMI) that&#xD;
      lead to a loss of efficacy in one or in both the tasks. The main aim of the study is to&#xD;
      verify the impact of a brief rehabilitation training that combining motor and cognitive&#xD;
      therapy using a dual-task paradigm, on balance and gait in MS patients, compared with the&#xD;
      traditional therapies that provide a specific postural stability rehabilitation approach.&#xD;
      Recruited patients will be randomized in two different groups which perform two different&#xD;
      training. Each group perform the allocated training 3 times a week for 4 weeks. All the&#xD;
      patients will be evaluated at the baseline (T0), at the end of the training (T1) and 60 days&#xD;
      after the end of the training (T2).&#xD;
