  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the TEACCH School Transition to Employment and&#xD;
      Post-Secondary Education (T-STEP) Program. Through randomized assignment young adults (18-21&#xD;
      year-old) with ASD will participate in the full T-STEP Program or a counseling only&#xD;
      condition. Effectiveness will be assessed by caregiver report (social communication,&#xD;
      executive function, employment readiness), self-report (self-determination, coping,&#xD;
      depression), and behavioral observation (i.e., a mock employment experience). The long-term&#xD;
      impact of this intervention is to promote a more positive quality of life for young adults&#xD;
      with high functioning ASD including increased postsecondary education completion, employment,&#xD;
      self-determination, and decreased difficulties with coping and depression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to conduct an alternative treatment randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial (RCT) to examine the efficacy of the TEACCH School Transition to Employment and&#xD;
      Postsecondary Education (T-STEP) Program, a 12-week transition intervention targeting&#xD;
      specific challenges that young adults with ASD experience in executive function, social&#xD;
      communication, and emotion regulation including group intervention, internship, and&#xD;
      counseling services, compared to counseling services only. The investigator predicts that the&#xD;
      full T-STEP program (community college course, internship, counseling) will lead to improved&#xD;
      short-term and long-term outcomes compared to counseling services only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One cohort will be conducted per semester at two different community colleges with the&#xD;
      specific semester counterbalanced across years. Each site will run one to two cohorts per&#xD;
      year. The study will be conducted for three years. Students will be enrolled in the study&#xD;
      after screening inclusion criteria have been met.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening. After contact, initial eligibility criteria will be confirmed during a phone&#xD;
           screening documenting age, previous diagnosis of ASD, and completion, or in the final&#xD;
           year of completing, a high school diploma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pre-Assessment. Young adults and caregivers will complete an assessment at their&#xD;
           regional community college or via video visit (depending on COVID-19 restrictions) to&#xD;
           verify eligibility. Following verification students will be randomized to the T-STEP&#xD;
           Comprehensive intervention or the Counseling Only intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The statistical consultant will use a random number generator to assign participants to&#xD;
           the T-STEP Comprehensive intervention condition or the Counseling Only condition. The&#xD;
           statistical consultant will use a random number generator to assign participants to the&#xD;
           T-STEP Comprehensive intervention condition or the Counseling Only condition. Assignment&#xD;
           will be made separately at each site and with equal numbers assigned to each condition.&#xD;
           This will ensure that equal numbers of participants are assigned to each condition&#xD;
           across sites per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Baseline. Baseline assessments are estimated to take 2 hours (1 hour for behavioral&#xD;
           measures; 1 hour for self-report paper and pencil measures). Caregiver measures are&#xD;
           estimated to take 1 to 1.5 hours. Assessments will take place on the community college&#xD;
           campus or via video visit (depending on COVID-19 restrictions).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Intervention. Both treatment conditions will be offered free of charge through our&#xD;
           partnership with participating community colleges. Participants in both groups will&#xD;
           complete 12-weeks of treatment as described below. All sessions will occur at regional&#xD;
           community college campuses via video sessions, or via a hybrid approach with some&#xD;
           sessions virtually and some sessions on campus (depending on COVID-19 restrictions).&#xD;
&#xD;
           T-STEP Intervention Condition. The T-STEP is a comprehensive 12-week transition program&#xD;
           that will be delivered in a community college setting. The curriculum includes 36 hours&#xD;
           of group-based instruction delivered within a traditional school academic semester&#xD;
           (i.e., 24 ninety-minute classes across 12 weeks). Students also participate in a weekly&#xD;
           community-based internship to practice the skills learned in the intervention group (2&#xD;
           hours per week for 12 weeks). In addition, students participate in 12 hours of&#xD;
           manualized individual counseling services that are traditionally available on a college&#xD;
           campus (e.g., job exploration/career counseling, academic counseling, and self-advocacy&#xD;
           counseling).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Counseling Only Intervention Condition. Participants in the Counseling Only condition&#xD;
           will receive the same manualized counseling sessions that are included in the T-STEP&#xD;
           program described above. Specifically, 12 hours of individual counseling focused on job&#xD;
           exploration/career counseling, academic counseling, and self-advocacy counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Post-Intervention (Post-Test) &amp; Follow-Up. Participants in both conditions will complete&#xD;
           post-assessments immediately following treatment and a follow-up assessment 4 months&#xD;
           (week 28) after finishing the treatment. All assessments will take place on the&#xD;
           community college campus or via video visit (depending on COVID-19 restrictions). Both&#xD;
           assessments will take approximately 2 hours to complete by students with ASD and 35&#xD;
           minutes to complete by caregivers. Assessments will be completed by research assistants&#xD;
           who are unfamiliar to participants.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Transition Readiness and Employability Evaluation (TREE) Scores from Baseline to Post-Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-intervention (within 4 weeks of completing the 12-week intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>An objective behavioral observation measure developed that provides a series of organization, social communication, and emotion regulation presses during a simulated work environment appropriate for students with ASD and average or higher IQ. Two 15-minute employment tasks appropriate to office (e.g., filing, assembly of information folders) and computer data entry (e.g., accounting receipts, entry of evaluations forms) settings are presented. Participants have opportunities for social interaction with co-workers and supervisors, to respond to corrective feedback, and to request assistance. Assessments will be videotaped and coded by a trained research assistant who will be blind to treatment condition. Domain raw scores will be calculated (Emotion Regulation 0-16; Executive Function 0-16; Social Communication 0-22). Lower scores in each domain indicate less impairment and a better outcome.</description>
