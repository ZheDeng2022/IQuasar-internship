      The purpose of this study is to to explore the efficacy and safety of PD-1 immune check point&#xD;
      inhibitor, sintilimab, in biomarker-selected subjects with advanced or metastatic Non-small&#xD;
      Cell Lung Cancer who have failed from standard front-line treatment.&#xD;

      This study is planned to be carried out in The First Hospital of China Medical University. 33&#xD;
      cases are preliminarily expected to be included. The study started in October 2020 and ended&#xD;
      in October 2023. It is expected that the trial will end in October 2023.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of such situations as withdrawal of informed consent, intolerance of drug&#xD;
      toxicity and side effects, or inappropriateness for further trials, each participant's&#xD;
      expected time for research and treatment will continue until radiographically confirmed tumor&#xD;
      progression occurs.&#xD;
