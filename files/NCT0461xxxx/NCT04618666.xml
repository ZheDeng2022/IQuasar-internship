      The appendix is a blind-ended tube connected to the cecum, from which it develops in the&#xD;
      embryo. The most common diseases of the appendix (in humans) are appendicitis and carcinoid&#xD;
      tumors. Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix. Symptoms commonly include right lower&#xD;
      abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite. However, approximately 40% of&#xD;
      people do not have these typical symptoms . Appendicitis is caused by a blockage of the&#xD;
      hollow portion of the appendix. This is most commonly due to a calcified &quot;stone&quot; made of&#xD;
      feces. Inflamed lymphoid tissue from a viral infection, parasites, gallstone, or tumors may&#xD;
      also cause the blockage. This blockage leads to increased pressures in the appendix,&#xD;
      decreased blood flow to the tissues of the appendix, and bacterial growth inside the appendix&#xD;
      causing inflammation. The combination of inflammation, reduced blood flow to the appendix and&#xD;
      distention of the appendix causes tissue injury and tissue death. If this process is left&#xD;
      untreated, the appendix may burst, releasing bacteria into the abdominal cavity, leading to&#xD;
      increased complications. The surgical procedure for the removal of the appendix is called an&#xD;
      appendicectomy. Appendicectomy can be performed through open or laparoscopic surgery. The&#xD;
      surgical procedure for the removal of the appendix is called an appendicectomy .&#xD;
      Appendicectomy can be performed through open or laparoscopic surgery. When the surgeon uses&#xD;
      the open approach, he makes an incision in the lower right section of the abdomen. Most&#xD;
      incisions are less than 3 in (7.6 cm) in length. The surgeon then identifies all of the&#xD;
      organs in the abdomen and examines them for other disease or abnormalities. The appendix is&#xD;
      located and brought up into the wounds. The surgeon separates the appendix from all the&#xD;
      surrounding tissue and its attachment to the cecum, and then removes it. The site where the&#xD;
      appendix was previously attached, the cecum, is closed and returned to the abdomen The muscle&#xD;
      layers and then the skin are sewn together . When the surgeon performs a laparoscopic&#xD;
      appendectomy, four incisions, each about 1 in (2.5 cm) in length, are made. One incision is&#xD;
      near the umbilicus, or navel, and one is between the umbilicus and the pubis. Two other&#xD;
      incisions are smaller and are on the right side of the lower abdomen. The surgeon then passes&#xD;
      a camera and special instruments through these incisions. With the aid of this equipment, the&#xD;
      surgeon visually examines the abdominal organs and identifies the appendix. The appendix is&#xD;
      then freed from all of its attachments and removed. The place where the appendix was formerly&#xD;
      attached, the cecum, is stitched. The appendix is removed through one of the incisions. The&#xD;
      instruments are removed and then all of the incisions are closed . The primary objective of&#xD;
      this study was to compare the laparoscopic approach and the conventional technique in the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic Appendicitis.&#xD;
