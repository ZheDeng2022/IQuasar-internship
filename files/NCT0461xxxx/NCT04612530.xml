  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irreversible electroporation is a local ablative technique used in the treatment of&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer. In addition to its cytoreductive ability, IRE also induces a systemic&#xD;
      immune response. However, this immune response is not potent enough to establish durable&#xD;
      regression of the tumor. The immune response can be leveraged by combining IRE with&#xD;
      immunotherapy. The primary aim of this study is to determine the safety of IRE + Nivolumab&#xD;
      (arm B) and IRE + Nivolumab + CpG (arm C). The secondary aim is to assess efficacy of the&#xD;
      experimental arms (B, C) and control arm A (Nivolumab monotherapy), based on overall and&#xD;
      progression-free survival as well as locoregional and systemic immune modulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic carcinoma is one of the deadliest types of cancer. In contrast to other cancers,&#xD;
      new treatment options have demonstrated only moderate improvements for pancreatic cancer in&#xD;
      terms of overall survival. Patients with metastasized disease (stage IV, AJCC) that are&#xD;
      treated with chemotherapy in the Netherlands currently present a median overall survival of&#xD;
      6.4 months. Previous research has shown promising results for patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer (LAPC, stage III, AJCC) with regards to combination treatment with&#xD;
      chemotherapy and irreversible electroporation (IRE), a local ablation technique that utilizes&#xD;
      electrical pulses to destroy cancerous tissue. In addition to an increase in overall&#xD;
      survival, IRE induced a systemic immune response. However, the immune response was not potent&#xD;
      enough to generate a lasting anti-tumor effect. Leveraging the body's own immune response by&#xD;
      using local and systemic immunotherapy may create a synergistic effect, potentially inducing&#xD;
      a durable anti-tumor response. The PANFIRE-III is a prospective randomised phase 1 trial with&#xD;
      the primary aim to determine safety of the combination therapies IRE + Nivolumab (arm B) and&#xD;
      CpG + IRE + Nivolumab (arm C) in patients with oligo-metastasized pancreatic cancer. The&#xD;
      secondary goal is to determine efficacy of the experimental arms (arm B, C) compared to the&#xD;
      control arm A (Nivolumab monotherapy). This will be assessed by looking at the overall and&#xD;
      progression-free survival as well as the locoregional and systemic immune response. The&#xD;
      treatment combination of IRE with immunotherapy has the potential to generate systemic&#xD;
      protection by in vivo vaccination against pancreatic cancer cells, hereby inhibiting both&#xD;
      local and distant tumor growth.&#xD;
