  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study focused on patients with digestive system tumors resistant to PD-1&#xD;
      inhibitors, and explored the reversal resistance of epigenetic drugs (decitabine) and TKI&#xD;
      drugs (anlotinib) in this part of patients.&#xD;

    <description>&quot;Real low-dose epigenetics drugs (decitabine) can reverse the resistance of PD-1 inhibitors by re-regulating the immune microenvironment.&#xD;
TQB2450 is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting PD-L1, which prevents PD-L1 from binding to the PD-1 and B7.1 receptors on the surface of T cells, so as to restore the activity of T cells and thereby enhance the immune response, and has the potential to treat various types of tumors.&quot;</description>

Anlotinib Hydrochloride is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with significant inhibitory activity against angiogenesis related kinases (VEGFR1/2/3, FGFR1/2/3, etc.) and other tumor cell proliferation-related kinases (PDGFR /, C-Kit, RET, etc.), which can play a dual role in anti-tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth inhibition. &quot;</description>
