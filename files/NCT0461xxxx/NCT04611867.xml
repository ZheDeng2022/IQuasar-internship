  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic and lung cancer are ones of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. During&#xD;
      the course of illness, these patients often experience marked physical suffering,&#xD;
      psychological distress and frequent unplanned resource-demanding hospitalized care. Patients&#xD;
      with pancreatic and lung cancer have highest rates of unplanned hospitalizations.&#xD;
      Investigator initiated prospective &quot;Study of Supportive Application with Integrated&#xD;
      Patient-Reported Outcomes in Patients with Advanced Pancreatic or Lung Cancer&#xD;
      (BetterEveryDay)&quot; is to be initiated based on the great need for optimizing treatment care,&#xD;
      reducing hospitalizations and improving outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is designed as an investigator initiated prospective study of patients with&#xD;
      advanced pancreatic and lung (non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC) cancer initiating systemic&#xD;
      treatment to determine the feasibility and efficacy of supportive application with integrated&#xD;
      weekly Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO) on unplanned hospitalization, Quality of Life (QoL),&#xD;
      survival, satisfaction with oncologist communication, and resource utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of Part A (Feasibility), as well as a possible Part B (Randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial, RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, 30 patients with advanced lung (NSCLC) and pancreatic cancer initiating systemic&#xD;
      therapy will be enrolled in the Part A to assess the feasibility of the supportive&#xD;
      application with integrated weekly PRO. Patients included in feasibility Part A will be&#xD;
      instructed in self-reporting via web-based supportive application with integrated weekly PRO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of successfully completed Part A, the randomized Part B will be activated to&#xD;
      determine the efficacy of the supportive application with integrated weekly PRO on unplanned&#xD;
      hospitalization, QoL, survival, satisfaction and resource utilization for patients with&#xD;
      advanced lung (NSCLC) and pancreatic cancer initiating systemic therapy. Format of that Part&#xD;
      B will be adjusted if indicated based on the feasibility responses seen in the 30 patients in&#xD;
      Part A. Patients will be randomized in Part B with a 1:1 ratio in a stratified manner&#xD;
      according to cancer type (lung cancer versus pancreatic cancer). If initiated, the data from&#xD;
      Part B: RCT will be analyzed separately and will not be pooled with Part A for the purpose of&#xD;
      statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the course of the study patients in both arms will be asked to complete questionnaires&#xD;
      about QoL at baseline and week 12 and 24. Additionally, patients in both arms are asked to&#xD;
      complete the modified Health Care Climate Questionnaire (HCCQ) at week 12 and 24.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will fill in a web-based application PRO-CTCAE with integrated preparation questionnaire every week. If their weekly reported symptoms exceed a predefined threshold of severity, this results in a notification on the staff application interface and a nurse will contact a patient for verification of symptoms. Nurse will review patient recent treatment and PRO reports and advise patient according to the local practice for symptom management and reinforce reporting. Nurse will consult with or refers to (if possible) treating physician if patient will require medical intervention and/or physician assistance.</description>
