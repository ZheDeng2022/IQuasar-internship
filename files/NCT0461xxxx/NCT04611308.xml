      Globally, breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers in women and is the second&#xD;
      leading cause of cancer death , representing 15% of worldwide deaths per year. In Egypt, it&#xD;
      accounts for 32 % of cancer in women with a high mortality rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology of breast cancer is multifactorial in which multiple epigenetic and genetic&#xD;
      variations affect its incidence and prognosis . Although diagnostic methods and therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies for breast cancer have been improved in past decades, long-term survival of breast&#xD;
      cancer patients still remains poor due to high proliferation, metastasis and post-surgical&#xD;
      recurrence rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it is critical to develop more effective screening methods that can detect BC at&#xD;
      an early stage and novel therapeutic targets for better treatment. This may be achieved by&#xD;
      understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the initiation and progression of this&#xD;
      malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complement C1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein (CTRPs) are a protein family of&#xD;
      adiponectin paralogs which contains fifteen members, CTRP1- CTRP15. This super family are&#xD;
      involved in several biological processes, including metabolism, immunity, inflammation,&#xD;
      apoptosis and cell differentiation (15, 16). Accumulating evidence correlates CTRP family&#xD;
      members with carcinogenesis and signaling pathways associated with cancer development,&#xD;
      progression and metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein 6 (CTRP6) or (C1qTNF6) is a member of CTRPs family.&#xD;
      It contains four domains including signal peptide, short N-terminal variable region, collagen&#xD;
      domain and C-terminal C1q domain. It is expressed mainly in placenta, heart, uterus and&#xD;
      adipose tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CTRP6 is involved in multiple physiological processes, such as regulating cell proliferation&#xD;
      and differentiation. It also mediates fatty acid oxidation, adipogenesis and insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity, attenuates cell fibrosis and displays anti-inflammatory properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although recent studies have revealed that adiponectin has an inhibitory role in&#xD;
      carcinogenesis, the role of CTRP6 in carcinogenesis remains unclear. CTRP6 was initially&#xD;
      found to be overexpressed and possibly contributes to tumor angiogenesis in many&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinomas. Moreover, recent research indicates that CTRP6 is correlated with&#xD;
      gastric cancer progression by mediating proliferation, migration and apoptosis, which reveals&#xD;
      a similar pattern in lung adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, tumor suppressor functions of CTRP6 were also successively reported. CTRP6 was found&#xD;
      to have inhibitory effect on the proliferation and migration of ovarian cancer cells.&#xD;
      Moreover, CTRP6 significantly suppressed the growth and invasion activity of the oral&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role CTRP6 plays in breast cancer is yet unknown. The present study will investigate the&#xD;
      level of CTRP6 in BC specimens. Furthermore, the pathological functions of CTRP6 in BC,&#xD;
      including cell growth, proliferation, migration, and effect on inflammation and angiogenesis&#xD;
      will be studied in breast cancer cells.&#xD;
