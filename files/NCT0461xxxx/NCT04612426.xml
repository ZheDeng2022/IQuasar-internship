  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke has become the first cause of death and disability among Chinese adults. 70%-80% of&#xD;
      patients cannot live independently due to disability, which has brought a heavy burden to&#xD;
      families, medical institutions and society. How to better evaluate and improve post-stroke&#xD;
      motor and cognitive dysfunction has always been a hot research topic. With the rapid&#xD;
      development of brain-computer interface technology, rehabilitation assessment based on&#xD;
      quantitative EEG analysis is gradually being applied in the medical field. So we designed a&#xD;
      brain-computer interface based on hierarchical task induction-pedaling rehabilitation&#xD;
      training system to investigate the effectiveness on the rehabilitation of stroke patients.&#xD;

    <description>The Brain-computer Interface-Pedaling Training System includes four parts: computer, monitor, EEG testing equipment and pedaling training equipment. The patient wears an EEG detection device, which calculates brain movement participation every 0.5 seconds. The system will provide real-time visual/auditory/somatosensory feedback to patients based on the results of participation, so that patients can participate in motor function training more attentively.</description>
