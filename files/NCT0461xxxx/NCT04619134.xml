    <textblock>
      The aim of study is to determine effects of non pain contingent spine rehabilitation in&#xD;
      chronic low back pain.A Randomized controlled trial will be conducted at Railway general&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size will be 32.Participants will be divided in two groups, 16 participants in group A&#xD;
      will receive Non pain contingent spine rehabilitation (NCSR) therapy and 16 Group B will&#xD;
      receive conventional physical therapy. The study duration will be six months. Purposive non&#xD;
      probability sampling technique will be applied.&#xD;

      Low back pain is defined as pain and discomfort below the costal margin and above the&#xD;
      inferior gluteal folds. It has different characteristics such as aching, burning, stabbing,&#xD;
      sharp or dull, well-defined, or vague. Low back pain may have intensity varying from mild to&#xD;
      severe . Low back pain (LBP) causes more disability than any other medical condition&#xD;
      worldwide Low Back Pain has a significant impact on functional capacity, as pain restricts&#xD;
      occupational activities and is a major cause of absenteeism. Chronic low Back pain is defined&#xD;
      as chronic when pain remains for more than three months it has different characteristics.&#xD;
      Many authors define chronic pain as pain that lasts beyond the expected period of healing.&#xD;
      Low back pain is classified and treated according to duration of symptoms, cause, absence or&#xD;
      presence of radiculopathy and associated anatomical and radiographic changes. Symptoms&#xD;
      persisting for less than 4 weeks is defined as acute low back pain and in sub-acute low back&#xD;
      pain symptoms lasts for 4-12 weeks, chronic low back pain lasts for more than 12 weeks. Back&#xD;
      pain can also be categorized into specific and nonspecific back pain, Specific back pain has&#xD;
      a specific cause for example fracture and infection etc. and nonspecific is of unknown&#xD;
      etiology. Non-specific pain is most common type of back pain. The prevalence of low back pain&#xD;
      has been reported among many people especially when resulting from work related and&#xD;
      occupational activities 75-84% of the general population suffer from low back pain and among&#xD;
      them, it is estimated that 5-10% of the people experience LBP resulting in severe morbidity,&#xD;
      increased health care costs, sick leaves and individual suffering. Men and women are equally&#xD;
      reported to be affected by this condition. Core muscles maintain spinal stability, first&#xD;
      group include deep core muscles also called local stabilizing muscles primarily include the&#xD;
      transversus abdominis, lumbar multifidus, internal oblique muscle and quadratus lumborum.&#xD;
      Second group include shallow core muscles, also known as global stabilizing muscles,&#xD;
      including the rectus abdominis, internal and external oblique muscles, erector spinae,&#xD;
      quadratus lumborum, and hip muscles. The causes of chronic low back pain are complex, several&#xD;
      of which are unknown one major cause involves the weakening of the shallow trunk and&#xD;
      abdominal muscle, another cause of chronic low back pain is the weakening of deep trunk&#xD;
      muscles, such as the lumbar multifidus and transversus abdominis. Patients usually experience&#xD;
      pain during lifting it leads to avoidance behavior and cause disability. Less intensive and&#xD;
      cost effective non pain contingent rehabilitation therapy could target fear avoidance&#xD;
      behavior toward lifting and in restoration of normal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In female patients with chronic low back pain, Primary outcome measures were recorded by&#xD;
      visual analogue scale (VAS) and oswestry disability index (ODI) .Patterns of improvement&#xD;
      suggested that the Non pain Contingent Spinal Rehabilitation approach is more effective than&#xD;
      Conventional Physical Therapy in female patients with chronic low back pain. It is feasible&#xD;
      to adapt progressive Isoinertial lifting evaluation for determining the lifting capacity, it&#xD;
      is a valid and reliable method. Lumbar dynamic strengthening exercises are beneficial in the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic nonspecific LBP for reduction of pain, improvement in functional&#xD;
      ability, increase range of motion and improve core strength. Exercise intervention programs&#xD;
      involving either muscular strength, flexibility or aerobic fitness is beneficial for&#xD;
      nonspecific chronic low back pain. Effects of lumbar stabilization exercise on functional&#xD;
      disability and lumbar lordosis angle in patients with chronic low back pain in 2015 Lumbar&#xD;
      stabilization exercise and conservative program were performed 3 times a week for 6 weeks and&#xD;
      he reported that lumbar stabilization exercise is more effective than conservative treatment&#xD;
      for improving functional disability and lumbar lordosis angle, and significant decrease in&#xD;
      Oswestry disability index score. Comparative effect of core muscles strength training with&#xD;
      supine bridging over prone bridging in patients with nonspecific low back pain and concluded&#xD;
      that prone bridging exercise is more effective in improvement of functional activities and&#xD;
      reducing pain than supine bridging exercise program in nonspecific low back pain.&#xD;
      Effectiveness of core stabilization exercises and routine exercise therapy in management of&#xD;
      pain in chronic non-specific low back pain&quot; in which he reported that Core stabilization&#xD;
      exercise is more effective than routine physical therapy exercise in terms of greater&#xD;
      reduction in pain in patients with non-specific low back pain. In 2013 The purpose of the&#xD;
      study was to determine the effect of core stabilization exercises in comparison with&#xD;
      conventional exercises on pain, functional status in patients with non-specific LBP and they&#xD;
      concluded Core stabilization exercises found to be more effective in reducing pain and&#xD;
      improving functional status by decreasing disability of patients with non-specific low back&#xD;
      pain in comparison with conventional exercises. Progressive Isoinertial Lift Evaluation&#xD;
      (PILE) method was developed by Mayer et al.in PILE protocol describes it as lifting of weight&#xD;
      in a box from floor to waist (lumbar test) or from floor to shoulder height (cervical test)&#xD;
      at a rate of four lifts in a 20 second interval.&#xD;
