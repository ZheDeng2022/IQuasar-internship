  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, chronic, debilitating mood disorder causing&#xD;
      serious functional impairment and significantly decreased quality of life. Pharmacotherapy&#xD;
      represents the first-line treatment choice; however, only about one third of patients respond&#xD;
      to the first trial because of antidepressants ineffectiveness or side-effects. This causes&#xD;
      suffering for patients and their families and significantly contributes to pushing up costs&#xD;
      for healthcare services. Precision medicine in psychiatry might offer to clinicians the&#xD;
      possibility to tailor the treatment according to the best possible evidence of effectiveness&#xD;
      and tolerability for each subject. In this context our study aims to carry out a clinical&#xD;
      validation of a combinatorial pharmacogenomics (PGx) test in an Italian MDD patient cohort&#xD;
      with an advocacy license independence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study is a prospective single-blind randomized controlled clinical observational trial&#xD;
      enrolling 300 MDD patients. Patients referred to psychiatric services due to the failure&#xD;
      and/or the onset of adverse effects of their current treatment for receiving a new&#xD;
      antidepressant. Eligible participants with a primary diagnosis of MDD according to DSM-5&#xD;
      criteria and a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D17) with a score &gt; 14 are randomized to&#xD;
      TGTG group (Treated with Genetic Test Guide) or TAU group (Treated as Usual). For all&#xD;
      subjects, buccal brush for DNA is collected. The primary outcome is the reduction in&#xD;
      depressive symptomatology as measured by HAM-D17. The secondary outcomes involve a range of&#xD;
      scales that assess MDD symptoms and social functioning outcomes. The assessment is performed&#xD;
      at four timepoints: baseline and 4, 8, and 12 weeks. This project represents the first&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trial in which is tested whether a non-commercial PGx test&#xD;
      improves outcomes in a MDD naturalistic cohort. Moreover, the identification of new genetic&#xD;
      variants associated with non-response or side effects will improve the efficacy of the test&#xD;
      leading to a further cost-saving.&#xD;
