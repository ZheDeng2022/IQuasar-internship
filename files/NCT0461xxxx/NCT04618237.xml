  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with severe hemophilia A can experience repeated bleeding into the same joint (ie, a&#xD;
      target joint; most frequently in the ankle, knee, and elbow), which can contribute to&#xD;
      hemophilic arthropathy and, over time, ultimately result in chronic pain, functional&#xD;
      limitations, deformities, reduced joint of motion and decreased quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early use of prophylaxis is recommended following diagnosis of severe hemophilia A to&#xD;
      maintain joint health and prevent joint destruction. Eloctate is produced using a human cell&#xD;
      line and an addition of an Fc fusion protein to recombinant FVIII (rFVIIIFc) with prolonged&#xD;
      half-life and was launched in Taiwan from Nov. 2018. The pivotal studies of rFVIIIFc show&#xD;
      that patients maintained a low bleeding rate, with most experiencing a median annualized&#xD;
      bleeding rate (ABR) of 0 and 97% of target joints were resolved across adult, adolescent, and&#xD;
      pediatric subjects during 4 years of prophylaxis rFVIIIFc treatment. However, in Taiwan we&#xD;
      are still lacking the real world treatment outcome data on rFVIIIFc, especially for the joint&#xD;
      health evidence in Asian Hemophilia A patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of rFVIIIFc treatment&#xD;
      on joint health over a long observational period of 36 month focused on physical and&#xD;
      functional changes in hemophilia A patients.&#xD;

      Thermographic assessment has been proposed to be a potential tool in evaluating the&#xD;
      inflammatory arthritis patients. Thermography has advantages of simple, time-saving, low&#xD;
      skill demanding, no radiation exposure and non-invasiveness. It is possible to conduct a&#xD;
      quantitative analysis with thermography. However, it is still unknown whether thermography&#xD;
      evaluation can provide clinical information regarding the joint health in hemophilia&#xD;
      arthropathy patients. The project will focus on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigate the association among thermography findings and functional status in&#xD;
           hemophilia arthroplasty&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigate the novel biomarkers in predicting function in hemophilia arthropathy&#xD;
           including: soft tissue ultrasound, body composition, thermographic findings of joints,&#xD;
           muscle composition and serum biomarkers of joint degeneration.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The HJHS measures joint health, in the domain of body structure and function (i.e. impairment), of the joints most commonly affected by bleeding in hemophilia: the knees, ankles, and elbows. The HJHS provides a total score (higher score is worse; max=124), joint specific scores, and a global gait score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Musculoskeletal ultrasound/HEAD-US scoring system (Haemophilia Early Arthropathy Detection by UltraSound)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Musculoskeletal ultrasound could detect soft tissue alterations and be used as early detection of hemophilic arthropathy. Ultrasound assessment of bilateral knees and ankles, and bilateral gastrocnemius and quadriceps would be taken out in this study and scored with HEAD-US(Haemophilia Early Arthropathy Detection by UltraSound) scoring system. The scoring was based on three markers: synovitis (score 0-2), cartilage (score 0-4) and subchondral bone (score of 0-2) with a maximum score of eight points per joint, higher score is worse.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>X-rays/Pettersson score (PS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>X-rays are used to evaluate structural changes in joints of patients with hemophilic arthropathy. X-rays images of bilateral knees and ankles will be taken in this study and scored with Pettersson scoring system. The maximum possible score for a given joint is 13 points and higher score is worse.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Thermography</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Infrared thermography could be a simple tool to detect early inflammation of joints and joint associated structures. FLIR ONE imaging camera is used to take thermal images.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serum markers: cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 months follow up</time_frame>
