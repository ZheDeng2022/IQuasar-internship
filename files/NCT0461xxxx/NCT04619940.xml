      The validity and reliability of active internal rotation ROM measurement of shoulder with&#xD;
      smartphone in patients with shoulder pain was investigated.&#xD;

      Eighteen patients with shoulder pain who applied to the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation,&#xD;
      shoulder subspecialty outpatient clinic who agreed to participate in the study and 18&#xD;
      volunteers who had not experienced shoulder pain before enrolled in the study. Participant&#xD;
      age range was determined as 40-70 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IHandy® app is a free app with a visual display similar to that of the digital&#xD;
      inclinometer in terms of digital size. In this study, due to its prevalence in the literature&#xD;
      and its use in clinics, manual goniometer (gold standard) was chosen to be compared with this&#xD;
      iPhone application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants were asked to lie on the bed in supine position with shoulder to be measured&#xD;
      at the edge of the bed. The measured shoulder was positioned at 90 degrees abduction, 90&#xD;
      degrees elbow flexion and forearm at neutral position. The participant was asked to bring the&#xD;
      wrist closer to the bed in the direction of the little finger, and was measured at the angle&#xD;
      that the shoulder could not move without lifting the arm. In the measurement made with the&#xD;
      application, the phone was held parallel to the ulna and the value displayed on the screen&#xD;
      was recorded. The participant were asked to repeat the movement if his/her shoulder lift up&#xD;
      of bed, straightened his/her elbow, or did anything that would disrupt her movement pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each measurement was repeated 3 times and after 2 weeks the control measurements were made by&#xD;
      repeating 3 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements were conducted separately in different cabinets without seeing each other for&#xD;
      each participant by 1 physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist and 1 physiotherapist.&#xD;
      The measurements were recorded in separate locations until all participants were completed.&#xD;
