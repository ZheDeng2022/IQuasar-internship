  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most asthma is allergic in origin. The purpose of this study is to better understand the&#xD;
      airway immune response to inhaled allergens in order to identify factors that promote asthma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allergy is the strongest risk factor for asthma, and most cases of asthma are allergic in&#xD;
      origin. However, not all allergic patients have asthma. In this study, we will enroll&#xD;
      allergic adults to undergo bronchoscopic segmental allergen challenge in order to identify&#xD;
      differences in the airway immune response to allergen in those with asthma compared to those&#xD;
      without asthma. After a discussion about the study and potential risks, subjects giving&#xD;
      written informed consent will undergo two bronchoscopies. During the first procedure, samples&#xD;
      will be collected from the left lung and allergen will be administered to a small segment of&#xD;
      the right lung. The second procedure will be performed 24 hours later, with collection of&#xD;
      samples from the allergen-challenged lung segment.&#xD;
