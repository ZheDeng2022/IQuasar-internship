      The study hypothesis is that perioperative Auricular (battlefield) acupuncture for general&#xD;
      surgery and urology cases undergoing general anesthesia will decrease opioid requirements,&#xD;
      postoperative pain, the incidence of PONV, and the incidence of perioperative anxiety in&#xD;
      comparison to simulated (placebo) perioperative battlefield acupuncture.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Battlefield acupuncture is an auricular therapy that has been used for centuries, with roots&#xD;
      tied to Eastern Asian medicine. Ease of application, low cost, and minimal side effects make&#xD;
      battlefield acupuncture a perioperative modality that has been linked to decreased morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality in patients undergoing surgical procedures and anesthesia (1). In the United&#xD;
      States, there is pressure by the government and the medical community to decrease opioid use,&#xD;
      especially in the perioperative time period. Opiate use due to postoperative pain,&#xD;
      postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), perioperative anxiety have all been linked to an&#xD;
      increased hospital stay, increased morbidity, and mortality, and ultimately higher healthcare&#xD;
      costs (2). Anesthesia providers can be trained in the application of acupuncture in the&#xD;
      perioperative time period. Through analysis of rates of postoperative opioid use,&#xD;
      postoperative nausea and vomiting and perioperative anxiety, the efficacy, and utility of&#xD;
      battlefield acupuncture will be realized as an effective adjunct to multimodal anesthesia&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective randomized study to compare auricular battlefield acupuncture to&#xD;
      sham auricular battlefield acupuncture in patients undergoing general surgery and urology&#xD;
      cases with general anesthesia. Participants in the study will be randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      receive auricular battlefield acupuncture (treatment group) or simulated (placebo; control&#xD;
      group) auricular battlefield acupuncture. Battlefield acupuncture needles will be utilized in&#xD;
      the test arm and blunt needle pressing and covering with acupuncture stickers will be&#xD;
      utilized in the control arm as a sham treatment. Location of needles and stickers will be&#xD;
      placed according to 5 VA approved BFA auricular acupuncture points associated with PONV,&#xD;
      pain, and anxiety respectively (Figure 1; 3). In both arms, the treatment ear will be covered&#xD;
      after treatment so as to blind the patient. Both battlefield acupuncture and control groups&#xD;
      will receive small band aids on the battlefield acupuncture needle sites. Both the evaluators&#xD;
      for post procedure assessment along with the patient will be blinded in regards to what group&#xD;
      they are in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1- Patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status&#xD;
      classification of 1 to 4 2 - Patients aged between 18 and 100 scheduled to undergo scheduled&#xD;
      suitable inpatient/outpatient cases under anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 - Patients must be willing and fit to give written informed consent 4 - Inpatient stay&#xD;
      required&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - Coagulopathies&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Patients with continuous epidural&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - Uncooperative patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. - Psychiatric disorders and language deficiencies that may interfere with the assessment&#xD;
           of pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. - Insufficient understanding of the pain scoring system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. - Outpatient stay&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be performed at the John D. Dingell VA Medical Center. Only a trained MD&#xD;
      anesthesiologist will recruit patient in the preoperative period, where informed consent will&#xD;
      be obtained. Computerized randomization will take place at the time the patient presents for&#xD;
      surgery. Consent will be taken preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anesthetic management will be general anesthesia with the provision of intravenous&#xD;
      opioids intraoperatively and during recovery. Fentanyl will be the sole intra operative&#xD;
      opioid. No other alterations of anesthetic management will take place pre or intra&#xD;
      operatively. The battlefield acupuncture or sham battlefield acupuncture will be placed in&#xD;
      the postoperative care unit (PACU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupuncture Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Typically acupuncture needles which are semi-permanent needles have the characteristics of&#xD;
      remaining in the ear acupoints for up to 3-4 days before being pushed out toward to the&#xD;
      surface by the previous flattened epidermis. The test arm (treatment group) will received&#xD;
      actual acupuncture needles, while the control arm will received sham or placebo acupuncture&#xD;
      via pressing of a blunt needle on the specified BFA locations and then application of&#xD;
      adhesive stickers. In the control group simulating acupuncture, the needles will never enter&#xD;
      the patients' skin and will give the impression to the patient that the procedure has taken&#xD;
      place. The ear treated will be covered with a bandage via non-skin sensitive tape so as to&#xD;
      blind the patient to which treatment group they are in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An unpaired students-t-test procedure (two-sample assuming equal variances, two-tail&#xD;
      significance p&lt;0.05, 95% confidence interval) was performed to examine mean differences&#xD;
      between the two study groups on all continuously scaled variables. A Repeated measures ANOVA&#xD;
      will be used to measured differences between time for continuous variables at the 2 measured&#xD;
      time points (1 hour and 24 hours). Assumptions of normality and/or homogeneity of variance&#xD;
      will be checked and verified. Comparisons between study groups on proportional differences&#xD;
      will be examined using a non-parametric Fisher's Exact Chi-square test, when applied to 2x2&#xD;
      tables. Statistical significance will be set at a p-value ≤0.05. All continuous data will be&#xD;
      expressed as the mean with 95% upper and lower confidence intervals or Mean ± Standard&#xD;
      deviation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A binary outcome, superiority power analysis based on a rate of 33% reduction of opioid&#xD;
      consumption in the auricular battlefield acupuncture group compared to controls (sham&#xD;
      auricular battlefield acupuncture) concluded 72 participants (36 patients per group) would be&#xD;
      necessary to achieve 80% power with a p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
