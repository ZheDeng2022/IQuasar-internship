    <textblock>
      This study is designed to identify the best tolerated doses of Lutathera® and Azedra® when&#xD;
      co-administered to treat midgut neuroendocrine tumors. These drugs are radioactive drugs,&#xD;
      known as radionuclide therapy, and are both approved in the treatment of midgut&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumor as single agents (not together). Currently, the safest and best&#xD;
      tolerated doses of these drugs (when combined) is unknown. That is the purpose of this&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Azedra and Lutatheraare are FDA-approved radioactive drugs designed to treat specific tumor&#xD;
      cells. These drugs are a combination of the radiation (131-Iodine, 177-lutetium) and a&#xD;
      protein that targets the tumor cell (MIBG or DOTATATE). Because these proteins are attracted&#xD;
      to, and stick to, the tumor, the radiation is centered in the tumors. This kills more tumor&#xD;
      cells and minimizes radiation-damage to healthy tissues, like the heart and lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two organs still absorb some of the radiation, though: bone marrow and the kidney. These&#xD;
      organs limit how much radiation can be given to tumors, but we don't know how much radiation&#xD;
      is too much. Too much radiation to bone marrow can result in anemia. Too much radiation to&#xD;
      the kidneys can result in kidney failure. From prior radiation therapies, we have a general&#xD;
      idea of how much radiation we can give safely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Azedra and Lutathera have never been given together. We want to give them together because&#xD;
      many times, tumors are actually groups of different types of cells. This means, not all the&#xD;
      cells respond to therapy the same way. If some tumor cells survive therapy, the tumor will&#xD;
      continue to grow and eventually come back. We know some mid-gut neuroendocrine tumors (NETs)&#xD;
      have targets for DOTATATE and some other mid-gut NETs have targets for MIBG. We also have now&#xD;
      identified that some people with mid-gut NETs have different tumors: some with targets for&#xD;
      MIBG and some with targets for DOTATATE. For these people, this means treating only with&#xD;
      Azedra or Lutathera will not be enough to treat their cancer. They need both radioactive&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because we are combining these radioactive drugs, this study is known as a first-in-man&#xD;
      study. We are also using a special imaging to help us estimate the radiation dose to the bone&#xD;
      marrow and to the kidneys. This is what decides the final dose of Azedra and Lutathera.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving a standard treatment of Lutathera, participants are asked to undergo imaging&#xD;
      to verify they have both MIBG and DOTATATE tumor types:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  participants are given a tracer dose of Azedra&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a special camera (SPECT/CT) collects images (scans)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  imaging (scans) are done over 4 calendar days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood samples are taken at that time, too, to measure the circulating amount of tracer&#xD;
           doses&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the scans show a participant does not have both MIBG and DOTATATE receptors, they continue&#xD;
      with standard therapy (Lutathera only). Participants are asked to still undergo study&#xD;
      assessments to provide a comparison group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the scans show a participant has both MIBG and DOTATATE receptors, combined therapy is&#xD;
      administered:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a customized dose of Lutathera is given on day 1 of a treatment cycle. This is given&#xD;
           outpatient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a customized dose of Azedra is given on day 2 of a treatment cycle. This is given&#xD;
           inpatient (admitted to the hospital).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  participants are monitored through blood tests to identify the side effects of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant can have up to 2 cycles of therapy. The cycles are 12 weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doses for Lutathera and Azedra are decided based on radiation to the bone marrow and&#xD;
      radiation to the kidney. Doses are decided by how well other participants have done on this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have life long follow-up for this study. This is very important, because a study&#xD;
      like this has not been done.&#xD;
