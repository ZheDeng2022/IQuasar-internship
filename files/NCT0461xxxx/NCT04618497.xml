  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients commonly visit the emergency department (ED) for pain after musculoskeletal injury&#xD;
      and need early treatment with analgesic. Prompt and adequate pain relief can reduce suffering&#xD;
      and promote early discharge and return to work. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)&#xD;
      and opioids are the major injectable analgesic used for moderate to severe pain in EDs in&#xD;
      Hong Kong. They are given via intravenous or intramuscular route for faster onset of action&#xD;
      to achieve rapid pain relief in the emergency setting. However, injections are invasive and&#xD;
      can be distressing for patients. Methoxyflurane (Penthrox®) is recently introduced to our&#xD;
      emergency department as an inhalational analgesic. It has been granted registration approval&#xD;
      in Hong Kong since 2018, but it is not widely used in the locality. Methoxyflurane is a&#xD;
      volatile fluorinated hydrocarbon self-administrated by inhalation through a portable&#xD;
      hand-held whistle-shaped inhaler device (Penthrox®) to relieve pain associated with trauma or&#xD;
      minor surgical procedures in stable and conscious patients. In this study, the investigators&#xD;
      will evaluate the efficacy and safety Penthrox® in the treatment of acute traumatic pain in&#xD;
      hospital emergency department setting by comparing it to another conventional analgesic&#xD;
      commonly used.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be enrolled on a convenience basis. After being seen and screened by investigators, patients who meet all inclusion and non-exclusion criteria will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 by drawing from equal preset numbers of envelopes. Patients will receive either inhalational methoxyflurane or intramuscular ketorolac. Patients and investigators are not blinded to the treatment due to the nature of drug administration.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Patients are advised to report any discomfort any time during the study period. The investigator would judge whether the complaint is drug-related and give corresponding treatment. If the patients have no active complaint, they would be asked on a checklist for possible related adverse events before discharge. The nature and severity of adverse events would be documented. To exclude any late effects, discharged patients are encouraged to return to the department if they experience any adverse events.</description>

    <description>Each patient in the methoxyflurane group will use one Penthrox inhaler under supervision of trained personnel. After priming the inhaler with 3 mL of methoxyflurane, patient is instructed to inhale through the mouthpiece to obtain analgesia, and then exhale back into the mouthpiece so that any unmetabolized methoxyflurane can be adsorbed by activated charcoal chamber. First few breaths should be gentle and then breathe normally through Inhaler. Onset of pain relief is rapid and occurs after 6-10 inhalations. If stronger analgesia is required, patient can cover the diluter hole with a finger during inhalation. Patients are able to titrate the amount of methoxyflurane inhaled and should be instructed to inhale intermittently to achieve adequate pain control.</description>
