  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single patient, single center study evaluating if administration of pan-genotypic&#xD;
      DAA therapy on day 3 (+/- 2 days) post-kidney transplant prevents the transmission of&#xD;
      hepatitis C virus infection from an HCV-positive donor kidney to an HCV-negative recipient.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patient selected for this study previously received a kidney transplant under protocol&#xD;
      2016P002051. Unfortunately, she experienced primary graft nonfunction due to a renal vein&#xD;
      thrombus and acute thrombotic microangiopathy and the transplanted HCV+ kidney was removed.&#xD;
      She continued glecaprevir and pibrentasvir for the full course (8 weeks of treatment) and was&#xD;
      cured of HCV. However, she continues on dialysis requiring ongoing, albeit low dose,&#xD;
      immunosuppression after her failed transplant. This causes increased risk of infection and&#xD;
      other dialysis-related morbidity. Futhermore, she is at risk of access loss due to multiple&#xD;
      failed fistula attempts and prior dialysis catheter line thrombosis. Of note, she also failed&#xD;
      a trial of peritoneal dialysis due to development of a large pleural effusion (a known&#xD;
      treatment-limiting complication of peritoneal dialysis). Thus, this young patient, is at risk&#xD;
      of losing dialysis access which could lead to death. The MGH transplant team has now decided&#xD;
      that she could be retransplanted with alterations in peri-transplant anticoagulation and&#xD;
      immunosuppression (eculizumab) that they are confident should decrease her risk of&#xD;
      peri-transplant thrombosis and recurrent TMA. Thus, we desire to expedite her access to&#xD;
      re-transplant. Through this protocol, this recipient will be given the opportunity to accept&#xD;
      a kidney that is HCV antibody positive and nucleic acid test (NAT) negative or HCV NAT&#xD;
      positive and will be treated with oral glecaprevir (300mg)/pibrentasvir (120mg) (G/P,&#xD;
      MavyretTM) on day 3 (+/- 2 days) post-kidney transplant to prevent the transmission of HCV&#xD;
      infection at the time of transplant. Our goal is to provide access to kidney transplantation&#xD;
      as soon as possible, with a donor of any genotype of infection, with elimination of the&#xD;
      potential HCV infection by therapy used on day 3 (+/- 2 days) in the case of HCV NAT+&#xD;
      transplant and surveillance and reactive therapy in the case of HCV antibody positive NAT-&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;
