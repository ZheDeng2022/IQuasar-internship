      The aim of this study is to determine whether self-administered, at-home use of a&#xD;
      transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulating device is an effective, acceptable and feasible&#xD;
      method of relief from neuropathic pain among patients with Neuromyelitis optica spectrum&#xD;
      disorder (NMOSD).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a chronic relapsing autoimmune disease of&#xD;
      the central nervous system (CNS) that preferentially targets the optic nerves and spinal&#xD;
      cord, leading to paralysis, blindness and death. NMOSD is a rare disease that affects&#xD;
      approximately 4,000-8,000 (8,000 - 15,000) people in the United States, disproportionately&#xD;
      affects non-Caucasians and females, and has a worldwide prevalence estimated to be 0.52 to&#xD;
      4.4/100,000. Pain is a severely disabling component of the disease with up to 91% of patients&#xD;
      reporting central neuropathic pain (CNP) characterized by agonizing burning, shooting or&#xD;
      tingling sensation in the face, arms, torso and legs. NMOSD lesions in the spinal cord are&#xD;
      characteristically long and destructive, and pain is more prevalent in NMOSD than in most&#xD;
      other neurological diseases. Research on the impact of persistent pain on quality of life&#xD;
      (QoL) in NMOSD has found that those patients with CNP experience more depression, less&#xD;
      enjoyment of life, and more difficulty with ambulation. Currently, there is no standard of&#xD;
      care for CNP treatment and off-label use of medications typically used for diabetic&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy are often insufficient. NMOSD is a devastating disease and there&#xD;
      remains a high unmet need for effective treatment of CNP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) therapy is a non-invasive pain modifying&#xD;
      intervention that utilizes transcutaneous electrical stimulation of ascending (sensory)&#xD;
      fibers with the intent of re-organizing maladaptive signaling pathways. This neuromodulatory&#xD;
      therapy has been investigated for treatment of persistent peripheral neuropathic pain in&#xD;
      several conditions including chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia and&#xD;
      post-surgical neuropathic pain with promising results. Patients report sustained relief after&#xD;
      undergoing daily treatment sessions for 10 consecutive weekdays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently the investigators completed a sham controlled trial using a TENS unit called&#xD;
      Scrambler in NMOSD patients showing a meaningful reduction in neuropathic pain compared to&#xD;
      controls. The Scrambler device must be operated in an office by a professional technician,&#xD;
      thereby limiting its usefulness to the wider NMOSD population. The home TENS device is&#xD;
      similar to the Scrambler unit in that it provides non-invasive transcutaneous electrical&#xD;
      impulses to reduce pain. It is a small, wearable device that utilizes both high and low&#xD;
      frequencies to create a nerve-block effect based on the same gating theory. Because the TENS&#xD;
      device for this study is programmable remotely, a controlled trial can be conducted while&#xD;
      keeping the patient blinded to the trial arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with NMOSD and other conditions that cause pain originating in the central&#xD;
      nervous system, non-obtrusive, non-pharmacological devices might prove a viable alternative&#xD;
      to pain medications. Pharmaceutical treatments for pain such as opioids have led to addiction&#xD;
      and life-style changes with unacceptable side effects. Cost and side effects are concerns&#xD;
      with other pharmacologic therapies for pain. In addition, in efforts to control pain, many&#xD;
      patients are prescribed multiple medications, and then have to cope with the complexities and&#xD;
      hazards of polypharmacy. Most importantly, none of the pharmaceutical treatments for pain in&#xD;
      NMOSD have been proven effective in a trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If it can be shown among a significant patient cohort that a safe and effective at-home&#xD;
      nonpharmacological pain therapy is available for patients with NMOSD, it would be life&#xD;
      altering for a great many - not only those with NMOSD, but also with related neuroimmune&#xD;
      disorders and other conditions with central neuropathic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to provide an effective, non-invasive treatment for neuropathic&#xD;
      pain in NMOSD that can be safely employed at home. Many NMOSD patients have such chronic pain&#xD;
      and/or disability that frequent visits to the clinic for therapy is difficult, if not&#xD;
      impossible, in the best of times. Secondly, safe at-home treatments that offer continuous&#xD;
      relief of pain (and potentially other co-occurring symptoms) can improve quality of life&#xD;
      immensely during this, and likely future times of social distancing, when leaving home is&#xD;
      dangerous, especially for a population on lifelong immune suppressants. Also, an at-home&#xD;
      therapeutic option will save both time and money for patients.&#xD;
