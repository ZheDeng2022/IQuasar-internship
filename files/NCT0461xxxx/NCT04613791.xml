  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a multifactorial pathology in which external (lifestyle, environment) and internal&#xD;
      (psychological or biological, especially genetic) factors are involved. These are responsible&#xD;
      for a positive energy balance. One of the external factors that can intervene in the genesis&#xD;
      of obesity is the existence of eating disorders: bulimic hyperphagia. Some teams consider&#xD;
      bulimic hyperphagia as a form of addiction. After bariatric surgery, the appearance of new&#xD;
      addictions has been observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In connection with Pr Perney's addictology department, the investigators have observed that&#xD;
      some patients under treatment for obesity at the endocrinology department subsequently&#xD;
      developed other addictions, in particular misuse of alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses of this research are :&#xD;
&#xD;
      There appears to be a transfer from eating disorders to substance misuse addiction in&#xD;
      post-treatment of obesity, particularly in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The misuse of addictive substances most concerned by this transfer of addiction in the&#xD;
      post-treatment of obesity, particularly after bariatric surgery, seems to be the misuse of&#xD;
      alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be the first French cohort study on addictive behaviors in patients undergoing&#xD;
      bariatric surgery and the first international study including non-operated obese patients&#xD;
      benefiting from medical care alone. This study will improve the multidisciplinary management&#xD;
      of these patients by integrating addictologists.&#xD;

    <measure>Presence of alcohol abuse evaluated at the first clinical consultation according to the AUDIT(Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) self-questionnaire consists of 10 questions covering consumption (the first 3 questions), behaviors that may evoke dependency (not being able to stop drinking, inability to carry out one's plans, needing a drink in the morning) and problems related to alcohol consumption (guilt or remorse, memory loss, injuries, concerns from family and friends). Each question can be scored from 0 (low) - 4 (high) points, leading to a possible total score of 40 points. This questionnaire therefore makes it possible to cover all aspects of alcohol misuse in a very short space of time. It has been validated with good diagnostic performance: sensitivity at 92% and specificity at 94% for a threshold ≥ 8 (Saunders et al. 1993; Coulton et al. 2006). Moreover, this questionnaire is very widely used and recognized in scientific articles on addictology.</description>

    <description>The &quot;Echelle de Qualité de Vie, Obésité et Diététique - EQVOD&quot; (Quality of Life, Obesity and Dietetics Scale ) is a self-questionnaire validated in French which is adapted to the socio-cultural factors of obesity in France, making it possible to take into account the effects of dietary treatments on the quality of life of obese subjects (see Appendix 17.5) (Ziegler et al. 2005). It consists of 36 items, rated from 1 (always/highly) to 5 (never/not at all). It explores five dimensions (physical impact - Q1-Q11, psychosocial impact - Q12-Q22, impact on sexual life - Q23-Q26, food well-being - Q27-Q31 and diet experience - Q32-Q36). The rating for each dimension is reported as 100. The closer the score is to 100, the better the quality of life related to that dimension.</description>

    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a self-report questionnaire that assesses depressive and anxiety symptomatology (excluding somatic symptoms) and measures severity in patients between 16 and 65 years of age from a hospital environment (Zigmong &amp; Snaith 1983, Snaith et al. 2003). The HADS consists of two parts: (a) 7 questions for screening for depression, and (b) 7 questions for screening for anxiety disorders. Each question receives a score between 0 and 3. The score for each part is obtained by adding the items that make up the part. The higher the score, the greater the severity of the corresponding symptoms.&#xD;
The French version was validated by Razavi et al. 1989 and Friedman et al. 2001.</description>

    <description>The Binge Eating Scale (BES) is a self-administered questionnaire that diagnoses Binge Eating Disorder (BED) and assesses the behavioural, emotional and cognitive symptoms associated with Binge Eating Disorder in obese individuals (Gormally et al. 1982). It is composed of 16 items corresponding to groups of sentences including one to be selected from 3 to 4 propositions, which best describe how one feels. For each item, the subject has to choose the formulation that best corresponds to his current situation, which results in a score varying between 0 and 3 or between 0 and 2 for each item. Half of the items measure eating behaviours and the other half assess feelings or cognitions occurring during compulsive episodes. It gives a total score (from 0 to 46) that reflects the severity of the BED. A score greater than or equal to 18 indicates significant bulimic hyperphagia. The French version of this questionnaire was translated and validated by Brunault et al (2016).</description>
