      Worldwide, physiotherapists treat patients with CAD in the acute stage following a coronary&#xD;
      event and/ or following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. These patients are then&#xD;
      later followed up as outpatients during cardiac rehabilitation(CR) in turn to improve&#xD;
      cardio-respiratory fitness and quality of life and to delay the incidence of subsequent&#xD;
      coronary events. Early mobilisation and physical activity is often the first choice of&#xD;
      treatment, but evidence as to the optimal intensity, timing and choice of exercises is&#xD;
      scarce. In 2018 the effect of obesity on functional capacity, anxiety and Daily life&#xD;
      activities in patients with coronary artery disease and phase II cardiac rehabilitation. The&#xD;
      results shows that When Group 1 patients were assessed at the end of 30 sessions of cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation (CR) program, a statistically significant improvement was detected in 6MWT,&#xD;
      physical functioning, physical role, mental health, social functioning and pain sub&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2019, study Changes in 6-minute walk test (6MWT) distance and heart rate walking speed&#xD;
      index following a cardiovascular prevention and rehabilitation programme .Patients increased&#xD;
      their 6-minute walk test distance by 40 meters and decreased their heart rate walking speed&#xD;
      index by 2.7, which translates into a saving of three heart beats for every 100 meters walked&#xD;
      or 45 heart beats for every mile walked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2012, conducted study Resistance and Balance Training Improves Functional Capacity in Very&#xD;
      Old Participants Attending Cardiac Rehabilitation Participants were assigned randomly in a&#xD;
      ratio of 1:1 to an intervention group (IG; inpatient CR plus resistance training and balance&#xD;
      training) or control group (CG;inpatient CR)after Coronary Bypass Surgery. The study&#xD;
      concluded that there is significantly greater improvement in functional capacity measured as&#xD;
      6-MWD,TUG time, and maximal relative workload in the IG than in the CG..&#xD;

    <measure>6 min walk test: Distance (meters)</measure>
    <time_frame>4th week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from the baseline, 6 min walk test was used to measure Functional capacity. It is a sub maximal exercise test which can aid in assessing functional capacity of patients with cardiopulmonary diseases, in this test we find out the maximum distance in meters which an individual covers in 6 min without any support.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Oxygen Saturation (SpO2)</measure>
    <time_frame>4th week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline SPO2 was measured in percentage. Oxygen immersion is the division of oxygen-soaked hemoglobin with respect to add up to hemoglobin in the blood. Pulse oximeter measure it.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pulse Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>4th week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline, Pulse rate was measured per minute through pulse oximeter</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion</measure>
    <time_frame>4th week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from the Baseline, It is a subjective numeric scale ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 indicates &quot;no dyspnea&quot; and 10 indicates &quot;unbearable dyspnea.&quot; A number is chosen by the patient in order to decide the best score that matches his level of dyspnea during physical activity.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Systolic and diastolic blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>4th week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from the Baseline, Blood pressure is measured through sphygmomanometer</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>WHO_BREF questioner (Quality of life)</measure>
    <time_frame>4th week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes for the baseline, The World Health Organization (WHO) Quality of Life Group Developed a self-report 26 item questionnaire called the WHO Quality of Life Instrument, Short Form (WHOQOLBREF).the questioner is intend to assess the four aspect of quality of life physical (seven questions), psychological (six questions), social (three questions), and environmental (eight questions) dimensions.There are no cut-off points above or below which quality of life could be evaluated as &quot;poor&quot; or &quot;good&quot;. Thus, it was decided to rationalize the analysis by defining two groups at the extremes, both in perception of QoL and satisfaction with health (good QoL /satisfied - includes those who reported having good or very good QoL and were satisfied or very satisfied with their health; and poor QoL /dissatisfied - includes those who reported poor or very poor QoL and who were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with their health).</description>
