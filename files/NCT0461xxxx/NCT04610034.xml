  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to develop and test the effectiveness of a resilience-based&#xD;
      intervention for distressed partner caregivers of cancer patients in reducing symptoms of&#xD;
      anxiety, depression and distress, while improving quality of life and resilience&#xD;
      (meta-reflective skill, values clarification and coping strategies).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Informal caregivers of cancer patients often experience significant psychological distress,&#xD;
      which may even exceed that of the patient's. Partners or spouses are typically the most&#xD;
      important caregiver and emotional support person for the cancer patient, but there is a lack&#xD;
      of psychological interventions that specifically target caregiving partners. &quot;Resilient&#xD;
      Caregivers&quot; is a novel 7-session group-based program aimed specifically at improving the&#xD;
      participant's ability to cope with the stresses of being a partner to a cancer patient. In&#xD;
      this randomized trial, the investigators aim to assess the potential efficacy of this program&#xD;
      in improving the caregiver's resilience and quality of life, as well as reducing symptoms of&#xD;
      anxiety, depression and distress. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at 3, 6 and&#xD;
      12-months follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>&quot;Resilient Caregivers&quot; is a 7-session group program developed for partner caregivers of patients with cancer (6 weekly sessions and 1 booster session). Each session takes place in groups of approximately 8 participants and lasts for two-and-a-half hours. Sessions 1 to 3 focuses on the caregiver and introduces the resilience components of coping strategies, meta-reflective skill and clarification of values. Sessions 4 and 5 focuses on these components in the relationship between the caregiver and the cancer patient and social support networks respectively, while Session 6 focuses on resilience in relation to self-care and care for the partner. A booster session will be scheduled one month after the end of Session 6 in order to follow-up on the intervention and allow participants to reflect on the benefits and challenges of the program.</description>
