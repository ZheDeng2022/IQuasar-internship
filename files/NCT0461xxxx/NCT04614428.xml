  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite a range of evidence-based programs to identify high-risk patients and apply&#xD;
      strategies to keep them out of hospital, a growing number of cases are &quot;resistant&quot; to such&#xD;
      programs. These &quot;seasonal frequent flyers&quot; routinely overwhelm hospital services. The&#xD;
      investigators have identified vulnerability to provocation of seasonal and acute weather&#xD;
      changes (&quot;seasonality&quot;) as a major driver of preventable/costly hospitalisations in typically&#xD;
      older patients with heart disease and multimorbidity subject to gold-standard care. From this&#xD;
      research the investigators developed the RESILIENCE Program which is tailored to each person&#xD;
      and designed to assist the participants to become more &quot;resilient&quot; to changes in the weather.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of the RESILIENCE Trial is to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of an&#xD;
      individually tailored, interventional health care program designed to address the&#xD;
      debilitating, costly and deadly phenomenon of seasonal vulnerability in a growing number of&#xD;
      individuals admitted to hospital with chronic heart disease and multimorbidity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After informed written consent, 300 participants will have comprehensive sociodemographic and&#xD;
      clinical profiling to establish extent of multi-morbidity. Demographic, lifestyle and medical&#xD;
      history questionnaires will be completed, anthropometric measurements and blood pressure will&#xD;
      be taken, handgrip strength test and sit-stand test will be conducted. The Montreal Cognitive&#xD;
      Assessment, depression, anxiety and quality of life questionnaires will be conducted. Blood&#xD;
      biochemistry will be assessed for vitamin D, blood counts, thyroid and renal function,&#xD;
      hemoglobin and glycated hemoglobin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial profiling participants will be randomized to standard care or the&#xD;
      RESILIENCE Program group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the standard care participants would normally receive, the 150 participants&#xD;
      assigned to the RESILIENCE Program group will receive a structured follow-up over the next 12&#xD;
      months to monitor and adjust the participant's status and management from a seasonal&#xD;
      perspective. These will include a combination of strategies designed to promote seasonal&#xD;
      resilience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, this will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Profiling of the participants seasonal vulnerability: prior to hospital discharge,&#xD;
           participants will be clinically profiled and then fitted with an physiological monitor&#xD;
           (to measure heart rate, physical activity levels) at the point of hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Within 7-14 days after discharge a 60-80-minute home visit will be conducted by a&#xD;
           dedicated RESILIENCE Nurse to assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physiological Status: The physiological monitor will be collected for analysis at&#xD;
                this visit and blood pressure will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Environment: A formal home environment assessment including presence/type of&#xD;
                heating and/or cooling equipment, air quality and any other factors that might&#xD;
                contribute to seasonal instability (e.g. lack of home insulation). Indoor versus&#xD;
                outdoor temperature and humidity will also be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Behaviour: Participants will be asked to describe the adaptive changes they make to&#xD;
                activity levels, diet, clothing and heating/cooling behaviours during winter versus&#xD;
                summer and acute weather events; with an immediate assessment relevant to ambient&#xD;
                weather conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Modulating Factors: The (socio-economic) capacity for the participant/family to&#xD;
                apply resources/funds to maintain thermoregulatory control (including clothing&#xD;
                choices and ability to pay power bills) throughout the year will be assessed;&#xD;
                alongside those personal factors/decisions that potentially determine how they&#xD;
                prioritize other forms of expenditure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participants with the capacity and/or preference for videoconferencing will be offered&#xD;
           &quot;virtual/remote&quot; attendance or a standard outpatient clinic appointment at the Austin&#xD;
           Hospital RESILIENCE Clinic with a dedicated RESILIENCE physician to develop a long-term&#xD;
           plan to help promote/maintain seasonal resilience. The clinic appointments will occur&#xD;
           with the individual at 21 days, 6 months and 12 months post hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 12 months, the comprehensive socio-demographic and clinical profiling will be repeated in&#xD;
      the RESILIENCE Program group.&#xD;
