  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the study is to investigate the effects of five weeks of heat-suit&#xD;
      training on training-associated changes in hemoglobin mass, skeletal muscle characteristics&#xD;
      and endurance exercise performance in elite cyclists&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endurance exercise performance depends on a range of determinants, including hemoglobin mass&#xD;
      in blood and content of respiratory mitochondria in skeletal muscle. Low-intensity training&#xD;
      (LIT) with heat exposure may be beneficial for development of these variables. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to investigate the effects of five weeks of LIT-training with heat suit (five&#xD;
      times a week; 50 min per session) on hemoglobin mass and other blood characteristics in elite&#xD;
      cyclists (males and females) compared to a non-heat-suit training control group, including&#xD;
      subsequent investigation of the retrograde effects of ~one month of training without heat&#xD;
      suit. The study will also investigate the effects of heat-suit training on endurance exercise&#xD;
      performance/performance determinants and other muscle biological charateristics, and will&#xD;
      investigate the basic characteristics of mitochondrial function and abundances in these&#xD;
      highly trained athletes. Training sessions with heat suit (or lack thereof) will complement&#xD;
      the habitual training routines of the participants.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study will be conducted as a five-week intervention. In the heat-suit arm, participants will conduct a 50-minute low-intensity cycling session with heat suit five time a week. In the none-heat-suit arm, participants will conduct similar amounts of low-intensity cycling without heat suit. These training sessions will complement the habitual training of the participants. Participants will be allocated into the two arms in a planned randomized manner. In short, participants will be stratified based on baseline performance levels (VO2max), whereby they will be allocated into the two intervention arms in a manner that ensures similar average performance levels between the two arms.</intervention_model_description>
