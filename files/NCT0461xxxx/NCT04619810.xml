  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction. Lung cancer is very common worldwide with 2.09 million cases in 2018.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy has become a mainstay in cancer treatment. There is insuficient knowledge about&#xD;
      the impact of altered needs, as well as the interventions developed by the nurse that are&#xD;
      aimed at cancer patients in immunotherapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives. Describe the needs of non-microcytic lung cancer patients in immunotherapy. And,&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of a nurse intervention program aimed at these patients in&#xD;
      decreasing comorbidities, increasing satisfaction, early detection of symptoms and management&#xD;
      of toxicities, quality of life and monitoring of anthropometric indicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology. Phase 1: descriptive, cross-cutting and prospective study. Phase 2:&#xD;
      quasi-experimental pre-post study. The sample is patients of the Hospital de la Santa Creu i&#xD;
      Sant Pau, with non-microcytic lung cancer in treatment with Checkpoints inhibitor antibodies.&#xD;
      The dependent variables: sociodemographic variables, clinical variables, satisfaction,&#xD;
      quality of life, nutritional status, psychological impact, toxicities, number of unscheduled&#xD;
      visits and health costs. Independent variable: nurse intervention program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications for practice: Knowing the needs of patients in immunotherapy treatment will&#xD;
      allow the development of a nurse care program to meet these needs and evaluate the program.&#xD;
