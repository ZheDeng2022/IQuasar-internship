  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical students are at high risk of stress. This project will test how well a 12-week stress&#xD;
      reduction program works to reduce stress, anxiety and depression and improve well-being. The&#xD;
      program is delivered online and each week is made of an introduction video, 7-8 minutes of&#xD;
      yoga, 5-7 minutes of meditation and nutrition tips. At the beginning and the end of the&#xD;
      12-week research study, we will be using surveys to ask students about their stress, anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, sense of control over their own life, quality of life, and pain levels. After the&#xD;
      program, the research team will conduct interviews with the medical student to allow them to&#xD;
      share their other feedback about the program. The researchers will also send surveys to the&#xD;
      medical students one month after the program ends to asses their continued satisfaction with&#xD;
      and adherence to the program.&#xD;
