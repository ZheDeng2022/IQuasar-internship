  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck cancers (HNC) often receive radiotherapy as part of their treatment. However,&#xD;
      unacceptable failure rates and severe side effects remain a challenge. The improvements in&#xD;
      radiotherapy are closely related to improvements in medical imaging. Functional imaging,&#xD;
      where intratumoural characteristics such as tumour oxygenation, metabolism, and blood vessel&#xD;
      function can be quantified, offers possibilities to personalize the radiotherapy. In this&#xD;
      study we will establish the clinical workflow for PET- and MRI-based radiotherapy in HNC by&#xD;
      acquiring images prior to and during radiotherapy to develop new concepts for image-based&#xD;
      biologically adaptive radiotherapy, both based on photon-based radiotherapy and also proton&#xD;
      therapy, which soon will be available for cancer patients in Norway. The investigators aim to&#xD;
      contribute towards further developments of personalised high-precision radiotherapy for HNC&#xD;
      patients resulting in improved outcome, reduced side-effects and better quality of life.&#xD;

        Study population 1 consists of all patients who are referred to the &quot;fast track&quot; clinical&#xD;
        pathway for HNC at St. Olavs hospital, approximately 130 patients per year for three years.&#xD;
        Out of these, 60 patients are defined as study population 2, due to locally advanced head&#xD;
        and neck cancer (HNC) of squamous cell histology scheduled for definitive&#xD;
        (chemo)radiotherapy with curative intent.&#xD;

             II-III) were PET/CT is negative outside the head-neck region can be considered for&#xD;
             inclusion at the discretion of the study investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

          -  general contraindications for MRI (pacemaker, aneurysm clips, any form of metal in the&#xD;
             body, severe claustrophobia)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  serious comorbidity (including previous or othe cancer) that in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator would compromise the patient's ability to complete the study of interfere&#xD;
             with the evaluation of the study objectives (e.g. poorly controlled diabetes mellitus)&#xD;
