  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric cardiac arrest (PCA) has a high mortality and morbidity. Its management is complex&#xD;
      and often deviates from guideline recommendations leading to patients' worse clinical&#xD;
      outcomes. A new tablet app, named PediAppRREST has been developed by our research group to&#xD;
      support the management of PCA. The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of the&#xD;
      PediAppRREST app on the management of a PCA simulated scenario. The investigators have&#xD;
      planned to conduct a multicenter, simulation-based, randomized control trial assessing the&#xD;
      number of deviations (errors and delays) from international recommendations in PCA&#xD;
      management. The hypothesis is that teams who use the PediAppRREST app as a cognitive aid will&#xD;
      show fewer deviations from guidelines than teams who use a static paper-based cognitive aid&#xD;
      (American Heart Association Pediatric Advanced Life Support pocket reference card) or no&#xD;
      cognitive aid, during the management of a simulated PCA scenario.&#xD;

      AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a new tablet app, named&#xD;
      PediAppRREST, in reducing deviations from guideline recommendations during pediatric cardiac&#xD;
      arrest management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim is to assess the impact of the use of the app on performance and time to&#xD;
      accomplish critical interventions for resuscitation, team leader's workload, cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      resuscitation quality metrics and overall resuscitation team performance. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      study will have the purpose to evaluate the usability of the app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be residents in Pediatrics, Emergency Medicine, and&#xD;
      Anesthesiology-Intensive Care programs at four Italian University Hospitals (Padova, Firenze,&#xD;
      Novara, and Roma). In order to be included in the study, residents must be BLS (Basic Life&#xD;
      Support) or P-BLS (Pediatric-Basic Life Support) or PALS (Pediatric Advanced Life Support) or&#xD;
      ALS (Advanced Life Support) or ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support) certified, following the&#xD;
      American Heart Association (AHA) or the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) recommendations.&#xD;
      Additionally, to be eligible for the role of team leader residents must be PALS-certified&#xD;
      according to AHA or ERC guidelines. Those residents who are unable to attend the simulation&#xD;
      sessions because of maternity/paternity leave, personal/sick leave or training abroad, or who&#xD;
      have participated in previous studies using the PediAppRREST app will not be eligible to&#xD;
      participate in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a multicenter, randomized controlled, three-parallel arm study, conducted in the&#xD;
      setting of simulation. All teams, each consisting of three participants, will manage the same&#xD;
      scenario of non-shockable pediatric cardiac arrest with the help of one confederate nurse who&#xD;
      will act according to a script. Participants will be randomized to teams, and teams to&#xD;
      interventions, using a 1:1:1 ratio. According to the allocation into one of three study arms,&#xD;
      teams will use, or not use, a different PALS-related cognitive aid during the management of&#xD;
      the scenario: 1) an intervention group using the tablet app PediAppRREST; or 2) a control&#xD;
      group (CtrlPALS+) using the AHA-PALS pocket reference card; or 3) a control group (CtrlPALS-)&#xD;
      not allowed to use any cognitive aid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the simulation scenarios will be video recorded, and two independent, previously trained&#xD;
      reviewers will report actions performed by the teams and time to accomplish them. Outcomes&#xD;
      will be subsequently assessed by two independent outcome assessors using data extracted by&#xD;
      video reviewers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the study will be the number of deviations from AHA PALS guidelines&#xD;
      recommendations during the management of pediatric cardiac arrest, defined as delays and&#xD;
      errors according to a novel checklist, named c-DEV15plus, based on previously published&#xD;
      guidelines, checklists and scoring systems/evaluation tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes will be the performance of critical actions for resuscitation and the&#xD;
      time to perform them, the usability of the app (measured by open-ended questions and one&#xD;
      validated questionnaire: the System Usability Scale), the team leaders' workload (measured by&#xD;
      the validated NASA-Task Load Index), the quality metrics of cardiopulmonary resuscitation&#xD;
      (extracted by the manikin's software SkillReporter, Laerdal™) according to AHA guidelines,&#xD;
      and the overall team resuscitation performance (measured by the validated Clinical&#xD;
      Performance Tool).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators calculated the sample size on the basis of the results obtained during two&#xD;
      previous studies: one observational simulation-based study and one pilot study conducted to&#xD;
      test the app usability. Based on the preliminary results from these studies, using a single&#xD;
      factor ANOVA model, 29 scenarios per each of the three groups (PediAppRREST, CtrlPALS+,&#xD;
      CtrlPALS-) are necessary to detect a difference of at least 3.00 points on the c-DEV15plus&#xD;
      scale using the Tukey-Kramer (Pairwise) multiple comparison procedure at a 5% significance&#xD;
      level and 80% power. In consideration that some possible technical problems with&#xD;
      video-recording or other study procedures could occur, the investigators aim to increase the&#xD;
      recruitment of participating teams by 20% per arm, to compensate for loss of statistical&#xD;
      power due to a potential insufficient sample size. Hence, the investigators plan to have 35&#xD;
      scenarios per arm, for a total of 105 scenarios, which will include overall 315 residents who&#xD;
      will be divided in teams of three.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The c-DEV15plus scale, the performance and time to accomplish specific resuscitation&#xD;
      interventions, workload, overall team performance and cardiopulmonary resuscitation metrics&#xD;
      will be compared between groups with one-way ANOVA model, followed by the Tukey-Kramer&#xD;
      multiple comparisons adjustment procedure in case of statistical significance. The outcomes&#xD;
      will also be analyzed with a linear mixed model considering the team as a cluster to evaluate&#xD;
      the influence of participants' characteristics on the outcome. To take into account the&#xD;
      correlation of the observations within a team, the investigators will specify an undetermined&#xD;
      correlation matrix. In case of a not normal distribution of the model residuals, the&#xD;
      investigators will proceed with a transformation in order to normalize the distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONFIDENTIALITY AND PRIVACY PROTECTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      A written informed consent to take part into the study will be obtained from each&#xD;
      participant. To ensure that the data collected remains confidential, all data and videos will&#xD;
      be stored on password protected and secured hard-disk drives, that will be stored in locked&#xD;
      filing cabinets located at the Department of Women's and Children's health, University of&#xD;
      Padova, Italy.&#xD;

    <measure>Deviations from American Heart Association Pediatric Advanced Life Support (AHA-PALS) guidelines</measure>
    <time_frame>Scenario will be video recorded and evaluated by two independent video reviewers. Outcome assessors will score teams' performance by means of the c-DEV15plus score using data extracted by video reviewers through study completion, an average of 15 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Deviations from AHA-PALS guidelines recommendations are defined as delays and errors according to a novel checklist we derived from a previously published checklist, denominated c-DEV (circulation-deviations), published by Wolfe et al. (2020), by integrating it with evidence-based guidelines, previously reported scoring tools and checklists. We named our new modified checklist c-DEV15plus (circulation-deviations 15 plus). It includes 15 items, which represent correct critical actions for pediatric resuscitation. Each item of the c-DEV15plus is scored either as 0, when the action is performed correctly and timely, as described in the item, or as 1, when the action is not undertaken, undertaken incorrectly, or with wrong timing. The sum of the points attributed to the items represents the c-DEV15plus total score, hence ranging from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 15, with higher scores corresponding to a higher number of deviations from the guidelines and a worse performance.</description>
