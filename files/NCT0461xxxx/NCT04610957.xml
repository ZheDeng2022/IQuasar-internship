    <textblock>
      This prospective, randomized clinical trial double blinded study, has been carried on 160&#xD;
      infertile patients seeking pregnancy in Gynecology and Obstetrics Department, Zagazig&#xD;
      University Hospitals during the period from January 2019 to November 2019, the participants'&#xD;
      randomizations were done and patients divided into two groups; group I: included 80 women&#xD;
      receiving Clomiphene citrate (CC) plus Isoflavonoids. Group 2: included 80 women receiving&#xD;
      Clomiphene citrate only&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phytoestrogens continue to be of increasing interest because of their possible influence on&#xD;
      the physiology of the reproductive tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of Prospective randomized clinical trial study is to evaluate effect of adding&#xD;
      isoflavonoids to clomiphene citrate during ovulation induction in women with PCOS on the&#xD;
      endometrial thickness which has an impact on pregnancy rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study included 160 infertile women seeking pregnancy and they were divided into two&#xD;
      groups. Clomiphene is given orally at dose, one tablet twice per day (tablet 50 mg), from day&#xD;
      3 to day 7 for all patients (group I and group II),while phytoestrogens are given at dose,&#xD;
      two tablets two times per day (tablet 800mg), from day 3 to day 12 only for group I, followed&#xD;
      by HCG injection on attaining mature follicle(s) by trans-vaginal US scan with diameter ≥ 18&#xD;
      mm.&#xD;
