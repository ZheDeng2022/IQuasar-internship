  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In-utero exposure to drugs and chemicals through maternal smoking, alcohol use, drug abuse,&#xD;
      prescription medicines and occupational/lifestyle exposures is widespread. Such exposures can&#xD;
      alter fetal development and programming, leading to the effects becoming &quot;locked in&quot; from&#xD;
      birth and causing long-term adverse consequences for the individual. These include costly and&#xD;
      widespread conditions such as obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome and infertility. The&#xD;
      weight of evidence linking these conditions to fetal recreational drug or environmental&#xD;
      chemical exposures, including cigarettes, alcohol, air pollution, food contact materials, is&#xD;
      overwhelming. What is lacking is an understanding of how fetal drug exposure translates to&#xD;
      adult ill-health and this is due, largely, to an inability to study the problem directly in&#xD;
      affected human fetuses. The investigators, and others, have shown that human fetal&#xD;
      development, which lays the foundations of adult health and function (fetal programming), is&#xD;
      quite different from the rodent and frequently exhibits surprising aspects. It has become&#xD;
      evident that the close interconnectivity of the developing fetal organs and also the&#xD;
      placenta, means that a much more holistic approach to research aiming to understand human&#xD;
      fetal development and the challenges posed to programming for a health adulthood is critical.&#xD;
      To that end the investigators have established a carefully considered gestational age range&#xD;
      (7-20 weeks of gestation) of fetuses we can study together with multiple fetal organs and&#xD;
      body fluids collected and maternal information recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching objective of the study is to intensively and systematically study the human&#xD;
      fetus during a normal pregnancy and pregnancies where aspects of maternal lifestyle and&#xD;
      environment will challenge the fetus. The investigators aim to provide fundamental&#xD;
      information to better understand the mechanisms involved and to detect and treat or&#xD;
      ameliorate adverse effects during pregnancy (such as maternal smoking/drinking, deprivation,&#xD;
      exposure to pollution). In the long term findings from this research will be important for&#xD;
      future studies aimed at enabling better health in later life.&#xD;

      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To provide fundamental information to better understand the mechanisms involved and to detect&#xD;
      and treat or ameliorate adverse effects during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are aimed at better understanding of normal processes&#xD;
      during development and how maternal lifestyle and environment can affect it. The&#xD;
      investigators' research will involve a wide range of laboratory, cell and tissue culture and&#xD;
      xenografting as well as microscopic techniques to study chemicals, hormones, proteins, genes&#xD;
      and DNA in the fetal tissues. The investigators have developed sophisticated approaches to&#xD;
      minimise how much tissue is required to carry out as many different measurements as possible&#xD;
      in the same sample. It should be noted that the proposed studies are collaborative with&#xD;
      different research groups since no single research group could carry out all the studies in&#xD;
      isolation. Furthermore, the proposed studies will inform back to animal and cell studies,&#xD;
      enabling more accurate interpretation of their own findings in light of mechanisms and&#xD;
      specific conditions actually at play in the human fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Human fetal endocrine system&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators aim to investigate how the different hormone systems in the fetus&#xD;
           develop and are affected by adverse maternal factors such as cigarette smoking and&#xD;
           obesity. These include the testis, ovary, adrenal gland, thyroid gland, kidney and the&#xD;
           hypothalamus, pineal gland and pituitary gland in the brain. In addition, the&#xD;
           investigators also aim to study the placenta, including its endocrine function, and how&#xD;
           it is affected by maternal environment, since it is a key organ of pregnancy. Changes in&#xD;
           programming that establishes the endocrine system can have lifelong consequences for&#xD;
           health and wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Human fetal reproductive and urogenital system&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators aim to investigate how the ovary, testis, urogenital tract (including&#xD;
           prostate gland, breast buds and uterus), genitalia and kidney develop in the human&#xD;
           fetus. There is considerable evidence that maternal smoking and over the counter&#xD;
           medicine use can have negative impacts on this system and we will investigate when such&#xD;
           impacts begin and what mechanisms are involved. In addition, common cancers, such as&#xD;
           testis cancer, may have fetal origins and certainly events in fetal life may predispose&#xD;
           the resulting adult to develop cancers. In the case of testis, ovary, breast buds and&#xD;
           prostate gland, an additional aim is to determine whether and how events between 7 and&#xD;
           20 weeks of gestation increase the likelihood of cancers in these organs in adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Mechanistic studies, Epilepsy and other brain disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators aim to investigate development of the fetal central nervous system,&#xD;
           including the brain. The first study planned is to investigate changes in genes and the&#xD;
           structure of DNA in the brain related to epilepsy and other neurodevelopmental disorders&#xD;
           linked with maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy. A second aim is to use the&#xD;
           smoke-exposed fetuses to better understand the role vitamin A plays in normal fetal&#xD;
           development, including development of the central nervous system. Similar concerns are&#xD;
           expressed in the literature with respect to maternal alcohol consumption and by&#xD;
           accessing data from the Fast Alcohol Screening Test alcohol questionnaire that is&#xD;
           already collected at clinic, the investigators will be able to address this issue&#xD;
           systematically with respect to all the studies, including fetal brain development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Metabolism and liver disease&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators aim to continue their studies (funded by the Medical Research Council)&#xD;
           of the human fetal liver and other organs important for metabolism, including pancreas&#xD;
           and fat cells and cells that will become fat cells (precursor cells). Programming of&#xD;
           metabolism during life in the womb is important for adult health and better&#xD;
           understanding of the development of the metabolic systems and how they are perturbed by&#xD;
           factors such as maternal smoking and deprivation is an important basis of developing&#xD;
           strategies for wellbeing post-natally. A critical disease of growing importance in these&#xD;
           studies is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is increasing in incidence,&#xD;
           especially in obese individuals. Given that the human fetal liver is active and&#xD;
           responding to maternal environment, some of the basis of this disease may be established&#xD;
           in fetal life. In addition, the development of thyroid and adrenal glands is also&#xD;
           essential in establishing normal metabolic processes. Cutting edge techniques, such as&#xD;
           large-scale metabolomic and lipidomic studies, including analysis of a wide range of&#xD;
           dietary metabolites, will also be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Heart and cardiovascular system&#xD;
&#xD;
           The development of the heart and the major artery, the aorta, between 7 and 20 weeks of&#xD;
           gestation will be characterised. The effects of adverse in-utero environment of the&#xD;
           developmental processes will then be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Immune system development&#xD;
&#xD;
           The thymus is critical and large organ in fetal development that is important to&#xD;
           establish the immune system. The spleen manufactures antibodies and, in fetal life, red&#xD;
           blood cells (as does the fetal liver) and recycles red blood cells. Both organs have&#xD;
           important role in maintaining the immune system. The investigators aim to investigate&#xD;
           whether adverse maternal lifestyle and/or environment can alter thymus and spleen&#xD;
           development and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Bone, cartilage and joints&#xD;
&#xD;
           Very little is known about normal bone and cartilage development in the human fetus.&#xD;
           Importantly, it is not even know when the cells involved in bone, cartilage and joint&#xD;
           development begin to alter their behaviour into a more &quot;adult&quot; format. The reason this&#xD;
           is important is that in musculoskeletal disease in the elderly, especially&#xD;
           osteoarthritis, early stages of disease is usually characterised by renewed tissue&#xD;
           growth - i.e. a return to a more &quot;fetal&quot; pattern of cell behaviour. The role of cell&#xD;
           programming during fetal life and better understanding of the correct development and&#xD;
           maintenance of bone, cartilage and joints, and how programming is affected by the fetal&#xD;
           environment, is therefore one of the investigators' aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The development of the placenta between 7 and 20 weeks of gestation&#xD;
&#xD;
           A great deal is known about the term placenta because it is so easy to obtain and to&#xD;
           relate directly to the accompanying new-born and its parents. However, the placenta is a&#xD;
           dynamically developing organ that is vital for normal pregnancy and that is affected by&#xD;
           maternal lifestyle (e.g. placental growth is reduced if the mother continues to smoke&#xD;
           while pregnant). The investigators aim therefore to better understand how the placenta&#xD;
           develops during this window in gestation and how it is affected by maternal environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Nerve repair&#xD;
&#xD;
           Spinal cord injury is a massive health problem globally. Recently it has been shown that&#xD;
           human fetal central nervous system cells or embryonic nerve stem cells have the&#xD;
           potential to assist in novel treatment strategies to repair spinal cord injury. This&#xD;
           final secondary objective is focussed on a proof of concept study to determine whether&#xD;
           culturing severed nerves in the presence of human fetal nerve cells assists in correct&#xD;
           and functional nerve regrowth and re-joining across the induced gap. Any further&#xD;
           studies, if the proof of concept aim is realised in a satisfactory manner would require&#xD;
           a separate ethic application.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Maternal emotional health and wellbeing effects on the fetus&#xD;
&#xD;
           Maternal stress is a well-known negative influence on fetal development. The&#xD;
           investigators' aim is to perform a pilot study relating indices of fetal development,&#xD;
           such as morphology, endocrine status, to maternal records of emotional health and&#xD;
           wellbeing and abuse. The principal outcome will be an indication as to whether maternal&#xD;
           stress is affecting fetal development at a general level between 7 and 20 weeks of&#xD;
           gestation. Placental biomarkers identified in other studies listed above will also be&#xD;
           related to measures of maternal stress in order to establish whether there may be&#xD;
           placental biomarkers of early fetal response to maternal stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Fetal lung&#xD;
&#xD;
           While it is well known that the adverse effects of maternal smoking include increased&#xD;
           incidences of respiratory problems, such as asthma. However, there are also data&#xD;
           suggesting that the offspring exposed to cigarette smoke may be more likely to develop&#xD;
           lung cancer. The investigators' aim is to determine whether maternal smoking disturbs&#xD;
           fetal lung development early in pregnancy and if this includes signs of increased&#xD;
           likelihood of cancer development, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-DNA adducts in&#xD;
           the fetal lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Quantifying human fetal exposure to pollutants, drugs, pharmaceuticals and other&#xD;
           chemicals&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is simple to measure chemicals in the blood or urine of the mother, or in amniotic&#xD;
           fluid collected during amniocentesis. However, amniocentesis is not performed for&#xD;
           research purposes because of not inconsiderable risk to the fetus. This means reliance&#xD;
           on animal studies of such chemicals getting to the fetus but this is rather inadequate&#xD;
           due to major species differences. Therefore the investigators aim to measure chemicals&#xD;
           and drugs of potential health concern (such as bisphenol A which is in plastics and over&#xD;
           the counter drugs taken by mothers which may affect the fetus, such as paracetamol) in&#xD;
           the fetal tissues, including blood and urine where available. This is the only way to&#xD;
           accurately assess how much of these compounds actually get into the fetus itself. This&#xD;
           is important since the fetus is considered much more vulnerable than the adult to toxic&#xD;
           chemicals. In addition, the investigators aim to also measure these compounds in the&#xD;
           placentas (and cord blood where available) from the same fetuses. Because the placenta&#xD;
           is readily available at term, placental biomarkers of fetal exposure to adverse&#xD;
           compounds (e.g. alcohol) that are detected in the second trimester fetal liver will be&#xD;
           investigated in the term placenta.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Non-genetic programming of the fetus for adult life&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epigenetic changes are changes that involve marks being put onto DNA that affects how genes&#xD;
      are activated. Therefore, an epigenetic change can change, sometimes greatly, the link&#xD;
      between the amount of a gene present in cell and its effect. This linkage can be quite large&#xD;
      with a gene being practically silenced in terms of its effect, even though there may be&#xD;
      plenty of the gene present in the cell. Conditions within the womb, such a maternal smoking,&#xD;
      can have epigenetic effects. The investigators aim therefore to better understand how the&#xD;
      environment experience by the fetus can affect development and programming of adult health&#xD;
      and disease by epigenetic mechanisms.&#xD;
