    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effects of trastuzumab deruxtecan in treating patients with&#xD;
      HER2 positive osteosarcoma that is newly diagnosed or has come back (recurrent). Trastuzumab&#xD;
      deruxtecan is a monoclonal antibody, called trastuzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug called&#xD;
      deruxtecan. Trastuzumab attaches to HER2 positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers&#xD;
      deruxtecan to kill them.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the proportion of patients with recurrent measurable osteosarcoma treated with&#xD;
      trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a) who are event free (%EF) at 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety of DS-8201a in patients with recurrent osteosarcoma. II. To describe&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics of DS-8201a in patients with recurrent osteosarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate the objective response rate (ORR), event free survival (EFS), overall&#xD;
      survival (OS) and duration of response (DOR) of patients with recurrent, measurable&#xD;
      osteosarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the relationship between potential biomarkers and response to DS-8201a.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate quantitative circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) and&#xD;
      circulating tumor cells (CTCs) as a surrogate markers of response in recurrent osteosarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive trastuzumab deruxtecan intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 35 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have had histologic verification of osteosarcoma at original diagnosis&#xD;
             or relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with diagnoses of osteosarcoma and confirmed HER2 expression of &gt; 10% of&#xD;
                  osteosarcoma cells are eligible for the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Note: There is a mandatory tissue submission for HER2 staining during the&#xD;
                       Step 0 Eligibility Screening process. Metastatic tissue, when possible from&#xD;
                       the most recent relapse, is strongly preferred for HER2 staining over&#xD;
                       archival tissue from primary resection or diagnostic biopsy. The evaluation&#xD;
                       period for HER2 staining to determine eligibility for therapy will be less&#xD;
                       than 4 weeks from screening enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
             Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. Patients with clinically inactive brain metastases may be&#xD;

             symptomatic and who require no treatment with corticosteroids or anticonvulsants may&#xD;

             radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient's current disease state must be one for which they have received at least&#xD;
             standard initial therapy, defined as systemic therapy combined with either radiation&#xD;

             relapse is not required&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a performance status corresponding to Eastern Cooperative Oncology&#xD;
             Group (ECOG) scores of 0 or 1. Use Karnofsky for patients &gt; 16 years of age and Lansky&#xD;

                  conjugates (e.g. TDM-1 or DS-8201a), HER2 directed cellular therapies, HER2&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Non-child-bearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal&#xD;
             ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous&#xD;

             is confirmatory). Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal&#xD;
             status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods outlined&#xD;
             for women of child-bearing potential if they wish to continue their HRT during the&#xD;
             study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal&#xD;
