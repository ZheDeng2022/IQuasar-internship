      The purpose of this research study is to see if the amount of vitamin D in ones blood makes&#xD;
      it more or less likely to develop thyroid gland toxicity when being treated with&#xD;
      immunotherapy that blocks the activity of proteins called programed death-1(PD-1) or&#xD;
      programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1). Immunotherapy is treatment that makes changes to the&#xD;
      immune system to try to fight cancer. Immunotherapy treatments that block the activity of&#xD;
      important parts of the immune system called PD-1 and PD-L1 are used to standardly treat many&#xD;
      different types of cancer and can cause thyroid toxicity in certain people. In this study the&#xD;
      treatment for your cancer is not research treatment but standard of care determined by your&#xD;
      oncologist. Blood will be drawn before starting treatment to determine the amount of Vitamin&#xD;
      D and also to assess thyroid function. Also questionnaires will be completed before starting&#xD;
      treatment and while on treatment to assess symptoms you are experiencing.&#xD;

      Until 2011 no therapy with proven overall survival benefit was Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) approved for the treatment of stage IV (disseminated) melanoma. In 2011 ipilimumab, an&#xD;
      inhibitor of CTLA-4, was FDA approved for the treatment of stage IV melanoma representing the&#xD;
      first immunotherapy to confer an increase in overall survival. CTLA-4 is expressed on the&#xD;
      surface of activated T cells and binds to B7 on antigen-presenting cells with higher affinity&#xD;
      than the co-stimulatory protein CD28. By competing for and disrupting the binding of CD28 to&#xD;
      B7, CTLA-4 prevents T-cell co-stimulation which leads to a dampening of the immune response.&#xD;
      Ipilimumab is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds CTLA-4 in an inhibitory manner. Treating&#xD;
      stage IV melanoma with ipilimumab confers an overall survival benefit when compared in&#xD;
      randomized fashion to peptide vaccine treatment, with median survival increasing from 6 to 10&#xD;
      months and 2-year survival increasing from 14% to 24%. Benefit is durable as the overall&#xD;
      survival rate plateauing at 21% by year 3 with follow-up extending up to 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The regulation of immune T-cell activity is complex involving multiple activating and&#xD;
      inhibitory protein interactions with antigen presenting cells. T-cells express the protein&#xD;
      programmed death-1 (PD-1) which when bound to its ligand PD-L1 normally expressed on&#xD;
      peripheral tissues inhibits T-cell activity. Many melanomas select for aberrant expression of&#xD;
      PD-L1. When T-cells infiltrate the melanoma metastasis tumor microenvironment the PD-1 on the&#xD;
      infiltrating T-cells binds the tumor expressed PD-L1 leading to inhibition of T-cell&#xD;
      activity. Blocking the interaction of PD-1 to PD-L1 in stage IV melanoma leads to clinical&#xD;
      efficacy. Two inhibitors of PD-1, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, were FDA approved in 2014 for&#xD;
      the treatment stage IV melanoma with response rates approximating 40% and 5-year survival&#xD;
      post-nivolumab treatment of 35%. In 2015 concurrent treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab&#xD;
      was FDA-approved on the basis of a 57.6% response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ipilimumab is infused intravenously as a single agent every 3 weeks for a total of four&#xD;
      treatments. Nivolumab is administered intravenously every two weeks at dose of 240 mg or&#xD;
      every four weeks at a dose of 480 mg while pembrolizumab is infused every three weeks at dose&#xD;
      of 200 mg or every 6 weeks at 400 mg per dose. With concurrent ipilimumab and nivolumab&#xD;
      treatment the combination is administered every three weeks for 4 doses and then nivolumab is&#xD;
      infused as a single agent every two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inhibition of immune cell activity in the tumor microenvironment through the selection of&#xD;
      PD-L1 expression on tumor cells is not specific to melanoma. Clinical efficacy has been&#xD;
      appreciated in a range of malignancies leading to multiple FDA approvals for stage IV&#xD;
      disease. Specifically pembrolizumab is also FDA approved for treatment of stage IV non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer and recurrent or metastatic HNSCC. Nivolumab is also FDA approved for the&#xD;
      treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, advanced renal cell carcinoma, classical&#xD;
      Hodgkin lymphoma, and recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the mechanism of action of CTLA-4 and PD-1 inhibitors toxicity is largely immune&#xD;
      mediated. The incidence of grade3 or higher immune mediated toxicity following single agent&#xD;
      ipilimumab treatment is approximately 25%. Following nivolumab or pembrolizumab treatment the&#xD;
      risk of such toxicity is 17-20% while following combined ipilimumab and nivolumab treatment&#xD;
      the risk is 55-59%. Toxicity can manifest based on organ or tissue involved such as rash,&#xD;
      colitis, hepatitis, nephritis, pancreatitis, myocarditis, pneumonitis uveitis, neurologic or&#xD;
      endocrine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autoimmune endocrinopathies (thyroid disease, hypophysitis, adrenal failure and diabetes)&#xD;
      have been reported in 6-25% of patients on anti-PD-1 therapies in different case series. With&#xD;
      concurrent CTLA-4 and PD-1 inhibition the rate of thyroid immune mediated toxicity is&#xD;
      approximately 15%. Autoimmune thyroid disease can easily be detected on routine blood tests&#xD;
      before the patient develops symptoms, is associated with known autoantibodies that have&#xD;
      clinical assays, and autoimmune thyroid disease can be treated with thyroid hormone&#xD;
      replacement, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels have been inversely correlated with the levels of&#xD;
      anti-thyroperoxidase (TPO) antibodies in some cohorts. Vitamin D deficiency has also been&#xD;
      linked to an increased risk of autoimmune thyroid disease. Vitamin D supplementation has been&#xD;
      reported to suppress CD4+ T cell and NK cell function in pre-clinical and clinical studies.&#xD;
      It is not known whether vitamin D deficiency plays a role in the development of the irAEs in&#xD;
      patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Furthermore, it is not known if vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency or supplementation alters the rate of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition has demonstrated clinical efficacy in a range of malignancies with&#xD;
      treatment leading to durable benefit. However this type of treatment can lead to immune&#xD;
      mediated toxicity that if high grade can necessitate interventions or management with high&#xD;
      dose steroids. As such identifying biomarkers for toxicity and strategies to minimize&#xD;
      toxicity risk are very important. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels have been inversely&#xD;
      correlated with the levels of anti-thyroperoxidase (TPO) antibodies in some cohorts. Vitamin&#xD;
      D deficiency has also been linked to an increased risk of autoimmune thyroid disease. This&#xD;
      study plans to determine if baseline deficiency in serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels&#xD;
      correlates with altered risk of developing immune mediated toxicity of the thyroid gland in&#xD;
      patients being treated with anti-PD1/PD-L1 immunotherapy.&#xD;
