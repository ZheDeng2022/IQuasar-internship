    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer and the second leading cause&#xD;
      of cancer-related deaths in the world. Because HCC is insidious and early diagnosis is&#xD;
      difficult, most patients have locally advanced or distant metastasis at the time of&#xD;
      diagnosis. So they are not suitable candidates for curative treatments by resection or&#xD;
      transplantation. Currently, There are only not more than five drugs to be selected for&#xD;
      advanced HCC, although it prolongs the survival for less than 3 months. Recently,&#xD;
      metabolomics studies of HCC have shown that typical Warburg effect was observed in hepatoma&#xD;
      carcinoma cells. Arginine hydrochloride is a new anticancer drug in the treatment of HCC,&#xD;
      which is mainly aimed at the pathway of energy metabolism.acetazolamide may play an&#xD;
      anti-tumor role by inhibiting the reverse TCA cycle. The investigators have been proceeding&#xD;
      this trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acetazolamide combined with levamisole in&#xD;
      the treatment of advanced HCC.&#xD;
