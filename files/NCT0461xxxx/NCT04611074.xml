  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nordic Clinic is a private clinic for personalised treatment based on the Functional Medicine&#xD;
      concept. In summary, functional medicine is aimed at addressing the lifestyle and behavioral&#xD;
      factors that are believed to contribute to the symptoms the patient suffers from. In short,&#xD;
      the treatment is based on a timeline of health-related life events, current lifestyle factors&#xD;
      and behaviors and physiological examinations to develop a personalised lifestyle program. The&#xD;
      main component of the treatment provided at Nordic Clinic is in-depth lifestyle coaching to&#xD;
      achieve the desired behavioral and lifestyle changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working at the clinic is a clinical physiologist, nutritionist, physician specialist in&#xD;
      general medicine and researchers work. The vast majority of people who apply for the clinic&#xD;
      have long-standing symptoms that have been investigated by the healthcare system without any&#xD;
      organic explanation for the symptoms having been identified. Common causes are&#xD;
      gastrointestinal problems, persistent fatigue and insomnia. The aim of the study is to&#xD;
      investigate symptom-borne and health-related quality of life during and after treatment and&#xD;
      to identify predictors of improvement of health-related quality of life. The main purpose is&#xD;
      to investigate whether the health-related quality of life is improved during treatment. This&#xD;
      is an observational study and all adult patients who are able to complete the web form in&#xD;
      Swedish at the clinic are asked to participate. Participants who give consent will receive a&#xD;
      link to the questionnaire via email once a month for one year and once after two years.&#xD;
      Participants are recruited for two years, and will be completed after the last questionnaire&#xD;
      is completed by the last included participant, ie autumn 2022. In addition to the&#xD;
      self-assessments, the number of visits to the clinic, sampling and results, who finances the&#xD;
      treatment and treatment plan are recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim is to investigate improvement in symptom burden and health related quality of&#xD;
      life during and after treatment (does symptom burden and health related quality of improve&#xD;
      during treatment and are improvements stable at the 2 year follow-up?) The second aim is to&#xD;
      investigate factors that predict recovery (Do persons with a high level of motivation for&#xD;
      behavioural change experience a better improvement in symptom burden and health related&#xD;
      quality of life than persons with a low level of motivation for behavioural change?).&#xD;

      Research plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health related quality of life in patients at the Nordic Clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nordic Clinic is a private clinic that provides personalised treatment based on functional&#xD;
      medicine. The vast majority of the patients seeking care at the clinic suffer from&#xD;
      unexplained medical symptoms, most commonly fatigue and abdominal symptoms, and have&#xD;
      previously been medically evaluated by health care. Working at the clinic are a clinical&#xD;
      physiologist, nutritional therapist, licensed physician and a researcher. Patients follow a&#xD;
      clinical treatment process starting with the physician progressing through to the&#xD;
      nutritionist. Treatment is covered either by the patient themselves, by employers or health&#xD;
      insurances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before treatment is initialised, an extensive medical history along with current lifestyle&#xD;
      habits are taken. The treatment programme is based on lifestyle factors, mainly diet, sleep,&#xD;
      stress management and physical activity. Supplements are given. Drugs are prescribed sparsely&#xD;
      and by a licenced physician, and may include Rifaximin or other antibiotics for intestinal&#xD;
      bacterial overgrowth, motility drugs for constipation, anti-parasitic drugs in case of&#xD;
      parasite infection, and melatonin for sleep disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The components in the treatment programme have been investigated separately. Any supplements&#xD;
      used are produced by reputable organisations and most of them have been part of the treatment&#xD;
      routine for several years. The aims of the study is to evaluate improvement during and after&#xD;
      treatment and to identify predictors of recovery. The goal is to understand the process of&#xD;
      recovery with the long term goal to improve care given at the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim and research question&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim is to investigate improvement in symptom burden and health related quality of&#xD;
      life during and after treatment (does symptom burden and health related quality of improve&#xD;
      during treatment and are improvements stable at the 2 year follow-up?) The second aim is to&#xD;
      investigate factors that predict recovery (Do persons with a high level of motivation for&#xD;
      behavioural change experience a better improvement in symptom burden and health related&#xD;
      quality of life than persons with a low level of motivation for behavioural change?).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population and inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Swedish speaking patients (&gt;1= 18 years) visiting the clinic will be asked to participate&#xD;
      in the study by clinic personnel when visiting the clinic. All patients at the clinic are&#xD;
      able to provide informed consent and to fill out online forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study where patients are followed over time in terms of symptom&#xD;
      burden and health related quality of life. The study participants are asked to fill out forms&#xD;
      once a month for one year counting from the first visit, and once again 2 years after&#xD;
      baseline. Clinical data is collected from the medial record by the clinician at the end of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Jylhä 2009)(K, S et al. 2003)(Westerlund, Brandt et al. 2014)(Smets, Garssen et al.&#xD;
      1995)(Andreasson, Wicksell et al. 2016)(Spitzer, Kroenke et al. 2006)(Spitzer, Kroenke et al.&#xD;
      1999)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on diagnosis, number of visits, tests and test results, treatment programme and&#xD;
      background information (including age, gender, lifestyle factors, readiness for change,&#xD;
      education, occupation, social support, height and weight, blood pressure), will be collected&#xD;
      from the medical record of the patient by the clinician at the end of the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on experience of these types of analyses, 150 participants would give a reasonable&#xD;
      foundation for the statistical analyses. 300 unique patients are expected to enrol during the&#xD;
      study inclusion period and expect 200 of these to complete at least the first year of data&#xD;
      collection. In the main analysis of the first aim, the effect of time on questionnaire scores&#xD;
      will be investigated using mixed effect linear regression to see to what extent symptom&#xD;
      burden and health related quality of life is affected during treatment and to investigate the&#xD;
      stability in any improvements. Secondly, it will be investigated it a high adherence to the&#xD;
      treatment programme is associated with improvement. Thirdly, the level of adherence to the&#xD;
      treatment programme will be compared between patients with predominant abdominal symptoms and&#xD;
      patients with predominant fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the main analysis of the second aim, readiness for change will be tested as a moderator of&#xD;
      the effect of time on questionnaire scores. Secondly, the level of improvement will be&#xD;
      compared between patients who self-fund the treatment programme and patients with funding&#xD;
      from employer or health insurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients often present with a range of different symptoms. Principal component analysis will&#xD;
      be performed in an exploratory analysis to investigate if there are subgroups within the&#xD;
      patient population, and if these subgroups differ in terms of treatment response. Covariation&#xD;
      over time of symptoms, health related quality of life and self-rated health will be&#xD;
      investigated in exploratory analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study poses little risk to the participant. The treatment programme that the&#xD;
      participant would undergo independently of the study is considered safe with few and mild&#xD;
      side effects such as rash. As part of the study the participant report health information on&#xD;
      a web questionnaire. Health data is sensitive information and the same platform will be used&#xD;
      as for all other data collected by the clinic for treatment. The platform that is used is&#xD;
      certified safe (add information) and complies to the GDPR regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk of missing serious diagnoses&#xD;
&#xD;
      When dealing with symptoms such as persistent fatigue there is a risk that serious conditions&#xD;
      such as cancer might be missed. However, the risk is estimated as low as low as in primary&#xD;
      care at a Vårdcentral. Our medical doctor is still active in primary health care in parallel&#xD;
      to Nordic Clinic and has many years of experience. Most of the patients at Nordic Clinic have&#xD;
      been thoroughly investigated in the primary care system before signing up as patients at&#xD;
      Nordic Clinic. Should patients however present with symptoms that warrant the investigation&#xD;
      of serious conditions like malignancies, it is made sure that a thorough investigation has&#xD;
      indeed been performed. If it has not, our medical doctor refers them back to primary or&#xD;
      specialist health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has not been a strong research tradition to evaluate treatment programmes based on&#xD;
      functional medicine, albeit the individual components therein have all been evaluated and are&#xD;
      found to be safe. However, all treatments given to patients need continuing evaluation. This&#xD;
      two-year observational study will provide information regarding treatment outcomes and&#xD;
      stability thereof over time, in addition to identifying patient groups that get the most&#xD;
      benefit of the treatment. Future randomised controlled trials are needed to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the treatment programme.&#xD;
