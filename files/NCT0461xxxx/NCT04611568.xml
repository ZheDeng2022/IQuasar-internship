      This trial studies how well a health educational campaign works in increasing early detection&#xD;
      of melanoma in Oregon. The health educational campaign may provide information to help people&#xD;
      learn about the early signs of melanoma. Increased education in Oregon may decrease the&#xD;
      number of people who die from melanoma and increase the number of melanomas that are&#xD;
      identified at an earlier stage.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To measure the change in melanoma literacy in Oregon, Washington, and Utah over five years&#xD;
      (relative to baseline) and determine if there is a statistically significant difference in&#xD;
      literacy in Oregon (where the educational campaign occurred) as compared to the&#xD;
      non-participating states (Washington and Utah).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine if there is an association between melanoma literacy and 1) stage at&#xD;
      diagnosis, 2) tumor depth, 3) incidence, and 4) mortality rates in Oregon, Washington, and&#xD;
      Utah.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine if the cost of care for melanoma in Oregon is impacted by melanoma literacy&#xD;
      and/or tumor stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEDIA CAMPAIGN: Participants view digital media strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS AND PROFESSIONALS: Primary care providers and professionals who see&#xD;
      skin and potential melanomas receive online based curriculum on melanoma. Participants also&#xD;
      complete a survey to assess knowledge and confidence before and after receiving the&#xD;
      curriculum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MELANOMA COMMUNITY REGISTRY VOLUNTEERS: Melanoma Community Registry volunteers in Oregon&#xD;
      receive educational and training materials on melanoma. Participants also complete a survey&#xD;
      before and after receiving educational material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS: High school students receive an educational lecture over 1 hour on&#xD;
      sun-safety and early detection of melanoma practices. Participants also complete a survey&#xD;
      before and after the educational lecture.&#xD;
