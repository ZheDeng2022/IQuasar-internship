  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we research patient segmentation made by Suuntima-service and itÂ´s impacts to&#xD;
      Quality of care, Service use and Costs of care among Type 2 Diabetes patients and Substance&#xD;
      Abuse patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this Suuntima-servise based segmentation we assume to find appropriate services and&#xD;
      Self-Management to allocate Type 2 Diabetes and Substance Abuse patients. We plan their care&#xD;
      pathways by Suuntiman-service customership strategies (Self-acting, community, co-operation,&#xD;
      network).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study recruits 270 adult-type diabetics and 200 clients of substance abuse services for&#xD;
      each of the four client segments (self-employment, community, cooperation, network client)&#xD;
      and the comparison group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous evaluations and studies of the Suuntima service, it is assumed that there&#xD;
      will be 60% self-acting customers, 20% community customers, 10% co-operation customers, 10%&#xD;
      network customers, therefore patients must be recruited sample. Thus, a total of about 1,350&#xD;
      to 1,500 patients are recruited for adult-type diabetes patients, and 1,000 to 1,200 clients&#xD;
      for substance abuse services until sufficient representation is obtained for each clientele.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every adult patients with type 2 diabetes who are admitted to the caregiver's preparatory&#xD;
      diabetic nurse appointment for the annual diabetes control will be asked to participate in&#xD;
      the study until the number of patients required for the study has been accumulated. With&#xD;
      regard to the substance abuse process, all clients who come to the substance abuse nurse's&#xD;
      office are asked to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nursing staff review the information document with the subjects in an understandable way and&#xD;
      the subjects are given the opportunity to ask questions about the study. If they choose to&#xD;
      participate in the study, they will be asked to comply with consent to participate in the&#xD;
      study.A Suuntima is made for the research subject and the customership and the type of use of&#xD;
      the services, ie the servicepath, are defined. At the beginning, the research patients fill&#xD;
      in a 15D questionnaire measuring the quality of life and a service experience meter (NPS, Net&#xD;
      Promoter Score) and answer questions about height, weight, smoking habbits and how they&#xD;
      manages in their everyday life. Clients of substance abuse services answer also questions&#xD;
      about substance use. To monitor the quality and effectiveness of treatment, clinical&#xD;
      variables are collected from the patient information system according to the recommendation&#xD;
      of the National Diabetes Treatment Quality Register (Glucose hemoglobin, LDL cholesterol,&#xD;
      albumin-creatinine ratio). Similarly, the necessary clinical parameters (serum&#xD;
      glutamyltransferase (GT), serum low-carbohydrate transferrin (CDT), and drug screen) are&#xD;
      collected from clients of substance abuse to monitor the quality and effectiveness of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the study collects information on the use of the health and social services and&#xD;
      costs in general, as well as on the use and costs of services related to diabetes or&#xD;
      substance abuse are collected from the patient information systems of both the health centers&#xD;
      and Tampere Univercity hospital information systems of municipal social services. Laboratory&#xD;
      data are collected from Fimlab's information systems with the permission of the registrar,&#xD;
      and cost data for specialist care are collected from Tays' Mynla system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up data will be collected after one and two years in connection with diabetes&#xD;
      monitoring, in which case the above-mentioned data collection will be repeated. For substance&#xD;
      abuse clients, monitoring is performed at 6 months and 12 months. In addition, the follow-up&#xD;
      visit examines with a questionnaire whether the customer path has been realized as planned&#xD;
      during the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the autumn of 2020, the health care professionals participating in the study will be&#xD;
      interviewed about the implementation of customer paths during the year. Interviews are&#xD;
      recorded, transcribed. Participation in the interview is voluntary and your information will&#xD;
      be collected without any unique identifiers. The information is processed in such a way that&#xD;
      no individual interviewee can be directly identified from them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, similar information is collected at the reference health centers agreed in&#xD;
      Pirkanmaa for adult-type diabetic patients and substance abuse patients, whose services are&#xD;
      not planned according to the Suuntima service customership carepathways.&#xD;
