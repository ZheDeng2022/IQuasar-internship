        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female participants must be 18 to 55 years of age, inclusive, at the time of&#xD;
             signing the ICD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female participants who are overtly healthy as determined by medical&#xD;
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, vitals&#xD;
             and ECGs. Participants with obesity that are otherwise healthy may be enrolled in this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment&#xD;
             plan, laboratory tests, lifestyle considerations, and other study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lb) and BMI of 25.0 to 40.0 kg/m2 at the screening&#xD;
             visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent, which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the ICD and protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,&#xD;
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurological, or&#xD;
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,&#xD;
             seasonal allergies at the time of dosing).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of HIV infection, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C; positive testing for HBsAg,&#xD;
             HBsAb, HBcAb, HCVAb or HIV. Hepatitis B vaccination is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or multiple endocrine&#xD;
             neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN2), or participants with suspected MTC per the&#xD;
             investigator's judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the past year) or&#xD;
             active suicidal ideation/behavior or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk&#xD;
             of study participation or, in the investigator's judgment, make the participant&#xD;
             inappropriate for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary and herbal supplements within&#xD;
             7 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study&#xD;
             intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of hormone replacement therapy or oral/injectable contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous administration with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined&#xD;
             by the local requirement) or 5 half lives preceding the first dose of study&#xD;
             intervention used in this study (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known prior participation (ie, randomized and received at least 1&#xD;
             dose of investigational product) in a study involving PF 06882961.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive urine drug test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Using a properly sized and calibrated BP cuff, screening supine BP ≥140 mm Hg&#xD;
             (systolic) or ≥90 mm Hg (diastolic) following at least 5 minutes of supine rest. If BP&#xD;
             is ≥140 mm Hg (systolic) or ≥90 mm Hg (diastolic) the BP should be repeated 2 more&#xD;
             times and the average of the 3 BP values should be used to determine the participant's&#xD;
             eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline 12 lead ECG that demonstrates clinically relevant abnormalities that may&#xD;
             affect participant safety or interpretation of study results (eg, baseline QTcF&#xD;
             interval &gt;450 msec, complete LBBB, signs of an acute or indeterminate age myocardial&#xD;
             infarction, ST T interval changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia, second or third&#xD;
             degree AV block, or serious bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias). If the baseline&#xD;
             uncorrected QT interval is &gt;450 msec, this interval should be rate corrected using the&#xD;
             Fridericia method and the resulting QTcF should be used for decision making and&#xD;
             reporting. If QTcF exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be&#xD;
             repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTcF or QRS values should be used to&#xD;
             determine the participant's eligibility. Computer interpreted ECGs should be overread&#xD;
             by a physician experienced in reading ECGs before excluding participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at&#xD;
             screening, as assessed by the study specific laboratory and confirmed by a single&#xD;
             repeat test, if deemed necessary:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level ≥1.25 ×&#xD;
                  upper limit of normal (ULN);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin level ≥1.5 × ULN; participants with a history of Gilbert's&#xD;
                  syndrome may have direct bilirubin measured and would be eligible for this study&#xD;
                  provided the direct bilirubin level is ≤ ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  HbA1c ≥6.5%;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Fasting blood glucose ≥126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Calcitonin &gt; ULN;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  eGFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 as calculated by the CKD-EPI equation.&#xD;
