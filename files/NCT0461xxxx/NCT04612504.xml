  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/IIa, open-label, multicenter study to characterize safety and tolerability,&#xD;
      evaluate biodistribution, biological effects and immunogenicity, and evaluate the preliminary&#xD;
      clinical efficacy of SynOV1.1, when administered as monotherapy and in combination with&#xD;
      atezolizumab to participants with AFP positive HCC.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Part 1 (dose escalation) is designed to determine the pharmacodynamics of SynOV1.1 as well as&#xD;
      type and severity of toxicity based on safety and tolerability assessments. 3 dose level (3 ×&#xD;
      10^11, 1 × 10^12, 3 × 10^12) will be evaluated. Part 2 (combination therapy) is designed to&#xD;
      gather safety, tolerability, biodistribution data, and to evaluate the preliminary efficacy&#xD;
      of SynOV1.1 in combination with atezolizumab. Part 3 (expansion study) is designed to further&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy SynOV1.1 in combination with atezolizumab in participants with HCC.&#xD;
