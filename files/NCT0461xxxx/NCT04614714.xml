  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breastfeeding has well-established immunity and developmental benefits for newborns, yet&#xD;
      mothers of preterm infants often struggle to provide sufficient breast milk. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that supplementing mothers of preterm infants with nicotinamide&#xD;
      riboside (NR) during early postpartum will result in increased milk production. NR is a&#xD;
      unique precursor to NAD+, which functions in whole-body metabolism, including that which&#xD;
      supports the elevated energy demands of lactation. In lactating rats, NR supplementation&#xD;
      improved milk quantity and quality, with metabolic benefits for the mother and lasting&#xD;
      protective advantages for the offspring. No studies have been conducted to date that explore&#xD;
      the short- or long-term use of NR for increasing milk supply in lactating women. This study&#xD;
      will follow a small cohort of women and very preterm infants in the NICU throughout two&#xD;
      intervention phases-- one in which each mother will randomly receive either NR or a placebo,&#xD;
      then the opposite treatment-- to determine the effect of maternal NR supplementation on&#xD;
      expressed milk volume and other markers of metabolism.&#xD;
