  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial was to compare the clinical performances of composite resin&#xD;
      restorations with/without the polyethylene fiber to the first permanent molar teeth with&#xD;
      extensively carious pediatric patients. A total of 75 restorations with (FC; n=38)or without&#xD;
      (C; n=37) fiber were placed in the first permanent molar teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Restorations were evaluated at baseline-6-12-18 months according to the modified-USPHS&#xD;
      criteria. Data were analyzed with Chi-Square and Cochran's Q (p&lt;0.05).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Fiber reinforced composite restorations developed in recent years have been presented to&#xD;
      improve the negative properties of composite resin systems applied by the traditional method&#xD;
      thanks to the fact that the fibers act as a crack stopper, reduce polymerization shrinkage by&#xD;
      decreasing the the mass of composite resin material between the remaining dentin structure&#xD;
      and the fiber. Many authors having conducted tremendous experience in this field of research&#xD;
      have reported that the polyethylene fiber is an innovative approach because it not only&#xD;
      increases the flexural strength but also improves fracture toughness. Its woven fiber&#xD;
      orientation provides the stresses to be dispersed throughout the restoration, and therefore&#xD;
      reinforces the restoration and the remaining tooth structure in multiple directions.&#xD;

    <description>Observers evaluated the restorations was performed using the modified United State Public Health Service criteria Observers evaluated the restorations was performed using the modified United State Public Health Service criteria which was evaluated by 2 independent clinicians. Visual inspection with a mirror at 18 inches was performed. A score means the higher score of clinical acceptability while C and D score means that the restoration has failed and needs to be replaced.

    <description>The enamel and dentin were conditioned with bonding procedure.After bonding procedures, remaining tooth composite resin walls were created and cured for 20 s. Prepared ribbond fiber pieces, 2-mm-wide approximately 12mm-long, (Ribbond Thinner, Higher, Modulus - Ribbond Inc,Seattle) were wetted with an unfilled resin for 2 minutes at a non-light environment. The inner surfaces of the prepared class I cavity were lined with flowable resin. After removing the excess resin, pre-wetted polyethylene fiber was condensed circumferentially and embedded with a hand instrument into the bed of unpolymerized flowable composite and then polymerized for 20 seconds with Light Emitting Diodes. After curing for 20 s, composite resin was applied to the rest of the cavity incrementally, each increment was cured for 20 seconds. Finally, the restoration was shaped with finishing diamonds and silicon instruments.</description>
