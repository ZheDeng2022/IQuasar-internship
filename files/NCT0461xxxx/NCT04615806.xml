  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Indocyanine green (ICG) has been recently introduced in clinical practice as a fuorescent&#xD;
      tracer. Lymphadenectomy is particularly challenging in esophageal cancer surgery, owing to&#xD;
      the complex anatomical drainage.Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore whether&#xD;
      the NIR-ICG imaging system could accurately assess the lymph node markers during radical&#xD;
      resection of esophageal cancer.&#xD;

      This study will be accepted in esophageal cancer patients with Radical Esophag-ectomy as the&#xD;
      research object.We will divide them into two groups: experimental group for injection of&#xD;
      indocyanine green group and control group for injectable in-docyanine green group.We will&#xD;
      compare with the accuracy,false positive rate and false negative rate,sensitivity,&#xD;
      specificity and related indicators of intraoperative lymph node cleaning,in order to explore&#xD;
      the common position of esophageal cancer sentinel lymph node,guidance of esophageal cancer&#xD;
      lymph node cleaning thoroughly.&#xD;
