  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to study the feasibility and acceptability of the Open to Options&#xD;
      (O2O) Chatbot prototype. The O2O program is an existing patient support program with content&#xD;
      currently delivered via in-person counseling with a trained mental health professional or via&#xD;
      an existing web-based program (Let's Talk Treatment Options).The Chatbot is an automated,&#xD;
      menu-based agent being developed in this study to extend the reach and accessibility of the&#xD;
      O2O program via the Chatbot's &quot;virtual coaching&quot;.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to assess feasibility and acceptability, and to gather preliminary data&#xD;
      on how patients with a new diagnosis of cancer appraise being prepared for their upcoming&#xD;
      visit with a cancer specialist. Participants will be randomized to take a survey either&#xD;
      before or after their Chatbot interaction. The surveys collect participants' self-appraisal&#xD;
      regarding preparedness for their upcoming appointment with a cancer physician, cancer&#xD;
      distress and cancer anxiety. The study will examine whether patients who take the survey&#xD;
      after viewing the Chatbot feel more prepared for their upcoming appointment than those who&#xD;
      take the survey before the Chatbot interaction.&#xD;

    <description>An online, automated, menu-based agent in which all responses are pre-programmed to be consistent with the existing O2O program. The chat-like responses help guide the participant through a process with the goal of developing a list of questions for their upcoming appointment with a cancer clinician. The session is meant to be completed in one sitting and estimated to take about 45 minutes to complete (including the pre- or post-intervention survey); however, if a participant stops in the middle, they may go back and complete the Chatbot session (or survey).</description>
