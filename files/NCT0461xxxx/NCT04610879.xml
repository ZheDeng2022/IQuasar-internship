  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rolandic epilepsy (RE) is the most common type of epilepsy. Children with RE have seizures&#xD;
      and can often find that their learning, sleep, behaviour, self-esteem and mood are affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of standard NHS care, children diagnosed with RE may be treated with standard&#xD;
      anti-epileptic medicines, like carbamazepine, or no medicine at all. The medicines used to&#xD;
      treat epilepsy often slow down a child's thinking and learning. In the past, doctors believed&#xD;
      this was an acceptable price to pay to reduce seizures. However, with RE, where the seizures&#xD;
      usually stop in teenage years, investigators do not know if it is better to treat these&#xD;
      children with medicines or not, especially if the medicines might have a negative effect on&#xD;
      their learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A newer medicine called levetiracetam has also been found to work in children with RE and has&#xD;
      shown less problems with thinking and learning in adults. However, it is still no known if&#xD;
      this is also the case for children and it has not been proven which of the three options&#xD;
      (carbamazepine, levetiracetam or no treatment) would be best for RE patients. The CASTLE&#xD;
      study aims to find this out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, it has been found that seizures often happen when a child has had poor sleep and&#xD;
      they often come at night or early in the morning. It has been shown that sleep can be&#xD;
      improved through practice without the need of medicines. There are established guidelines to&#xD;
      help toddlers go to sleep, but nothing available that helps young people with epilepsy and&#xD;
      their parents improve their sleep quality. In the CASTLE study, a sleep training plan has&#xD;
      been developed for children with epilepsy and the trial aims to find out whether following&#xD;
      this sleep training plan results in less seizures than using no sleep training at all.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is a phase IV randomised factorial design controlled trial comparing carbamazepine,&#xD;
      levetiracetam or active monitoring combined with or without sleep behaviour intervention. A&#xD;
      factorial trial design has been used as this approach enables the efficient simultaneous&#xD;
      investigation of AED (carbamazepine; levetiracetam; no AED) and sleep behaviour intervention&#xD;
      (vs standard care) by including all participants in both analyses. In a factorial trial it is&#xD;
      also possible to consider both the separate effects of each intervention and the benefits of&#xD;
      receiving both interventions together (for example levetiracetam and sleep intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CASTLE trial will take place in NHS out-patient paediatric epilepsy and general&#xD;
      paediatric clinics in the United Kingdom (UK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once consent has been obtained from the appropriate adult, and assent from the child if&#xD;
      appropriate, by the delegated member of the research team the eligibility assessments will be&#xD;
      completed, full eligibility confirmed (confirmation must be by a medically qualified doctor)&#xD;
      and baseline data will be collected prior to randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be performed via a web based tool accessed by research team at site. This&#xD;
      system is generated centrally by the Clinical Trial Research Centre (CTRC) using a computer&#xD;
      algorithm concealed from the investigators and research teams/trial management group. In&#xD;
      order to balance the groups, minimisation for variables believed to influence disease outcome&#xD;
      and end points will be built into the randomisation algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomised to treatment with carbamazepine, levetiracetam or active&#xD;
      monitoring. Where randomised to drug treatment, the randomised treatment should ideally begin&#xD;
      on the day of randomisation or within 14 days of randomisation at the latest. Randomised&#xD;
      treatment will continue for a minimum of 12 months and a maximum of 48 months. All treatments&#xD;
      will be procured, prescribed and issued as per routine NHS practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data capture will be in the form of paper copies of Case Report Forms (CRFs) that&#xD;
      will be returned as an on-going process from each centre to the CTRC. Patient/parent reported&#xD;
      data will be collected directly on paper at each outpatient visit with the exception of&#xD;
      CANTAB, which will be collected on iPads at the centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All trial documents (except raw Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) from NHS digital that will&#xD;
      only be retained for 1 year) will be retained for 25 years from the End of Trial. The PI at&#xD;
      each investigational centre must make arrangements to store the essential trial documents,&#xD;
      (as defined in Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial (ICH E6, Guideline for&#xD;
      Good Clinical Practice)) including the ISF, until the CTRC informs the investigator that the&#xD;
      documents are no longer to be retained&#xD;
