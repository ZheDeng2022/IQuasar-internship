      This is a prospective interventional trial that aims to restore iodine incorporation in&#xD;
      tumoral lesions of patients with unresectable, radioiodine-refractory thyroid cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective interventional study testing the hypothesis that the inhibition of MEK&#xD;
      can restore iodine incorporation in BRAF wild type (WT) and a combined inhibition of BRAF and&#xD;
      MEK can restore iodine incorporation in BRAFV600E mutant (MUT), radioiodine-refractory (RAIR)&#xD;
      thyroid cancer. Patients with proven iodine negative tumor lesion(s) will be included in this&#xD;
      study. Patients will then receive Trametinib (WT-group) or Dabrafenib and Trametinib&#xD;
      combination-therapy (MUT-group) for approximately 3 weeks, after which a Thyrogen-stimulated&#xD;
      123I SPECT imaging will be performed. For patients whose tumor(s) demonstrate sufficient&#xD;
      iodine incorporation in the post drug treatment 123I SPECT imaging, a treatment according to&#xD;
      guidelines for iodine positive lesions will be performed. The follow up of the patients will&#xD;
      be conducted as standard of care.&#xD;

             metastatic thyroid carcinoma of follicular origin (including papillary and its&#xD;
             respective variants).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmation in a certified laboratory of the mutation status of BRAF gene (primary&#xD;
             tumor, recurrent tumor, or metastasis) .&#xD;

             calipers by clinical exam. Tumors in previously irradiated fields may be considered&#xD;
             measureable if there is evidence of tumor progression after radiation treatment.&#xD;

               2. No external beam radiation therapy &lt; 4 weeks prior to initiation of therapy on&#xD;
                  this protocol. (Previous treatment with radiation for any indication is allowed&#xD;
                  if the investigator judges that the previous radiation does not significantly&#xD;
                  compromise patient safety on this protocol.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. No chemotherapy or targeted therapy (e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitor) is allowed&#xD;
                  &lt; 4 weeks prior to the initiation of therapy on this protocol.&#xD;

          -  Fertile men and women must use an effective method of contraception during treatment&#xD;
             and for at least 6 months after completion of treatment as directed by their&#xD;
             physician. Effective methods of contraception are defined as those, which result in a&#xD;
             low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly&#xD;
             (for example implants, injectables, combined oral contraception or intra-uterine&#xD;
             devices). At the discretion of the investigator, acceptable methods of contraception&#xD;
             may include total abstinence in cases where the lifestyle of the patient ensures&#xD;
             compliance. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
             postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Availability of archival tumor tissue from the thyroid cancer primary or metastasis (a&#xD;
             tissue block or a minimum of 30 unstained slides would be required. Patients with less&#xD;
             archival tissue available may still be eligible for the study after discussion with&#xD;
             the Principal Investigator). This does not apply to patients who undergo a biopsy.&#xD;
