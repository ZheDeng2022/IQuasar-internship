  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women with personal history of breast cancer (PHBC) are at risk of developing second breast&#xD;
      cancers in the conserved and contralateral breast. Because early detection of second breast&#xD;
      cancers at the asymptomatic phase can improve relative survival by 17-28%, guidelines&#xD;
      recommend annual mammography screening in women with PHBC. However, lower sensitivity and&#xD;
      higher interval cancer rates are observed in women with a PHBC compared with women without,&#xD;
      especially in women 50 years or younger and those with dense breasts. In a multicenter&#xD;
      comparison study of 754 women, MRI screening detected 3.8 additional cancers and&#xD;
      ultrasonography detected 2.4 additional cancers, and increased sensitivity over mammography&#xD;
      alone. However, the use of breast MRI is limited not only by high costs and long examination&#xD;
      time but also by high false-positive findings. In addition, the use of intravenous&#xD;
      gadolinium-based contrast agent is contraindicated in women with renal impairment or contrast&#xD;
      material allergy contrast. Supplemental ultrasonography in patients with PHBC reports lower&#xD;
      sensitivity with high interval cancer rate. Thus, there is a need to develop a more safe,&#xD;
      accurate, and cost-effective supplemental imaging modality for screening in women with PHBC.&#xD;
      Diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI is an unenhanced fast, functional modality that measures the&#xD;
      movement of water molecules to create tissue contrast. Breast malignancies exhibit hindered&#xD;
      diffusion and appear hyperintense on DW MRI with low apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)&#xD;
      compared to normal surrounding tissue. Multiple studies have shown that the use of DW MRI can&#xD;
      significantly reduce the false positives and unnecessary benign biopsy of breast MRI. Several&#xD;
      studies have shown that DW MRI has a potential to detect mammography occult breast cancers&#xD;
      with less false positives compared to ultrasonography. These observations have led to the&#xD;
      consideration of utilizing DW MRI to screen women with PHBC. In Diffusion-weighted MRI for&#xD;
      Breast Cancer Screening (DIMRISC-2) study, we hypothesized that the screening performance of&#xD;
      high-resolution DW MRI at 3.0 T should be superior to mammography alone or combined&#xD;
      mammography and ultrasonography in women with PHBC. In our institution, alternating&#xD;
      conventional imaging and DW MRI screening is offered for patients who have undergone breast&#xD;
      surgery and at increased risk of an interval second breast cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      -  Primary objective: to compare the screening performance of DW MRI versus mammography&#xD;
           alone or combined mammography and ultrasonography in women with PHBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objective: to compare the tumor and patient characteristics detected by DW MRI&#xD;
           and combined mammography and ultrasonography in women with PHBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a prospective, single center, observational cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A total of 1694 women will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two latest 3.0 T MRI scanners with dedicated 16- or 18-channel bilateral breast coil are&#xD;
           used for DW MRI. For DW MRI screening, the high-resolution echo-planar imaging sequence&#xD;
           is designed to have an in-plane resolution of 1.3 x 1.3 mm and a slice thickness of 3&#xD;
           mm. Three b values of 0, 800, and 1200 sec/mm2 are used and ADC maps are generated based&#xD;
           on the b=0 and 800 sec/mm2 DW MRI data. The DW MRI images are reconstructed into single&#xD;
           summation images with maximum-intensity projections (MIPs) in the sagittal and axial&#xD;
           planes. In addition, T1-weighted imaging sequence is also obtained with in-plane&#xD;
           resolution of 1.0 x 1.0 mm and a slice thickness of 1 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients with PHBC undergo digital two-dimensional mammography and&#xD;
           physician-performed whole-breast ultrasonography on the same day. DW MRI and&#xD;
           conventional imaging (mammography and ultrasonography) are alternatively scheduled at&#xD;
           6-month intervals and the order has been randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mammography alone, combined mammography and ultrasonography, and DW MRI will be&#xD;
           interpreted independently according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System&#xD;
           (BI-RADS) and likelihood of malignancy (Score range, 0%-100%) by trained radiologists.&#xD;
           DW MRI interpretation guidelines to be used in this study are based on both qualitative&#xD;
           and quantitative assessments. Radiologists are required to successfully complete a&#xD;
           training case series of 100 DW MR studies prior to interpreting the DW MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A negative examination result is defined as a final assessment BI-RADS category of 1, 2,&#xD;
           3 and a positive examination result is defined as a final assessment BI-RADS category of&#xD;
           4 or 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biopsies of DW MRI-detected lesions are performed under ultrasonography guidance&#xD;
           whenever possible or with MR guidance if there is no correlative ultrasonography&#xD;
           finding. Pathology of core or surgical biopsy and 1 year follow up is the reference&#xD;
           standard.&#xD;
