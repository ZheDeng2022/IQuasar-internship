    <textblock>
      In the regional health trust of North Norway, time to reperfusion in acute ST-elevation&#xD;
      myocardial infarction is below the national average and below recommendations. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to monitor outcomes, especially time to reperfusion, in ST-elevation acute&#xD;
      myocardial infarction patients. The study period is supposedly lasting for approximately 4&#xD;
      months, the time estimated to observe the clinical course of 100 patients. Before and during&#xD;
      the study period, clinical leaders are encouraged to improve guideline adherence and to&#xD;
      closely monitor the results of their own and collaborating institutions.&#xD;
