  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there are limited prevention or treatments available for dyschromia in burn&#xD;
      hypertrophic scars (HTSs). The limited available techniques involve transferring melanocytes&#xD;
      from unaffected areas to the scar to adjust pigment. These techniques involve the creation of&#xD;
      a donor site and do not utilize the cells that may already be present in scars. This study&#xD;
      aims to confirm melanocyte presence in regions of hypo- and hyper- pigmented HTS. If&#xD;
      melanocytes can be found in regions of hypopigmentation, these scars may be able to be&#xD;
      treated in the future by pigmentation stimulators without the need for surgery. Additionally,&#xD;
      if pigmentation specific molecules of interest can be found to be up-regulated in&#xD;
      hyperpigmented scar, these may be able to be altered by a pharmacotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with burn scars that are lighter and/or darker than their normal skin will be asked&#xD;
      to participate in this study. It is being done to obtain more information about why some&#xD;
      people develop scars that are different in color to their normal skin after trauma to the&#xD;
      skin such as a burn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who wish to participate will have scar measured with a ruler, and study sites&#xD;
      identified and photographed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally the following procedures will be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive measurements: Each area of scar will have multiple non-invasive measurements&#xD;
      done. These include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  scar scales - subjective measures of color, itching, pain, height, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  elasticity - a probe is briefly placed on top of the skin to measure its ability to&#xD;
           stretch&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  induration - a probe is briefly placed on top of the skin to measure how firm it is&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  color - a skin probe in briefly placed on top of the skin to measure its color&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsies: Based on the measurement of the scars, several small 3mm punch biopsies will be&#xD;
      done. Subjects with light colored scars and total scar greater than 500cm2 are eligible to&#xD;
      participate in an optional sub-study. For this sub-study, an additional excisional biopsy 1&#xD;
      cm by 2 cm in the shape of an oval will be obtained from the lighter colored scar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood collection: Blood will be collected for correlating blood characteristics to scar&#xD;
      outcome. Approximately 20 mL of blood will be collected, which is less than 2 tablespoons. A&#xD;
      portion of this blood might be used in the future for genome sequencing of pigmentation or&#xD;
      hypertrophic scar-related gene sequences. Whole genome sequencing will not be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interview: Personal information, medical history, health behaviors, and scar history will be&#xD;
      reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: Information about initial burn injury, hospitalization, and outpatient&#xD;
      visits will be requested from the medical record.&#xD;

      Skin tissue and blood samples will be obtained. Blood and skin tissue will be coded with&#xD;
      unique identifying numbers and maintained in our lab. Samples that are not completely used in&#xD;
      this study may (with the permission of the subject via Informed Consent and HIPAA&#xD;
      Authorization) be transferred to an existing Biospecimen Repository (MedStar IRB #2012- 233)&#xD;

&#xD;
      All biologic samples, as well as genomic data, are subject to withdrawal from their&#xD;
