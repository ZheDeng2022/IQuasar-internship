      The aim of this study was to investigate the volumetric and linear analysis, and to present&#xD;
      the axial classification of root resorptions using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 43 teeth of external cervical resorption (ECR) (n=27), external replacement&#xD;
      resorption (ERR) (n=4) and internal root resorption (IRR) (n=12) were identified from 34&#xD;
      patients. The volume of resorption and total tooth, the widest lengths of these resorptions,&#xD;
      and the amount of thinnest dentin thickness around them were measured and compared according&#xD;
      to age and sex. Additionally, the eight regional axial classification was performed and the&#xD;
      percentages in these regions were evaluated. Significance was set at p=0.05 for statistical&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More accurate management of resorption can be achieved thanks to the three-dimensions&#xD;
      volumetric and linear analysis, and the axial classification presented in this study.&#xD;

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Group 1. Internal root resorption (IRR)</arm_group_label>
    <description>Internal root resorption is the progressive destruction of intraradicular dentin and dentinal tubules along the middle and apical thirds of the canal walls as a result of clastic activities. It is seen as a radiolucent area around the pulpal cavity, usually of incisors and mandibular molars. The various etiological factors suggested for internal root resorption include traumatic injury; infection and orthodontic treatment.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Group 2. external cervical resorption (ECR)</arm_group_label>
    <description>Cementum is considered to protect the underlying root dentin from being resorbed. It is broadly accepted that damage to or deficiency of this protective cementum layer below the epithelial attachment exposes the root surface to osteoclasts, which then resorb the dentin.&#xD;
Clinical sign; Located in cervical region of tooth Pink spot might be noted by patient/dentist Tooth usually responds positively to vitality tests unless there is pulpal involvement (in very advanced cases) Spontaneous and profuse bleeding on probing Sharp, thinned out edges around the resorptive cavity</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Grup 3. external replacement resorption (ERR)</arm_group_label>
    <description>external replacement resorption also known as trauma-induced resorption - and this resorption may occur in teeth that also have external inflammatory resorption. This review will not discuss external replacement resorption in detail but it will be mentioned where relevant as both types of resorption may occur in some cases. This is because replacement resorption is a consequence of the same injuries that typically cause external inflammatory resorption - such as intrusion and avulsion where there is significant damage to the external root surface during the injury, as well as sometimes during the repositioning/ replantation of the tooth.</description>

        Cases of resorption that had CBCT images were included in the study. Radiographic features&#xD;
        of resorption were defined in the images of 34 patients in accordance with these criteria.&#xD;
        A total of 43 teeth with ECR (n=27), ERR (n=4), and IRR (n=12) were identified from 34&#xD;
        patients.&#xD;
