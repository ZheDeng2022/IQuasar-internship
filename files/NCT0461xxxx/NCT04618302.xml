      This study investigates the test-retest reliability of the lung diffusing capacity for nitric&#xD;
      oxide in healthy individuals during exercise.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study of to evaluate the test-retest reliability of single-breath lung&#xD;
      diffusing capacity measurements for nitric oxide (DLNO) in healthy individuals during light&#xD;
      and moderate intensity cycling exercise. Healthy subjects will perform repeated single-breath&#xD;
      DLNO measurements during light (i.e., at 50% of the first ventilatory threshold) and moderate&#xD;
      intensity exercise (i.e., 80% of the first ventilatory threshold) on a stationary cycle&#xD;
      ergometer.&#xD;
