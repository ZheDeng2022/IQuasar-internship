      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a disorder that causes episodes of acute pain and progressive&#xD;
      organ damage. Ways to manage SCD have evolved slowly. Treatments do not always work.&#xD;
      Researchers want to see if a drug called mitapivat can help people with SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the long-term tolerability and safety of mitapivat (or AG-348) in people with SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults age 18-70 with SCD who took part in and benefited from NIH study #19H0097.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will give a&#xD;
      blood sample. They will have an electrocardiogram to test heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will repeat some of the screening tests during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete 6-minute walk tests to measure mobility and function. They will&#xD;
      have transthoracic echocardiograms to measure heart and lung function. They will have&#xD;
      dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans to measure bone health. They will complete online&#xD;
      questionnaires that measure their overall health and well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take the study drug in the form of a tablet twice a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will keep a study diary. They will record any symptoms they may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for about 54 weeks. After 48 weeks, participants can either keep&#xD;
      taking the study drug for 48 more weeks or be tapered off of the study drug to complete the&#xD;
      study. Those who are on the study for 1 year will have 10 study visits. Those who are on the&#xD;
      study for 2 years will have 14 study visits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a multisystem disorder associated with episodes of acute&#xD;
      clinical events and progressive organ damage. Episodic pain, triggered by microvascular&#xD;
      vaso-occlusion induced by sickling of red blood cells (RBCs), is the most common acute&#xD;
      complication and the leading cause of hospitalization. As the root cause of SCD is&#xD;
      polymerization of deoxy-hemoglobin S (HbS), there is a strong rationale for exploring agents&#xD;
      that could inhibit or reduce the polymerization process itself. HbS polymerization is&#xD;
      influenced by a number of factors, including 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) concentration&#xD;
      in the RBC. Increased 2,3-DPG levels in SCD decrease oxygen binding of hemoglobin and&#xD;
      stabilizes the deoxygenated state, causing HbS to polymerize. In addition, increased 2,3-DPG&#xD;
      concentration decreases intraerythrocyte pH, further promoting HbS polymerization. 2,3-DPG is&#xD;
      an intermediate substrate in the glycolytic pathway, the only source of energy production in&#xD;
      RBCs in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Pyruvate kinase (PK) is a key enzyme in the&#xD;
      final step of glycolysis that is responsible for 50% of the total red cell ATP production.&#xD;
      ATP is essential for maintaining integrity of the RBC membrane, and therefore reduced PK&#xD;
      activity not only leads to the accumulation of upstream 2,3-DPG and HbS polymerization but&#xD;
      also affects RBC membrane health. Therefore, increasing red cell PK (PKR) activity presents a&#xD;
      new and potentially attractive therapeutic target for thwarting HbS polymerization,&#xD;
      vaso-occlusion, and hemolysis in SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mitapivat (AG-348) is an orally bioavailable small molecule allosteric activator of PKR,&#xD;
      currently being studied in Phase II/III clinical trials in humans with PK deficiency&#xD;
      (NCT02476916, NCT03548220 / AG348-C-006; NCT03559699 / AG348-C-007), as well as in an ongoing&#xD;
      Phase II clinical trial in humans with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NCT03692052).&#xD;
      The recently published results of mitapivat treatment in a large cohort of PK deficient&#xD;
      subjects appear promising, with demonstrated durable improvement in anemia and reduction in&#xD;
      hemolysis, as well as an acceptable safety profile. The preclinical and clinical mitapivat&#xD;
      data support dose-dependent changes in blood glycolytic intermediates including 2,3-DPG,&#xD;
      consistent with glycolytic pathway activation at multiple ascending doses tested, supporting&#xD;
      the potential anti-sickling role of mitapivat in the treatment of SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We (PI: Dr. S. L. Thein) initiated a Phase I study (NCT04000165) to assess clinical safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of multiple escalating doses of mitapivat in subjects with SCD. To date, we&#xD;
      have observed an acceptable safety profile for mitapivat at all doses, as well as preliminary&#xD;
      evidence of efficacy, with increases in hemoglobin level and decreases in hemolytic markers&#xD;
      observed in a majority of SCD subjects. Following on these preliminary results, the present&#xD;
      study has been initiated to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of long-term&#xD;
      treatment with maintenance dosing of mitapivat in subjects with SCD.&#xD;
