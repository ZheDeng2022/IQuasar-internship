  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study includes two study groups, one involves treatment with auto-cross-linked Hyaluronic&#xD;
      acid by intralesional and hypodermic injection, repeated after two weeks (T14), while the&#xD;
      control arm provides an equal treatment but with isotonic saline solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will be randomized into 2 groups with an allocation of 2:1 in study&#xD;
      treatment arm and control arm respectively. They will be evaluated using the POSAS scale&#xD;
      before the treatment and re-evaluated at 30, 90 and 180 days after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scar evaluation will be completed by an ultrasound assessment at time 0 (T0), 30 (T30),&#xD;
      T90 and T180 and the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index) to be assessed at time 0 (T0), 30&#xD;
      (T30), 90 (T90) and 180 (T180).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In subjects that will consent, a small surgical biopsy for an explorative evaluation of the&#xD;
      scar tissue will be performed before (T0) and after treatment (T30) for a histological&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
