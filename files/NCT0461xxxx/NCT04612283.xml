  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis is characterized by the breakdown of cartilage in joints. As cartilage&#xD;
      deteriorates, the bones of the joint begin to run against one another, causing stiffness and&#xD;
      pain, which often impairs movement. Osteoarthritis also can damage ligaments, menisci, and&#xD;
      muscles. Bone or cartilage fragments may float in the joint space, causing irritation and&#xD;
      pain. Bone spurs, or osteophytes, may also develop, causing additional pain and potentially&#xD;
      damaging surrounding tissues. Around the world, an estimated 10%-15% of adults over 60 have&#xD;
      some degree of osteoarthritis. It most commonly affects the joints in the knee, hands, feet,&#xD;
      and spine, and is also relatively common in other joints such as the shoulder and hip joints.&#xD;
      There are two types of osteoarthritis: primary and secondary. Primary osteoarthritis is a&#xD;
      chronic degenerative disease that is related to, but not caused by, aging. As a person ages,&#xD;
      the water content of their cartilage decreases, thus weakening it and making it less&#xD;
      resilient and more susceptible to degradation. There are strong indications that genetic&#xD;
      inheritance is a factor, as up to 60% of all OA cases are thought to result from genetic&#xD;
      factors. The main symptoms are pain, loss of ability, and &quot;joint stiffness after exercise or&#xD;
      use.&quot; These symptoms are often aggravated by activity or rigorous exercise and relieved&#xD;
      during rest, though the disease may eventually progress to the point where the patient even&#xD;
      feels pain when resting, and some people report pain so intense that it wakes them up when&#xD;
      they are sleeping. Osteoarthritis, at present, cannot be cured, and will likely get worse&#xD;
      over time, but the symptoms can be controlled. Treatments vary widely, from alternative&#xD;
      medicine, to lifestyle changes such as exercise and diet, to physical aids such as canes or&#xD;
      braces, to medications such as acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS),&#xD;
      corticosteroids, and more. Osteoarthritis is the most common joint disease of human. Among&#xD;
      the elderly knee osteoarthritis is leading cause of chronic disability in developed&#xD;
      countries. Some people in India are unable to walk independently from bed and bath-room&#xD;
      because of Osteoarthritis of the knee or hip joint. Osteoarthritis (OA) also known as&#xD;
      degenerative arthritis or degenerative joint disease, is a group of mechanical abnormalities&#xD;
      involving degradation of joints, including articular cartilage and subchondral bone. Symptoms&#xD;
      may include joint pain, tenderness, stiffness, locking, and sometimes an effusion. A variety&#xD;
      of causes viz. hereditary, developmental, metabolic, and mechanical may initiate processes&#xD;
      leading to loss of cartilage. When bone surfaces are not well protected by cartilage, bone&#xD;
      may get exposed and damaged. As a result of decreased movement secondary to pain, atrophy of&#xD;
      regional muscles, and ligaments may become more lax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of treatment is to reduce or eliminate the signs and symptoms of Osteoarthritis.&#xD;
      Mild to moderate disease is often treated with topical therapies. Sponsor has developed the&#xD;
      NGA-01Gel containing the fixed dose combination of alcohol and water mixture, with active&#xD;
      herbal ingredients, without preservatives and dyes. The Gel is easy to apply, and the&#xD;
      cosmetic appearance is that of a white, milky gel, easily-spreadable that absorbs completely&#xD;
      into the skin a few minutes after application and it is expected that the Gel will&#xD;
      differentiate from marketed formulations by patient preference for the gel and gel.&#xD;
