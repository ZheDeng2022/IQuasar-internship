  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years damage to the nerve fibers in the retina has been experienced as an early&#xD;
      sign of complications resulting from type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, it has been presented that people with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of&#xD;
      developing brain diseases, such as mild memory impairment and Alzheimer's disease, as well as&#xD;
      mental illness in the form of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eye corresponds to be a protruding part of the brain which means the brain and the eye&#xD;
      share common features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently it is time and cost consuming to asses changes in the brain, but recent research&#xD;
      has shown that patient friendly eye examinations can detect nerve loss brain diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown that depression can also have a physiological component, which can&#xD;
      be measured by changes in structures in the retina of the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research project, we will conduct a clinical study, to assess whether there is an&#xD;
      association between changes in the retina of the eye (e.g. vascular structure, retinal&#xD;
      thickness and oxygen saturation) and mild memory impairment and depression respectively in&#xD;
      people with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical study will help to clarify the possibility of including patient-friendly eye&#xD;
      examinations in the assessment of minimal memory impairment and depression in patients with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      200 people with type 2 diabetes will be invited to participate in a clinical cross-sectional&#xD;
      study. The Funen Diabetes Database will be used as recruitment tool. Participants will&#xD;
      undergo a thorough eye examination as well as neuropsychological examinations for signs of&#xD;
      mild memory impairment. They will also complete questionnaires regarding depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, the research project will help to create awareness in this area among both&#xD;
      healthcare professionals and patients. Early risk detection could mean better diabetes care&#xD;
      and fewer complications, which will have a major impact on quality of life and contribute to&#xD;
      socio-economic gains. Any findings may contribute to the discussion of individualized&#xD;
      screening and treatment if some individuals within this group are at increased risk of&#xD;
      developing memory impairment or depression.&#xD;

      A cross sectional study will be performed to determine correlation between retinal endpoints&#xD;
      in persons with type 2 diabetes and cognitive impairment. 200 patients with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      without diabetic retinopathy and non to severe diabetic retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether structural and/or metabolic retinal markers are able to differentiate&#xD;
      people with minimal cognitive impairment (MCI) within persons with type 2 diabetes (T2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess whether retinal metabolism measured by oximetry can identify individuals with&#xD;
           MCI among people with T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess whether retinal metabolism measured by oximetry can identify individuals with&#xD;
           depressive symptoms among people with T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine whether retinal structural markers can identify people with depressive&#xD;
           symptoms among people with T2D.&#xD;
