  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this non-interventional study (NIS) a polyamide non-absorbable suture (Dafilon®) will be&#xD;
      evaluated for skin closure in adult and pediatric patients. The aim of the study is to&#xD;
      collect clinical data on the performance of Dafilon® for skin closure. The results of this&#xD;
      study will generate further clinical evidence for the use and the benefit of a non-absorbable&#xD;
      surgical suture material produced from polyamide. Furthermore, the proactive collection of&#xD;
      clinical data for Dafilon® suture will support the maintenance of the suture material on the&#xD;
      market, so that in the future other patients can receive the suture material for skin&#xD;
      closure.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Combination of Surgical Site Infection (SSI) and Wound Dehiscence</measure>
    <time_frame>until suture removal 10±5 days postoperatively.</time_frame>
    <description>The hypotheses of the current study is that the combined endpoint which consists of the sum of the wound dehiscence and SSI rate will not be inferior to the rate of 13% published by Sajid M. S. et al., 2014 [Systematic review of absorbable vs non-absorbable sutures used for the closure of surgical incisions. World J Gastrointest Surg 2014 27;6(12): 241-247]</description>

    <measure>Individual rate of surgical site infection (SSI) at discharge</measure>

    <measure>Progress of Wound healing</measure>
    <time_frame>until day of discharge (approximately 1-2 days postoperatively), 10±5 days post operatively and at follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>This parameter will be noted using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) which states &quot;0&quot; at one end representing &quot;worst wound healing&quot; and &quot;10&quot; at the opposite end representing &quot;excellent wound healing&quot;. The values are compared over postoperative period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progress of Cosmetic result</measure>
    <time_frame>at 10±5 days (suture removal) and at optional follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>Overall patient and observer satisfaction with the scar using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS). Cosmetic result and the scar will be evaluated by the patient and the physician. Patient will rate the cosmetic outcome in six categories (Pain, Itching, Color of scar, Stiffness of scar, thickness and irregularity of scar) on a 1 to 10 points scale each. The physician will use the Observer component, rating vascularization, pigmentation, thickness, relief and pliability of the scar on a 1 to 10 points scale each. The categories are added to a total POSAS score of 11 (minimum) to 110 points (maximum). The values are compared over postoperative period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of hypertrophic scar</measure>
    <time_frame>10±5 days postoperatively (suture removal)</time_frame>
    <description>A hypertrophic scar is a cutaneous condition characterized by deposits of excessive amounts of collagen which gives rise to a raised scar, but not to the degree observed with keloids. [wikipedia]</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of keloid scar</measure>
    <time_frame>10±5 days postoperatively (suture removal)</time_frame>
    <description>Keloidal scar is the formation of a type of scar which, depending on its maturity, is composed mainly of either type III (early) or type I (late) collagen. It is a result of an overgrowth of granulation tissue (collagen type 3) at the site of a healed skin injury which is then slowly replaced by collagen type 1. Keloids should not be confused with hypertrophic scars, which are raised scars that do not grow beyond the boundaries of the original wound. [wikipedia]</description>

    <time_frame>until day of discharge (approximately 1-2 days postoperatively) and 10±5 days postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>This parameter will be noted using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) which state &quot;0&quot; at one end representing &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;100&quot; at the opposite end representing &quot;heavy pain&quot;. The values are compared over postoperative period.</description>

    <measure>Progress of Satisfaction: Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>until day of discharge (approximately 1-2 days postoperatively) and 10±5 days postoperatively</time_frame>
