  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fraility; It is an age-related biological syndrome. It is characterized by decreased&#xD;
      resistance to stressors due to changes in functional reserves and physiological systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BESTest, which is frequently used in the literature, was modified and Frail'BESTest was&#xD;
      developed to detect balance problems in fragile individuals. The test consists of 6&#xD;
      subtitles. These are participation, reaction, movement ability, sensory organization,&#xD;
      biomechanical constraints, gait symmetry. When looking at the literature, the Turkish version&#xD;
      of Frail'BESTest has not been found. For this reason, the aim of study is to examine the&#xD;
      validity and reliability of the Turkish version of Frail'BESTest in elderly individuals and&#xD;
      to question the effectiveness of its clinical use and to bring it to the use of other&#xD;
      researchers.&#xD;

      Fraility; It is an age-related biological syndrome. It is characterized by decreased&#xD;
      resistance to stressors due to changes in functional reserves and physiological&#xD;
      systems.Especially, the increase in the incidence of falls, loss of mobility, dependence in&#xD;
      basic life activities, increase in hospitalizations and increased incidence of death make the&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of frailty important in elderly individuals.&#xD;
