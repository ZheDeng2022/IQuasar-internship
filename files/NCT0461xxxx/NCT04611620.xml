      This descriptive, cross-sectional study will evaulate and fully characterize factors&#xD;
      associated with cognitive dysfunction in Breast Cancer (BCS) and Colorectal Cancer (CRC)&#xD;
      survivors that have cognitive concerns, and factors associated with psychoneurological&#xD;
      symptom cluster in BCS and CRC survivors.&#xD;

      Primary Aim: To identify demographic factors (age and education), medical and cancer&#xD;
      treatment-related factors (comorbidities and treatment type), psychosocial factors (perceived&#xD;
      stress, affect, optimism, coping, emotional support), cancer-related symptoms (pain,&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, fatigue and sleep disturbance), and genetic factors (APOE, COMT, BDNF)&#xD;
      associated with the level of subjective or the level of objective cognitive dysfunction in&#xD;
      breast cancer and colorectal cancer survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim: To identify demographic factors (age and education), medical and cancer&#xD;
      treatment-related factors (comorbidities and treatment type), psychosocial factors (perceived&#xD;
      stress, affect, optimism, coping, emotional support), and genetic factors (APOE, COMT, BDNF)&#xD;
      associated with psychoneurological symptom cluster using either subjective or objective&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunction in breast cancer and colorectal cancer survivors.&#xD;

      The NIH NINR lab will run genome-wide sequencing per an approved and standardized protocol.&#xD;
      In this study, we will focus on 3 genetic SNP variants of BDNF, APOE, and COMT (described&#xD;
      previously). After final batch analyses, only outcome data with the unique identification&#xD;
      numbers will be transferred via secure server to be linked back with the other survey and&#xD;
      neuropsychological data.&#xD;

        A total of 465 breast and colorectal cancer patients will be recruited for this study.&#xD;
        Breast and colorectal cancer survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The eligibility checklist is a self-report questionnaire. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
        self-identify that they are 21 years of age or older, had been diagnosed with breast or&#xD;
        colorectal cancer excluding Stage IV (those without distant metastasis) and have completed&#xD;
        treatment (adjuvant or neo-adjuvant) at least 6 months prior to completing the survey. In&#xD;
        addition, as part of the eligibility checklist, participants will need to self-rate that&#xD;
        they have cognitive concerns (select yes).&#xD;
