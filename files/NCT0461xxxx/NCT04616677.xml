        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI; weight [kilogram {kg}]/height [meter {m}]^2) between 18 and 40&#xD;
             kilograms per meter square (kg/m^2) (inclusive) with a body weight not less than 50 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All female participants (regardless of childbearing potential), must have a negative&#xD;
             serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) pregnancy test at screening and a&#xD;
             negative urine pregnancy test on Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must not donate blood for up to 3 months after study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with normal renal function (Group 1) must meet the following additional&#xD;
             inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study: Must have normal renal function&#xD;
             defined as: estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) greater than or equal to (&gt;=)&#xD;
             90 milliliter (mL)/minute (min) at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with moderate (optional Group 3) or severe (Group 2) renal impairment&#xD;
             must meet the following additional inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study:&#xD;
             Must have a eGFR of less than (&lt;) 90 mL/min with the following classification used at&#xD;
             screening: Moderate renal impairment (eGFR &gt;= 30 to 59 mL/min); Severe renal&#xD;
             impairment (eGFR &gt;= 15 to 29 mL/min)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with moderate (optional Group 3) or severe (Group 2) renal impairment&#xD;
             must meet the following additional inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study:&#xD;
             Must have stable renal function, that is, no significant change in renal function as&#xD;
             evidenced by the (mean) screening serum creatinine value within plus minus (+ -) 25&#xD;
             percent (%) from the determination obtained at least 3 months prior to screening, and&#xD;
             expected to remain stable during the study, and not planning to initiate dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who: are on a vegetarian diet or who take creatine supplements, have a&#xD;
             non-standard muscle mass, such as, amputation, malnutrition, or muscle wasting,&#xD;
             because these factors are not accounted for in the prediction equations for glomerular&#xD;
             filtration rate (GFR)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donated blood or blood products or had substantial loss of blood (more than 500 mL)&#xD;
             within 3 months before the first administration of study drug or intention to donate&#xD;
             blood or blood products during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received an experimental drug or used an experimental medical device within 1 month or&#xD;
             within a period less than 5 times the drug's half-life, whichever is longer, before&#xD;
             study drug is scheduled&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to swallow solid, oral dosage forms whole with the aid of water (participants&#xD;
             may not chew, divide, dissolve, or crush the study drug)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with renal impairment (Cohort 2 and Cohort 3) have kidney failure,&#xD;
             requiring dialysis&#xD;
