    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-center Phase 0/2 study that will enroll up to 30 participants&#xD;
      with newly diagnosed (N=12) and recurrent glioblastoma (N=18). The trial will be composed of&#xD;
      a Phase 0 component (subdivided into Arm A, Arm B, and Arm C), and an Exploratory Phase 2&#xD;
      component. Participants with tumors demonstrating a PK response in the Phase 0 component of&#xD;
      the study will graduate to an exploratory Phase 2 component that combines therapeutic dosing&#xD;
      of pamiparib plus fractionated radiotherapy (for unmethylated MGMT promoter newly-diagnosed&#xD;
      cases), pamiparib plus fractionated radiotherapy (for recurrent cases) or Olaparib plus&#xD;
      fractionated radiotherapy (recurrent cases).&#xD;
