  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As of last year, new insight into the function of secretin was brought about as rodent&#xD;
      studies showed secretin to possess potential body weight-regulating effects. In these&#xD;
      studies, secretin was shown to increase non-shivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue&#xD;
      (BAT), decrease meal size and promote meal discontinuation. The mechanisms behind these&#xD;
      regulatory effect of secretin on energy homeostasis are unclear,&#xD;

      Secretin was - as the first hormone - identified in 19021, but was not isolated until the&#xD;
      1960s. Secretin is produced in and secreted form small intestinal S cells. In the 1970s, the&#xD;
      primary endocrine effects of secretin were unequivocally confirmed, namely potentiation of&#xD;
      bicarbonate and pepsin secretion from the pancreas as well as stimulation of bile production&#xD;
      in the liver. In the 1990s, the biosynthesis of secretin was delineated and its receptor was&#xD;
      discovered. In the 2000s the pancreatic regulation of intestinal pH was shown to be&#xD;
      secretin-mediated. As of last year, new insight into the function of secretin was brought&#xD;
      about as rodent studies showed secretin to possess potential body weight-regulating effects.&#xD;
      In these studies, secretin was shown to increase non-shivering thermogenesis in brown adipose&#xD;
      tissue (BAT), decrease meal size and promote meal discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a 5-hour intravenous infusion with&#xD;
      the naturally occurring hormone secretin on ad libitum food intake (primary endpoint)&#xD;
      compared to a double-blinded placebo (isotonic saline) infusion in 25 healthy young males.&#xD;
