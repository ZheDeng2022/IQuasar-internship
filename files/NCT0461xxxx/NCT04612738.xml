  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compared to the general population, individuals from underserved communities are more likely&#xD;
      to receive low quality end-of-life care and unwanted, costly and burdensome treatments due in&#xD;
      part to a lack of advance care planning (ACP; the process of discussing wishes for&#xD;
      end-of-life care with loved ones/clinicians and documenting them in advance directives).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use existing, trusted, and respected social networks to evaluate two&#xD;
      conversation-based tools intended to engage underserved individuals in discussions about&#xD;
      end-of-life issue and motivate them to carry out ACP behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through this study, investigators will learn how best to engage underserved populations in&#xD;
      ACP so as to: 1) increase the likelihood that patients from underserved communities will&#xD;
      receive high-quality end-of-life care; 2) address health disparities related to end-of-life&#xD;
      treatments; and 3) reduce unnecessary suffering for patients and their families.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall project goal of this 3-armed cluster, randomized control trial in underserved,&#xD;
      diverse communities is to determine whether playing a serious conversation game called Hello&#xD;
      is more effective than other advance care planning (ACP) approaches, or usual care (i.e.,&#xD;
      simply distributing an advance directive [AD]). The investigators will randomize 75&#xD;
      underserved communities across the US. The primary outcome is completion of a visually&#xD;
      verified AD; secondary outcomes include performance of other ACP behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many Black/African Americans and Latina/Latino patients are more likely to receive low&#xD;
      quality end-of- life medical care than White individuals- in fact, they are 3 times more&#xD;
      likely than white Americans to die after a lengthy intensive care unit stay. Advance care&#xD;
      planning (ACP)- the process of discussing one's wishes with loved ones and clinicians, and&#xD;
      then documenting them in an advance directive (AD)- can help reduce these health inequities&#xD;
      by preventing costly/burdensome treatments that are unlikely to reduce suffering or improve&#xD;
      quality of life. Though ~60% of Americans engage in ACP, &lt;25% of underserved populations have&#xD;
      done so- in large part due to distrust of the healthcare system/clinicians, and reluctance to&#xD;
      discuss death and dying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study leverages underserved communities' existing, trusted social networks to deploy two&#xD;
      community-based ACP interventions and study their mechanisms of action. By identifying which&#xD;
      interventions increase engagement in ACP in underserved communities (and why), this project&#xD;
      will help improve quality of end-of-life care, reduce unnecessary suffering, and end-of-life&#xD;
      healthcare costs which conserves public health resources.&#xD;

    <description>The 'Hello' game is a commercially available serious game that consists of 32 questions prompting players to share their values, goals, and beliefs about end-of-life issues. The game is played with 4 - 5 players, with each receiving a game booklet and chips. A play reads the first question in the book. Then each player writes down their answers individually and takes turns sharing their answers with the group. Players control what they share, how long they share and when to move to the next questions. During the conversation, plays can acknowledge others for a thoughtful, poignant or even funny comments by giving them a chip. A pre-game coin flip determines whether the player with the most chips wins the game (heads) or player with the least chips win (tails) the game.&#xD;

    <description>The CP Starter Kit is one of the most widely promoted and disseminated ACP tools nationwide, is available for free online, and does not require a healthcare professional for use. Like 'Hello', it is intended to help individuals have end-of-life conversations with loved ones. The 11-page workbook has open- ended prompts to consider one's values and preferences for end-of-life care, who to talk with about one's wishes, and suggestions on how to do so. It also prompts participants to rank priorities on a 5-point scale (e.g., What are your concerns about treatment? 1= I'm worried I won't get enough care, 5= I'm worried I'll get overly aggressive care). The CP website provides resources for running a community event using the 'CP Starter Kit', including a 23-page manual, &quot;Coaching the Conversation- A Guide to Facilitating Conversation Groups,&quot; with details on hosting a community-based program.</description>
