  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neck pain is second largest cause of disability worldwide. Chronic neck pain prevalence is&#xD;
      14% which is somewhat higher in females as compared to males. In India reported prevalence is&#xD;
      6%. Therapeutically, neck pain is managed by physiotherapists using rest, stretching and&#xD;
      strengthening exercises, educating patient, and intense proprioception and positional&#xD;
      exercises.&#xD;

      To determine the evidences for the efficacy of SNAGs in the Management of Mechanical Neck&#xD;
      Pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 patients [Age group 25-45 yrs] who were diagnosed with neck pain, with onset ˃1-3 months&#xD;
      (chronic) were randomly assigned to group A receiving conventional Physiotherapy plus SNAGs&#xD;
      and group B receiving conventional Physiotherapy plus ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in-group A that received conventional Physiotherapy plus SNAGs showed greater&#xD;
      Improvement in pain and range of motion compared with the conventional Physiotherapy plus&#xD;
      ultrasound group on 2nd week compared with pretreatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The result of study suggests that both SNAGs and Ultrasound groups improves the symptoms of&#xD;
      neck pain. Ultrasound group improved the pain symptoms but was too small to reach&#xD;
      satisfactory outcome for patients. Based on these results conventional Physiotherapy plus&#xD;
      SNAGs should be the treatment of choice for neck pain rather than conventional Physiotherapy&#xD;
      plus Ultrasound .&#xD;

    <measure>Visual analog scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analog scale is a subjective outcome measurement where patients judge the intensity of their pain on a scale of 0-10, which is in the form of a 10cm straight line. On this 0-10 scale, zero denotes no pain and ten denotes severe pain intensity.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck Range of motion</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Range of motion of the cervical spine measured by bubble inclinometer. It consists of a 360-degree scale with a fluid filled circular tube containing a small air bubble. It is a gravity dependent Goniometer, which uses the gravity's effect on fluid level to measure joint position and motion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Neck disability Index contains 10 items, seven related to activities of daily living, two related to pain, and one item related to concentration. Each item is scored ranging from 0 (no pain or disability) to 5 (severe pain and disability); and the total score is expressed as a percentage, with higher scores corresponding to greater disability.</description>
