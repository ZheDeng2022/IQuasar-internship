  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab (an&#xD;
      engineered anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-1] antibody) plus chemotherapy vs placebo plus&#xD;
      chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy in participants with triple negative breast cancer&#xD;
      (TNBC). Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Arm A (camrelizumab +chemotherapy)&#xD;
      or Arm B (placebo + chemotherapy).&#xD;
