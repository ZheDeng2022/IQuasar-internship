  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      background Hallux valgus (HV) is a common forefoot disorder in need of surgical intervention&#xD;
      after failed conservative treatment. Surgical treatment of HV generally includes different&#xD;
      kinds of osteotomy in combination with different distal soft tissue procedures (DSTP).&#xD;
      Commonly used DSTP are open first-web lateral release, transarticular lateral release (TALR),&#xD;
      and percutaneous lateral release (PCLR). In some studies, TALR showed similar surgical&#xD;
      outcomes with open first-web space lateral release. Besides, PCLR has been described with&#xD;
      satisfactory outcomes. TALR and PCLR are gaining popularity due to their less invasive&#xD;
      approach and potential in combination with a distal metatarsal Chevron osteotomy (DMCO).&#xD;
      Currently, there is no study comparing the surgical results between TALR and PCLR for&#xD;
      surgical reconstruction of HV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The aim of this prospective randomized trial is to compare the surgical outcomes of TALR&#xD;
      versus PCLR, both in combination of DMCO, for the treatment of HV. Our hypothesis is that&#xD;
      TALR would achieve a better surgical outcomes than PCLR.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted from January, 2021 to December, 2024. A total of 140&#xD;
      participants are included with 70 participants in each group. Participants are allocated to&#xD;
      TALR or PCLR group before index surgery according to a computer-generated randomization list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all patients, after regional nerve block and adequate sedation, intraoperative stress&#xD;
      test is performed for flexibility of first metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ).6 The test is&#xD;
      confirmed with dorsoplantar fluoroscopy. Only the cases with negative results (passive&#xD;
      correction is not possible) are included. Then, a medial incision of 2.5-cm is made at distal&#xD;
      metatarsal head and a reverse L-shaped medial capsulotomy is made followed by TALR or PCLR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After TALR or PCLR, medial bunionectomy is performed. DMCO is made with the apex at distal&#xD;
      metatarsal neck and angle of 60 to 90 degrees. The metatarsal head is laterally moved and&#xD;
      fixed with one or 2 oblique headless compression screws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative followup The patients are followed up at two weeks for removal of stitches,&#xD;
      then 1-month, 2-month, 3-month, 6-months, 1-year, and annually after 1 year for radiographic&#xD;
      , functional assessments, and evaluation of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis for patient number With the assumption of mean HVA are 10 degrees for TALR&#xD;
      group and 15 degrees for PCLR group at final followup, and a standard deviation of 8 degrees&#xD;
      for both groups, the calculated effect size d is 0.625. In order to achieve the α error&#xD;
      probability of 0.05 and power of 0.95, 68 participants in each group are necessary with a&#xD;
      total of 136 participants in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis In the comparisons between TALR and PCLR groups, the independent two&#xD;
      samples t-test and the Mann-Whitney test are performed for normal and non-normal distributed&#xD;
      data respectively, and the Fisher's exact test is performed for categorical data. P-values&#xD;
      less than 0.05 is considered to be statistical significant. The statistical analyses are&#xD;
      performed by using SPSS 25.0 statistics software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical relevance&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the differences of surgical outcomes between TALR and PCLR. These results could&#xD;
           offer valuable information for foot and ankle surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If PCLR is not adequate to achieve satisfactory outcomes, the minimally invasive surgery&#xD;
           using PCLR for HV is not recommended.&#xD;
