  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The lives of more than 2 million Americans are affected by aphasia, an acquired language&#xD;
      impairment most commonly resulting from stroke that affects the ability to remember and&#xD;
      express words. The well-being of these individuals is affected not just by the loss of words&#xD;
      that is aphasia, but also the loss of friendships and opportunities for community engagement&#xD;
      in which the loss of words can result. This study evaluates an animal-assisted treatment, The&#xD;
      Persons with Aphasia Training Dogs (PATD) Program, designed to target the psychosocial&#xD;
      consequences of aphasia by training participants in positive reinforcement dog training&#xD;
      techniques that harness new skill learning and the advantages of interaction with family- or&#xD;
      shelter-dwelling dogs to increase confidence and social engagement to support participants in&#xD;
      living well with aphasia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our long-term goals are to evaluate the effectiveness of canine- assisted therapy for persons&#xD;
      with aphasia and to operationalize aphasia treatments targeting psychosocial consequences of&#xD;
      aphasia such that they may be implemented with fidelity across clinical settings. The overall&#xD;
      objective of this application is to determine the feasibility and impact of a canine-assisted&#xD;
      therapy program, the Persons with Aphasia Training Dogs (PATD) Program. This feasibility&#xD;
      study, a crucial first step toward our long-term goals, will evaluate participants' ability&#xD;
      to learn positive reinforcement dog training techniques, and provide data regarding the&#xD;
      impact of treatment with respect to feasibility metrics associated with recruitment,&#xD;
      retention, compliance, and importantly, program satisfaction/acceptability. The hypotheses&#xD;
      are that PWA are able to learn positive reinforcement techniques to apply to dog training and&#xD;
      that retention, compliance, and program satisfaction rates for this canine-assisted treatment&#xD;
      will be high, with program satisfaction linked to psychosocial benefits such as increased&#xD;
      self-confidence and social engagement for PWA. These hypotheses have been formulated on the&#xD;
      basis of the PI's funded work designing and implementing the PATD program for the MossRehab&#xD;
      Aphasia Center, as well as work in aphasia rehabilitation and canine-assisted interventions,&#xD;
      including those with persons with aphasia. Accomplishment of the overall objective of this&#xD;
      application will be achieved through this small-scale feasibility study aimed to garner&#xD;
      preliminary support for our hypotheses and provide data to inform design of a future,&#xD;
      large-scale clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Determine whether PWA, through participation in the PATD program, can learn&#xD;
      and implement positive reinforcement techniques to train dogs in basic obedience skills.&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: On program completion, PWA will be competent in using positive reinforcement&#xD;
      techniques, to independently cue a dog to complete a minimum of 4 (of 5) trained obedience&#xD;
      skills. To test this hypothesis, participants will be assessed using a PI-adapted version of&#xD;
      the Pet Partners© Animal-Handler Evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Define participant characteristics associated with recruitment, retention,&#xD;
      compliance and program acceptability/satisfaction relevant for determining PATD candidacy.&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: PWA will demonstrate high (above 80%) retention and compliance rates, and high&#xD;
      program satisfaction, including increases in self-reported ratings of psychosocial&#xD;
      well-being. To test this hypothesis, our primary outcome measure will be the Assessment of&#xD;
      Living with Aphasia, complemented by self-report of participants' PATD experience gathered&#xD;
      through an ALA-modeled qualitative spoken interview and a written, aphasia-friendly,&#xD;
      satisfaction survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accomplishment of the overall objective of this application will be achieved through this&#xD;
      small-scale, feasibility study aimed to garner preliminary support for our hypotheses and to&#xD;
      provide the foundation for a future, large-scale clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Determine whether PWA, through participation in the PATD program, can learn&#xD;
      and implement positive reinforcement techniques to train dogs in basic obedience skills.&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: On program completion, PWA will be competent in using positive reinforcement&#xD;
      techniques, to independently cue a dog to complete a minimum of 4 (of 5) trained obedience&#xD;
      skills. To test this hypothesis, program participants will be assessed using a PI-adapted&#xD;
      version of the Pet Partners© Animal-Handler Evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skills Training: In consultation with a certified professional dog trainer, the PATD program&#xD;
      was developed by the PI, a trained speech language-pathologist with eighteen years of&#xD;
      experience working with people with aphasia, who has spent more than ten years working with&#xD;
      shelter animals using positive reinforcement techniques. Participants enrolled in the PATD&#xD;
      program will engage in five once-weekly individual training sessions with the PI, either with&#xD;
      a family dog (PATD) or by volunteering at a local shelter, the Pennsylvania SPCA&#xD;
      (PATD-PSPCA). PATD-PSPCA participants will work only with dogs that have been evaluated by&#xD;
      PSPCA staff as appropriate for interaction with new volunteers. Each session will be&#xD;
      dedicated to one of five pre-determined, sequentially-presented, obedience skills (i.e.,&#xD;
      LOOK, TOUCH, SIT, STAY, COME). Training sessions will last approximately 75 minutes, with an&#xD;
      additional half hour allotted to the beginning of the first training session to review&#xD;
      principles of positive-reinforcement training. Subsequent sessions will begin with a brief&#xD;
      probe of the participant's skill in cueing the dog to perform the behavior trained the&#xD;
      previous week. Following the probe, sessions will continue with a review of that week's&#xD;
      lesson plan, after which the PI will model the first training step three times. After the&#xD;
      model has been provided, the participant will attempt the procedure, receiving instructive&#xD;
      feedback or reinforcement from the trainer. Instruction will proceed to the subsequent step&#xD;
      when the participant and dog have attained 5 successful trials at the current step. The same&#xD;
      demonstration procedure will be used at each subsequent step. Commands will be trained using&#xD;
      one hand gesture for each behavior. To mark behaviors, participants will use a clicker&#xD;
      attached to a wrist band, which can be hand-held or allowed to dangle for ease of use for&#xD;
      those with hemiplegia. Participants will have the option of introducing the verbal command,&#xD;
      but will not be required to do so. All participants will be asked to provide their dog with a&#xD;
      walk before training sessions to support the dog in being ready to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skills Practice: Participants will not be required to complete all steps for an obedience&#xD;
      skill in a single session, and will be encouraged to practice the skill with the dog for at&#xD;
      least 3 practice sessions over the course of the week. Practice will be used as a measure of&#xD;
      participant compliance. Each participant will be provided with a copy of the lesson plan and,&#xD;
      if interested, a video demonstrating the PI performing the target skill with her own dog.&#xD;
      Participants will also be provided with a training log to complete after each time they&#xD;
      practice over the course of the week. Using a nine-point visual analog scale adapted from the&#xD;
      Assessment of Living with Aphasia (ALA), participants will rate their own and the dog's&#xD;
      performance during each practice session. To facilitate responses on the log, participants&#xD;
      will be provided with a pictographic list of questions to consider in determining their&#xD;
      ratings (e.g., &quot;How many times did I have to cue the dog&quot;, &quot;Did I 'click' as soon as the dog&#xD;
      did what I asked?&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Define participant characteristics associated with recruitment, retention,&#xD;
      compliance and program acceptability/satisfaction relevant for determining PATD candidacy.&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: PWA will demonstrate high (above 80%) retention and compliance rates, and high&#xD;
      program satisfaction, including increases in self-reported ratings of psychosocial&#xD;
      well-being. To test this hypothesis, the primary outcome measure will be the Assessment of&#xD;
      Living with Aphasia, complemented by self-report of participants' PATD experience gathered&#xD;
      through an ALA-modeled qualitative spoken interview and a written, aphasia-friendly,&#xD;
      satisfaction survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility Metrics: Recruitment rates will be tracked appropriate to the creation of a&#xD;
      CONSORT flow diagram including: # contacted, # screened, # eligible (vs. ineligible), #&#xD;
      consented/enrolled (vs. declined). To evaluate further the size of the population that may&#xD;
      benefit from the treatment, participant screening will include surveying of interest in&#xD;
      interaction with dogs and in dog-related activities. Similarly, participant retention rates&#xD;
      will be tracked including: # completing baseline assessment, # completing immediate&#xD;
      post-treatment assessment, and # completing follow-up assessment. Participant withdrawals&#xD;
      will be tracked for whether initiated by researcher or participant. Participant compliance&#xD;
      rates will be tracked including # assessment and training sessions (relative to total&#xD;
      possible) completed, and # self-reported home practice sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measurement: The primary quantitative outcome measure of acceptability, the ALA, is a&#xD;
      pictographic self-report measure of quality of life developed to assess the impact of aphasia&#xD;
      on daily life. Questions address participants' perceptions of aphasia, their environment,&#xD;
      their relationships, their community engagement, experiences of self-confidence and respect,&#xD;
      and their progress toward &quot;living well with aphasia&quot;. Participants respond by pointing to a&#xD;
      visual analog scale, providing for quantification of responses, and rendering the tool&#xD;
      accessible to those with language impairment. Overall score and subdomain scores have&#xD;
      demonstrated acceptable-to-high test-retest reliability and internal consistency. To augment&#xD;
      standardized evaluation, the PI has developed a complementary interview, consistent with the&#xD;
      format of the ALA, to more specifically probe PATD participants' perceptions of the impact of&#xD;
      the training program. Participant narratives produced during the administration will be&#xD;
      supported using interviewing strategies appropriate for persons with aphasia. A written,&#xD;
      visual analog scale satisfaction survey designed to adhere to guidelines of&#xD;
      'aphasia-friendly' written materials will also be administered. It is anticipated that the&#xD;
      assessment battery will take two hours to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measurement/Participation Timeline: Participants will be randomized into immediate&#xD;
      and waitlist treatment groups using permuted block randomization with stratification.&#xD;
      Analysis between these two arms will be exploratory only in nature, and will inform us&#xD;
      regarding the feasibility of the waitlist control design for use in a larger clinical trial.&#xD;
      All participants will be evaluated before training begins, immediately following training,&#xD;
      and at a 3-month follow-up. Participants in the delayed arm will participate in two&#xD;
      pre-training evaluations, one immediately upon enrollment and one at the end of the delay&#xD;
      period immediately before beginning training.&#xD;
