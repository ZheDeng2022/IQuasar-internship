  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Strong evidence supports the association between high fiber (HiFi) diets (e.g. legumes, nuts,&#xD;
      vegetables) and a reduced risk for chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease (CVD),&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes and some forms of cancer. However, the current U.S. average consumption of&#xD;
      dietary fiber of 17g/day is significantly below the recommendation level of 25g/d for women&#xD;
      and 38g/d for men. Furthermore, fiber fermentation to produce short chain fatty acid (SCFA)&#xD;
      products and alterations in microbial composition and activity may be mechanisms linking a&#xD;
      HiFi diet to improved health. Importantly, much of the data, including findings supporting a&#xD;
      beneficial role of SCFA have been derived from animal studies. Human studies are now needed&#xD;
      to advance the understanding of the translational significance of rodent studies and the&#xD;
      potential benefit of fiber on microbial metabolites and cardiometabolic health, glucose&#xD;
      regulation, appetite and satiety. The central hypothesis is that that the mechanisms by which&#xD;
      dietary fiber provides metabolic benefit include direct physical effects in the upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract to slow nutrient absorption, and indirect effects to reduce food&#xD;
      intake mediated by SCFA-induced secretion of intestinal hormones resulting in increased&#xD;
      satiety. Design: Using fiber derived from peas, Aim 1 will test the effect of a HiFi diet on&#xD;
      appetite, satiety, and cardiometabolic health and whether elevated SCFA concentration&#xD;
      mediates improved satiety in 44 overweight/obese subjects randomly assigned to receive either&#xD;
      a high fiber or a low fiber dietary intervention for four weeks in a parallel arm-repeated&#xD;
      measures design. Aim 2 will quantitate the changes in microbial composition and colonic SCFA&#xD;
      production rate during HiFi feeding and whether any changes are potential mediators of&#xD;
      observed benefits on satiety and cardiometabolic risk factors in 26 subjects assigned to&#xD;
      receive a high fiber intervention for 3 weeks in a repeated measures design. Relevance: These&#xD;
      studies will significantly expand the understanding of mechanisms by which dietary fiber&#xD;
      improves satiety and cardiometabolic health in humans.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dietary patterns with high fiber content are linked to a lower risk for the development of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease [1-3], hypertension [4], type 2 diabetes [5] and increased body weight&#xD;
      [4]. Potential biological mechanisms that may mediate these beneficial health effects include&#xD;
      a slowing of the absorption of meal carbohydrate (CHO) [6-11], reduction in blood lipids&#xD;
      [8,12] and an increase in the release of satiety hormones [10,13]. The PI has previously&#xD;
      shown that compared to low-fiber (LowFi) meals, high-fiber (HiFi) meals reduced blood glucose&#xD;
      concentrations postprandially by 11% [14]. Another potential mechanism is a postulated role&#xD;
      for microbial fiber fermentation to improve health through production of the short chain&#xD;
      fatty acids (SCFA) acetate, propionate, and butyrate [15-17]. In addition to promoting colon&#xD;
      health, butyrate production may stimulate release of the gut hormones, glucagon-like&#xD;
      peptide-1 GLP-1 and peptide YY (PYY) [18] resulting in improved appetite regulation [19].&#xD;
      Since the seminal paper of Gordon in 2004 [20], a large body of research has uncovered the&#xD;
      critical role that gut microbes play in health. Importantly, much of these data, including&#xD;
      findings supporting a beneficial role of SCFA [21-23] have been derived from animal studies.&#xD;
      Human studies are now needed to advance the translational significance of rodent studies and&#xD;
      the potential benefit of fiber on microbial metabolites and cardiometabolic health, glucose&#xD;
      regulation, appetite and satiety. The current study will determine the effects of dietary&#xD;
      fiber intake on appetite, intestinal metabolism, and the microbiome. We hypothesize that the&#xD;
      mechanisms by which dietary fiber provides metabolic benefit include direct physical effects&#xD;
      in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract to slow nutrient absorption and indirect effects to&#xD;
      reduce food intake mediated by SCFA-induced secretion of GI hormones resulting in increased&#xD;
      satiety. To test this hypothesis, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of 4 weeks of&#xD;
      HiFi or LowFi diets in 44 subjects (specific aim 1, SA1) and also leverage a screening&#xD;
      colonoscopy to standardize baseline microbial populations for a 3-week, pre- and post HiFi&#xD;
      intervention study in 26 subjects (SA2) with metabolic syndrome. We will assess the effects&#xD;
      of the diets on appetite and satiety, cardiometabolic risk and intestinal metabolism at the&#xD;
      beginning and at the end of the feeding interventions. The fiber chosen is derived from peas,&#xD;
      as recent data suggest that legumes significantly improve glycemia [6,24-27], diabetes&#xD;
      [28,29], heart disease risk [30], and risk for obesity [31]. These methods will be employed&#xD;
      to accomplish two specific aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA1a: Test the effect of a HiFi diet on appetite and satiety and whether SCFA production&#xD;
      mediates improved satiety in HiFi feeding. Hypothesis (H) 1a: In adult men and women, the&#xD;
      HiFi (n=22) compared to the LowFi (n=22) diet will significantly improve markers of satiety&#xD;
      (GLP-1, PYY, subjective appetite ratings) and lower activation in brain regions that control&#xD;
      food intake/reward/appetite while increasing activation in executive control regions during&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) visual food cues. These changes will be related&#xD;
      to higher postprandial SCFA concentrations and altered microbial populations as evidenced by&#xD;
      greater bifidobacteria levels and low Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA1b: Determine whether a HiFi diet improves cardiometabolic health. H1b: A HiFi diet will&#xD;
      result in lower glycemia, blood lipids, blood pressure, and waist circumference compared to a&#xD;
      LowFi diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA2: Quantitate the changes in microbial composition and colonic SCFA production rate (using&#xD;
      stable isotopic infusion techniques) on HiFi diet feeding (n=26) and whether any changes are&#xD;
      potential mediators of observed benefits on satiety and cardiometabolic risk factors. H2: A&#xD;
      significant microbial species reduction will follow colonoscopy bowel prep, and repopulation&#xD;
      after HiFi will be characterized by greater bifidobacterial and low Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes&#xD;
      ratio. An increase in SCFA flux following HiFi will be associated with improvements in&#xD;
      microbial composition and postprandial markers of satiety and blood triglycerides and glucose&#xD;
      excursions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Based on our own published [14] and unpublished data, and that from others&#xD;
      [32-35], a power analysis revealed that a sample size of between 10 to 20 subjects/group is&#xD;
      needed to detect significant differences in key variables (alpha 0.05) and a power of 90% (15&#xD;
      to 18 subjects/group with 80% power). For specific aim 1, we will add 2 subjects/group to&#xD;
      account for a 10% subject dropout and for specific aim 2, we will add an additional 6&#xD;
      subjects to account for 30% dropout. Thus, for specific aim 1 44 subjects (22/group) and for&#xD;
      specific aim 2, 26 subjects are analyzed in a repeated-measures design. We believe any&#xD;
      dietary fiber effect smaller than past, published treatments will be balanced by the relative&#xD;
      'clean' starting point of the colon after colonoscopy (specific aim 2) and also by the fact&#xD;
      that we are providing all study meals and hence fully controlling the subject's intake&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed with SPSS software (version 25). Graphical methods are&#xD;
      used to assess the appropriateness of assuming linear relationships and histograms and&#xD;
      probability plots used to assess the normality of residuals. Transformation or non-parametric&#xD;
      methods will be, employed as needed. Fasting glucose and hormones concentrations will be,&#xD;
      obtained serially - both acutely after meals and in the fasting state before and after the&#xD;
      diets. Changes over time (treated as a nominal factor so as not to assume a linear trend) and&#xD;
      by diet in the composition of the microbiome will be assessed by grouping into the dominant&#xD;
      bacterial phyla (i.e. Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and&#xD;
      Tenericutes) and genus. For SA1, a two-factor ANOVA will be used for each outcome, with the&#xD;
      factors being Group, Time and the Group by Time interaction. The groups are constructed via&#xD;
      matched-sample randomization, so we expect comparability at baseline. For SA2, a paired&#xD;
      sample t-test will be used to compare outcomes of interest. Results will be reported as group&#xD;
      means or medians, as most appropriate for the data along with 95% confidence intervals for&#xD;
      the summary statistics. Analyses of the fMRI data during visual stimulation are performed&#xD;
      using Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 software (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). Data are&#xD;
      preprocessed, beginning with slice timing and realignment of the images to the mean image.&#xD;
      The anatomical T1-weighted image is co-registered to the mean functional image. Normalization&#xD;
      into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space and Gaussian spatial smoothing is then&#xD;
      performed. For each participant (first-level analyses), a general linear model is applied for&#xD;
      the high- and low-caloric food and non-food image conditions. For each condition, a separate&#xD;
      regressor is modeled by using a canonical hemodynamic response function that includes time&#xD;
      derivatives. Movement parameters are, modeled as confounders. For second level analysis, a&#xD;
      mixed model ANOVA is used, with the within-factor, image condition (high calorie food, low&#xD;
      calorie food, non-food|) and the between-factor group (HiFi vs LowFi). A priori&#xD;
      regions-of-interest (ROIs) such as, insula, orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, and prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex are examined for potential group-by-food image interactions (the effect of most&#xD;
      interest). Whole-brain analyses are also conducted (corrected for multiple comparisons) to&#xD;
      identify other potential ROIs.&#xD;
