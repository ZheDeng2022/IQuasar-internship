  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a concept increasingly consolidated by clinical evidence that at each&#xD;
      hospitalization due to HF decompensation there is a substantial loss of quality of life,&#xD;
      which is associated with an initial period of great clinical vulnerability, with high rates&#xD;
      of rehospitalization and an increased risk of death. The non-pharmacological measures that&#xD;
      are widely practiced and recommended for HF patients, such as fluid restriction, specially at&#xD;
      the first 30 days after hospital discharge, still lack clearer evidence of their therapeutic&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The need for hospitalization is an important marker of poor prognosis in patients with heart&#xD;
      failure. It is estimated that 25% of patients presenting with acute heart failure are&#xD;
      readmitted within 30 days. The maintenance of signs and symptoms of congestion at hospital&#xD;
      discharge are common causes of hospital readmission. Thus, the reduction of these signs is a&#xD;
      goal to be reached during hospitalization so that the chances of readmission are reduced.&#xD;
      However, there is evidence that approximately ¼ of the patients are released despite&#xD;
      persisting signs of congestive symptoms. It seems plausible to speculate that patients with&#xD;
      HF at higher risk of rehospitalization would be those with the greatest chance of benefiting&#xD;
      from therapeutic strategies that seek to reduce the congestive state, such as fluid&#xD;
      restriction. In this scenario of initial vulnerability after hospitalization for acutely&#xD;
      decompensated HF, recent studies have demonstrated a correlation in the number of B lines in&#xD;
      the pulmonary ultrasound of patients at the time of hospital discharge and the prediction of&#xD;
      frequent clinical outcomes. It was observed that the presence of pattern B, defined as the&#xD;
      presence of more than 3 B lines in at least 2 pulmonary fields bilaterally, was associated&#xD;
      with a worse prognosis (mortality from all causes and hospitalization due to decompensation).&#xD;
      The present study, therefore, will evaluate the effect of outpatient fluid restriction on&#xD;
      levels of NT-proBNP in patients who remain with signs of congestion based on pulmonary&#xD;
      ultrasound at the bedside during hospital discharge.&#xD;
