  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venetoclax is a treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute myeloid leukemia&#xD;
      (AML). However, the pharmacokinetic data in Chinese population, as well as the change of&#xD;
      venetoclax plasma concentration while taking CYP enzyme inducers or inhibitors, remained&#xD;
      unknown so far. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      characteristics of venetoclax.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Venetoclax has been approved in combination with azacitidine or decitabine or low-dose&#xD;
      cytarabine for the treatment of newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in adults who&#xD;
      are age 75 years or older, or who have comorbidities that preclude use of intensive induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy. There are several clinical trials of Venetoclax for the treatment of AML. In&#xD;
      trial M14-358 (NCT02203773), 91% of the combination of venetoclax and azacitidine were&#xD;
      Caucasian, while about 87% of the the combination of Venetoclax and decitabine were&#xD;
      Caucasian. In another trial M14-387 (NCT02287233), up to 94.9% of the combination of&#xD;
      venetoclax and low-dose cytarabine group were Caucasian. However, the actual proportion of&#xD;
      Asian or other races is unknown in both trials. Therefore, there is not enough data from&#xD;
      Chinese other Asian races regarding its efficacy or adverse reactions in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a venetoclax population pharmacokinetic study published in 2016, which&#xD;
      integrated 505 subjects from 8 clinical trials, concluded that race was not a covariate that&#xD;
      affect venetoclax PK. However, only 6 Asians (1.19%) were included, and most of the subjects&#xD;
      were chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) or non-Hodgkin's&#xD;
      lymphoma (NHL), and the results may not be directly generalized to AML patients. The&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of Venetoclax is affected by many factors, and the most influential factors&#xD;
      may be fat content from dietary and concomitant use of CYP3A inhibitors or inducers. In&#xD;
      particular, patients with hematological malignancies often require antifungal agents (such as&#xD;
      voriconazole, posaconazole) as prophylaxis or treatment of fungal infections during&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Therefore, these two factors will be considered in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common side effect after using venetoclax is cytopenia. About 40% of patients&#xD;
      developed severe neutropenia, 4.7% required interruption of treatment, and 3.7% required&#xD;
      dosage reduction in phase 2 clinical trials. Although no patient requires permanent&#xD;
      venetoclax treatment discontinuation because of neutropenia, 9% of patients need to&#xD;
      discontinue venetoclax treatment due to infection. The incidence of severe thrombocytopenia&#xD;
      and anemia is 18% and 15%. Recent studies have found that the incidence of neutropenia and&#xD;
      infection seems to be inversely related to the blood concentration of venetoclax, that is,&#xD;
      the higher the blood concentration of venetoclax, the lower the incidence of neutropenia and&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study is designed to examine the plasma concentration of venetoclax in&#xD;
      patients with CLL or AML, to create a pharmacokinetic model of venetoclax in Chinese&#xD;
      population, and to analyze the extent to which CYP enzyme inhibitors and inducers may have&#xD;
      effect on venetoclax plasma concentration. Moreover, the association between therapeutic&#xD;
      effectiveness, adverse events, and venetoclax plasma concentration will also be analyzed in&#xD;
      this study, and the final purpose is to establish the principle of clinical dose adjustment&#xD;
      in the future.&#xD;
