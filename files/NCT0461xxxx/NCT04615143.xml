  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-arm phase II clinical trial aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Tislelizumab as neoadjuvant treatment for resectable RHCC patients&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients have about 70% of 5-year recurrence rate after&#xD;
      curative treatment. Only 30% of recurrent HCC (RHCC) patients are resectable when diagnosed.&#xD;
      Neoadjuvant treatment may reduce tumor burden and recurrence rate after surgery for RHCC&#xD;
      patients. Immune treatment, like PD-1 inhibitors, have already been reported effective in&#xD;
      advanced HCC patients as first-line therapy and in several early-stage solid tumors as&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy. According to several preclinical results, immune infiltration and the&#xD;
      expression of PD-1 was higher in RHCC tumors than paired primary tumors. So, we designed this&#xD;
      single-arm phase II clinical trial to explore the efficacy and safety of Tislelizumab (PD-1&#xD;
      inhibitor) as neoadjuvant treatment for resectable RHCC patients.&#xD;

    <description>Patients receive Tislelizumab on week 1 and week 4 (200mg, iv, q3w). After 2 cycles of Tislelizumab and evaluation of resectability, patients will receive surgery in 7 weeks after enrollment. Patients will receive Tislelizumab for 1 year (200mg, iv, q3w, 17 cycles) in 4-6 weeks after surgery.</description>
