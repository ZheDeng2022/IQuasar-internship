  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone anchored hearing aids provide a hearing solution for patients that are unable to wear&#xD;
      traditional air conduction hearing aid solutions. The technology of the devices has developed&#xD;
      significantly over the last 510 years and patients are gaining access to their sound&#xD;
      processor at a much earlier stage than when first brought onto the market. Despite this the&#xD;
      investigators feel there is still room to develop this and with the new abutments with&#xD;
      specialised hydroxyapatite coating it is hoped that patients can be loaded with their sound&#xD;
      processor in the day of surgery. This study will compare abutment stability between two&#xD;
      groups of patients. Those loaded immediately with their sound processor and those loaded&#xD;
      traditionally at 2 weeks post operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At routine followup appointments patients will have the stability of their abutment checked&#xD;
      and the investigators will compare to see if loading earlier had any detrimental effects on&#xD;
      osteointegration and the stability of the abutment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the favourable outcomes and high stability record for the BA400 it is anticipated&#xD;
      that the time to processor fitting may be further reduced, provided favourable bone&#xD;
      conditions at the implant site and provided satisfactory soft tissue status at the time of&#xD;
      loading. It is hypothesised that loading immediately at the time of surgery is possible with&#xD;
      comparable short and long term outcomes when compared to standard loading at 2 weeks&#xD;
