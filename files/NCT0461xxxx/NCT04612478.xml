    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness and value of clinic-based physical&#xD;
      therapy (PT) and a home-based, self-directed exercise program (SDEP). The home exercise&#xD;
      program will be developed by a team of physical therapists, orthopaedic trauma surgeons and&#xD;
      experts in rehabilitation engagement in collaboration with patients recovering from traumatic&#xD;
      lower-extremity injuries. The study will also determine which subgroups of individuals based&#xD;
      on patient and injury characteristics are the best candidates for a home exercise program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is little clinical debate that patients with multiple extremity injuries or injuries&#xD;
      with associated complex soft tissue damage or nerve deficits benefit from supervised PT.&#xD;
      Prior research from the LEAP Study examined the impact of PT on patients with high energy&#xD;
      trauma injuries below the distal femur.1 While the surgeons and PTs differed in their&#xD;
      assessment of perceived need for PT,2,3 evidence demonstrates the beneficial effect of PT for&#xD;
      this patient population.4 Research on combat-related lower extremity limb salvage patients&#xD;
      showed a significant benefit and a higher return-to-duty rate following intense and focused&#xD;
      rehabilitation combined with an integrated orthotic.5-7 However, the majority of lower&#xD;
      extremity fractures seen in the military and civilian sectors are not combat related or of&#xD;
      the severity of the Lower Extremity Assessment Project (LEAP) limb salvage patients and, thus&#xD;
      may not require intensive, clinic-based, supervised PT treatment. Patients with isolated&#xD;
      major lower extremity fractures may benefit from a self-guided, home-based post-injury&#xD;
      exercise program. Studies evaluating home exercise programs for elective orthopaedic&#xD;
      reconstruction surgery for joint replacement and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL&#xD;
      )reconstruction have reported equivalent outcomes compared to in-person, supervised PT.8-12&#xD;
      Because PT resources are critical, limited, and expensive in most civilian centers,&#xD;
      identifying the patients who would most benefit from utilizing these resources could result&#xD;
      in savings for both the patients and the health care systems, and lead to more efficient&#xD;
      access to PT services by the population who needs them the most. In addition to health&#xD;
      systems benefits, patients able to achieve positive outcomes through a home-based,&#xD;
      self-directed exercise program would experience flexibility regarding when the exercises are&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness and value of clinic-based PT and a&#xD;
      home-based, self-directed exercise program (SDEP). The home exercise program will be&#xD;
      developed by a team of physical therapists, orthopaedic trauma surgeons and experts in&#xD;
      rehabilitation engagement in collaboration with patients recovering from traumatic&#xD;
      lower-extremity injuries. The study will also determine which subgroups of individuals based&#xD;
      on patient and injury characteristics are the best candidates for a home exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The overall hypothesis is that return to work/major activities as well as&#xD;
      clinical and functional outcomes and health-related quality of life for patients who receive&#xD;
      clinic-based PT will be similar to patients receiving SDEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To compare the effectiveness of SDEP, exercise instructions given by&#xD;
      physician and clinic-based PT for improving return to work/major activities, clinical and&#xD;
      functional/performance outcomes and health-related quality of life in patients following&#xD;
      selected lower-extremity fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine which sub-groups of patients, based on patient and injury&#xD;
      characteristics, are most likely to benefit from SDEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To compare the cost-effectiveness of clinic-based PT and SDEP&#xD;
&#xD;
