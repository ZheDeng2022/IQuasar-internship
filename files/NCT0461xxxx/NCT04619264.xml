  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the study was to compare the effect of chemo-mechanical caries removal methods using&#xD;
      Papacarie-Duo and alternative restorative treatment (ART) on the Oral Health Related Quality&#xD;
      of Life (OHRQoL) of pregnant women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted in 2019 and included 162 pregnant women&#xD;
      visiting family health centers in Alexandria, Egypt with mild to moderate dental pain due to&#xD;
      caries. Participants were randomly assigned into Papacarie-Dup group (n=82) and ART group&#xD;
      (n=80). The outcome variable was percent change in OHRQoL measured by OHIP-14.&#xD;

    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This was assessed by measuring changes between the Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14). The OHIP-14 includes 14 questions in seven dimensions with two questions for each dimension: functional limitation, physical pain, psychological discomfort, physical disability, psychological disability, social disability and handicap. Responses to the OHIP-14 items were measured on a 5-pont Likert scale ranging from never = 0; hardly ever = 1; occasionally = 2; fairly often = 3; to very often = 4. The OHIP-14 score is the sum of the scores of the 14 statements and ranges from 0 to 56 and from 0 to 8 for each dimension with higher scores indicating higher frequency of negative impact.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Retention of the final restoration</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The scoring system was as follows: 0=present, without defect; 1=present, small defects on the margin measuring less than 0.5 mm in depth, with no need for repair; 2=present, small defects on the margin measuring 0.5 to 1.0 mm in depth, with need for repair; 3=present, gross defects on the margin measuring 1.0 mm or more in depth, with need for repair; 4=absent, restoration completely lost, need for treatment; 5=absent, other treatment had been performed for some reason; 6=tooth absent for some reason; 7=present, wear on surface less than 0.5 mm, with no need for replacement; 8=present, wear on surface greater than 0.5 mm, with need for replacement; 9=diagnosis impossible. Restorations having a score of 0, 1 or 7 were considered successful and those receiving a score of 2, 3, 4 or 8 were considered failures.</description>

    <description>First, tooth was cleaned with a wet cotton pellet. The gel was inserted using disposable syringe tip into the cavity and its color changed from clear to cloudy indicating the presence of infected tissues. After 40 seconds, the softened carious tissue was removed using excavator by gentle pressure. The remaining gel was removed with a cotton pellet. The procedure was repeated until there was no change in the gel color indicating that there was no more infected tissue.</description>

    <description>The tooth was cleaned with a wet cotton pellet to remove debris and plaque and then isolated with cotton rolls to promote a dry environment. Caries was removed using a sharp excavator and the cavity was cleaned using a small wet cotton pellet and dried with a dry cotton pellet.</description>
