  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about the dynamic change of human microbiome in different body sites&#xD;
      including skin, mouth and gut during sailing. The present study aims to reveal the change of&#xD;
      human microbiome in response to the sailing environment in a 1-month period, and its&#xD;
      implication for human health.&#xD;

      This study will recruit a number of participants who are going to sail for mariana trench&#xD;
      from Shenzhen, China. Characteristics of the participants will be described by a series of&#xD;
      index of stool, urine, skin microbiota and tongue coating. All the biospecimen will be&#xD;
      collected before and during the voyage. Stool at the 2nd, the 4th and the 12th week after the&#xD;
      voyage and blood sample at the baseline will also be collected. Participants' mood states,&#xD;
      health-related quality of life, fatigue score and sleep quality will be investigated with&#xD;
      questionnaires throughout the 1-month period. Participants are asked to record diseases and&#xD;
      symptoms, if any, when sailing. All the data will be used to analyse how microbiota change&#xD;
      and be involved in human health during a voyage.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gut microbial abundant change</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, day 10, day 16, day 23, day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Gut microbial communities and their abundant features will be analysed based on shotgun metagenomic sequencing.</description>

    <measure>Tongue coating microbial abundant change</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, day 10, day 16, day 23, day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Tongue coating microbial communities and their abundant features will be analysed based on shotgun metagenomic sequencing.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mood states change over 4 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, day 10, day 16, day 23, day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Transient, fluctuating feelings, and enduring affect states will be assessed by the Profile of Mood States-Short Form (POMS-SF) . POMS-SF contains 30 questions that assess the following seven different moods: anger-hostility (AH), confusion-bewilderment (CB), depression-dejection (DD), fatigue-inertia (FI), tension-anxiety (TA), vigoractivity (VA), and friendliness (F). Total mood disturbance (TMD) scores were calculated based on the previous seven factors. High scores for VA and F indicate a positive mood state, while high scores for AH, CB, DD, FI, TA, and TMD indicate a negative mood state.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health-related quality of life change over the one-month sailing</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life will be assessed by the Short-Form 36 Health Status Questionnaire（SF-36). It contains eight subscales scoring from 0 to 100 points for each, with higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep quality change over the one-month sailing</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, day 30</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index （PSQI）will be used to assess sleep quality. It comprises 19 items for self-reported sleep quality in the last month and five additional questions to be answered by roommates, if applicable. The 19 items are grouped into seven component scores: sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, efficiency of habitual sleep, sleep disturbance, use of sleep medication, and diurnal dysfunction. These are then added to a global PSQI score. The PSQI score ranges from 0 to 21, with a higher score indicative of poorer sleep quality.</description>

    <measure>Short-chain fatty acids change</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, day 10, day 16, day 23, day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Short-chain fatty acids will be analysed by performing liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/Q-TOF/MS).</description>

    <measure>Weight change</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, day 10, day 16, day 23, day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Weight will be described by kilogram.</description>

    <measure>Blood pressure change</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, day 10, day 16, day 23, day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Systolic pressure and diastolic pressure will be measured and described by mmHg.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue score change</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, day 10, day 16, day 23, day 30</time_frame>
    <description>The Multi-dimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20) will be used to measure aspects of fatigue experienced during the previous days. It consists of five subscales of fatigue: general fatigue (GF), physical fatigue (PF), re-duced motivation (RM), reduced activity (RA), and mental fatigue (MF). The score ranges from 20 to 100. Higher scores indicate a higher degree of fatigue.</description>
