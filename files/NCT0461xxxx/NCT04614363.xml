  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center, open-label pilot study of 68GA-PSMA-11 given at a&#xD;
      single time prior to PET/CT imaging in men with localized high risk prostate cancer or&#xD;
      biochemical recurrence. The imaging agent (68 Ga-PSMA 11 will be administered on an&#xD;
      outpatient basis. It will be administered prior to the PET/CT imaging. The objective is to&#xD;
      evaluate the distribution of 68GA-PSMA-11 in tissues and to determine if this alters the&#xD;
      planned clinical management.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open label, single-center, single-arm, pilot diagnostic accuracy study&#xD;
      to evaluate the tissue distribution of 68Ga-PSMA Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/CT in 80&#xD;
      patients with high risk localized prostate cancer or biochemical recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a single IV dose of 3-7 mCi of 68Ga-PSMA (study drug) followed by&#xD;
      PET/CT imaging 60-90 minutes after injection. All patients will be closely monitored with&#xD;
      vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate), before and 2 hours following radiotracer&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a phone call 2 days following PET/CT to assess for adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To minimize bias, all PET/CT images will be interpreted by a board-certified radiologist. The&#xD;
      radiologist evaluating the images will be blinded to the final outcome, such as the&#xD;
      histopathology of any biopsies and the outcome of subsequent imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with study-defined high-risk features who are eligible and scheduled for radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy will undergo 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT injection. The results of the 68Ga-PSMA-11&#xD;
      PET/CT may alter patient management in one of several ways, including the decision to not&#xD;
      pursue surgical extirpation (e.g. in the event of extensive distant metastasis) in favor of&#xD;
      systemic therapy. It is also possible that the extent of surgical resection may be altered,&#xD;
      such as non-regional pelvic or retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. The alteration in&#xD;
      planned surgical treatment from standard of care will be recorded as a secondary-end point.&#xD;
