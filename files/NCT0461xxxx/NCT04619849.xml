  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the most important causes of carpal tunnel syndrome is increased pressure in the&#xD;
      canal. With the loading of the palmaris longus at 20 degrees of wrist extension, the pressure&#xD;
      within the canal increases more than the load exerted on other flexor tendons. Several&#xD;
      studies have shown the association of carpal tunnel syndrome with the presence of palmaris&#xD;
      longus. In this study, our aim is to investigate how the presence or absence of palmaris&#xD;
      longus changes EMG measurements in the median nerve. Individuals with a diagnosis of carpal&#xD;
      tunnel syndrome or entrapment neuropathy will be given the Schaffer test, a standardized test&#xD;
      to test the presence of the palmaris longus muscle. The result will be noted, EMG examination&#xD;
      will be requested and the electrophysiological properties of the median nerve will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;

      One of the most important causes of carpal tunnel syndrome(CTS) is the pressure increase in&#xD;
      the canal. With the loading of the palmaris longus at 20 degrees of wrist extension, the&#xD;
      pressure within the canal increases more than the load exerted on other flexor tendons.&#xD;
      Several studies have shown the association of carpal tunnel syndrome with the presence of&#xD;
      palmaris longus. Our aim in this study is to investigate how the presence or absence of the&#xD;
      palmaris longus changes the EMG measurements in the median nerve. Individuals with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome or entrapment neuropathy will be given the Schaffer test,&#xD;
      a standardized test to test the presence of the palmaris longus muscle. The result will be&#xD;
      noted, EMG examination will be requested, and the electrophysiological properties of the&#xD;
      median nerve will be recorded. If the Schaffer test that detects the presence of palmaris&#xD;
      longus is negative, 4 different tests that will prove the absence of palmaris longus will be&#xD;
      performed by the same practitioner. These 4 tests are Thompson's test, Mishra's test I,&#xD;
      Mishra's test II and Pushpakumar's &quot;two-finger sign&quot; method. Routine median nerve conduction&#xD;
      studies are valuable in CTS. Prolonged distal latency in motor and sensory nerves can be&#xD;
      found in most cases of CTS. If routine studies are insufficient, more sensitive methods are&#xD;
      needed. These; Comparison of mixed latencies in the wrist recording of the sensory responses&#xD;
      of the median and ulnar nerves with palmar stimulation, median and ulnar sensory latencies&#xD;
      with orthodromic or antidromic recording from the 4th finger, median and ulnar motor&#xD;
      latencies with recording from the second lumbrical and second interosseous muscle, median and&#xD;
      radial sensory latencies with thumb recording It is based on determining the compression&#xD;
      point by centrifugation method by performing segmental sensory nerve conduction examination.&#xD;
