    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether the MiniMed 780G AHCL system&#xD;
      improves glycemic control and Quality of Life (QoL) perception in adult individuals with T1D&#xD;
      and naïve to CSII and CGM technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is a two-centers, randomized controlled, parallel group study. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed up during approximatively 3 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent advances in insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices, and control&#xD;
      algorithms have resulted in an acceleration of progress in the development of the automated&#xD;
      systems of insulin delivery including hybrid closed loop (HCL) systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial studies on the MiniMed 670G system, the first HCL system approved, have reported&#xD;
      increased glycemic control in both adults and pediatrics, having experience with insulin pump&#xD;
      therapy with or without experience of CGM technology. More recently it was shown shown even&#xD;
      further improvement in glycemic control with the 670G system, in children and adolescents&#xD;
      naïve to both pump and CGM technologies. This may be, at least partially, due to lack of&#xD;
      willingness of patients to &quot;let the algorithm work&quot; based on their previous experience with&#xD;
      CSII and CGM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to evaluate the impact of an Advanced Hybrid Closed Loop (AHCL) system&#xD;
      in adults naïve to pump and CGM technology. For this purpose the investigators target the&#xD;
      population of T1DM individuals who are older than 26 years. The study will be conducted in&#xD;
      Poland, where only individuals under the age of 26 are entitled to CSII/CGM reimbursement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the study succeeds in terms of improved glycemic patterns, quality of life and patients'&#xD;
      acceptance, it may provide evidence for consideration in CSII/CGM reimbursement for this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Devices usage in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Envision Pro device (CE-marked) will be used to collect CGM data in a retrospective manner.&#xD;
      Envision Pro records up to 6 days of data. Patients will wear 2 consecutive Envision Pro&#xD;
      devices both during the run-in phase and the at the end of the study phase, i.e. up to 12&#xD;
      days of data. The first Envision Pro device will be placed in the hospital and the second&#xD;
      Envision Pro device will be placed by the patient at home, assisted by the study staff on the&#xD;
      phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, patients from the AHCL group will use the MiniMed 780G AHCL system (CE-marked).&#xD;
      The AHCL system will be initiated first in Manual Mode (i.e. without AHCL control) with&#xD;
      suspend before low feature. In short, the protocol inputs the current insulin program (MDI)&#xD;
      and calculates a 10-20% reduction in total daily dose, with a 40/60 basal/bolus distribution&#xD;
      in four or five basal rates. Insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio (ICR) settings utilize the formula&#xD;
      of 300-450/total daily dose (TDD) and the formula of 90-110/TDD (mmol/L) with two CF&#xD;
      settings; the nighttime CF factor is set 10-20% higher than the daytime CF. Active insulin is&#xD;
      set time (3 h); suspend before low feature is turned on with a threshold of 3.0-3.8 mmol/L&#xD;
      (55-70 mg/dL), and glucose target ranges from 5.0 to 7.2 mmol/L (90-130 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AHCL system will be initiated in Auto Mode (i.e. with AHCL control) at Visit 2.At each&#xD;
      visit, the AHCL system data will be downloaded and reviewed by the physician. The patient&#xD;
      interaction with the system will be evaluated, included sensor calibration, bolus management&#xD;
      (before the meals and for corrections as needed), alarms and Auto Mode exits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit, the glycemic control will be reviewed, and system settings re-assessed and&#xD;
      adjusted as needed, including ICR, AIT and basal rates in Manual Mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is a two-centers, randomized controlled, parallel group study. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed up during approximatively 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will have a similar number of visits in order to minimize bias. However, the AHCL&#xD;
      group will have 2 additional visits to allow for patients to be trained on the AHCL system.&#xD;

    <description>&quot;Severe Hypoglycemia&quot; is an event requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. These episodes may be associated with sufficient neuroglycopenia to induce seizure or coma. Plasma glucose measurements may not be available during such an event, but neurological recovery attributable to the restoration of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration.
