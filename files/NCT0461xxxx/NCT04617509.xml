  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will collect information about pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and tolerability&#xD;
      following a single dose of GS-248 in two different oral solid formulations in capsules to&#xD;
      healthy subjects. It will also collect information about pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and&#xD;
      tolerability following a single dose of one of the two formulations of GS-248 in fed&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is divided in two parts. Part I will evaluate PK, safety and tolerability of a&#xD;
      single oral dose of two different formulations of GS-248 in fasting conditions. Part II will&#xD;
      evaluate PK, safety and tolerability of one of the two different formulations of GS-248 in&#xD;
      fed conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part I, a single oral dose of GS-248 in two different solid formulations will be&#xD;
      administered to 14 healthy subjects. All subjects will first receive Formulation A and then&#xD;
      Formulation B. A wash-out period of at least 4 days will be applied between the IMP&#xD;
      administrations. Both doses contain 120 mg GS 248. For Part I, subjects will come to the&#xD;
      clinic for single dose administration of Formulation A or Formulation B, respectively, and PK&#xD;
      and safety assessments. Safety assessments include AE reporting, physical examination, ECG,&#xD;
      vital signs, body temperature, and blood sampling for analysis of safety laboratory&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After evaluation of the PK profiles of Formulation A and B in Part I of the study, one&#xD;
      formulation will be selected to be given following intake of a standardised breakfast in Part&#xD;
      II of the study. Subjects will return to the clinic for a second dose of the selected&#xD;
      formulation, yet now in fed conditions. The assessments during fed conditions will be the&#xD;
      same as during fasting conditions except that the subjects will consume a high-fat&#xD;
      high-calorie breakfast 30 minutes prior to IMP administration.&#xD;

    <description>The grading of the severity/intensity (grade 1 to grade 5) of AEs followed the common terminology criteria for AEs (CTCAE) v5.0.

      <pre_assignment_details>Screening (Visit 1) took place from Day -28 to Day -1 and included an eligibility check and a general health assessment. A total of 29 subjects were screened for participation. Eleven subjects were screening failures and 4 subjects were reserves who were not used in the study. Fourteen subjects were included and dosed in the study.</pre_assignment_details>

Subject 112 was prematurely withdrawn from the study due to self-reported Covid-19-like symptoms via phone after Visit 5, i.e. after receiving both GS-248 formulations but prior to the food interaction part. This means subject 112 was withdrawn after Part I Formulation B but before Part II which cannot be visualized in the Period section. The correct number of subjects started Part II is thus 13.</participants>

The analysis set is part of the Food Interaction PK Analysis Set (PKAS - Food Interaction), and consisted of all subjects in Arm 1 (receiving Formulation A under fasted conditions) who, subsequently, also received Formulation A under fed conditions in the third treatment period of the study (Arm 3). Since 1 subject terminated the study prematurely between study treatment period 1 and 3, only 13 subjects were included in this analysis set that was used for the assessment of the relative bioavailability of Formulation A in fed versus fasted conditions.</description>

          <description>The grading of the severity/intensity (grade 1 to grade 5) of AEs followed the common terminology criteria for AEs (CTCAE) v5.0. AEs were assessed by the Investigator as &quot;unlikely&quot;, &quot;possibly&quot; or &quot;probably&quot; related to the IMP. An AE was considered causally related to the use of the IMP when the causality assessment was &quot;probable&quot; or &quot;possible&quot;.</description>
