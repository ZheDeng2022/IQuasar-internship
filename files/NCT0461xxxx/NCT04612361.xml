  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective observational study aims at investigating whether insomnia or sleep&#xD;
      deprivation during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy can be implicated in the occurrence of&#xD;
      adverse maternal or fetal outcome. Data will be collected from all participants with special&#xD;
      emphasis on: history of impaired sleep due to insomnia or sleep deprivation due to working on&#xD;
      night shifts, history of insomnia during first 20 weeks of pregnancy.Number of night sleep&#xD;
      hours and total number of sleep hours during the day will be recorded for each participant.&#xD;
      The Insomnia severity index(ISI) a brief self report questionnaire used for assessing the&#xD;
      degree of current insomnia will be administered to all participants at the time of their&#xD;
      routine antenatal care visits to detect insomnia and its severity if present .The possible&#xD;
      relationship between clinical insomnia or sleep deprivation and the occurrence of preterm&#xD;
      birth or IUGR will be explored and the association with increased Cesarean delivery rate or&#xD;
      painful and/ or prolonged labour.&#xD;

      The demographic data will be collected from all participants including patient's age , BMI ,&#xD;
      gestational age, personal,present and past obstetric history, with special emphasis on:&#xD;
      history of impaired sleep due to insomnia or sleep deprivation due to working on night&#xD;
      shifts, history of insomnia during first 20 weeks of pregnancy.Number of night sleep hours&#xD;
      and total number of sleep hours during the day will be recorded for each participant. The&#xD;
      Insomnia severity index(ISI) a brief self report questionnaire used for assessing the degree&#xD;
      of current insomnia will be administered to all participants at the time of their routine&#xD;
      antenatal care visits to detect insomnia and its severity if present .It will be applied both&#xD;
      in English and in its Arabic translated version. The ISI comprises seven items assessing the&#xD;
      type of insomnia problem, satisfaction with the current sleep pattern, affection of the&#xD;
      quality of life by the sleep problem, the degree of distress related to insomnia and its&#xD;
      affect on daily functioning .Each item is scored on a scale of 0-4 and the total ISI score&#xD;
      ranges from 0-28, with higher scores indicating more severe insomnia. A written informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from each participant before joining the study. The participants&#xD;
      will be followed up throughout their 3rd trimester till the time of their delivery. Any&#xD;
      drop-out cases will be reported. The pregnant women who didn't suffer insomnia in any of the&#xD;
      assessments, nor were sleep deprived due to working on night shifts will comprise the the non&#xD;
      impaired sleep group and those suffering clinical insomnia as detected by the insomnia&#xD;
      severity index (total score &gt; or equal to 15) in any or all of the assessments will comprise&#xD;
      the insomnia group. The 3rd group (sleep deprived group) will be comprised of participants&#xD;
      who are only sleep deprived due to working on night shifts and not due to insomnia. Those&#xD;
      getting less than 7hours of sleep/day will be considered sleep deprived.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be assessed during their routine visits with transabdominal ultrasound and&#xD;
      Doppler studies for evaluation of fetal growth ,fetal well being ,placenta and exclusion of&#xD;
      congenital anomalies, abnormal fetal position or presentation .The gestational age at&#xD;
      delivery,mode of delivery,presence of prolonged or painful labour and fetal birth weight will&#xD;
      all be recorded for comparison.&#xD;
