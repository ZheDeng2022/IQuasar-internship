  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate the effectiveness, immune response, and safety of a coronavirus&#xD;
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine called SARS-CoV-2 rS with Matrix-M1 adjuvant in adults 18&#xD;
      years of age and older with a pediatric expansion in adolescents (12 to &lt; 18 years) in the&#xD;
      United States and Mexico. A vaccine causes the body to have an immune response that may help&#xD;
      prevent the infection or reduce the severity of symptoms. An adjuvant is something that can&#xD;
      make a vaccine work better. This study will look at the protective effect, body's immune&#xD;
      response, and safety of SARS-CoV-2 rS with Matrix-M1 adjuvant in the study population.&#xD;
      Participants in the study will randomly be assigned to receive SARS-CoV-2 rS with Matrix-M1&#xD;
      adjuvant or placebo. Each participant in the study will receive a total of 2 intramuscular&#xD;
      injections of either ARS-CoV-2 rS with Matrix-M1 adjuvant or placebo in the Initial&#xD;
      Vaccination Period. Up to 33,000 participants will take part in the study. Following the&#xD;
      recommendation of COVID-19 vaccination for all adults 18 years of age and older, adult&#xD;
      participants will be scheduled for the administration of 2 injections of the alternate study&#xD;
      material 21 days apart (&quot;blinded crossover&quot;). That is, initial recipients of placebo will&#xD;
      receive SARS-CoV-2 rS with Matrix-M1 adjuvant and initial recipients of SARS-CoV-2 rS with&#xD;
      Matrix-M1 adjuvant will receive placebo. A blinded crossover will be implemented for&#xD;
      adolescents 12 to &lt; 18 years of age approximately 6 months after the initial vaccination.&#xD;
