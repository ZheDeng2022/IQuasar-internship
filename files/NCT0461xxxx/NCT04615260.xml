  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this longitudinal study are to assess and measure fusion status (fused or&#xD;
      not fused) and rate of bony fusion using NanoBone速 Synthetic Bone Graft in patients requiring&#xD;
      one to two level lumbar posterolateral fusion procedures with or without commercially&#xD;
      available rigid spinal instrumentation. Our hypothesis is that the Nanobone synthetic bone&#xD;
      graft will be as effective at creating a fusion in the lumbar spine as compared with a local&#xD;
      bone graft. Each subject will serve as their own control during this study, as patients will&#xD;
      receive the Nanobone graft on the right side of their spine and the local bone graft on their&#xD;
      left side.&#xD;

      Subjects will be recruited for this study from among those scheduled to undergo 1-2 level&#xD;
      posterolateral spinal fusion procedures with bone grafting for degenerative disc disease or&#xD;
      grade 1-3 spondylolisthesis. The study will entail each subject having a local bone graft&#xD;
      placed on the left side of their spine, with Nanobone placed on the right side of their spine&#xD;
      during the procedure. Eligible and consenting patients recruited for this study will be&#xD;
      subject to the standard of care. This includes the following visits: preoperative, operative,&#xD;
      post-discharge, 4 months postoperative, 1-year postoperative, and 2-years postoperative. They&#xD;
      will be subject to standard of care imaging modalities including AP, lateral, and&#xD;
      flexion/extension lumbar radiographs at pre-operative, post-discharge, 4-months&#xD;
      postoperative, 1-year postoperative, and 2-year postoperative time points. Standard of care&#xD;
      advanced imaging including a CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan will be&#xD;
      performed pre-operatively. Patients will also receive standard of care clinical examinations&#xD;
      and self-assessments at all clinic visits. Imaging obtained outside the standard of care for&#xD;
      this study will include 1-year and 2-year lumbar CT scans to evaluate fusion. The 2-year&#xD;
      lumbar CT scan will only be required if fusion has not been demonstrated at the time of the&#xD;
      1-year lumbar CT scan. Patients enrolled in this study who are treated with rigid pedicle&#xD;
      screw fixation must be treated using rigid pedicle screw instrumentation appropriate for&#xD;
      posterolateral spinal fusions.&#xD;

    <description>Nanobone速 Synthetic Bone Graft is a nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite imbedded in a silica gel matrix. The nanocrystalline structure accurately replicates autologous hydroxyapatite and the silica gel matrix that rapidly transforms into an osteogenic matrix post-implantation. NanoBone promotes remodeling by acting as a strong osteoinductive material. NanoBone速 is available as a putty.</description>
