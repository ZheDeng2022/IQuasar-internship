      This is a multicenter, randomized, double blind, parallel placebo controlled, phase 3&#xD;

      WIBP:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inactivated SARS CoV 2 Vaccine (Vero cell) is prepared by inoculating Verda Reno cells&#xD;
      (Vero cell) with SARS CoV 2 WIV04 strain, culturing, harvesting, inactivating, clarifying,&#xD;
      concentrating, second inactivating, purifying and adding aluminum hydroxide adjuvant BIBP:&#xD;
      The inactivated SARS CoV 2 Vaccine (Vero cell) is prepared by inoculating Verda Reno cells&#xD;
      (Vero cell) with SARS CoV 2 HB02 strain, culturing, harvesting, inactivating, clarifying,&#xD;
      concentrating, purifying and adding aluminum hydroxide adjuvant. After vaccination, the body&#xD;
      can produce immune response to prevent diseases caused by SARS CoV 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective To evaluate the protective efficacy of inactivated SARS CoV 2 Vaccine (Vero&#xD;
      Cell) after full course of immunization in preventing diseases caused by the SARS CoV 2 in&#xD;
      healthy subjects aged 18 years old and above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial is conducted in randomized, blind, placebo-controlled design. Total&#xD;
      sample size is 12,000, which are randomly allocated into investigational vaccine 1,&#xD;
      investigational vaccine 2 and placebo control group. Subjects with compatible symptoms, will&#xD;
      be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunization schedule: 2-doses of investigational vaccine or placebo are inoculated to the&#xD;
      deltoid muscle of the upper arm according to the Day 0 and day 21 (window for both days + 7&#xD;
      days), immunization schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety observation After each dose of vaccination, the subject is observed for 30 minutes on&#xD;
      site, and local and systemic adverse events are collected. Within 0-30 21/28 days, the local&#xD;
      and systemic reactions of the subjects are actively followed up and recorded on the.&#xD;
      telephone follow-up contact form. Serious adverse events (SAE) will be daily monitored within&#xD;
      12 months after vaccination, and followed up, recorded and reported as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observation of efficacy After the subjects are enrolled in the group, the monitoring of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection cases will begin Planned and active follow-up is carried out on the&#xD;
      subjects, and a monitoring network is established in local medical and health institutions to&#xD;
      monitor SARS-CoV-2 infection-like cases in the subjects. Those diagnosed as suspected cases&#xD;
      by clinicians will be studied as epidemiological case, including nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum&#xD;
      and/or other lower respiratory secretions, venous blood in acute and convalescent stages are&#xD;
      collected. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid will be tested by RT-PCR method, and/or viral gene&#xD;
      sequencing. Subjects with positive nucleic acid, or/and convalescent serum antibodies&#xD;
      increased 4 fold or more than acute phase serum are confirmed cases of COVID-19. (refer to&#xD;
      case monitoring operation manual).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 disease in the three groups of study samples is&#xD;
      calculated and the epidemiological protection rate and confidence interval of SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      inactivated vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 disease are analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunogenicity observation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunogenicity (antibody response to inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine / placebo) will be&#xD;
      evaluated in subjects V00001-V12000 on 14 days after 2nd dose (day 35) and 360 days after 2nd&#xD;
      dose (day 381). Subgroups of 1200 participants will be registered on 28 days after 2nd dose&#xD;
      (days 49), 180 days after 2nd dose ( day 201), to better precise the peak of neutralizing&#xD;
      antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case definition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cases will be further classified as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asymptomatic cases: No symptoms developed for 14 consecutive days after positive PCR testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confirmed cases: On the basis of the clarification of the suspected case, the COVID-19 PCR&#xD;
      diagnosis is positive, or IgG antibodies in convalescent sera four times higher than&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confirmed mild COVID-19 cases: The clinical symptoms were mild, and there was no sign of&#xD;
      pneumonia on imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confirmed moderate COVID-19 cases: Showing fever and respiratory symptoms with radiological&#xD;
      findings of pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confirmed severe COVID-19 cases: Confirmed COVID-19 case meeting any one of the following&#xD;
      criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory distress (RR≥30 breaths/min);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxygen saturation≤93% at rest;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/ fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)≦300mmHg&#xD;
           (1mmHg=0.133kPa);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The clinical symptoms progressively worsened, and the chest imaging showed &gt;50% obvious&#xD;
           lesion progression within 24-48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confirmed Critical COVID-19 cases: Confirmed COVID-19 case meeting any one of the following&#xD;
      criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory failure and requiring mechanical ventilation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Shock;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  With other organ failure that requires ICU care;&#xD;
