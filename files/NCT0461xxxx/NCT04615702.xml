      This study aims to assess the outcome of standardized evidence-based care to all patients&#xD;

      during the period from may, 2017 to may 2019.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute pancreatitis (AP) is one of the most important gastrointestinal disorders causing&#xD;
      emotional and physical human burden . The annual incidence worldwide for AP is 4.9-73.4 cases&#xD;
      per 100,000 people and the overall mortality rate is 4 to 8%, which increases to 33% in&#xD;
      patients with infected necrosis. AP is diagnosed when two of three criteria are fulfilled:&#xD;
      typical abdominal pain of AP, more than three times elevated serum amylase/lipase level and&#xD;
      signs of AP on imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is necessary to clarify the etiology of AP promptly. The diagnosis of gallstones, as the&#xD;
      leading cause for AP, should have the top priority as that will direct the treatment policy.&#xD;
      Long standing alcohol consumption and gallstones disease incriminated in the majority of&#xD;
      cases with AP. Small common bile duct stones, in particular, are the cause of AP in&#xD;
      approximately 32 to 40% of cases. In 10-30% of cases, the cause is unknown, so studies have&#xD;
      suggested that up to 70% of cases of idiopathic pancreatitis are secondary to biliary&#xD;
      microlithiasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of biliary AP has been intensively investigated. Many theories explain how&#xD;
      gallstones can trigger AP. The predominant theories include common pathway theory and&#xD;
      gallstone migration theory. In general, AP occurs when intracellular protective mechanisms&#xD;
      fail to prevent trypsinogen activation or reduce trypsin activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important that management of such potentially life threatening condition to be guided&#xD;
      by an evidence-based approach. After comparing the Japanese (JPN) Guidelines 2015 and its&#xD;
      former edition 2010 with the other two guidelines, International Association of&#xD;
      Pancreatology/American Pancreas Association guidelines (IAP/APA), 2013 and American College&#xD;
      of Gastroenterology (ACG), 2013, the JPN Guidelines, 2015 proved to be the highest quality&#xD;
      regarding its systematic literature review prepared by the meta-analysis team, including the&#xD;
      grading of recommendations and providing pancreatitis bundles.&#xD;

    <description>General anesthesia , Supine position with 30 degree tilt towards the right side&#xD;
A left subcostal 5 cm incision is performed one finger below the left costal margin over the midaxillary line and the muscles were divided sequentially&#xD;
Then, aspiration is done from the possible collection.&#xD;
After confirmation that it was the site of the collection, the fibrotic thick wall was opened by a scissor, as the collection is opened, pus drained spontaneously.&#xD;
At first, a wide suction was introduced in the cavity and the friable loose necrotic tissue was aspirated. Then, a circuit of flushing saline was created in the residual cavity by injection of saline through the previously placed PCD followed by aspiration of the saline and detached loose necrotic tissue fragments by the wide suction tube&#xD;
After completion of the procedure, large bore surgical drain was placed into the collection. The fascia was closed over the drains. The skin closed by interrupted sutures</description>

    <description>Open necrosectomy was done after failure of the minimally invasive techniques. The procedure was done under general anesthesia under the coverage of Tienam (.5gm/6h IV) following the results of culture and sensitivity of the percutaneous drain effluent Surgical exploration of the peritoneal cavity was done through midline exploratory incision, there were 2 large pus collections extending from the Rt. and Lt. Lumber regions deep down into the pelvis, the intervening septa were divided and the pus was aspirated by a wide suction drain.&#xD;
The lesser sac was opened and necrosectomy was done The previously placed PCD repositioned in the site of necrosectomy as a port for continuous irrigation while a wide tube drain was placed in the lesser sac for drainage. Another 2 tube drains were placed in the pelvis.</description>

    <description>for pancreatic pseudocyst Antibiotic prophylaxis with Ciprofloxacin 400mg IV /12 hour was administered before the procedure and continued for 5 days after the procedure At first the cyst morphology was evaluated by EUS and color Doppler ultrasound is used to identify nearby vessels The puncture was performed using a 19-gauge needle, which was introduced into the pseudocyst via a therapeutic linear array echoendoscope. Then, a 0.035-inch guidewire was introduced through the needle and coiled within the pseudocyst under fluoroscopic guidance.&#xD;
The needle was removed and a 10F cystotome was advanced over the guidewire and the tract was dilated by the cystotome, after dilatation, a 10F double-pigtail stent was placed and a sample of the aspirate is sent for chemical and microbiological analysis</description>

A 5 cm horizontal anterior gastrotomy was performed (Image 23a). Hemostasis of the submucosal vessels was performed before the incision of the gastric mucosa.&#xD;
First, the cyst was punctured followed by an incision of 5 cm at the posterior gastric wall. Aspiration of the cyst content was done for chemical and microbiological analysis The wall of the pseudocyst is hemmed to the gastric wall with continuous sutures made of a vicryl 2/0 alongside the entire circumference of the orifice Nasogastric tube was placed in the stomach. The procedure was completed by suturing the anterior gastrotomy with a vicryl 2/0 continous sutures in 2 layers A tube drain was inserted at the pelvis with closure of the abdominal wound in a standard way.</description>
