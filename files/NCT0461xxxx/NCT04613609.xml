  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      E-cigarettes are marketed as an alternative to smoking for those who want to decrease the&#xD;
      health risks of tobacco. Tobacco cigarettes increase heart rate (HR) and arterial pressure,&#xD;
      while reducing muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) through sympathetic baroreflex&#xD;
      inhibition. The acute effects of e-cigarettes on arterial pressure and MSNA have not been&#xD;
      reported: our purpose was to clarify this issue. Using a randomized crossover design,&#xD;
      participants inhaled on a JUUL containing nicotine (59 mg/ml) and a similar placebo&#xD;
      e-cigarette (0 mg/ml).&#xD;
