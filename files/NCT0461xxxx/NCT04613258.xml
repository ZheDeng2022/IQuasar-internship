  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis patients that have complications (e.g., diabetes mellitus and human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)) who live in tropical&#xD;
      regions experience vitamin D deficiency, especially in North Sumatra, Indonesia. The presence&#xD;
      of vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphism genes, TaqI and FokI, is one of the predisposing&#xD;
      factors, as is high levels of inflammatory markers, also indicating disease progression and&#xD;
      malnutrition. This study aims to assess the effect of 50 g of soy-catfish-anchovy-rice (SCAR)&#xD;
      porridge per day for 14 days on 25(OH)D, calcium, and biomolecular serum levels in patients&#xD;
      with VDR gene polymorphisms (TaqI or FokI). The study was a parallel, open, clinical trial. A&#xD;
      total of 43 subjects with the VDR gene polymorphisms were selected. The subjects were divided&#xD;
      into two groups using block randomization. There were 22 subjects in the intervention group&#xD;
      (I) who received 50 g of SCAR porridge once per day, along with dietary counseling, and 21&#xD;
      subjects in the control group (C) who only received dietary counseling.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>We aimed to determine the effect of soy, catfish, anchovy, and rice (SCAR) porridge supplementation for 14 days along with nutritional counseling on vitamin D, calcium, and biomolecular parameters on new patients diagnosed with tuberculosis and associated complications who visited two public health centers: Teladan Public Health Center and Amplas Public Health Center, located in Medan, North Sumatera, Indonesia. The sample was collected on Sumatera Island, at latitude 3.57 N and longitude 98.65 E, with enough sunlight and a temperature of ± 32 °C (90 °F). The study was performed from May to September 2019. This study was a controlled randomized clinical trial. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 43 patients participated in the study. These patients were divided into two groups: 22 patients were put into the treatment group (I) and 21 into the control group (C).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The treatment group was given SCAR porridge supplementation in the form of a soft porridge (a mixture of 50 g dry powder porridge added to 200 mL of hot water) along with nutritional counseling. The control group only received nutritional counseling and no SCAR porridge supplementation. A 50 g portion of SCAR porridge was provided once a day for 14 days. The SCAR porridge was monitored and administered by a researcher once a week to inquire about adherence to the supplementation consumption and perceived side effects. All research subjects went through a clearance period of one week and were requested not to consume any supplements.</description>
