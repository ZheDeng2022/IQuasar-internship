  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change of the Reflective Total Nasal Symptoms Score (rTNSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months post study procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The TNSS is an instrument used to collect patient self-rated severity of nasal symptoms originally comprised of 3 symptoms (nasal obstruction, itching/sneezing and secretion/runny nose) that has been widely adapted to include 4 nasal symptoms: rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing. The patient rates 4 nasal symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching and sneezing) on the following 4-point scale:&#xD;
0 = absent symptoms (no sign/symptom is evident)&#xD;
1 = mild symptoms (sign/symptom present, but minimal awareness; easily tolerated)&#xD;
2 = moderate symptoms (definite awareness of sign/symptom that is bothersome but tolerable)&#xD;
3 = severe symptoms (sign/symptom that is hard to tolerate; causes interference with activities of daily living and/or sleeping).&#xD;
The total score is the sum of the 4 nasal symptoms.&#xD;
A low score indicates lower symptoms, a higher score indicates more symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>30% Improvement in Reflective Total Nasal Symptoms Score (rTNSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months post study procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The TNSS is an instrument used to collect patient self-rated severity of nasal symptoms. The patient rates 4 nasal symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching and sneezing) on the following 4-point scale:&#xD;
0 = absent symptoms (no sign/symptom is evident)&#xD;

2 = moderate symptoms (definite awareness of sign/symptom that is bothersome but tolerable)&#xD;
3 = severe symptoms (sign/symptom that is hard to tolerate; causes interference with activities of daily living and/or sleeping).&#xD;
The total score is the sum of the 4 nasal symptoms.&#xD;
A low score indicates lower symptoms, a higher score indicates more symptoms.&#xD;
Improvement indicates if the score at 3 months is lower than at Baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in Mini Rhinoconjuctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months post study procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The Rhinoconjuctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire is a well-established, validated, and the most frequently used rhinoconjuctivitis disease-specific instrument. The MiniRQLQ, to be used in this study, was developed and validated to further facilitate ease of use and efficiency by reducing the number of questions to 14.&#xD;
The instrument consists of 14 questions across 5 domains (activity limitations (n=3), practical problems (n=2), nose symptoms (n=3), eye symptoms (n=3), and other symptoms (n=3)). Responses are based on a 1-week recall and provided on a 7-point scale:&#xD;
0 = not troubled&#xD;
1 = hardly troubled at all&#xD;
2 = somewhat troubled&#xD;
3 = moderately troubled&#xD;
4 = quite a bit troubled&#xD;
5 = very troubled&#xD;
6 = extremely troubled.&#xD;
The total or overall MiniRQLQ score is the mean of the 14 responses and the domain scores are the mean of the questions in each domain.</description>

    <description>The RhinAer procedure will be performed in the study clinic using the RhinAer Stylus and Aerin Console. The RhinAer Stylus is a disposable handheld device capable of delivering bipolar radiofrequency energy to tissue when connected to the Aerin Console radiofrequency generating device. Participants will have both nostrils treated in the portion of the nasal cavity mucosa overlying the region of the posterior nasal nerve.</description>

    <description>The RhinAer procedure incorporates use of the RhinAer Stylus (Model FG815), which is a cleared (FDA - K192471) disposable handheld device capable of delivering bipolar radiofrequency energy to tissue. RhinAer has CE Marking in EU. The Aerin Console (Model FG226) RF generator with temperature control capable of delivering very low doses of energy was cleared for use in the US (FDA - K162810) and has CE Marking in the EU (CE639608).</description>
