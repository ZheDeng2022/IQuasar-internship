    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial investigates the side effects and best dose of LY3214996 when given&#xD;
      together with cetuximab alone or in combination with abemaciclib and to see how well they&#xD;
      work in treating patients with colorectal cancer that cannot be removed by surgery&#xD;
      (unresectable) and/or has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Cetuximab is a&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;
      LY3214996 and abemaciclib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Giving LY3214996 and cetuximab alone or in combination with&#xD;
      abemaciclib may help treat patients with colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ERK1/2&#xD;
      inhibitor LY3214996 (LY3214996) administered in combination with cetuximab. (Phase 1b) II.&#xD;
      Determine the MTD and RP2D of LY3214996 administered in combination with cetuximab plus&#xD;
      abemaciclib. (Phase 1b) III. Assess the preliminary antitumor activity of the treatment&#xD;
      combinations based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.&#xD;
      (Phase 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the preliminary antitumor activity of the treatment combinations based on RECIST&#xD;
      v.1.1. (Phase 1b) II. Characterize the safety profile of the treatment combinations (DLTs).&#xD;
      III. Evaluate for pERK and Ki67 inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess blood- and tissue-based predictive biomarkers of activity and immune effects upon&#xD;
      treatment with cetuximab, LY3214996, and abemaciclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Demonstrate feasibility of establishing patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models in matched&#xD;
      patients with cetuximab-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) to evaluate for&#xD;
      biomarkers of response and mechanisms of resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Explore mechanisms of resistance to cetuximab plus LY3214996 and cetuximab, LY3214996,&#xD;
      plus abemaciclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of ERK1/2 inhibitor LY3214996 followed by&#xD;
      a phase II study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive ERK1/2 inhibitor LY3214996 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28&#xD;
      and cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive ERK1/2 inhibitor LY3214996 and cetuximab as in Arm A. Patients also&#xD;
      receive abemaciclib PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;
