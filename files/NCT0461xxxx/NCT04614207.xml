    <textblock>
      Children and adolescents with cerebral palsy may be trapped in a vicious circle of low&#xD;
      physical fitness, early fatigue in daily activities, resulting in deconditioning and a&#xD;
      further decrease in physical activity. From this perspective, establishing a healthy and&#xD;
      active lifestyle during childhood is even more important for individuals with a disability,&#xD;
      who are at higher risk for functional limitations and general fatigue in addition with&#xD;
      developing secondary' conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity.&#xD;
      Furthermore, physical activity has a positive impact on quality of life, but it remains&#xD;
      unknown which factors that influence high levels of habitual physical activity in children&#xD;
      and adolescents with cerebral palsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present research project will investigate predictors of habitual physical activity in&#xD;
      children and adolescents with cerebral palsy with the perspective of providing evidence on&#xD;
      optimizing physical activity and consequently improved overall health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is a condition that describes a group of disorders (altered muscle tone,&#xD;
      movements disorder, muscle weakness, ataxia and rigidity) covering the development of&#xD;
      movement and posture causing activity limitations and reduced quality of life (1). In Denmark&#xD;
      2000-2500 children and adolescents under the age of 18 are living with the diagnosis of&#xD;
      cerebral palsy. This is equivalent to two children being diagnosed with cerebral palsy per&#xD;
      1000 living births (2). Though, CP is a non-progressive diagnosis, it is a lifelong condition&#xD;
      that requires attention through most of the patient's life, as impairments that inhibit&#xD;
      performance of activities and participation in daily living develops (1, 3). Children and&#xD;
      adolescents with cerebral palsy are a vulnerable group who find it challenging to meet the&#xD;
      physical activity guidelines, therefore predisposing them to the negative health implications&#xD;
      associated with low levels of physical activity and high levels of sedentary time (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are no specific evidence-based physical activity guidelines for children and&#xD;
      adolescents with cerebral palsy, it is clear that they have lower levels of physical activity&#xD;
      than their peers, that they do not meet the World Health Organization's physical activity&#xD;
      guidelines, and that their level of mobility limitation is negatively associated with their&#xD;
      level of physical activity (5, 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate predictors of physical activity and&#xD;
      inactivity in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy with the perspective of providing&#xD;
      evidence-based motivators for optimized physical activity, with the potential benefit of&#xD;
      improved overall health and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective clinical cohort study. Eligible children and adolescents and their&#xD;
      families will be identified through the Danish Health Data Authority after which the&#xD;
      parents/guardians will receive written information about the study through digital post,&#xD;
      e-Boks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents/guardians will be asked to fill out questionnaires on quality of life, overall&#xD;
      health, pain and participation in normal daily activities, and the children/adolescents will&#xD;
      be asked to wear accelerometers for seven consecutive days. Data from the Cerebral Palsy&#xD;
      FollowUp Program (CPUP) register will be collected. Gait analysis will be performed on a&#xD;
      sub-group of children, i.e. those who are referred to three-dimensional gait analyses as a&#xD;
      part of their individualized clinical treatment plan. A subgroup of families will be invited&#xD;
      to participate in interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All collected data will be compared with data from former studies of Danish children based on&#xD;
      the same methodological framework. The comparison enables analyses of how, and to what&#xD;
      extent, cerebral palsy affects the included children's and adolescents' physical activity&#xD;
      behavior and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be implemented in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration II. It has been&#xD;
      approved by the Danish Data protection Agency and has been declared not notifiable by the&#xD;
      Regional Committee on Health Research Ethics, cf. Committee Act Art. 14, paragraph 1&#xD;
      (S-20192000-23). All subject data will be treated confidentially and in confidence under the&#xD;
      Danish laws on personal data and health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide novel evidence that will improve the knowledge on how to optimize&#xD;
      physical activity, and thus improve overall health and quality of life, for the current group&#xD;
      of children and adolescents. Due to wide inclusion criteria, this knowledge will constitute a&#xD;
      high level of generalizability and most probably high acceptance by the treating health&#xD;
      professionals as the majority of variables of interest already are implemented in a current&#xD;
      cerebral palsy registry. Finally, the findings may be implemented in evidence-based physical&#xD;
      activity guidelines, which currently are lacking for the present group of children and&#xD;
      adolescents with cerebral palsy.&#xD;
