  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In sub-Saharan Africa, tuberculosis (TB) is the etiology of 25-50% of bloodstream infections&#xD;
      (BSIs) and the leading cause of sepsis among people living with HIV. TB BSI is associated&#xD;
      with 20-50% mortality, and 20-25% of deaths occur within five days of admission. TB BSI is&#xD;
      difficult to identify clinically and microbiologically. Given that the high prevalence of TB&#xD;
      BSI is under-recognized, most patients with sepsis in sub-Saharan Africa do not receive early&#xD;
      anti-TB therapy. The hypothesis of this study is that immediate and optimally dosed anti-TB&#xD;
      therapy will improve 28 day mortality in patients with sepsis in Uganda and Tanzania.&#xD;
      Therefore, the overall goal is to conduct a phase 3 multi-site open label 2x2 factorial&#xD;
      clinical trial of 1) empiric immediate initiation of anti-TB therapy plus standard care&#xD;
      compared to diagnosis dependent anti-TB therapy plus standard care and 2) sepsis-specific&#xD;
      dose anti-TB therapy plus standard care compared to conventional WHO weight-based dose&#xD;
      anti-TB therapy plus standard care for the treatment of sepsis in people living with HIV&#xD;
      admitted to our longstanding collaborative research sites at either the Mbarara Regional&#xD;
      Referral Hospital in Mbarara, Uganda, or Kilimanjaro region hospitals in Moshi, Tanzania.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) To conduct a randomized 2x2 factorial clinical trial of 1) empiric immediate initiation of&#xD;
      anti-TB therapy plus standard care vs diagnosis dependent anti-TB therapy plus standard care,&#xD;
      2) sepsis-specific anti-TB therapy plus standard care vs conventional WHO weight-based&#xD;
      anti-TB therapy plus standard care for patients presenting with sepsis in Uganda and&#xD;
      Tanzania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1a) To determine if empiric immediate initiation of anti-TB therapy plus standard care&#xD;
      improves 28 day mortality compared to diagnosis dependent anti-TB therapy plus standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1b) To determine if sepsis-specific dose anti-TB therapy plus standard care improves 28 day&#xD;
      mortality compared to conventional WHO weight-based anti-TB therapy plus standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if empiric immediate initiation of anti-TB therapy plus standard care&#xD;
           improves in-hospital mortality compared to diagnosis dependent anti-TB therapy plus&#xD;
           standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if sepsis-specific dose anti-TB therapy plus standard care improves&#xD;
           in-hospital mortality compared to conventional WHO weight-based anti-TB therapy plus&#xD;
           standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine if empiric immediate initiation of anti-TB therapy plus standard care&#xD;
           improves 6 month mortality compared to diagnosis dependent anti-TB therapy plus standard&#xD;
           care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine if sepsis-specific dose anti-TB therapy plus standard care improves 6 month&#xD;
           mortality compared to conventional WHO weight-based anti-TB therapy plus standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine the safety of increased dose sepsis-specific anti-TB therapy for patients&#xD;
           with sepsis&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To determine if early achievement of target serum drug concentrations of isoniazid and&#xD;
           rifampin, measured at day-2 of TB treatment, associates with more rapid clinical&#xD;
           improvement among patients with confirmed TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be men or women aged ≥18 years living with HIV in Tanzania or Uganda who&#xD;
      are admitted to one of the study hospitals with sepsis, defined by a clinical concern for&#xD;
      infection, a modified quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score ≥2 (Glasgow&#xD;
      Coma Scale score &lt;15, a respiratory rate ≥22, or a systolic blood pressure ≤90 mmHg or a mean&#xD;
      arterial pressure of ≤65 mmHg). This is a multi-site trial at Kilimanjaro region hospitals in&#xD;
      Tanzania (Kibong'oto Infectious Diseases Hospital and Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre)&#xD;
      and Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital in Mbarara, Uganda. At both regional study sites,&#xD;
      clinical trial infrastructure has been developed over multiple TB and non-TB related&#xD;
      interventional studies supported by the NIH and other funders including EDCTP, WHO, MRC, and&#xD;
      BMGF with associated regulatory standards. Furthermore, both regional hospital systems have&#xD;
      large recruitment populations serving mid-sized cities where patients receive local care and&#xD;
      as referral hospitals for those from more peripheral settings. The study population will be&#xD;
      enrolled from the Emergency or inpatient wards. Admission numbers of eligible patients&#xD;
      presenting with sepsis at each site allow for a conservative estimates of 100 patients per&#xD;
      country per year to be well within attainment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment, patients will be randomized to 1) empiric immediate initiation of anti-TB&#xD;
      therapy plus standard care vs diagnosis dependent anti-TB therapy plus standard care and 2)&#xD;
      conventional WHO recommended weight-based dose anti-TB therapy with rifampin, isoniazid,&#xD;
      pyrazinamide, and ethambutol plus pyridoxine, plus standard therapy; or sepsis-specific dose&#xD;
      anti-TB therapy with rifampin (~30mg/kg), isoniazid (~7.5mg/kg), pyrazinamide, and ethambutol&#xD;
      plus pyridoxine, plus standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each individual participant will complete all participant follow-up at 6 months from&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;
