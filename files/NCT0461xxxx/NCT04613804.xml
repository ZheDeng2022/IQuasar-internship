  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the malignant tumor with the highest incidence and mortality in China.&#xD;
      Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) ,which includes non-squamous cell carcinoma (including&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and other cell types) and squamous cell carcinoma,&#xD;
      accounts for about 80% of lung cancer. Platinum-based two-drug chemotherapy is the first-line&#xD;
      standard treatment for driver-gene negative advanced NSCLC, but most patients experience&#xD;
      disease progression after 4 to 6 months. To extend the efficacy of first-line treatment,&#xD;
      maintenance therapy is a logical clinical option for patients who are effective after 4 to 6&#xD;
      cycles of standard treatment. There is currently no standard regimen for maintenance&#xD;
      treatment of NSCLC. We evaluated the effectiveness and safety of maintenance therapy with the&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (Toripalimab injection) followed by the first-line standard&#xD;
      regimen in advanced NSCLC patients who are effective after standard treatment. With a view to&#xD;
      exploring treatment methods that are effective for the maintenance treatment of driver-gene&#xD;
      negative advanced NSCLC and have little toxic and side effects,thereby improving the survival&#xD;
      prognosis of these patients.&#xD;
