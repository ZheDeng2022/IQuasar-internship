      The goal of this pilot study is to evaluate a bundle of implementation strategies at three&#xD;
      Veteran Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) to facilitate the referral and adoption of a&#xD;
      telehealth based, cognitive behavioral therapy program delivered by Health Psychologists for&#xD;
      Veterans with chronic migraine to inform a future fully-powered hybrid type 2&#xD;
      effectiveness-implementation design. Veteran patients will be randomized to either the&#xD;
      telehealth delivered CBT or usual care. Headache symptoms and severity will be reported using&#xD;
      a VA text messaging application.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With VHA's infrastructure dedicated to efficient telehealth delivery into patient homes, the&#xD;
      delivery of a behavioral intervention for chronic migrane, CM, via the telehealth platform is&#xD;
      primed to address barriers of in-person care delivery and holds considerable promise to reach&#xD;
      and improve Veteran headache-related quality of life. Therefore, the goal is to evaluate an&#xD;
      adapted bundle of EB implementation strategies to increase adoption of a Telemedicine-based&#xD;
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) program (TENACITY) for CM in 2 VA HCoEs (VA Connecticut&#xD;
      Healthcare System [VACHS], a large, multi-disciplinary HCoE, and Birmingham VA Medical Center&#xD;
      [BVAMC], a smaller VA Headache Consortium Center. The HCoEs are charged with improving&#xD;
      headache care throughout the VA, not just within an individual VAMC. As part of this study, a&#xD;
      non-HCoE will also participate, providing an opportunity for the TENACITY study to extend&#xD;
      this virtual specialty headache care to Veterans without headache specialty care. Dallas VA&#xD;
      Medical Center, also known as the North Texas Health Care System [NTHCS] will participate as&#xD;
      a third site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will determine whether TENACITY can be efficiently delivered through the&#xD;
      vehicle of telehealth by conducting a pilot randomly controlled trial (RCT) comparing a)&#xD;
      TENACITY to b). usual care plus education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit Veterans diagnosed with chronic migraine headaches until the&#xD;
      investigators have reached approximately 150 eligible Veterans participants across the 3&#xD;
      VAMCs. The investigators will randomize eligible Veterans to participate either in the&#xD;
      TENACITY intervention (n=75) or treatment as usual(n=75).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are threefold:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To develop a bundle of evidence-based practice (EBP) implementation strategies to&#xD;
      engage 3 VA Medical Centers [2 Headache Centers of Excellence HCoEs and 1 general neurology&#xD;
      service] and facilitate their local adaptation and implementation of Cognitive Behavioral&#xD;
      Therapy (CBT) (TENACITY) through the vehicle of telehealth services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1a. HCoE clinical providers will report high acceptability, appropriateness and&#xD;
      fidelity of TENACITY at 3 months and maintenance at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1b. TENACITY reach, adoption, and implementation will vary by HCoE local context&#xD;
      as evaluated by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) inner settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To conduct a pilot RCT and determine the preliminary efficacy and feasibility of&#xD;
      TENACITY compared to usual care in outpatient, in person facilities across 3 VA HCoE sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Veterans receiving TENACITY will experience a statistically significant&#xD;
      reduction in routine clinical headache metrics: headache frequency [headache days per month]&#xD;
      (primary outcome), headache-related impairment and psychological symptoms (secondary&#xD;
      outcomes) compared to usual care at 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: The investigators will conduct exploratory cost analysis of TENACITY from the&#xD;
      Veteran's perspective, using inputs from the pilot RCT, and a two-year budget impact analysis&#xD;
      from the VHA's perspective, incorporating the costs of implementation as well as direct costs&#xD;
      (and cost-savings,) of providing the TENACITY intervention over all HCoEs to VHA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: TENACITY will be cost-effective and provide value to Veterans and VHA.&#xD;
