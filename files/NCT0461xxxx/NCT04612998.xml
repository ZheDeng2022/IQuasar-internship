      The study population comprised 100 pregnant women diagnosed with obese aged between 18-45&#xD;
      years, American society of anesthesiologist I and II with full-term gestation undergoing&#xD;
      elective cesarean section under combined spinal - epidural anesthesia (CSEA). Women with&#xD;
      psychiatric diseases, preeclampsia, pregnancy-induced hypertension or chronic hypertension,&#xD;
      diabetes, multiple pregnancies, fetal anomaly and allergy to study drugs were excluded from&#xD;
      the study. Also, patients requiring general anesthesia and patients with an average blood&#xD;
      pressure below 90 and heart rate less than 50 were excluded. Before performance of CSEA, two&#xD;
      groups were formed by randomization. A computer-generated table of random numbers was used&#xD;
      for randomization. The CESA was performed in left lateral position in Group I (n=50) and in&#xD;
      sitting position in Group II (n=50).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premedication was not performed in any patient. Before entering the operating room, 10 mL/kg&#xD;
      lactated Ringer's solution was given to all patients via IV cannula over 20 minutes. Standard&#xD;
      monitoring was performed in the operating room. Before the operation; patients' age, weight,&#xD;
      height, ASA physical status and basal hemodynamic parameters were recorded. The CSEA was&#xD;
      planned for all patients. All interventions were performed by an experienced&#xD;
      anesthesiologist. Patients were appropriately positioned in accordance with the group in&#xD;
      which they were included. Group I (n=50) consisted of patients performing CSEA in the left&#xD;
      lateral decubitus position. The patient was laid on her left side, the legs were flexed on&#xD;
      the abdomen and the chin on the chest. Group II (n=50) consisted of patients performing CSEA&#xD;
      in the sitting position. The patient was seated on the edge of the operating table with his&#xD;
      feet hanging down, the feet supported by a chair, a pillow was given on her lap, and the&#xD;
      patient clung to the pillow. After the skin was sterilized and local infiltration was&#xD;
      performed with 2% lidocaine, 18 gauge Tuohy needle (Set for CSEA, Braun®, Melsungen, Germany)&#xD;
      was advanced through the midline L2-3 or L3-4 intervertebral spaces with loss of resistance&#xD;
      technique. Intrathecally, a 27-gauge pencil point needle was inserted using the&#xD;
      needle-through-needle technique. When free cerebrospinal fluid flow was seen, 1.8 ml 0.5%&#xD;
      isobaric bupivacaine (9 mg) was administered over 30 seconds. The epidural catheter was&#xD;
      advanced 3 cm into the epidural space following the spinal needle was removed. After the&#xD;
      catheter was checked with negative pressure, it was secured in place. At the end of the&#xD;
      procedure patients were placed in the supine position for operation and the operating table&#xD;
      was tilted 20° to the left. Sensory block level was evaluated via pinprick test and it was&#xD;
      recorded bilaterally every two minutes. Surgery was initiated following the sensory block&#xD;
      reached at the upper level of T6 dermatome. If signs of analgesia were not observed within&#xD;
      the first 20 min following the spinal injection, spinal anesthesia was evaluated as failed.&#xD;
      In case of failure, additional 5 ml solution of 2% lidocaine was performed via the epidural&#xD;
      catheter (5-min intervals, the total dose of 15 mg) until a T6 level of the sensory block was&#xD;
      provided. Motor block level was evaluated with Modified Bromage scale (scale 0 = motor block&#xD;
      is not available; scale 1 = The patient can do the full flexion of foot and knee, she is&#xD;
      unable to hip flexion; scale 2 = The patient can do the full flexion of foot, she is unable&#xD;
      to knee and hip flexion; scale 3 = Total motor block is available). General anaesthesia&#xD;
      protocol was applied in case of three unsuccessful attempts to reach to intrathecal space.&#xD;
      Oxygen was delivered during surgery. Intravenous ephedrine (6 mg) was used to treat&#xD;
      hypotension (a 30% decrease in systolic blood pressure compared to preoperative values)&#xD;
      during surgery. Intra-venous atropine (1 mg) was given in case of bradycardia (the heart rate&#xD;
      &lt; 45 beats/minute) during surgery. When nausea and vomiting were observed, intravenous&#xD;
      metoclopramide (10 mg) was administered. The application time of the CSEA, the time from the&#xD;
      spinal injection to the development of sensory blockade up to T6 dermatome, operation time&#xD;
      (the time from the start of the surgical incision until the end of surgery), highest sensory&#xD;
      block level, anesthetic complications and the number of patients required epidural medication&#xD;
      during surgery were recorded. Following drug administration to the intrathecal space,&#xD;
      intraoperative hemodynamic changes were recorded every 2 min. After surgery was initiated,&#xD;
      hemodynamic changes were recorded in 5-minute intervals until the end of the operation. Side&#xD;
      effects such as pruritus and nausea, the number of patients requiring ephedrine, atropine or&#xD;
      analgesic were recorded. After delivery, 30 IU oxytocin in 500 mL Ringer's lactate solution&#xD;
      was given intravenously. Neonatal Apgar scores obtained at 1 and 5 min after delivery and&#xD;
      umbilical artery blood gas values were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, patients were followed in the recovery room for 120 min. In the recovery room,&#xD;
      Visual analogue scale (VAS, 0 cm= no pain, 10 cm= worst pain) scores for pain severity,&#xD;
      anesthesia-related side effects (e.g., nausea, vomiting and headache), sensory block time&#xD;
      (from the spinal injection to the recovery of T10 dermatome), and the time requiring&#xD;
      supplemental analgesics was recorded by an independent observer blinded to the group&#xD;
      assignment at 30 min and 1st and 2nd hours post-operatively. In the case of VAS &gt; 3 in a&#xD;
      patient, 5 ml solution of 2% lidocaine was given through the epidural catheter. When the&#xD;
      motor block had regressed to the T10 level, patients were sent to the clinics.Sample size was&#xD;
      calculated as minimum 40 patients in each group, based on data obtained in previous studies,&#xD;
      to detect a minimum difference in the requirement of 10 mg ephedrine between the two groups&#xD;
      with a power of 90%, a of 0.05. Accordingly, 50 pregnant women were recruited in each group&#xD;
      to compensate for potential dropouts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were expressed as mean values ± standard deviation (SD) or number and percentage values.&#xD;
      Whether the data has normal distribution was tested using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.&#xD;
      Comparisons were performed using the Mann-Whitney U-test, when data was not normally&#xD;
      distributed. Comparisons were performed using the Independent T test in the presence of&#xD;
      normally distributed data. The percentage values were compared using chi-square, P&lt;0.05 was&#xD;
      considered significant statistically.&#xD;
