      The study consisted in the analysis of the autonomic modulation of the heart rate by the&#xD;
      Heart Rate Variability of the participants at rest for 5 minutes, and during physical&#xD;
      activity of 8 minutes, through a virtual reality game. The data capture was performed using a&#xD;
      cardio-frequency meter with belt placed on the volunteer's trunk and, in addition,&#xD;
      questionnaires, functional classification scales and personal data collection were applied.&#xD;

      This is a cross-sectional study, approved by the Ethics and Research Committee of the Medical&#xD;
      School of the Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP) registered under CAAE&#xD;
      793517.1.0000.5505. The recruitment of non-athletes was carried out at the Acreditando&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Center and the athletes were recruited at the Faca na Cadeira Institute, ICEL&#xD;
      and Clube Espéria. Participants were enrolled in the study after signing the Free and&#xD;
      Informed Consent Term. Convenience sampling technique was used with data collected from March&#xD;
      2017 to October 2018 Participants The study included athletes and non-athletes with a&#xD;
      confirmed medical diagnosis of SCI, with voluntary extension of elbows and wrist, active&#xD;
      trunk control, and who had already completed rehabilitation. For the athlete group,&#xD;
      participants had to fulfill the minimum criteria for defining an active athlete, described in&#xD;
      the next section. Also, a control group of able-bodied subjects, approximately paired by age&#xD;
      and sex wit the AG and non-athlete groups were recruited. Participants were excluded if they&#xD;
      presented with impairments to the upper limbs that interfered with the performance during the&#xD;
      game, were diagnosed with heart disease or other neurological disorders , were using&#xD;
      medication that were not part of their usual routine or that influenced the cardiac and&#xD;
      nervous systems, and presented an error greater than 5% in the analysis of HRV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of function The Funtional Independence Measure (FIM) and the Spinal Cord&#xD;
      Independence Measure Version III (SCIM III) were used to classify functional independence.&#xD;
      The International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI)&#xD;
      was employed to assess the level and severity of injury. To classify the physical activity&#xD;
      levels of the participants, the the Physical Activity in Athlete Questionnaire and the&#xD;
      Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire for Non-Athletes with Spinal Cord Injury&#xD;
      (LTPAQ-SCI) were employed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Heart Rate Variability For the HRV assessment, participants were instructed not&#xD;
      to consume alcohol, caffeine or smoke 24 hours before the test. The procedures to measure HRV&#xD;
      were conducted according to the guidelines from the Task Force of the European Society of&#xD;
      Cardiology and the North American Society of Stimulation and Electrophysiology and were&#xD;
      recorded using the Polar V800 electrocardiographic measuring device (Polar Electro, Finland),&#xD;
      with a sampling rate of 1000 Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The determination of the linear indexes of HRV for time and frequency was carried out using&#xD;
      the software Kubios HRV (v. 3.3.0). The HRV data for time was analyzed using linear methods,&#xD;
      using SDNN indices (standard deviation of the mean of all normal RR intervals) in&#xD;
      milliseconds (ms); PNN50 (percentage of successive differences of the RR intervals with an&#xD;
      absolute value greater than 50ms); RMSSD (square root of the mean square of the differences&#xD;
      between adjacent normal RR intervals). Moreover, geometric methods such as, the RRTri&#xD;
      (triangular index) and TINN (histogram interpolation of NN intervals), the indexes of the&#xD;
      Poincaré graph with the SD1 (standard deviation of the instantaneous variability of the&#xD;
      beat-to beat heart rate), SD2 (standard deviation of the long-term, continuous, RR interval&#xD;
      variability), and the SD1/SD2 ratio-the ratio between the short- and long-term variations&#xD;
      among the RR intervals and Parassympathetic Nervous System index (PNS index), Sympathetic&#xD;
      Nervous System index (SNS index) and Stress index given by HRV Kubios, were employed. LF&#xD;
      indices (low frequency spectral components, between 0.04 and 0.15 Hertz) were recorded in ms2&#xD;
      and in standard units (nu); while HF (high frequency spectral components, between 0.15 and&#xD;
      0.4 Hertz) was recorded in ms2 and nu; and the ratio of LF/HF in ms2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTOCOL For the three groups the HRV measures were captured in 2 instances: 1. For 5 minutes&#xD;
      at rest in the seated position; and 2. During the VR activity, in which the individual&#xD;
      executed movements according to a game in front of a computer for 8 minutes. The VR activity&#xD;
      was performed using the game MoveHero, developed at the School of Arts Sciences and&#xD;
      Humanities of the University of São Paulo (EACH-USP). The game consists of virtual balls that&#xD;
      fall in pre-determined time intervals and spacial distribution in four imaginary columns on a&#xD;
      computer screen. The participant must move in the direction of the balls to touch them as&#xD;
      they reach four pre-determined targets placed to the sides of the player's avatar. The&#xD;
      targets are numbered (1 to 4) and are placed in parallel at two different heights, two to the&#xD;
      left and two to the right of the player's avatar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The game captures the participant's movements with a webcam, not requiring physical contact&#xD;
      to perform the task. The participant must move his arms at 80% of their maximum lateral&#xD;
      range. Before starting the task, the experimenter positioned the participant in a distance&#xD;
      from the screen that allowed him/her to achieve the maximum lateral reach range for each side&#xD;
      (left and right) when reaching towards the two farthest balls (1 and 4). From that position,&#xD;
      the distance between the computer's table and the participant's feet was measured and the&#xD;
      participant was asked to move his/her wheelchair to 80% of this distance. During the task,&#xD;
      the participant had to wait for the balls to drop until they reached the pre-determined&#xD;
      targets. When the balls reached the targets, the color of the balls changed to green, which&#xD;
      prompted the participant to reach for them. Therefore, the game requires the participant to&#xD;
      have a strategy of planning their movement to reach the targets at the same time as the&#xD;
      balls.&#xD;
