  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single arm study, to evaluate the safety, effectiveness and usability&#xD;
      of the XACT device. Subjects undergoing CT-guided, minimally invasive percutaneous lung&#xD;
      procedures in the interventional radiology suite. eg. core, biopsy, will participate in the&#xD;
      study. System and clinical accuracy will be the primary efficacy endpoint. Usability and&#xD;
      safety will also be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-arm study is to evaluate the safety, effectiveness and&#xD;
      usability of the XACT device. The study will be approved by the Institutional Review Board&#xD;
      (IRB) at each of the participating centers prior to patient enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects undergoing CT-guided, minimally invasive percutaneous lung procedures in the&#xD;
      interventional radiology suite, e.g., core biopsy, fine needle aspiration (FNA), tumor&#xD;
      ablation, etc., and willing to sign an informed consent document will be screened for&#xD;
      compliance with the study inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of thirty (41) subjects will be enrolled in the study at 5 medical centers. The&#xD;
      intention is to recruit subjects, which will cover a variety of CT-guided interventional lung&#xD;
      procedures and a variety of different procedural tools that may be used with the device.&#xD;
      Investigators will screen patients based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria described below&#xD;
      and the subjects' demographic, general medical history, medical condition/indication,&#xD;
      coagulation factors, concomitant medications and vital signs will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The system accuracy will be the primary efficacy endpoint and is defined as the measured&#xD;
      distance from the tip of the needle/tool to the target, once the XACT robot reaches the&#xD;
      pre-defined target .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical accuracy will be the secondary efficacy endpoint and is defined as the ability to&#xD;
      place the instrument or procedural tool at a location suitable for the planned intervention.&#xD;
      The investigator will review the final instrument position on the post-placement CT images to&#xD;
      determine if the pre-operative planned target was reached. This information will be used to&#xD;
      calculate success rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the usability of the XACT device will be evaluated using a rating scale by&#xD;
      assessing the ease of device setup, device operation, pre-operative planning, robot&#xD;
      positioning, guiding and needle advancement. The total time of the procedure will be&#xD;
      recorded, as will the number of CT scans performed and the radiation dose (DLP and CTDI).&#xD;

    <description>Device: XACT Robotic System The XACT device is a real-time, CT image guided, 3-dimensional robotic system. The XACT device is intended for use as an image guided positioning and steering system for insertion of clinical tools, such as biopsy needles, ablation needles, etc., during minimally invasive percutaneous lung procedures. The system is defined to guide (i.e., position and steer) the tool according to a predefined trajectory following a registration process between the device's coordinate system and real-time CT images.</description>
