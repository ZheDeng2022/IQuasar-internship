  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ETAPES Program, a French national Experimentation in Telemedicine for the Improvement of&#xD;
      Healthcare Pathways, was launched in 2018 for 4 years. Its objectives were to provide a&#xD;
      temporary public reimbursement for medical telemonitoring in order to determine the benefits&#xD;
      for the patient and the impact on medical organization and healthcare costs. In particular,&#xD;
      this program applies to patients suffering from hypercapnic chronic respiratory failure and&#xD;
      requiring home non invasive ventilation (NIV). For these patients, the ETAPES program&#xD;
      combines NIV telemonitoring and therapeutic education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      e-VENT study aims at evaluating the ETAPES program, implemented using the Chronic Care&#xD;
      Connect™ telemonitoring solution, versus Standard of Care, on the effectiveness of home NIV,&#xD;
      measured by average PtCO2, reflecting the level of nocturnal alveolar hypoventilation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized study with two arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the level of nocturnal alveolar hypoventilation, defined as the&#xD;
      average PtCO2 in nocturnal capnography performed at 6th month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with hypercapnic chronic respiratory failure requiring home NIV (n=100).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-center study conducted in France involving approximately 20 sites&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product under study: Chronic Care Connect Pneumology telemonitoring solution, combining:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a technical solution for the transmission and analysis of ventilator data, with the&#xD;
           generation of alerts by a CE-marked algorithm;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an organizational solution relying on a nurse call center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First visit: eligibility criteria confirmation; randomization to 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the &quot;Telemonitoring&quot; group will participate in the ETAPES experimentation, with&#xD;
                remote monitoring of their ventilator data with generation of alerts to the nurse&#xD;
                call center, medical action if requested, and therapeutic education.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the &quot;Standard of Care&quot; group will receive standard medical follow-up, with&#xD;
                transmission of their ventilator data without generation of alerts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second visit (6th month): arterial blood gases, nocturnal capnography. Collection of&#xD;
           medical events having occurred in the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Third visit (12th month): for COPD patients only - Collection of medical events having&#xD;
           occurred in the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of the study, the investigators will complete a qualitative questionnaire on&#xD;
           their telemonitoring practice.&#xD;
