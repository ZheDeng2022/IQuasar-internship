  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venetoclax is a treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute myeloid leukemia&#xD;
      (AML). However, the pharmacokinetic data in Chinese population, as well as the change of&#xD;
      venetoclax plasma concentration while taking CYP enzyme inducers or inhibitors, remained&#xD;
      unknown so far. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      characteristics of venetoclax.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Venetoclax has been approved for treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic&#xD;
      leukemia (CLL). Currently, there is not enough data of CLL populations from Chinese or other&#xD;
      Asian regarding its efficacy or adverse reactions. In the phase 3 MURANO trial (NCT02005471),&#xD;
      only 8 Asians (2.06%) were included, while other phase 1 or phase 2 studies did not show the&#xD;
      percentage of Asian population. According to a venetoclax population pharmacokinetic study&#xD;
      published in 2016, which integrated 505 subjects from 8 clinical trials, concluded that race&#xD;
      was not a covariate that affect venetoclax PK. However, only 6 Asians (1.19%) were included,&#xD;
      and some of the subjects were small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)&#xD;
      or healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacokinetics of venetoclax is affected by many factors, and the most influential&#xD;
      factors may be fat content from dietary and concomitant use of CYP3A inhibitors or inducers.&#xD;
      In particular, patients with hematological malignancies often require antifungal agents (such&#xD;
      as voriconazole, posaconazole) as prophylaxis or treatment of fungal infections during&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Therefore, these two factors will be considered in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common side effect after using venetoclax is neutropenia. About 60.8% of patients&#xD;
      developed any grades neutropenia, 43.3% required dose interruption, 8.2% required dosage&#xD;
      reduction, and 2.6% required permanent treatment discontinuation because of neutropenia in&#xD;
      phase 3 MURANO trial. Recent studies have found that the probability of ≥ grade 3 neutropenia&#xD;
      and infection seems to be inversely related to the blood concentration of venetoclax, that&#xD;
      is, the higher the blood concentration of venetoclax, the lower the probability of&#xD;
      neutropenia and infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study is designed to examine the plasma concentration of venetoclax in&#xD;
      patients with CLL or AML, to create a pharmacokinetic model of venetoclax in Chinese&#xD;
      population, and to analyze the extent to which CYP enzyme inhibitors and inducers may have&#xD;
      effect on venetoclax plasma concentration. Moreover, the association between therapeutic&#xD;
      effectiveness, adverse events, and venetoclax plasma concentration will also be analyzed in&#xD;
      this study, and the final purpose is to establish the principle of clinical dose adjustment&#xD;
      in the future.&#xD;
