  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose that immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS)&#xD;
      is predicated upon the early loss of blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity with subsequent&#xD;
      monocyte infiltration leading to cross-activation of native glial cells. Glial&#xD;
      overstimulation leads to neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and ultimately neuronal&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;

    <description>This includes serum (GFAP and NfL) and CSF biomarkers (NfL, VILIP-1, YKL-40, TREM2, and Neurogranin) measured using a single molecule array in pg/ml&#xD;
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize a given biomarker level at different time points.</description>

    <description>-Serum (GFAP, NfL) and CSF biomarkers (NfL, VILIP-1, YKL-40, TREM2, and Neurogranin) as measured using a single molecule array in pg/ml will be compared between participants who develop ICANS compared to participants who do not develop ICANS using descriptive statistics</description>

    <measure>Cross-sectional imaging profile</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to up to 180 days post-transfusion (estimated to be 7 months)</time_frame>
    <description>-Diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) separates the point diffusion properties of water by magnitude and direction to provide a non-invasive measurement of cellularity, extracellular edema, and axonal integrity/myelination in μm^2/msec. All three components will then be compared between participants who develop ICANS compared to participants who do not develop ICANS using descriptive statistics</description>

    <measure>Cytokine profiles</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to up to 180 days post-transfusion (estimated to be 7 months)</time_frame>
    <description>-Elisa-based assays will measure the CSF cytokine profile measurements of IL-2, IL-6, IL10, IFN-y, TNFα, GM-CSF (ng/ml), with descriptive statistics used to compare between participants who develop ICANS compared to participants who do not develop ICANS</description>

    <measure>Changes in cognitive assessment as measured by Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 30 days, 90 days, and 180 days post-transfusion (estimated to be 7 months)</time_frame>
    <description>-The SDMT is a brief written test where participants use a key to match abstract symbols paired with numbers. The scale ranges from 0 to 110, with higher scores reflecting better function. By doing so, an indirect measure of attention, processing speed, motor speed, and visual scanning is obtained. Scores on formal testing will be then be analyzed in conjunction with quantification of imaging features (as parceled using DBSI) observed between participants who develop ICANS compared to participants who do not develop ICANs</description>

    <measure>Changes in cognitive assessment as measured by Trail Making Test A/B</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 30 days, 90 days, and 180 days post-transfusion (estimated to be 7 months)</time_frame>
    <description>This brief written test has participants connect lines between sequential numbers and/or letters in a given pattern. By doing so, an indirect measure of executive function tests task switching, visual search, scanning, processing speed, and visual attention is obtained. Scores on formal testing will be then be analyzed in conjunction with quantification of imaging features (as parceled using DBSI) observed between participants who develop ICANS compared to participants who do not develop ICANs</description>

    <measure>Changes in cognitive assessment as measured by Letter-Number Sequencing</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 30 days, 90 days, and 180 days post-transfusion (estimated to be 7 months)</time_frame>
    <description>-This brief cognitive test has participants listen to variable length strings of alphanumeric characters and repeat the characters back verbally in a specific order. They are then scored on the number of correct responses. Scores range from 0 to 21, with higher scores associated with improved cognitive function.&#xD;
By doing so, a direct measure of working memory is obtained. Scores on formal testing will be then be analyzed in conjunction with quantification of imaging features (as parceled using DBSI) observed between participants who develop ICANS compared to participants who do not develop ICANs</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in cognitive assessment as measured by Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Received (HVLT-R3)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 30 days, 90 days, and 180 days post-transfusion (estimated to be 7 months)</time_frame>
    <description>-This approximately 30 minute long cognitive test has participants learn and free-recall a collection of words from different categories. By doing so, a direct measure of recall and memory is obtained. Scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating improved cognitive function. Scores on formal testing will be then be analyzed in conjunction with quantification of imaging features (as parceled using DBSI) observed between participants who develop ICANS compared to participants who do not develop ICANs</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in cognitive assessment as measured by Montreal-Cognitive Assessment (MocA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 30 days, 90 days, and 180 days post-transfusion (estimated to be 7 months)</time_frame>
    <description>-This approximately 15 minute long cognitive test consists of both written and verbal sections. Participants are scored on the number of correct answers out of 30 (i.e. scores range from 0-30), with higher scores reflecting improved cognitive performance. By doing so, an indirect measure surveying multiple cognitive domains is obtained. Scores on formal testing will be then be analyzed in conjunction with quantification of imaging features (as parceled using DBSI) observed between participants who develop ICANS compared to participants who do not develop ICANs</description>

    <description>Participants will undergo baseline examination followed by evaluations between Days 3 and 5 post-transfusion, on Day 30 post-transfusion date (PTD), PTD 90, and PTD 180. At baseline this will include plasma testing, lumbar puncture (voluntary), neuroimaging (voluntary) and neuropsychiatric performance testing (voluntary). Between post-transfusion Day 3 and day 5, participants will undergo repeat exam, plasma testing, lumbar puncture (voluntary), and neuroimaging (voluntary). Day 30 testing will again test all modalities, including serum, CSF/lumbar puncture (voluntary), brain imaging (voluntary), and formal neuropsychiatric performance testing (voluntary). Finally, Day 90 and 180 will repeat serum testing, brain imaging, and formal neuropsychological performance testing.</description>
