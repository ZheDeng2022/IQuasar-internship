  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with sphincter saving procedures of rectal cancer usually experience intestinal&#xD;
      dysfunction, including difficulty emptying the bowel and faecal incontinence, leading to a&#xD;
      detriment in the quality of life. A prospective study is proposed to measure de feasibility&#xD;
      and the impact of a continuous care programme for the prevention or reduction of intestinal&#xD;
      dysfunction disorders. The intervention lies on prehabilitation and rehabilitation with&#xD;
      physiotherapy, biofeedback and neuromodulation, is assisted by a telematic information system&#xD;
      (APP for the monitoring of education on physiotherapy and surveillance).&#xD;

      -Study design: A single-arm, non-randomized prospective study that will initially evaluate&#xD;
      the compliance and feasibility of a prehabilitation and / or functional rehabilitation&#xD;
      program in patients with anterior rectal resection with mesorectal excision for rectal&#xD;
      cancer. In addition, clinical outcome variables will be obtained to evaluate the possibility&#xD;
      of a subsequent efficacy study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patient selection: Participation in this study will be proposed to all consecutive patients&#xD;
      with rectal cancer who are expected to perform a low anterior resection of the rectum with&#xD;
      mesorectal excision and colorectal anastomosis with or without protective ileostomy, older&#xD;
      than 18 years, who give their informed consent, and who can carry out a pelvic floor&#xD;
      physiotherapy program and be susceptible to tibial neurostimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria will be a POLARS score less than 20 (LARS-minor or non-LARS), the&#xD;
      existence of residual or distant locoregional disease, the presence of inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      disease (IBD), a previous known diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) , patients with&#xD;
      intestinal resections other than the rectum, existence of anastomotic complications, or&#xD;
      inability to perform pelvic muscle physiotherapy, presence of trophic disorders in the ankles&#xD;
      (post-febile syndrome), known diabetic neuropathy, carriers of pacemakers or implantable&#xD;
      defibrillators, and with previous SNS or PTNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The package of interventions consists on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Educational session: colorectal nursing consultation, in which the inclusion / exclusion&#xD;
           criteria are checked, the preoperative data relative to the outcome measures scales&#xD;
           (POLARS, Vaizey and QLQ-C30) and the pre and postoperative clinical variables are filled&#xD;
           in of interest to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After explaining the components, phases and duration of the prehabilitation or&#xD;
           rehabilitation program, the informed consent of the patients is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In this first visit, the pelvic floor muscle rehabilitation exercises to be performed&#xD;
           are shown and supervised, recording the baseline data of the modified Oxford scale and&#xD;
           the PERF scheme (Power, Endurance, Repetition, Fast).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy (FTSP) and Biofeedback: Patients will complete three sets&#xD;
           of muscle exercises per day: slow pelvic floor contractions, maximum sustained&#xD;
           contractions, and rapid pelvic floor contractions; performing 10 repetitions of each&#xD;
           modality per series, with an approximate duration of 2-3 minutes each. These exercises&#xD;
           can be performed in any position, moment or circumstance at the convenience of the&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At each visit to the nursing consultation, the exercises will be supervised and on&#xD;
           specific dates (see program diagram) the contraction force will be quantified using the&#xD;
           modified Oxford scale, the PERF scheme and an anal manometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For anal manometry, the Anopress device (THD SpA, Correggio (RE), Italy) will be used, a&#xD;
           portable and wireless manometer that uses high resolution air to fill the probes that&#xD;
           register pressures generated in the anal canal. A standard protocol was followed for all&#xD;
           patients. Resting pressure data are recorded, with voluntary contractions, involuntary&#xD;
           contractions (eg, with coughing) and resistance pressures (the duration of up to 50% of&#xD;
           the maximum effort pressure is defined in a maximum of ten seconds). A second catheter&#xD;
           with a distensible balloon is used to measure rectal sensitivity to distension and the&#xD;
           inhibitory anorectal reflex. There will be 2 biofeedback sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As controls of adherence to the program, patients will keep either a diary with the&#xD;
           exercises performed or the records of the pelvic floor exercise program app.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Percutaneous neurostimulation of the posterior tibial nerve: For the PTNS, an Urgent PCÂ®&#xD;
           device (Uroplasty, NL) is used; the procedure will be performed in outpatient&#xD;
           consultations by colorectal nurses, following the standard technique recommended by the&#xD;
           manufacturer. Stimulation is carried out using a 34 G needle electrode inserted at a&#xD;
           cranial point 3-4 cm and 2 cm posterior to the medial malleolus, and another adhesive&#xD;
           electrode near the arch of the foot of the same leg. The electrostimulation parameters&#xD;
           are as follows: a pulse width of 200 ms, a frequency of 20 Hz, and an increased current&#xD;
           until flexion of the fingers was first noticed (0-18 mA). The program includes a total&#xD;
           of 20 sessions of 30 minutes each, once a week for 12 consecutive weeks, followed by 4&#xD;
           additional sessions once every 15 days for the next 2 months and 4 additional sessions&#xD;
           once a month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. APP that allows physiotherapy education and monitoring of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical variables and outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measures will be the POLARS predictive score of the LARS, Vaizey (St. Mark's) of&#xD;
      fecal incontinence and the EORTC QLQ-30 of quality of life, obtained perioperatively, and the&#xD;
      LARS, Vayzey and QLQ-30 scales at 6 months and year of surgery or closure of the protective&#xD;
      stoma. As measurements of the FTSP, the results of the anal manometries, the modified Oxford&#xD;
      scale and the PERF scheme will be obtained. Adherence to the FTSP program will be evaluated&#xD;
      by the percentage of compliance with the exercises according to the patients' diary or from&#xD;
      the records of the pelvic floor app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the degree of acceptability to the program, the percentage of patients who leave it&#xD;
      voluntarily, totally or partially, will be evaluated, as well as using a visual analog scale&#xD;
      (VAS) obtained at the end of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be recorded as clinical variables: 1) sex; 2) age; 3) BMI; 4) date of&#xD;
      rectal resection; 5) performance or not of protection stoma and, where appropriate, date of&#xD;
      stoma closure; 6) administration or not of radiochemotherapy or neoadjuvant short-course&#xD;
      radiotherapy; 7) Height of tumor measured by MRI; 8) Open, laparoscopic, taTME or mixed&#xD;
      approach (abdominal part by laparoscopy and open pelvic part); 9) Total or partial mesorectal&#xD;
      excision; 10) Quality of mesorectal resection; 11) Height of the anastomosis (from anal&#xD;
      margin); 12) type of anastomosis (manual or mechanical, end-to-end or lateral-end or&#xD;
      pouch-end); 13) Administration of adjuvant chemotherapy; 14) Postoperative complications&#xD;
      according to the Clavien-Dindo classification; 15) Postoperative staging; and 16) Astringent&#xD;
      medication, forming fecal mass or hygienic-dietary modifications throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESULTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility and adherence to the program will be initially analyzed through the&#xD;
      percentage of compliance with the PTNS sessions and the proposed FSTP exercises performed in&#xD;
      the first 15 cases, in order to be able to adjust the program scheme and estimate a&#xD;
      representative sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study will be to compare the estimated preoperative LARS score&#xD;
      (POLARS) with the postoperative LARS score observed at 6 months and one year after radical&#xD;
      surgery (or closure of the ileostomy) for rectal cancer, considering it as clinically&#xD;
      relevant descending at least one category from POLARS- major to LARS- minor (or not LARS) in&#xD;
      at least 50% of patients. Secondary objectives will be to assess the effect of the&#xD;
      interventions on fecal incontinence (Vaizey), quality of life (QLQ-C30) and pelvic floor&#xD;
      contractility (anal manometry, Oxford scale and PERF).&#xD;
