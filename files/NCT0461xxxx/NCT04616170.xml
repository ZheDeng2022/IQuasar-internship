  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is common practice for practitioners to instruct patients to forcibly flex the hips at the&#xD;
      time of delivery of the fetal vertex. Though this is commonplace, it is reasonable to assume&#xD;
      that this forced stretching of the perineum at the time of fetal vertex emergence could&#xD;
      potentially lead to higher rates of severe lacerations and their sequelae. This study will&#xD;
      examine whether extending the hips, as compared to usual care, at the time of crowning of the&#xD;
      fetal vertex during vaginal delivery decreases maternal perineal trauma among nulliparous&#xD;
      women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perineal trauma at the time of vaginal delivery is a significant cause of maternal morbidity&#xD;
      including vaginal pain, dyspareunia, urinary incontinence, infection, and social isolation in&#xD;
      severe cases. There are well known risk factors in the literature for OASIS (obstetric anal&#xD;
      sphincter injuries), however, this literature is by no means comprehensive. A prior RCT in&#xD;
      2012 looked at the role of patient positioning at the time of pushing and delivery to&#xD;
      determine whether stirrup positioning and forced hip flexion leads to higher rates of any&#xD;
      perineal tears. The study concluded that stirrup positioning did not lead to higher rates of&#xD;
      perineal tearing but was not powered to evaluate the role of positioning on OASIS tears or on&#xD;
      postpartum perineal morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to lacking data with respect to patient positioning, data is limited regarding&#xD;
      perineal morbidity beyond the traditional grading system of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th degree&#xD;
      tears. 3rd and 4th degree lacerations are labeled as OASIS, however, perineal morbidity can&#xD;
      result from &quot;lower&quot; orders of perineal tearing at the time of delivery. Prior studies have&#xD;
      tried to illustrate various subsets of second degree lacerations in an attempt to subdivide&#xD;
      2nd degree lacerations into categories of severity, however, little has been done in practice&#xD;
      with this form of division and little is written on the topic of perineal morbidity beyond&#xD;
      OASIS tears.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is common practice for practitioners to instruct patients to flex the hips at the time of&#xD;
      delivery of the fetal vertex. Though this is commonplace, it is reasonable to assume that&#xD;
      this stretching of the perineum at the time of fetal vertex emergence could potentially lead&#xD;
      to higher rates of severe lacerations and their sequelae. The closest studies to examine this&#xD;
      have been in comparing women who deliver in the squatting position compared to in lithotomy.&#xD;
      Those who deliver in squatting positions have been found to have deeper perineal lacerations,&#xD;
      which demonstrate the possibility that forced flexion at the hips could lead to the same&#xD;
      outcome in the lithotomy position. Should research show an increased risk of morbidity with&#xD;
      this near universal positioning practice as compared to hip extension, this study could&#xD;
      change practice patterns for the betterment of patients worldwide.&#xD;
