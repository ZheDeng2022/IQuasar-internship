  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit participants between the age of 18 and 65 with chronic&#xD;
      non-specific low back pain and a sedentary lifestyle. The participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of the three groups. The first group is the control group, the participants&#xD;
      will be asked to continue their daily routine. The second group is an intervention group,&#xD;
      sedentary behaviour will be reduced. In the third group participants will be asked to&#xD;
      increase their physical activity up to 150min/week. The intervention takes place over a&#xD;
      period of 6 weeks. After the intervention the pressure pain threshold will be measured,&#xD;
      average steps will be measured (accelerometer) and a questionnaire needs to be filled out.&#xD;
      These results will be compared to the results before the intervention and to the results of&#xD;
      the other groups.&#xD;

      The investigators will recruit participants between the age of 18 and 65 with chronic&#xD;
      non-specific low back pain and a sedentary lifestyle. The partcipants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of the three groups. The first group is the control group, the participants&#xD;
      will be asked to not change their daily routine. In the first intervention group sedentary&#xD;
      behaviour will be reduced. The participants will be asked to download an app on their&#xD;
      smartphone and computer. This app will ask the participants to stand up and walk during 2&#xD;
      minutes to interrupt their sedentary behaviour during working hours. In the second&#xD;
      intervention group participants will be asked to increase their physical activity. More&#xD;
      specifically the participants will be asked to be active for a period of 150min/week. The&#xD;
      intervention takes place over a period of 6 weeks. During these 6 weeks the participants&#xD;
      needs to wear an accelerometer the first and the last week of the intervention. The week&#xD;
      before the intervention a pre-measurement will take place, this means that the participant&#xD;
      needs to wear an accelerometer during a week, fill out a questionnaire (BPI and SF-36) and&#xD;
      the pressure pain threshold will be measured. After the intervention (6 weeks) the pressure&#xD;
      pain threshold will be measured, average steps will be measured (accelerometer) and a&#xD;
      questionnaire needs to be filled out. These results will be compared to the results before&#xD;
      the intervention and to the results of the other groups. With this study the investigators&#xD;
      will investigate whether less sedentary behavior or more physical activity are beneficial for&#xD;
      chronic low-back pain.&#xD;

    <description>Since chronic pain is a rather fluctuating condition, the question &quot;Please rate your pain by circling the one number that best describes your pain on AVERAGE&quot; is used as primary outcome measure to evaluate pain intensity. The answer to this question is formulated on an 11-point (i.e. 0-10) numeric rating scale (NRS), which is recommended as a core outcome measure in clinical trials of chronic pain. 0 indicates no pain, 10 indicates the worst pain imaginable.</description>
