  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use point of care (POC) gastric ultrasound to confirm that nasojejunal tube&#xD;
      (NJ) feeds result in minimal to no gastric content and therefore are low risk for aspiration&#xD;
      and should be allowed at the very least to decrease the time that enteral feeds need to be&#xD;
      held prior to a procedure or if they need to be held at all. This would allow critically ill&#xD;
      children to receive the nutrition that they need to heal for longer periods of time. Using&#xD;
      ultrasound would also potentially eliminate the need for exposure to x-rays to confirm tube&#xD;
      placement. Most ICUs have a POC ultrasound machine so this would be any easy tool to access&#xD;
      to improve patient care.&#xD;
