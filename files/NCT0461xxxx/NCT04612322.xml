  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The evidence above demonstrates that microvascular dysfunction is an important determinant of&#xD;
      patient prognosis, which however remains poorly classified. Given the high burden of disease&#xD;
      and the severity of the functional impairment in these patients, the lack of a clear&#xD;
      definition for this disease has a potentially large clinical importance. It is important to&#xD;
      better describe the phenotype of these patients, identify the predictors of prognosis, and&#xD;
      determine the impact of diagnosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as prospective registry. Patients with angina CCS II-IV undergoing&#xD;
      assessment of microvascular function will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study does not interfere with the medical standards at the sites with regards to patient&#xD;
      treatment or follow-up care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration and schedule The duration of this study is expected to be 7 years. The subject&#xD;
      recruitment is planned to start in January 2020 and end in January 2022. The actual overall&#xD;
      study duration or subject recruitment period may differ from these time periods. Per-patient,&#xD;
      the duration of participation will be up to 5 years. Patients will be evaluated at hospital&#xD;
      discharge, at 12 months and 5 years (the latter two as telephone contacts).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects and study centers It is planned to enroll 1000 subjects in the registry&#xD;
      based on power calculations as described. Recruitment and treatment of subjects is expected&#xD;
      to be performed in 10 study centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint The primary endpoint is the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, rehospitalization for angina or heart failure, and unplanned coronary angiography&#xD;
      at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints Each of the components of the primary endpoint Seattle Angina&#xD;
      Questionnaire SAQ-7 Physical limitation scale SAQ-7 angina stability scale SAQ-7 angina&#xD;
      frequency scale SAQ-7 angina quality of life EQ-5D-5L Beck depression inventory&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SAQ-7 &quot;angina frequency&quot; domain has been shown to correlate to improvements in&#xD;
      microvascular function in the WISE study. SAQ-7-7 has been also used in a number of studies,&#xD;
      including the ISCHEMIA study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other patient questionnaires are also standardized tests for the assessment of quality of&#xD;
      life, depression and symptom severity in coronary artery disease studies.&#xD;
