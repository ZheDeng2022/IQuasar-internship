  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite some controversial results, many patients and animal studies have suggested&#xD;
      significant benefit of using hypothermia treatment in stroke patient population. However,&#xD;
      certain questions for how to applying this therapy properly such as when to start, what is&#xD;
      the optimal temperature, how long is the duration, and what is the best hypothermia&#xD;
      technology that may avoid the complications including focal soft tissue injuries are still&#xD;
      remain questioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will utilize the linear relationship of temperature vs. chemical shift in&#xD;
      MR Spectroscopy to measure the brain temperatures in normal men.&#xD;

      Brain temperature has an interactive relationship with brain cell metabolism. Hypothermia is&#xD;
      a known neuronal protectant therapy. It has been proven to be effective in reducing the brain&#xD;
      injury in patients post cardiac arrest. However, the role of hypothermia in brain or spinal&#xD;
      cord injury such as in either hemorrhagic or ischemic condition remains unclear. Many&#xD;
      questions on hypothermia are unanswered. For example, what is the optimal low temperature in&#xD;
      order to have the maximum therapeutic effect? How long should hypothermia be applied for? Is&#xD;
      there a regional temperature difference between different parts of brain in physiological or&#xD;
      pathological conditions? In order to answer these questions, the first step is to have a&#xD;
      reliable way of measuring brain temperature accurately. However, invasive technique such as&#xD;
      inserting temperature probe to different parts of brain is not practical. Using body core&#xD;
      temperature to estimate the intracranial temperature is inaccurate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish a noninvasive means to obtain and monitor brain temperature in a dynamic&#xD;
      environment is the essential step in order to studying hypothermia and answering the&#xD;
      questions mentioned earlier. MRI brain thermometry is a fast, direct and non-invasive method&#xD;
      to estimate the brain temperature with great accuracy. This technique is based on several&#xD;
      temperature dependent physical properties in our brain such as chemical shift between&#xD;
      metabolites and water. Currently, there is no standard MRI brain thermometry in physiological&#xD;
      and pathological conditions such as stroke. We plan to explore and establish MRI brain&#xD;
      thermometry. The first step is to establish temperature correlation on measured water&#xD;
      temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then temperature of different regions of brain will be used to compare to the standardized&#xD;
      water temperature in normal people.&#xD;
