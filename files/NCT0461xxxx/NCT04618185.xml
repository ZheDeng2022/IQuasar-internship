      An observational study of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) starting treatment with Kaftrio&#xD;
      (Elexacaftor / Tezacaftor / Ivacaftor) as part of routine clinical care, following EMA&#xD;
      licensing (approved end of Aug 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with CF who are p.Phe508del homozygotes will already be receiving the less&#xD;
           effective CFTR modulator drug Symkevi (Tezacaftor / Ivacaftor) and will switch to&#xD;
           KaftrioTM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are who are compound heterozygotes with at least 1 copy of p.Phe508del&#xD;
           currently have access to no effective CFTR modulator and will be starting a CFTR&#xD;
           modulator (Kaftrio) for the first time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants attend a study visit before Kaftrio treatment commences, followed by visits at&#xD;
      12 and 24 weeks after starting treatment. At each visit they will be scanned before and after&#xD;
      standardised meals in the morning and mid-day (11 scans in total over 6 hours). No&#xD;
      intravenous contrast or bowel preparation will be used. Participants will complete&#xD;
      questionnaires on gastrointestinal symptoms as well as providing stool and sputum samples for&#xD;
      assessment of microbiome and stool for inflammatory mediators and pancreatic function&#xD;
      (elastase).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study to observe the effects of Kaftrio (Elexacaftor / Tezacaftor /&#xD;
      Ivacaftor) on the gut in people with CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend 3 times (pre-Kaftrio, at 12 weeks of Kaftrio and at 24 weeks of&#xD;
      Kaftrio) for MRI scanning at the Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, after an overnight fast.&#xD;
      On this day, participants will be asked to withhold any medicines directly altering bowel&#xD;
      habit such as laxatives. They will continue to take pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy and&#xD;
      other medications for CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will use the same MRI protocol as described in GIFT-CF (NCT03566550 and&#xD;
      NCT04006873). Participants will have their first MRI scan fasted. After the first scan, they&#xD;
      will eat a first standardised meal . They will then have 7 MRI scans at half hourly intervals&#xD;
      and 3 MRI scans at hourly intervals. Participants will be given a second standardised meal&#xD;
      after their ninth MRI scan. Each MRI scan will last approximately 15 minutes. After each MRI&#xD;
      scan, participants will complete a validated gastrointestinal symptom questionnaire&#xD;
      (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale). In between scans, participants will have access to&#xD;
      an adjacent room with Wifi and television access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will also complete gut symptom questionnaires relating to the preceding 2 weeks and a 3&#xD;
      day food diary. They will also provide a sputum and stool sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infection control requirements mean that only 1 participant will attend for MRI scanning per&#xD;
      day. Extra COVID-19 precautions will also be taken throughout scan days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ***Please note, due to the timing of EMA approval for Kaftrio and ethics approval for the&#xD;
      study granted on 21st Ocober 2020, the clinicaltrials.gov registration was created on 21st&#xD;
      October 2020 and approved by the clinicaltrials.gov PRS team on 4th November 2020.***&#xD;
