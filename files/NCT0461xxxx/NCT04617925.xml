  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 2 study in subjects with previously treated&#xD;
      patients with light chain (AL) amyloidosis in need for therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 35 subjects will receive therapy with belantamab mafodotin. Subject&#xD;
      participation will include a Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase, a Post-Treatment Observation&#xD;
      Phase, and a Long-term Follow-up Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A safety run-in will be conducted in 6 subjects treated with belantamab mafodotin for at&#xD;
      least 1 cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the two-stage statistical design of the study, an interim analysis of efficacy&#xD;
      will occur. If after 15 patients have been enrolled at least 3 complete or very good partial&#xD;
      responses have been recorded, the accrual will continue until all planned patients have been&#xD;
      enrolled&#xD;
