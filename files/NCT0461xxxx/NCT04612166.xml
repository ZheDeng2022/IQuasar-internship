  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls are the leading cause of unintentional fatal and nonfatal injury among older adults in&#xD;
      the United States. In Iowa, rates of fall-related deaths and hospitalizations among older&#xD;
      adults are higher than the national average. More than one-third of older adults fall each&#xD;
      year in the U.S., and many of these falls result in injury, decreased or permanent loss of&#xD;
      functioning, loss of independence and a fear of falling. Certain medications, including those&#xD;
      that affect the central nervous system (CNS), increase the risk of a fall among older adults&#xD;
      and that interventions targeting withdrawal of these medications reduce falls and&#xD;
      fall-related injuries. Also, reaching high-risk older adults, including those living in rural&#xD;
      communities, with falls prevention programs can be challenging. On their own, older adults do&#xD;
      not typically engage in falls prevention behaviors and often report that limited support from&#xD;
      healthcare providers is a barrier to participation in falls prevention programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of the proposed study is to develop a sustainable program for healthcare&#xD;
      systems to reduce fatal and nonfatal falls among high-risk older adults living independently&#xD;
      in their communities. The objective of the proposed study is to examine how a medication care&#xD;
      plan, grounded in established medication deprescribing and tapering frameworks, can be&#xD;
      implemented in primary care clinics to reduce medically-treated falls among older adults&#xD;
      living in rural Iowa communities. The proposed study is a collaboration between researchers&#xD;
      and clinical pharmacists at the University of Iowa and a clinical team from the MercyOneSM&#xD;
      Health Network, which is a non-academic healthcare system with significant reach into rural&#xD;
      Iowa communities.&#xD;

      Intervention and Control Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A University of Iowa (UIowa) researcher will mail a welcome packet to the intervention and&#xD;
      control participants, which includes documents described in VII.D.29 and attached in this&#xD;
      application. A UIowa pharmacy technician will call the intervention and control participants&#xD;
      to conduct the baseline assessment interview during the scheduled interview time (scheduled&#xD;
      during the screening call). If the participant is not available during the scheduled time,&#xD;
      the pharmacy technician will reschedule the baseline assessment interview. The baseline&#xD;
      assessment interview will take approximately 30 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      after the baseline assessment is complete, a study pharmacist will review the baseline&#xD;
      assessment and will create a medication action plan (MAP) to guide the participant's taper.&#xD;
      Once drafted, the MAP will be sent to the participant's primary care physician for approval&#xD;
      over the secure DataShop system. The provider can approve the MAP, approve the MAP with&#xD;
      modifications, or decline the MAP recommendations. The pharmacist will make needed&#xD;
      modifications or negotiate modifications with the primary care provider through the Datashop&#xD;
      system. Once the MAP is approved by the participant's primary care provider, the pharmacist&#xD;
      will contact the participant to review the approved MAP. This review will take about 30&#xD;
      minutes. The participant can then approve the MAP, request modifications, or decline the MAP.&#xD;
      If modifications are needed, a revised MAP will be sent to the primary care physician for&#xD;
      approval. The UIowa pharmacist, participant and participant's primary care provider must&#xD;
      agree on the MAP before a MercyOneSM study health coach sets up an initial visit with the&#xD;
      participant. If at any point the provider refuses to approve the plan or the participant&#xD;
      refuses to move forward with the medication action plan, the participant will still be asked&#xD;
      to complete the monthly falls calendars. An example Medication Action Plan is included in&#xD;
      this application (titled: Medication Action Plan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a medication action plan is agreed upon, a MercyOneSM study health coach will contact&#xD;
      the participant and set up an in-person visit at the clinic to which the participant is&#xD;
      attributed. During this visit the study health coach will complete the initial visit&#xD;
      worksheet (titled: Initial Visit Worksheet) with the participant and review potential&#xD;
      withdrawal symptoms and the tapering schedule outlined in the medication action plan. The&#xD;
      health coach will answer any questions the participant may have during this meeting as well.&#xD;
      The initial visit will take about one hour. Follow up calls between the participant and the&#xD;
      study health coach will continue throughout the taper to discuss progress and assess any&#xD;
      adverse symptoms (titled Follow Up Worksheet). The call schedule for this will depend on&#xD;
      tapering schedule designated by the UIowa pharmacist based on type of medication, dose and&#xD;
      withdrawal symptoms. Each follow-up call will take about 5-10 minutes. Note that study health&#xD;
      coaches are from MercyOneSM. UIowa will need to establish a single IRB with MercyOneSM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention and Control Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six months after the baseline assessment, both intervention and control participants will be&#xD;
      recontacted by the pharmacy technician to conduct a follow up interview (titled: Follow Up&#xD;
      Assessment). If the participant is not interested in completing the follow up interview, they&#xD;
      can refuse (and the pharmacy technician will ensure the participant understands that&#xD;
      participation in the study is completely voluntary). The follow up interview will take about&#xD;
      15-20 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also be asked to complete monthly falls calendars for 2 years following&#xD;
      completion of the baseline assessment interview. The will be encouraged to complete the&#xD;
      calendar on a daily basis. Depending on their preferred method, the participant will either&#xD;
      be emailed a link to a RedCap survey to complete their falls calendars, or will be mailed&#xD;
      falls calendars with a pre-stamped and pre-addressed return envelope. If the participant does&#xD;
      not return their falls calendar or if they indicate a fall, a UIowa researcher will call the&#xD;
      participant to remind them to return their calendar or to confirm that the fall(s) reported&#xD;
      meet the study's definition of a fall. These calls will take about 5 minutes. Patients can&#xD;
      end their participation in the study at any time.&#xD;

    <description>EMR data for medically treated falls using ICD-10 codes for slipping, tripping, stumbling, and falls (W00-W19) and diagnoses of injuries commonly sustained during a fall. Fall-related injury diagnoses have been defined using ICD-9 diagnoses of injuries commonly sustained during a fall. Fall-related injury diagnoses have been defined using ICD-9 diagnosis codes for fractures, dislocations, and sprains and strains (800-848), intracranial injuries (850-854), and contusions with intact skin surfaces (920-924). We compare frequency between intervention and control groups.</description>

    <measure>Frequency of Traffic-related charges - intervention vs control group</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Traffic-related charges are publicly available through the Iowa Court Information System (ICIS), which contains electronic court information used by Clerks of the Court in all Iowa counties. The system maintains up-to-date information about charges at the individual level and includes: the offense date, explanatory codes identifying the type of offense, and identification of the individual who is charged. Traffic related charges are identified as either scheduled traffic violations (i.e., a set fine is associated with the charge) or non-scheduled violations (i.e., penalties are determined by the court). In the proposed study, two subcategories of traffic-related charges will be examined: (1) moving violations, and (2) administrative violations. Participants in the study will be linked to ICIS. We compare frequency between intervention and control groups.</description>

    <intervention_name>Medication Action Plan and Patient Empowerment (MAP-PE )</intervention_name>
    <description>Intervention patients (after consenting) will meet with a study health coach for an in-person meeting where the health coach will review the pharmacists Medication Action Plan (MAP) for deprescription of high-risk medication. The MAP will have previously been approved by both the patient and the patient's primary care physician. If the patient is on more than one high risk medication, the medication that puts them at the highest risk will be deprescribed first and only one medication will be decreased at a time. During this initial meeting, the health coach will use motivational interviewing and distribute materials to empower and support the patient in the reduction of the medication as outlined on their MAP. The health coach will then follow up with the patient on a schedule determined by the type and dosage of medication being reduced. Follow ups will decrease in frequency over time (starting with at least once a week). The patients will be followed for 24 months.</description>

    <ipd_description>Primary data collection includes: (1) older adult baseline and follow-up interview data (collected by the project team) and falls calendars (completed by older adults and mailed to the project team), and (2) interview data collected by the project team from clinic managers, clinical staff, providers and MercyOneSM administrators. All components of Medication Action Plan (MAP) delivery and implementation will be available for the project team, which includes material collected during the MAP meeting and data to monitor changes in medications as well as the final MAP and the adherence notes prepared by the health coaches. Secondary data collection includes: (1) patient EMR data available through the MercyOneSM Information Technology Division, (2) motor vehicle traffic-related charge data, which is publicly available through the Iowa Court Information System (ICIS), and (3) motor vehicle crash data available through the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) with a data use agreement.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_time_frame>The above information will be available one the patient has consented to the study (enrollment projected to begin in October of 2019) until six months after publication.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Analysis datasets that are generated from the proposed project will be available for public use. These datasets will be completely de-identified and will have gone through a series of data cleaning procedures (e.g., checking for missing data, consistency of coding). They will also include derived variables that were created for dissemination activities and materials. Data dictionaries will be developed for the analysis datasets and will include definitions of all variables, including how the derived variables were created. The project's final report will accompany the analysis datasets and data dictionaries. This will allow users to examine the original data collection instruments and data requests, understand how the data were collected/retrieved, and assess the limitations of the data collection processes and the data itself.</ipd_access_criteria>
