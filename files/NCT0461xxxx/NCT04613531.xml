  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People sometimes report that their relatives who have been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      (PD) have a unique smell. A previous study has demonstrated that PD patients do have smell&#xD;
      that is different from that of healthy people. Sniffer dogs have long been used to identify&#xD;
      criminals, and recently been used to identify subject with cancer. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesized that sniffer dogs may be able to identify PD patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's Disease is a neurodegeneration disorder that affects the life of millions of&#xD;
      people worldwide. There are multiple drugs available now that can modify the process of the&#xD;
      disease. Making a timely and correct diagnosis of PD is still a great challenge in many cases&#xD;
      even for specialists. Correct diagnosis is fundamental to the appropriate administration of&#xD;
      medicines. To help clinicians to quickly and correctly make a diagnosis, the investigators&#xD;
      aim to use sniffer dogs to identify PD patients from clearly non-PD subjects. After more than&#xD;
      one-year training of the dogs, the investigators found that it is feasible to use dogs to&#xD;
      identify PD patients from non-PD subjects. Now the investigators are trying to estimate the&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of sniffer dogs in identifying PD patients from non-PD subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this multicenter study, the clinicians and their assistants will collect samples and send&#xD;
      to the study center. One researcher alone will put seven plastic bags containing matched&#xD;
      samples (one PD sample and six non-PD samples) on a table and take notes, then relabel them&#xD;
      with random numbers and take notes again, and keep them in a confidential place till the&#xD;
      study is completed. Another researcher will take over the relabeled samples and put them into&#xD;
      different tanks and take notes. Thus, both the experimenter who helps to place the samples&#xD;
      into tanks and the dog handler will not know the nature of the samples. Test results will be&#xD;
      compared with the notes of the blind-setter after all the experiments have been performed.&#xD;
      The sensitivity and specificity of identification will be calculated. The study aims to test&#xD;
      the hypothesis that the diagnostic sensitivity of sniffer dogs in identifying PD patients&#xD;
      from non-PD subjects is over 90%.&#xD;
