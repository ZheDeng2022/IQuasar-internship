      In 2017, China CDC conducted a study titled &quot;A Study of Immunogenicity and Seroconversion&#xD;
      With Sabin IPV Schedules in China&quot;. At present, all the infants in the monitoring cohort were&#xD;
      over 18 months old and at least one year had elapsed since the last dose of sIPV&#xD;
      inoculation.Since there is no any data about the protection duration of two-dose Sabin IPV&#xD;
      schedules, China CDC propose to follow up the study cohort to evaluate the proportion of&#xD;
      seroprotection of antibody and measure neutralizing antibody titers against poliovirus at&#xD;
      over 18 months of age infants after a 2-dose or a 3-dose primary schedule of Sabin IPV in&#xD;
      Chinese children.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In 2017, China CDC conducted a study titled &quot;A Study of Immunogenicity and Seroconversion&#xD;
      With Sabin IPV Schedules in China&quot;. This study offers evidence that two doses of sIPV&#xD;
      administered at 4 and 8-11 months of age and three doses of sIPV administered at 2, 3, and 4&#xD;
      months of age both provide serological protection against poliomyelitis. At present, all the&#xD;
      infants in the monitoring cohort were over 18 months old and at least one year had elapsed&#xD;
      since the last dose of sIPV inoculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since there is no any data about the protection duration of two-dose Sabin IPV schedules,&#xD;
      China CDC propose to follow up the study cohort when all subjects are at least 18 months old&#xD;
      to monitor persistence of antibody. So that, if the antibody levels are not high enough to&#xD;
      protect children from the disease, remedial measures can be taken as soon as possible.So&#xD;
      China CDC conduct this follow up study ,to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the proportion of seroprotection of antibody against poliovirus at over 18&#xD;
           months of age infants after a 2-dose or a 3-dose primary schedule of Sabin IPV in&#xD;
           Chinese children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measure neutralizing antibody titers against poliovirus type I, II and III at over 18&#xD;
           months of age infants after 2-dose Sabin IPV schedule, compared with 3-dose Sabin IPV&#xD;
           schedule.&#xD;
