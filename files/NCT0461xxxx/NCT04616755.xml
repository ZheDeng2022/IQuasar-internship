  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After orthodontic treatment 3 different retention devices will be compared.Thirty patients in&#xD;
      each group; Group 1) Bonded retainer 13-23, Group 2)Bonded retainer 12-22 and Group 3)&#xD;
      Vacuum-formed retainer covering all erupted teeth in the maxilla. Retention capacity between&#xD;
      these three devices will be compared after 2 years of retention by measuring Contact Point&#xD;
      displacements (CPD) between 6 anterior teeth and sum of 5 anterior CPDs called Little´s&#xD;
      Irregularity Index (LII).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that esthetics, no doubt, is the major motivating factor for orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment both in adults and adolescents.Orthodontic relapses are usually described as&#xD;
      changes toward the pretreatment status. These changes occur very fast if the teeth are not&#xD;
      kept in their new position. That is the reason why, after orthodontic treatment, the result&#xD;
      must be stabilized by some kind of retention device to prevent relapse. However, after this&#xD;
      first period of remodeling of periodontal structures, comes the later period of changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relapse in aesthetic zone (Anterior teeth), is the major reason why patients are dissatisfied&#xD;
      with the results and seek for retreatment. There is a gap in our knowledge which kind of&#xD;
      retention device is more effective to stabilize achieved alignment after orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized clinical trial, tries to answer to that question. The investigators shall&#xD;
      compare three different retention devices and measure changes after 2 years when retention&#xD;
      devices have been in place and later compare the long-term results when the retainers have&#xD;
      been removed after 2 years of retention (future study 5 years ptstretention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Three months before the estimated removal of the fixed appliances, the patients&#xD;
      will be invited to take part in the trial. After gaining informed consent from the patient&#xD;
      and their custodians, the patients are randomly allocated to one of the three retention&#xD;
      groups as follow: A) bonded retainer 13-23, B) bonded retainer 12-22 and C) removable&#xD;
      vacuum-formed retainer (VFR) covering the maxillary teeth including the second molars. The&#xD;
      randomization process is prepared by an independent person and carried out by three staff&#xD;
      members not involved in the trial. The randomization uses blocks of 30. The randomization&#xD;
      notes is delivered in a sealed opaque envelope each. Every new participant picked an envelope&#xD;
      and reveal the group assignment by opening the envelope. Recruitment is ongoing until the&#xD;
      total number of participants meet the estimated sample size.&#xD;
