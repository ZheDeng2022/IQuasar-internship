  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib study evaluates the safety and efficacy of OH2 in combination with HX008, an&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 antibody, in patients with Melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OH2 is an oncolytic virus developed upon genetic modifications of the herpes simplex virus&#xD;
      type 2 strain HG52, allowing the virus to selectively replicate in tumors. Meanwhile, the&#xD;
      delivery of the gene encoding human granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)&#xD;
      may induce a more potent antitumor immune response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is a phase Ib study evaluating the safety and efficacy of OH2 injection combined&#xD;
      with HX008 injection in patients with Melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Phase Ib dose escalation trial, two doses (1x10e6, 1x10e7 CCID50/mL) of OH2 will be&#xD;
      combined with HX008(at a fixed dose of 200mg) will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Phase Ib dose expansion trial, OH2(1x10e7 CCID50/mL) will be injected individually in&#xD;
      the first week, followed by every two weeks while HX008(200 mg) will be injected every three&#xD;
      weeks after the first injection which will be in the second week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected and radiological imaging will be performed to evaluate safety&#xD;
      and efficacy during the trial. Besides, patients will be subjected to cutaneous swabs, and&#xD;
      blood/urine/feces sampling to determine virus shedding. Participating patients will be&#xD;
      evaluated for objective response rate, progression free survival and overall survival.&#xD;
