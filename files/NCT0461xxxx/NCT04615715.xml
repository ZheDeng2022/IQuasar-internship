  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether a brief prenatal clinic-based cytomegalovirus (CMV)&#xD;
      risk-reduction behavioral intervention will prevent maternal CMV infections during pregnancy&#xD;
      in women.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women will be recruited into the study following their first prenatal visit. After&#xD;
      enrollment, they will be randomized to either the CMV risk-reduction intervention or an&#xD;
      attention-matched control stress-reduction group stratified by their CMV serostatus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in both groups will attend an individualized behavioral skills session, watch a short&#xD;
      video, receive a take-home packet, receive weekly text messages for 12 weeks that reinforce&#xD;
      the experimental and control health messages, and attend follow-up visits at 6 and 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Saliva, urine, vaginal, and blood specimens will be collected at enrollment and 6 and 12&#xD;
      weeks follow-up visits. Additionally, at-home saliva and vaginal specimen collection will&#xD;
      occur at 3 and 9 weeks and once during the third trimester of pregnancy. At delivery, a&#xD;
      saliva specimen will be collected from both the mother and infant, along with a remnant cord&#xD;
      blood specimen.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Enrollment(baseline) to 12 weeks after enrollment (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in anxiety measured by the Kessler-10 Psychological Distress Scale (K10) administered pre- and post-intervention. K10 scores range from 10 to 50, with 50 indicating highest risk of anxiety.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in CMV knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment(baseline) to 12 weeks after enrollment (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in CMV knowledge indicated by self-report on CMV knowledge questionnaire administered pre- and post-intervention to all participants. The questionnaire will be assigned a score of 0 -18 based on the participants' answers, with a higher score indicating desired CMV knowledge.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of the educational intervention</measure>
