    <textblock>
      AB-106 will be administered once a day. Each treatment cycle is defined as 21 days of&#xD;
      continuous medication. Dosing will continue until any of the following conditions are met:&#xD;
      disease progression, intolerable drug-related adverse events, researchers recommend&#xD;
      discontinuation of treatment, withdrawal of informed consent, pregnancy during the study, use&#xD;
      of other anti-tumor therapy, loss of follow-up, death and other causes, whichever occurs&#xD;
      first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes a screening period, treatment period, safety follow-up and long-term&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
