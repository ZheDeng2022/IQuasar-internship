      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center study using the oral&#xD;
      ORMD-0801 insulin formulation in patients with NASH and confirmed type 2 DM. The study will&#xD;
      consist of a Screening Phase, Placebo Run-in Phase, Treatment Phase and an End-of-Study&#xD;
      Phase. Approximately 36 subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either 8 mg&#xD;
      ORMD-0801, 1 capsule twice a day (once in the morning approximately 30 to 45 minutes prior to&#xD;
      breakfast and no later than 10 AM, and once at night between 8 PM to Midnight and no sooner&#xD;
      than 1 hour after dinner) or matching placebo.&#xD;
