  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck cancer accounts for 3% of malignancies in the United States. However, the&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment for head and neck cancer is considered to be debilitating. Not&#xD;
      because of its morbidity, but due to the extremely rigorous treatment course which has a&#xD;
      profound impact on patients physical, social, and emotional functioning. Disfigurement and&#xD;
      sensorimotor deficits further compound this impact. Head and neck cancer patients contend&#xD;
      with treatments that can significantly affect their quality of life. Treatment regularly&#xD;
      results in decreased functional capacity and decreased quality of life. Physical impairments&#xD;
      are manifested through, but not limited to, disfigurement, deconditioning, communication&#xD;
      issues, &quot;swallowing, speech, breathing, and cancer-related fatigue&quot;. Premorbid factors such&#xD;
      as preexisting anxiety and depression, chemical dependency, financial barriers, and lack of&#xD;
      social support system are unique obstacles to the head and neck cancer population impacting&#xD;
      treatment and outcomes. Due to these factors, patients experience higher rates of anxiety and&#xD;
      depression, psychological distress, and fear of cancer recurrence. In fact, &quot;compared with&#xD;
      other survivors of cancer, head and neck cancer survivors are almost 2 times more likely to&#xD;
      die from suicide&quot;. In view of the aforementioned research, Roger Maris Cancer Center's head&#xD;
      and neck cancer will implement a prehabilitation program that evaluates each patient using&#xD;
      standardized screening tools and provide personalized education and interventions. This&#xD;
      project evaluates a more comprehensive and proactive multidisciplinary approach to improve&#xD;
      treatment and outcomes in head and neck cancer patients.&#xD;

    <description>We will assess whether prehabilitation intervention helps mitigate adverse symptoms (e.g., anxiety, depression, suicidality, distress, nutritional status, dysphagia, sarcopenia, and well-being) on a sample of head and neck cancer patients. Subjects will attend a Prepare for Surgery Heal Faster session and meet with a physical therapist, registered dietician, speech language pathologist, and masters of social work at pre-treatment, 6-8 weeks post-treatment, and 5-6 months post-treatment completion.</description>
