    <intervention_name>Omnipod 5 Automated Insulin Delivery System</intervention_name>
    <description>The Omnipod 5 is a single hormone insulin delivery system intended for the management of diabetes in persons requiring insulin. Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion may be delivered by user-defined settings (manual mode) or automatically adjusted in response to feedback from a continuous glucose monitor (CGM).&#xD;
The Omnipod 5 can automatically increase insulin delivery based on sensor glucose values from the continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and can decrease or suspend delivery of insulin when the glucose value falls below or is predicted to fall below predefined threshold values.&#xD;
The Omnipod 5 is designed to assist patients with diabetes in achieving glycemic targets set by their health care providers.</description>
