  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of heart failure is very high worldwide is between 1 and 2% in developed&#xD;
      countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The French Federation of Cardiology estimates that a million people are affected in France.&#xD;
      Each year in France, there are nearly 70,000 deaths linked to heart failure, and more than&#xD;
      150,000 hospitalizations with an average cumulative duration per year of 12.7 days, figures&#xD;
      which show the extent of the phenomenon. Heart failure is therefore a common pathology, which&#xD;
      constitutes an important public health issue. It requires rigorous monitoring and early&#xD;
      adaptation of treatments to avoid repeated hospitalizations. Studies show that following&#xD;
      hospitalization for heart failure, all-cause re-hospitalization rates rise to 18% within 30&#xD;
      days. In 2019, the rate of re-hospitalization at 1 year is 30%, half of which in the&#xD;
      following 3 months. The prognosis is grim with 20 to 30% of deaths within the year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The European Society of Cardiology recommends that the patient be integrated into a care path&#xD;
      coordinated by the general practitioner; and a consultation with his general practitioner in&#xD;
      the week after hospitalization and his cardiologist within two weeks. The CPAM (Caisse&#xD;
      Primaire d'Assurance Maladie) has set up since 2013 the PRADO-IC program (Program for Return&#xD;
      to Home Hospital for Heart Failure). This program must be in place before discharge from&#xD;
      hospital. A health insurance advisor comes to meet the patient, declared eligible for PRADO&#xD;
      by the hospital medical team, to present the offer and collect his approval before discharge.&#xD;
      He then contacts the attending physician and organizes his return home. A follow-up book is&#xD;
      given to the patient to allow better transmission of information between town and hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A specially trained nurse visits the patient's home every week. The duration of PRADO support&#xD;
      varies according to the NYHA stage of severity. It provides therapeutic education with&#xD;
      reinforcement of hygieno-dietetic rules, warning signs, checks compliance with treatments and&#xD;
      the necessary biological monitoring and must alert the attending physician in the event of&#xD;
      aggravation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this program are: to preserve the quality of life and the autonomy of&#xD;
      patients, to support the reduction of the length of stay in hospital, to strengthen the&#xD;
      quality of care in town around the attending physician, improve the efficiency of recourse to&#xD;
      hospitalization by reserving the heaviest structures for the patients who need them most.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The prevalence of heart failure is very high worldwide: according to the European Society of&#xD;
      Cardiology, it is between 1 and 2% in developed countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The French Federation of Cardiology estimates that a million people are affected in France.&#xD;
      This prevalence increases sharply with age, reaching 15% of people aged 85 and over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each year in France, there are nearly 70,000 deaths linked to heart failure, and more than&#xD;
      150,000 hospitalizations with an average cumulative duration per year of 12.7 days, figures&#xD;
      which show the extent of the phenomenon. In addition, the aging of the population and the&#xD;
      explosion of cardiovascular risk factors suggest that the impact of heart failure will be&#xD;
      greater in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart failure is therefore a common pathology, which constitutes an important public health&#xD;
      issue. It requires rigorous monitoring and early adaptation of treatments to avoid repeated&#xD;
      hospitalizations. Studies show that following hospitalization for heart failure, all-cause&#xD;
      re-hospitalization rates rise to 18% within 30 days. According to a report from the Caisse&#xD;
      Primaire d'Assurance Maladie (CPAM) in 2019, the rate of re-hospitalization at 1 year is 30%,&#xD;
      half of which in the following 3 months. The prognosis is grim with 20 to 30% of deaths&#xD;
      within the year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The European Society of Cardiology recommends that the patient be integrated into a care path&#xD;
      coordinated by the general practitioner; and a consultation with his general practitioner in&#xD;
      the week after hospitalization and his cardiologist within two weeks. But general&#xD;
      practitioners deplore a lack of coordination between city and hospital with difficulties in&#xD;
      taking care of their patient following hospitalization. According to the CPAM report, only&#xD;
      30% of re-hospitalized patients had contact with a cardiologist before their readmission, and&#xD;
      15% of patients had no contact with the health care system within 2 months of followed their&#xD;
      hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is in this need to improve monitoring that the CPAM has set up since 2013 the PRADO-IC&#xD;
      program (Support Program for Return to Home Hospital for Heart Failure). This program must be&#xD;
      in place before discharge from hospital. A health insurance advisor comes to meet the&#xD;
      patient, declared eligible for PRADO by the hospital medical team, to present the offer and&#xD;
      collect his approval before discharge. He then contacts the attending physician and organizes&#xD;
      his return home. A follow-up book is given to the patient to allow better transmission of&#xD;
      information between town and hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A specially trained nurse (internet training) visits the patient's home every week. The&#xD;
      duration of PRADO support varies according to the NYHA stage of severity: a patient in NYHA&#xD;
      stage I or II benefits from home support for a period of 2 months, and 6 months for NYHA&#xD;
      stages III and IV. It should make it possible to monitor the constants: blood pressure,&#xD;
      pulse, and weight. It provides therapeutic education with reinforcement of hygieno-dietetic&#xD;
      rules (low sodium diet), warning signs (orthopnea, cough, dyspnea), checks compliance with&#xD;
      treatments and the necessary biological monitoring and must alert the attending physician in&#xD;
      the event of aggravation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this program are: to preserve the quality of life and the autonomy of&#xD;
      patients, to support the reduction of the length of stay in hospital, to strengthen the&#xD;
      quality of care in town around the attending physician, improve the efficiency of recourse to&#xD;
      hospitalization by reserving the heaviest structures for the patients who need them most.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is therefore to assess the impact of the PRADO program on&#xD;
      re-hospitalization at 1 year, at Paris Saint-Joseph hospital for heart failure.&#xD;
