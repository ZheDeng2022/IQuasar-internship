    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of Sn-117m-DTPA on bone pain in patients with prostate&#xD;
      cancer that has spread to the bones. Sn-117m-DTPA is a radioactive therapeutic agent that&#xD;
      localizes to bones when given to patients. Sn-117m-DTPA may help reduce bone pain in patients&#xD;
      with prostate cancer that has spread to the bones.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of tin-117m diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Sn-117m-DTPA) on&#xD;
      sustained pain response in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)&#xD;
      metastatic to at least two bone sites with at least one clinically meaningful pain at&#xD;
      baseline (&gt;= 4 on an 11-point pain intensity scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of Sn-117m-DTPA per Common Terminology Criteria for&#xD;
      Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)5.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To measure Sn-117m-DTPA activity by gamma-camera dosimetry scans (serial full body planar&#xD;
      images) obtained at 1 hour, 4 hours (or within 4-6 hours), 24 hours (or within 16-24 hours),&#xD;
      48 hours (or within 36-48 hours), 72 hours (or within 60-72 hours), 1 week (+/- 2 days), and&#xD;
      4 weeks (+/- 2 days) after the first Sn-117m-DTPA administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of Sn-117m-DTPA at 24 weeks as measured by Prostate&#xD;
      Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate time to the first symptomatic skeletal event defined as i) the first use of&#xD;
      external-beam radiation therapy to relieve skeletal symptoms; ii) new symptomatic pathologic&#xD;
      vertebral or nonvertebral bone fractures; iii) spinal cord compression; or iv) tumor-related&#xD;
      orthopedic surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate the overall pain response rate at 24 weeks. VI. To evaluate the duration of&#xD;
      pain response defined as from the time of improvement in pain response (pain index =&lt; 3)&#xD;
      until the pain recurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To measure changes and time to progression in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and&#xD;
      serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To measure patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and adverse events (AEs) (PRO-CTCAE)&#xD;
      captured by digital instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine any tumor genomic alterations that may be associated with response or&#xD;
      resistance to Sn-117m-DTPA, a radiopharmaceutical agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To examine the changes in systemic inflammatory markers (such as interferon [IFN]-gamma,&#xD;
      tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, interleukins [IL]-8, IL-10, and IL-17) by flow cytometry,&#xD;
      and changes in markers of immune function by measuring the percentage and absolute number of&#xD;
      CD4+ T helper cells, CD8+ T cytotoxic cells, T regulatory cells, polymorphonuclear (PMN)&#xD;
      myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and mononuclear MDSCs (M-MDSCs) prior to treatment&#xD;
      versus (vs.) end of cycle 1, end of cycle 2, and at week 24 and correlate values and/or&#xD;
      changes with treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the feasibility of measuring polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) expression via&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining on archival tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive tin Sn 117m DTPA intravenously (IV) over 5-10 minutes on day 1. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 8 weeks for 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients may receive tin Sn 117m DTPA for an additional 2 cycles if pain recurs&#xD;
      within 6 months after a 16-week pain observation period and no disease progression on bone&#xD;
      scans, or evidence of clinical progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 4 weeks until week 28, and then&#xD;
      every 3 months for up to 12 months after the first dose of tin Sn 117m DTPA.&#xD;
