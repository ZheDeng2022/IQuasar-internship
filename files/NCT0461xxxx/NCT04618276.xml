  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching aim of this research project is to prevent orthopedic implant-associated&#xD;
      infections. This study aims to investigate if PDT has an effect on bacterial skin&#xD;
      colonization in order to improve skin antisepsis strategies for the prevention of surgical&#xD;
      site infections.&#xD;

      Background: Periprosthetic joint infections are a feared complication after orthopedic&#xD;
      surgery in particular in our increasing elderly population. These infections are usually&#xD;
      difficult to treat, because microorganisms persist in biofilms on the orthopedic implant&#xD;
      surface. Therefore, it would be desirable to prevent these infections. It is hypothesized&#xD;
      that bacteria from the skin surface or dermis - such as Staphylococcus aureus,&#xD;
      coagulase-negative staphylococci, or Cutibacterium sp. - are transmitted into the periimplant&#xD;
      tissue during surgery. In an ongoing interdisciplinary study with the Orthopedic University&#xD;
      Hospital Balgrist (data in preparation for publication), the investigators see that common&#xD;
      skin antisepsis preparation is not effective to eliminate skin bacteria before surgery&#xD;
      because they persist in sebaceous or sweat glands. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has recently&#xD;
      gained attention in the treatment of acne, a disease of the pilosebaceous unit, in which also&#xD;
      Cutibacterium acnes is implicated. The PDT works here on the one hand through a long-lasting&#xD;
      destruction of the sebaceous glands, and on the other hand due to anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
      antimicrobial effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous pilot study, the investigators tested if skin antisepsis is improved with&#xD;
      previous PDT with the photosensitizer-inducing prodrug 5% topical methyl aminolevulinate&#xD;
      (MAL) on inguinal skin in 10 participants. The induced photosensitizer was protoporphyrin IX&#xD;
      (Pp IX, 635 nm) activated by red light. The investigators showed a complete sterilization of&#xD;
      colonizing skin bacteria at the same day after this treatment However, orthopedic surgeons&#xD;
      are hesitant to perform an arthroplasty surgery after such a treatment due to skin erythema&#xD;
      for a few days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are entirely convinced about this novel prevention concept but need to&#xD;
      identify the photosensitizer with the ideal balance of antibactericidal effect versus skin&#xD;
      irritation. Building upon the data they gathered, they will explore PDT with the&#xD;
      Protoporphyrin IX inducing prodrug photosensitizer MAL and the photosensitizer Methylene blue&#xD;
      with potentially less local side-effects (skin erythema).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect of photodynamic treatment with the photosensitizers Pp IX (MAL) and Methylene blue in&#xD;
      combination with surgical antisepsis on bacterial skin colonization on the day of application&#xD;
      and on day 1, 3, and 5 after PDT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect of PDT on the skin microbiome using molecular techniques.&#xD;
