      The objective of this study is to determine and compare the in vivo kinematics and&#xD;
      vibroarthrography (VAG) signals for subjects implanted with Journey II Bi-Cruciate Stabilized&#xD;
      (BCS), CR (Cruciate Retaining), and Bi-Cruciate Retaining (XR) TKAs.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to determine and compare the in vivo kinematics and&#xD;
      vibroarthrography (VAG) signals for subjects implanted with Journey II Bi-Cruciate Stabilized&#xD;
      (BCS), CR (Cruciate Retaining), and Bi-Cruciate Retaining (XR) TKAs. The Journey II BCS Knee&#xD;
      System was designed to resect and replicate both the PCL and ACL, the Journey II CR System&#xD;
      retains the posterior cruciate ligament, while the Journey II XR System retains the cruciate&#xD;
      and collateral ligaments so they remain intact.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Researchers would like to retain this study data in our secure database so as to continue to add relevant, current data to our digital collection to help us work with manufacturers in the future to create better implants that last longer and will not require revision surgery. Participants will be asked if their study data may remain a part of the University of Tennessee's Center for Musculoskeletal Research data collection for use in future studies in the IC. Identifiers are automatically removed from the database upon entry into the secure server. Data shared with sponsors is de-identified.</ipd_description>
