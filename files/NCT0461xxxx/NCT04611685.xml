  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that the effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) for pain&#xD;
      relief among patients with pituitary adenomas undergoing transnasal transsphenoidal surgeries&#xD;
      are non-inferior to tramadol. We aim to launch a single-center randomized clinical trial to&#xD;
      verify this hypothesis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain is an important clinical concern and quality-of-care metric, yet it is&#xD;
      undertreated in neurosurgical patients. Approximately 40% of inpatients complain of severe&#xD;
      pain postoperatively, and only 56% of these patients indicate that their pain is well&#xD;
      controlled. In addition, pain is a common cause of delayed discharge and unplanned hospital&#xD;
      readmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pituitary adenoma is the second most common benign primary central nervous system tumor, and&#xD;
      transnasal transsphenoidal (TTS) has long taken over craniotomy to be the first-line surgical&#xD;
      approach for pituitary tumor resection. TTS significantly reduces patient's surgical trauma,&#xD;
      shortens the operation time, reduces surgery-related complications, and increases total tumor&#xD;
      resection rate compared with the previously used craniotomy. However, given that the nasal&#xD;
      mucosa is extremely sensitive, the feeling of pain is more obvious after surgery via TTS&#xD;
      approach than via craniotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opioids such as morphine and pethidine are the most effective post-surgical analgesics, but&#xD;
      they have a series of side effects, such as drug addiction, decreased gastrointestinal&#xD;
      motility, nausea and vomiting. Opioids are not an analgesic that must be used after TTS&#xD;
      surgery. NSAIDS, such as parecoxib and lexone, and tramadol are also commonly used analgesics&#xD;
      after surgery, and they are also effective. NSAIDS is a first-tier painkiller, and tramadol&#xD;
      is a second-tier drug. There is no evidence-based evidence recommending the preferred choice&#xD;
      of these two drugs. Which of NSAIDS and tramadol has the better analgesic effect and which&#xD;
      drug brings lower side effects to patients is still unclear. The clinical application of the&#xD;
      two drugs is entirely based on the personal habits of the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we plan to conduct a prospective randomized controlled trial to explore: whether&#xD;
      the analgesic effect of NSAIDS is non-inferior than tramadol; and whether the side effects of&#xD;
      NSAIDS are not higher than tramadol. This result will guide us in clinical pain management&#xD;
      for patients with pituitary adenomas after surgery via TTS approach.&#xD;
