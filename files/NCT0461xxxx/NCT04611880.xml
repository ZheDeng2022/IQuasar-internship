      This is a Phase 2 trial that will test the efficacy and safety of crizanlizumab for the&#xD;
      treatment of retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukoencephalopathy (RVCL), a very rare and&#xD;
      uniformly fatal genetic condition that affects the microvasculature, especially of the brain&#xD;
      and eye. There currently is no treatment for RVCL. A maximum of 20 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukoencephalopathy (RVCL) is a very rare and uniformly&#xD;
      fatal genetic condition that affects the microvasculature, especially of the brain and eye.&#xD;
      Symptoms begin in adulthood (usually in the mid-30s to early 40s) and include loss of vision,&#xD;
      mini-strokes, and dementia. Other patients have suffered from microvascular disease involving&#xD;
      the kidneys, osteonecrosis, and gut ischemia. Some of these features of microvascular&#xD;
      occlusive disease resemble ischemic events that occur during sickle cell disease. Currently,&#xD;
      there is no effective treatment for RVCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to test the efficacy of RVCL patients treated with crizanlizumab, a&#xD;
      humanized monoclonal anti-P-selectin antibody that prevents leukocyte adhesion to the&#xD;
      vascular endothelium, thereby limiting risk of microvascular occlusion. P-selectin is&#xD;
      mobilized to the surface of activated vascular endothelial cells and promotes leukocyte&#xD;
      adhesion to the blood vessel wall. The Miner laboratory has preliminarily observed a&#xD;
      correlation with levels of soluble P-selectin and the number of brain lesions in patients&#xD;
      with RVCL. Since leukocyte adhesion to the vascular endothelium promotes microvascular&#xD;
      occlusion, we will determine if crizanlizumab will help to limit ischemia and brain lesions&#xD;
      in patients with RVCL. This may lead to the development of fewer ischemic brain and eye&#xD;
      lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 20 RVCL patients will receive intravenous infusions of crizanlizumab 5 mg/kg at weeks 1&#xD;
      and 3. Thereafter, patients will receive crizanlizumab 5 mg/kg every 28 days for a total of&#xD;
      24 total months. Monitoring will include standard-of-care serial MRI as well as&#xD;
      standard-of-care eye disease monitoring at pre-defined intervals. High-risk medication&#xD;
      monitoring will include blood work monitoring (CBC/CMP) 1 month after initiation of treatment&#xD;
      and every 3 months thereafter. Standard-of-care assessments will be performed including&#xD;
      radiological and physical examinations as well as eye imaging and examinations. Patients will&#xD;
      be followed for at least 2 years after completion of crizanlizumab administration.&#xD;

    <description>Single arm study: crizanlizumab will be supplied in single use vials containing 10 mL at a concentration of 10 mg/mL for administration by IV infusion. Each patient will receive one dose of crizanlizumab on day 1 of Week 1, day 1 of Week 3, day 1 of Week 7, and then day 1 of every 4-week cycle. On infusion day, the pharmacist or designated personnel will prepare individual doses of crizanlizumab for subjects on a milligram per kilogram basis (5 mg/kg) in a 100 mL infusion bag in accordance with the Pharmacy Manual. Crizanlizumab will be administered over 30 minutes by IV infusion</description>
