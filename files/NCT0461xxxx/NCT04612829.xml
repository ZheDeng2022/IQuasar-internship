  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A thraot infection sometimes called pharyngitis can be either a bacterial or a viral&#xD;
      infection leading to inflammation of the tissues of the throat that causes redness, pain and&#xD;
      swelling of the walls and structure of the throat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The throat or Pharynx is the tube like structure that carries both food to the oesophagus and&#xD;
      air to your wind pipe (called the larynx). Infective agents of the throat most often enters&#xD;
      through the month or nose. Many of these infections are viral, other can be caused by&#xD;
      bacteria such as Streptococcus Pyogenes, or Group A streptococcus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symtoms of throat infections most commonly includes pain and a sensation of heat in the&#xD;
      throat or Pharynx.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Viral infections accounts for approx. 70% of all pharyngitis. Rhinovirus is the most common&#xD;
      cause of viral infections. The other common causes of viral infections in descending order&#xD;
      are corona virus, adeno virus, para influenza, and influenza virus. Viral infections are more&#xD;
      common during the winter month with the exception of adeno viruses which occur year round.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Viral Pharyngitis is spread through similar mechanism as other viral infections. Hand to&#xD;
      mouth contact, contact with oral secretions, and sharing common utensils, all contributes to&#xD;
      viral spread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevention of the spread of diseases is based on frequent hand washing, and clinical symptoms&#xD;
      of different viruses are more prevalent during certain seasons. Coryza, conjectivitis,&#xD;
      malease, or fatigue, hoarseness, and low grade fever such as the presence of viral&#xD;
      phayngitis. Subjects with viral pharyngitis can also have atypical symptoms such as mouth&#xD;
      breathing, nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medistus Antivirus is a medical device product with a noble impact. Kistosyn 100 extract&#xD;
      contains polyphenols, and with the help of gum arabic, it forms a protective film over the&#xD;
      mouth and throat mucus membranes. This protective Barrier lead to a physical (mechanical)&#xD;
      barrier against viruses and bacteria which prevent their penetration into body cells, and&#xD;
      their further propagation. Due to this physical effect, resistance development is not&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;
