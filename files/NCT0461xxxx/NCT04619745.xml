  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This feasibility study will assess whether a 6-month, home-based, parent-led physical&#xD;
      activity program, completed after surgical or catheterization treatment, enables young&#xD;
      children with congenital heart defects (CHD) to achieve the recommended 180 minutes of daily&#xD;
      physical activity. This study includes comprehensive measures of motor skill and physical&#xD;
      activity, intervening at a very young age, and targeting the high risk status for sedentary&#xD;
      lifestyles of children with CHD. This study will provide essential data on patient&#xD;
      recruitment, data collection procedures, the proposed physical activity intervention and&#xD;
      resources required to enable the design of an RCT to evaluate play-based, parent-delivered&#xD;
      interventions optimized to support age-appropriate physical activity and motor skills among&#xD;
      young children with CHD.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study addresses the issue that congenital heart defect (CHD) treatment in infants and&#xD;
      young children causes limitations that reduce active play opportunities, delaying motor skill&#xD;
      development, and preventing active lifestyle habits from being established in early&#xD;
      childhood. Recent research has shown that the most sedentary children assessed in infancy&#xD;
      continue to be the most sedentary children at school age. This suggests that an effective&#xD;
      intervention to enhance active play and prevent sedentary lifestyles must target children&#xD;
      with CHD in infancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that intervening during the treatment (via surgery or&#xD;
      catheterization) and post-treatment recovery phase would be optimal for changing physical&#xD;
      activity habits among young children with CHD. Thus, this feasibility study will assess&#xD;
      whether a 6-month, home-based, parent-led physical activity program, completed after surgical&#xD;
      or catheterization treatment, enables young children with CHD to achieve the recommended 180&#xD;
      minutes of daily physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes comprehensive measures of motor skill and physical activity, intervening&#xD;
      at a very young age, and targeting the high risk status for sedentary lifestyles of children&#xD;
      with CHD. This study will provide essential data on patient recruitment, data collection&#xD;
      procedures, the proposed physical activity intervention and resources required to enable the&#xD;
      design of an RCT to evaluate play-based, parent-delivered interventions optimized to support&#xD;
      age-appropriate physical activity and motor skills among young children with CHD. Children&#xD;
      who are scheduled for cardiac surgery or catheterization will be recruited during the study&#xD;
      recruitment period. The estimated initial sample size of recruited patients is 56, however&#xD;
      factoring in withdrawal rate, it is expected that feasibility data will be obtained for 48&#xD;
      participants. Eligible participants who agree to be contacted by a member of the research&#xD;
      team will have the study explained to them in full detail and will sign a consent form if&#xD;
      desired. All children in this study will complete five study visits. The first study visit&#xD;
      will consist of gaining the patient's consent and performing a baseline assessment on the&#xD;
      patient. After the first visit is complete, children will be randomized to either the&#xD;
      intervention or wait-list control study group. Control participants will follow the same&#xD;
      schedule of assessments but they will be on a &quot;wait list&quot; for the intervention, which will be&#xD;
      provided after the 12-month assessment has been completed.The first visit will occur during&#xD;
      the mandatory pre-treatment clinic visit, which is typically 1-2 weeks prior to treatment.&#xD;
      Visits #2, #3, #4 and #5 will occur 7 weeks and 6, 12 and 16 months after treatment. All&#xD;
      participants will complete all outcome measures and assessments at or after each visit.&#xD;
      Children will be given an omni-directional accelerometer to wear on a waist-worn belt for 7&#xD;
      days after each visit, to assess daily physical activity. Movement skills will be assessed&#xD;
      with the Peabody Motor Development Scales (version 2). Parents will complete a demographic&#xD;
      questionnaire, the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL51) proxy report for&#xD;
      toddlers/young children, the Social Skills Checklist, Parenting Stress Index, and parents of&#xD;
      children 4 years or younger will complete the Infant Quality of Life assessment. The child's&#xD;
      medical history will be extracted from the medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each child receiving CHD treatment randomized to the intervention group will be provided with&#xD;
      6 months of parent-led, home and play-based activity plans. The activities in the plan will&#xD;
      be tailored to each phase of treatment (in hospital, discharge to week 7, week 8 to 6&#xD;
      months), follow a standardized format and provide content individualized to each child's age&#xD;
      and previous visit assessments. The in-hospital intervention will begin when the child&#xD;
      returns to the regular hospital ward from the ICU. Play activities will focus on maintaining&#xD;
      or regaining range of motion and supporting midline crossing. Resumption of the motor skills&#xD;
      and mobility demonstrated prior to treatment will be encouraged once all treatment equipment&#xD;
      has been removed. From time of discharge to the week 7 follow up, a range of motion and&#xD;
      mobility intervention will be provided. It will be similar to the in-hospital plan but with&#xD;
      the addition of lower body mobility activities to encourage movement skill development. Upper&#xD;
      body weight bearing and lifting activities are restricted for children undergoing surgical&#xD;
      treatment until the week 7 evaluation. The research assistant will monitor/adjust the child's&#xD;
      physical activity on a weekly basis until activity is unrestricted. Once physical activity is&#xD;
      unrestricted, parent-led, home and play-based weekly plans will be designed by the research&#xD;
      assistant to encourage active lifestyle habits during the time between the week 7 and 6 month&#xD;
      visit. Each plan will be individualized to the child's age and assessment results. A new set&#xD;
      of progressive activity plans will be provided every four weeks until the end of the&#xD;
      intervention (6 month visit), using parent feedback regarding the child's progress and the&#xD;
      attainment of age-appropriate motor skills. The research assistant will also educate parents&#xD;
      about their child's assessed and desired level of daily physical activity and support parents&#xD;
      as they implement the activity plans at home. The research assistant on the project will see&#xD;
      children daily during their hospitalization, working with parents to implement the child's&#xD;
      personal activity plan. Collaborative implementation will enable the research assistant to&#xD;
      ensure accurate performance of target movements and answer parent questions. The research&#xD;
      assistant will track all data, study details and patient interactions.&#xD;
