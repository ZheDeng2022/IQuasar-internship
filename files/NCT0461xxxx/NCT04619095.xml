    <textblock>
      Background - Mental health and pain problems in early childhood are major risk factors for&#xD;
      serious mental health problems into adulthood. These long-term effects point toward the&#xD;
      essential need for prevention and early intervention to curbing the rising tide of global&#xD;
      mental health disease. New approaches to child and adolescent mental health are urgently&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study focus on children with functional abdominal pain (FAP), which is defined as&#xD;
      recurrent abdominal pain independent of bowel movements without an underlying medical cause.&#xD;
      This population has a high co-occurrence of anxiety and somatic complaints. The effects of&#xD;
      fiber on gastrointestinal pain have not yet been tested in this group. The investigators&#xD;
      propose that supplementation with dietary fiber (psyllium) in children with FAP will promote&#xD;
      SCFA production by the gut microbiota, reducing abdominal pain and subsequently anxiety and&#xD;
      improving quality of life. Psyllium promotes SCFA production, is considered safe, and&#xD;
      meta-analyses have identified it as the most potent fiber for reducing abdominal complaints&#xD;
      in IBS patients, indicating strong potential for reducing abdominal pain in children with&#xD;
      FAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is essential that potential mechanisms through which psyllium-induced SCFA production can&#xD;
      reduce abdominal pain and anxiety symptoms and improve quality of life are explored. This&#xD;
      study will explore 3 mechanisms: 1) activation of the vagus nerve, as SCFAs can induce vagal&#xD;
      signalling, and evidence suggests that vagus nerve stimulation can reduce pain and anxiety&#xD;
      symptoms; 2) reduction in HPA-axis responsiveness, since fiber has been shown to do so in&#xD;
      adults, and both abdominal pain and anxiety disorders are associated with increased HPA-axis&#xD;
      activity; and 3) structural and functional brain changes in the amygdala and hippocampus, as&#xD;
      SCFA can influence neuronal activity of specific brain regions and probiotics-induced&#xD;
      improvements in mental health have been related to these brain regions in adults with IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question &amp; Objectives - The first objective is to provide a dietary fiber psyllium&#xD;
      supplement to children (ages 8-16 years) who suffer from FAP. The aims are to: 1) determine&#xD;
      whether psyllium reduces abdominal pain, 2) investigate whether this subsequently decreases&#xD;
      anxiety and improves quality of life, and 3) assess associated gut-brain axis mediators,&#xD;
      specifically the vagus nerve, HPA-axis, and brain networks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods - The investigators propose a 12-week placebo-controlled double-blind parallel-group&#xD;
      intervention pilot study (n=20/group) where children suffering from FAP will receive a daily&#xD;
      supplement of either psyllium or placebo (maltodextrin). For participants aged 8-11 and&#xD;
      weighing &gt; 24 kgs, the dosage is daily 3 grams for 2 weeks followed by daily 6 grams for 10&#xD;
      weeks. For children aged 12-16 and weighing &gt; 40 kgs, the dosage is daily 5 grams for 2 weeks&#xD;
      followed by daily 10 grams for 10 weeks. An initial lower dose was chosen to allow the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract to acclimatize to the increase in dietary fiber. The dosages were&#xD;
      chosen based on the fact that this age group typically consumes 10g less dietary fiber than&#xD;
      recommended. All study measures are collected prior to, and after the intervention. The&#xD;
      primary measure is abdominal pain frequency and intensity during 7 consecutive days.&#xD;
      Secondary measures include parent and child reported anxiety and quality of life. Stool&#xD;
      samples are used to determine gut microbiota and SCFAs. MRI will be used to assess the role&#xD;
      of brain regions implicated in pain and anxiety. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia during seated&#xD;
      rest will be used to assess basal vagal tone.&#xD;
