      this study evaluates the use of Kagocel for the prevention of acute respiratory viral&#xD;
      infections (ARVI) and influenza during the epidemic rise in morbidity in Russia in the&#xD;
      2017-2018 season (epidemiology: number of cases during the period of taking Kagocel and&#xD;
      follow-up, severity of the disease, bacterial exacerbations, number of repeated episodes&#xD;
      (reinfection); patients demography; safety) in health care workers who are at risk.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This non-interventional prospective study included 204 health care workers over the age of 18&#xD;
      who had no symptoms of acute respiratory viral infections (ARVI) and influenza at the time of&#xD;
      inclusion and had not taken any antiviral medications to prevent ARVI and influenza for 30&#xD;
      days before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the study was 2 months: the first month participants took either&#xD;
      Kagocel (the main group), or did not take anything at all (the control group), during the&#xD;
      next 1 month all participants were monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of influenza and ARVI has been confirmed in accordance with the world health&#xD;
      organization (WHO) guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of pandemic influenza A&#xD;
      (H1N1) 2009 and other influenza viruses. All patient examinations are conducted in accordance&#xD;
      with local routine clinical practice and local and international standards of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By the study were analysed and compared those data between groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  demography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  anamnesis data (the incidence of ARVI and flu, the date of the lastest episode of the&#xD;
           disease, the presence of concomitant diseases, including ENT-organs, the date of the&#xD;
           lastest influenza vaccination).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  timelines: start of Kagocel's prevention - only for the group receiving Kagocel's&#xD;
           prevention, start of the disease, duration of ARVI and influenza symptoms (fever,&#xD;
           headache, runny nose, sore throat, cough), start of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  need for antiviral therapy (Yes/no)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  antiviral therapy (Yes/no, drug name)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  bacterial exacerbations (Yes/no)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  treatment of bacterial exacerbations (Yes/no)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  adverse events&#xD;
