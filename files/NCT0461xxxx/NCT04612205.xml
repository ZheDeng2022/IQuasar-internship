    <textblock>
      Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is the defined as a leakage of urine with physical&#xD;
      exertion, most commonly from coughing, laughing, or sneezing. It has a profound psychosocial&#xD;
      impact not only to patients but also on their families and caregivers, resulting in loss of&#xD;
      self stem, sexual dysfunction.Because of the higher incidence of stress urinary incontinence&#xD;
      that reach 30% of women during childbearing period, 50% in elderly women, and its social&#xD;
      embarrassing condition causing socio-psychological problems, disability and dependency with&#xD;
      higher economic impact and based on TECAR therapy had better recovery of muscle strength and&#xD;
      function in addition to there is no study has evaluated the impact of TECAR treatment on&#xD;
      stress urinary incontinence, our study aim to assess the effectiveness of TECAR in treatment&#xD;
      of such cases to decrease time of treatment and provide good results to patients.&#xD;

    <description>The patients will instructed to contract their pelvic floor muscles without contracting adjacent muscles, such as the abdomen, glutei and hip adductors muscles twenty repletion consisted of contraction and squeezing of the muscle ten seconds followed by relaxation for twenty second then rested for two minutes. The exercises program lasted for lasting 45 min. divided into 5 min. warming up, 35 min. actual treatment and 5 min. cooling down, three times a week for eight consecutive weeks. The patient will teach to contract their pelvic floor muscles before coughing or sneezing thus to prevent leakage. Home exercises through continuing practicing these contractions as frequent as possible according to her ability, at early morning before getting from bed from crock lying position, at afternoon from sitting and standing positions, at evening from sitting and standing positions and finally at night at bed time from crock lying position.</description>
