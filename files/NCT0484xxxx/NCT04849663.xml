      Material and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      16 patients from outpatient Oral Diagnosis dental clinic will participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection and hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective randomized clinical trial will be conducted on patients requiring correction of&#xD;
      gingival recession. The research will be reviewed by the ethical committee of Faculty of&#xD;
      Dentistry Ain Shams University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients should be above 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient included in the study will be with Miller class I recession defect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient having at least 1 mm of residual keratinized tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient with Systemic Problem affecting the results of periodontal Therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with mal-positioned teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pregnant and lactating women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients with any smoking habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients having bleeding problems or on anticoagulant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patients having caries or restorations in relation to the treated site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Grouping&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be randomly allocated into one of the two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      control group (8 patients): will be treated with coronally advanced flap combined with&#xD;
      subepithelial Connective tissue graft (SCTG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study group(8 patients): will be treated with coronally advanced flap combined with buccal&#xD;
      fat pad (BFP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all patients routine radiographic investigations are required. The first phase of therapy&#xD;
      formed of oral hygiene measures, scaling, subgingival debridement and correction of any&#xD;
      disturbance in occlusion needed. A periodontal evaluation should be done two weeks after&#xD;
      phase I therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A stent will be made for each defect with vertical groove located at the mid-labial region to&#xD;
      standardize the placement and angulation of probe while taking measurement. All measurements&#xD;
      will be taken with a standardized Williams graduated periodontal probe (Hu-Friedy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral antiseptic mouthwash will be used before anaesthetizing the surgical area. A field&#xD;
           block anesthesia at the surgical area is given with a lidocaine and&#xD;
           epinephrine-containing solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
           a) Recipient site preparation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A split-thickness flap will be reflected by a horizontal incision made at the papilla&#xD;
           base, mesial and distal to the recession defects. Two slightly divergent incisions will&#xD;
           be released from the end of the previous horizontal incisions with a full-thickness flap&#xD;
           starting from margin of the gingiva reaching 3-4 mm after the exposed bone then continue&#xD;
           with a split-thickness extending to the alveolar mucosa .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After flap elevation scaling, planing of the exposed root followed by root conditioning&#xD;
           with a tetracycline solution (125 mg tetracycline/ml of saline). In the study group&#xD;
           sites, previously prepared BFP or a subepihelial CT graft in control group will be&#xD;
           applied over the exposed root a single sling suture will fix the flap just coronal to&#xD;
           the Cemento-enamel junction (CEJ). Flaps will also be coronally positioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
           b) Donor site:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In study group the buccal vestibule is anesthetized in vicinity of the first and second&#xD;
           maxillary molar. The cheek will be retracted laterally and a mucosal incision will be&#xD;
           made while leaving a cuff of non- attached mucosa for closure. The incision will be done&#xD;
           throughout the mucosa and muscle meanwhile an external pressure will be applied on the&#xD;
           skin in the area of the buccal fat pad. After the buccal fat pad exposure, the fascia is&#xD;
           pierced with scissors. With a continuous external pressure on the cheeck a long hemostat&#xD;
           is used to spread and manipulate the fat. With minimal delicate traction, the protruding&#xD;
           portion of the fat pad is gently grasped and pulled outside of the incision then the fat&#xD;
           is clamped at the base and the required amount is harvested and excised to be used in&#xD;
           donor site. The incision is closed with suture .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The control group will receive SCTG from the palate with a single incision technique .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively patients will be covered by Augmentine 1 gm tablets every 12 hours and flagyl&#xD;
      500 mg every eight hours. Analgesics are given in a combined protocol; where ibuprofen 600mg&#xD;
      and paracetamol 1gm are alternating. The patient is instructed to use 0.12% chlorhexidine&#xD;
      mouthwash three times daily for two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parameters which should be measured at baseline, 3 and 6 months after surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Plaque index (PI) will be recorded according to Silness and Loe .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Gingival index (GI) will be recorded according to Loe and Silness .&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Probing depth (PD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Clinical attachment level (CAL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Recession depth (RD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Recession width (RW).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Percentage of mean root coverage (MRC %) will be calculated as ([RD preoperative - RD&#xD;
           postoperative]/RD preoperative) Ã— 100%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Width of keratinized tissue (WKT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Gingival thickness (GTH).&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Root coverage esthetic score (RES).&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Pain level will be assessed by verbal, numeric scale and by recording amount of&#xD;
           analgesic intake postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Result presentation and statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be tabulated and statistically analyzed.&#xD;
