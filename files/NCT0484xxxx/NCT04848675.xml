  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Above-normal systolic blood pressure (SBP), defined as SBP &gt;/= 120 mmHg, is the major&#xD;
      modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stroke, cognitive decline/dementia, and&#xD;
      other chronic health problems. Despite the availability of treatments to lower SBP, over 75&#xD;
      percent of adults with above-normal SBP fail to control BP, which has led to a nearly 50&#xD;
      percent increase in the number of deaths attributable to BP over the past decade. Therefore,&#xD;
      above-normal SBP is a major public health burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Greater than 65 percent of adults 50 years of age and older have above-normal SBP. The&#xD;
           number of adults age 50 years and older is rapidly increasing, predicting a continued&#xD;
           increase in above-normal SBP driven morbidity and mortality in the absence of effective&#xD;
           treatment strategies. This makes developing novel SBP-lowering therapies an urgent&#xD;
           biomedical research priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increasing SBP is closely linked to vascular dysfunction, observable as impaired&#xD;
           endothelial function, increased large-elastic artery stiffness, and impaired&#xD;
           cerebrovascular function. Declines in these functions play a large role in the increased&#xD;
           risk of chronic disease associated with above-normal SBP. The primary mechanism&#xD;
           responsible for SBP-induced vascular dysfunction is thought to be oxidative&#xD;
           stress-associated inhibition of nitric oxide bioavailability. Therefore, to have the&#xD;
           largest biomedical impact, new SBP-lowering therapies should also improve vascular&#xD;
           function by decreasing oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy lifestyle practices, such as conventional aerobic exercise, maintaining a&#xD;
           healthy diet, or reducing sodium intake, are all first-line strategies to lower SBP.&#xD;
           Importantly, these lifestyle practices also improve vascular function, in large part by&#xD;
           reducing oxidative stress. However, adherence to healthy lifestyle practices is poor,&#xD;
           with adherence to guidelines generally between 20 to 40 percent in adult Americans. The&#xD;
           greatest reported barrier to meeting healthy lifestyle guidelines is lack of time.&#xD;
           Therefore, time-efficient interventions have great promise for promoting adherence,&#xD;
           reducing SBP, and improving other physiological functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High-resistance inspiratory muscle strength training (IMST) is a time-efficient (5&#xD;
           minutes per session) lifestyle intervention consisting of 30 inspiratory maneuvers&#xD;
           performed against a high resistance. Preliminary data suggest 6-weeks of IMST performed&#xD;
           6 days/week reduces SBP by 9 mmHg in adults with above-normal SBP (i.e., greater than&#xD;
           120 mmHg) at baseline. Importantly, this reduction in SBP is equal to or greater than&#xD;
           the reduction in blood pressure typically achieved with time- and effort-intensive&#xD;
           healthy lifestyle strategies like conventional aerobic exercise. However, these results&#xD;
           need to be confirmed in an appropriately powered clinical trial with a longer,&#xD;
           guideline-based treatment duration. Furthermore, the influence of IMST on functions&#xD;
           impaired by above-normal SBP (endothelial, cerebrovascular, cognitive) needs to be&#xD;
           determined, as do the mechanisms through which IMST exerts beneficial effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Accordingly, we will conduct a randomized, blinded, sham-controlled, parallel group&#xD;
           design clinical trial to assess the efficacy of 3-months of IMST (75 percent maximal&#xD;
           inspiratory pressure) vs. brisk walking (40-60% heart rate reserve; an established&#xD;
           healthy lifestyle strategy) for lowering SBP and improving endothelial, cerebrovascular,&#xD;
           and cognitive function in adults age 50 years and older with above-normal SBP. I&#xD;
           hypothesize IMST will lower SBP and improve endothelial function by decreasing oxidative&#xD;
           stress and increasing nitric oxide bioavailability. I also hypothesize IMST will improve&#xD;
           cerebrovascular and cognitive function, and that these improvements will be related to&#xD;
           reductions in SBP and improvements in endothelial function. I also expect adherence to&#xD;
           the intervention to be excellent (over 80 percent of all training sessions completed at&#xD;
           the appropriate intensity).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test my hypothesis, I will recruit 102 adults age 50 years and older who have SBP &gt;/=&#xD;
           120 mmHg. Subjects will undergo baseline testing for casual (resting) SBP, 24-hour&#xD;
           ambulatory SBP, endothelial function, arterial stiffness, cognitive function, and&#xD;
           cerebrovascular function. Innovative mechanistic probes including pharmaco-dissection&#xD;
           with vitamin C, analysis of biopsied endothelial cells, and high-throughput&#xD;
           metabolomics, will be performed to assess oxidative stress and nitric oxide&#xD;
           bioavailability at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After baseline testing, subjects will be randomized to perform either 3-months of&#xD;
           high-resistance IMST or brisk walking. Subjects will train 6 days/week with one training&#xD;
           session supervised in the laboratory and the other 5 performed unsupervised at home.&#xD;
           Following 3 months of training, subjects will redo all the tests that were done during&#xD;
           baseline testing to assess training-induced changes in SBP, physiological functions, and&#xD;
           underlying mechanisms.&#xD;
