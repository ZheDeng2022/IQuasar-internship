  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver cancer is the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the fourth leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer death worldwide. It is the 3rd most common cause of cancer death in Hong Kong. The&#xD;
      five-year survival rates of liver cancer differ greatly with disease staging, ranging from&#xD;
      91.5% in early-stage to 11% in late-stage. The early and accurate diagnosis of liver cancer&#xD;
      is paramount in improving cancer survival. Liver cancer is diagnosed radiologically via cross&#xD;
      sectional imaging, e.g. computed tomography (CT), without the routine use of liver biopsy.&#xD;
      However, with current internationally-recommended radiological reporting methods, up to 49%&#xD;
      of liver lesions may be inconclusive, resulting in repeated scans and a delay in diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment. An artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that that can accurately diagnosed&#xD;
      liver cancer has been developed. Based on an interim analysis, the algorithm achieved a high&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy. The AI algorithm is now ready for implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to prospective validate this AI algorithm in comparison with the current&#xD;
      standard of radiological reporting in a randomized manner in the at-risk population&#xD;
      undergoing triphasic contrast CT. This research project is totally independent and separated&#xD;
      from the actual clinical reporting of the CT scan by the duty radiologist. The primary study&#xD;
      outcome is the diagnostic accuracy of liver cancer, which will be unbiasedly based on a&#xD;
      composite clinical reference standard.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Liver cancer is the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the fourth leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer death worldwide. The main disease burden is found in East Asia, in which the&#xD;
      age-standardized incidence is 26.8 and 8.7 per 100,000 in men and women respectively. In&#xD;
      2017, among the top 10 most common cancers in Hong Kong, liver cancer had the highest case&#xD;
      fatality rate of 84.6%. The five-year survival rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) differ&#xD;
      greatly with disease staging, ranging from 91.5% in &lt;2 cm with surgical resection to 11% in&#xD;
      &gt;5 cm with adjacent organ involvement. The early and accurate diagnosis of HCC is paramount&#xD;
      in improving cancer survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike other common cancers, HCC is diagnosed by highly characteristic dynamic patterns on&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced cross sectional imaging, without the need of pathological confirmation. The&#xD;
      Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) was established to standardize the lexicon,&#xD;
      interpretation and communication of radiological findings related to HCC. However, up to 49%&#xD;
      of nodules identified in computed tomography (CT) in the at-risk population are categorized&#xD;
      by LI-RADS as indeterminate, further delaying the establishment of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently studies pioneering the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the&#xD;
      field of medical imaging. A interdisciplinary research team of clinicians, radiologists and&#xD;
      statistical scientists, based on the clinical and radiological database of over 4,000 liver&#xD;
      images, and have developed an AI algorithm to accurately diagnose liver cancer on CT. Based&#xD;
      on retrospective data, an interim analysis found the AI algorithm able to achieve a&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy of &gt;97% and a negative predictive value of &gt;99%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Can this novel prototype AI algorithm achieve a better performance in diagnosing HCC in the&#xD;
      at-risk population when compared to LI-RADS? This question is especially relevant when the&#xD;
      key to improved survival is early diagnosis, of which AI can potentially improve. Currently,&#xD;
      errors in radiologist reporting are estimated to be 3-5% on a day-to-basis, equating to 40&#xD;
      million errors per annum worldwide. This prototype algorithm can be a solution to reduce&#xD;
      human misinterpretation of radiological findings.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Age &gt;=18 years. 2. Defined as the at-risk population requiring regular liver&#xD;
             ultrasonography surveillance. These include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Cirrhotic patients of any disease etiology,&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Chronic hepatitis B patients of age ≥40 years for men, age ≥50 years for women or&#xD;
                  with a family history of HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. At least one new-onset focal liver nodule detected on liver ultrasonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. Liver nodules of &lt;1 cm. Currently such nodules are not reported using&#xD;
                       LI-RADS criteria but are recommended for a repeat scan in 3-6 months. In&#xD;
                       patients with multiple liver nodules, the largest nodule will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. Patients with contraindications for contrast CT imaging, including a history&#xD;
                       of contrast anaphylaxis and impaired renal function (glomerular filtration&#xD;
                       rate &lt;30 ml/min).&#xD;
&#xD;
                    3. Patients with prior transarterial chemoembolization or other interventional&#xD;
                       procedures with intrahepatic injection of lipiodol. Lipiodol is extremely&#xD;
                       hyperdense on computed tomography and will preclude objective&#xD;
                       interpretation. Such patients were also excluded in the development of our&#xD;
                       prototype AI algorithm.&#xD;
