      Incidence and pathophysiologic hemodynamics of postoperative orthostatic intolerance and&#xD;
      orthostatic hypotension in patients receiving antihypertensives&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early postoperative mobilization is essential for rapid functional recovery after surgery and&#xD;
      it is considered a cornerstone in the so-called fast track multimodal perioperative approach,&#xD;
      which includes early ambulation, oral nutrition, multimodal opioid-sparing analgesia and&#xD;
      optimized fluid therapy. This strategy has improved patient outcome after surgery and reduced&#xD;
      hospital length of stay. Immobilization after surgery is associated with increased risk of&#xD;
      complications including venous thromboembolism (deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism),&#xD;
      muscle wasting, pneumonia and atelectasis, thereby impending convalescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, early postoperative mobilization can be delayed due to failed orthostatic&#xD;
      cardiovascular regulation, resulting in postoperative orthostatic hypotension (OH), defined&#xD;
      as a decrease in systolic blood pressure &gt; 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 10 mmHg or&#xD;
      postoperative orthostatic intolerance (OI), characterized by dizziness, nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
      visual disturbances or syncope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies investigating the incidence and pathophysiology of postoperative OI and OH&#xD;
      included mixed patient populations. Hitherto no studies have been performed looking into the&#xD;
      incidence and pathophysiologic hemodynamics of postoperative OI and OH specifically in&#xD;
      patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II&#xD;
      receptor blockers (ARBs), antihypertensive agents with potential effects on cardiovascular&#xD;
      compensatory functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study aims therefore to estimate the incidence and gain knowledge on&#xD;
      pathophysiological hemodynamics of postoperative OI and OH in patients receiving ACEIs and&#xD;
      ARBs.&#xD;

    <description>A standardized mobilization procedure was performed preoperatively ~ 1h before surgery and was repeated 6h and 24h after surgery. The mobilization procedure included patient supine rest (5 minutes), followed by 45° passive leg raise (PLR) (3 minutes), supine rest (5 minutes), sitting on the edge of the bed with feet resting on the floor (3 minutes) followed by standing using a walker while the patient was encouraged verbally to stand on toes and shift body weight from one leg to the other (3 minutes) and finally rest in supine position (5 minutes). The procedure was terminated prematurely in any position if patients experienced unbearable symptoms of OI or upon a decrease of systolic arterial pressure (SAP) &gt; 30 mmHg.</description>
