      The aim of the study is to translate the neck disability index (NDI) questionnaire into&#xD;
      Pushto, Punjabi, Sindhi and Balochi versions and o test the validity &amp; reliability of&#xD;
      translated versions of NDI among neck pain patients in Pakistan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Neck Disability Index is a state-unambiguous instrument for the description of a&#xD;
      disability. It is revised from the Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire It contains 10 items&#xD;
      mentioning various activities (personal care, lifting, driving, work, sleeping,&#xD;
      concentration, reading, recreation) and pain (pain intensity, headache) with 6 conceivable&#xD;
      answers for each item. Patients are educated to choose only one answer which most closely&#xD;
      suits their condition at the current time. The score of each item ranges between 0 (no pain&#xD;
      and no functional limitation) and 5 (worst pain and maximal limitation) that lead to the&#xD;
      total score of 0 (no disability) to 50 (totally disabled), as 0-4 points (no disability),&#xD;
      5-14 points (10-28% disability), 15-24 points (30-48% disability), 25-34 points (50-64%&#xD;
      disability) and 35-50 points (70-100% disability). The meantime to fill the questionnaire is&#xD;
      3-7.8 minutes. The NDI showed high validity and reliability for patients with neck pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By this study, the accuracy and reproducibility of the translated versions of NDI&#xD;
      questionnaires will be enhanced and thus can create a useful measure to obtain data from&#xD;
      culturally/linguistically diverse people belonging to different ethnic background as in&#xD;
      Pakistan. It will create trustworthiness among clinicians and researchers to utilize the tool&#xD;
      as a measure of what it is supposed to measure.&#xD;

It is revised from the Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire It contains 10 items mentioning various activities (personal care, lifting, driving, work, sleeping, concentration, reading, recreation) and pain (pain intensity, headache) with 6 conceivable answers for each item, so translation for this NDI is to be done into regional languages of Pakistan through a rigorous and approved process. The minimum and maximum possible scores could be 0 and 50. The higher the score more the disability is there.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To determine reliability and validity of cross-culturally adapted and the translated NDI versions in patients with neck pain of respective languages€î Reliability or reproducibility refers to the ability of a measure to produce the same results when administered at two or more interval between different visits of the patient and validity is how accurate the results are. Thus these both are to measured through various parameters to validate the translated versions as appropriate and applicable.</description>
