  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study collects data on blood neurotransmitter and neuromodulator levels of&#xD;
      subjects observing Ramadan. Additional information collected are a diet record, mood and&#xD;
      perceived stress using validated surveys at three time points: a) before starting Ramadan, b)&#xD;
      at the midpoint evaluation, and c) at the end of Ramadan. Three additional dispositional&#xD;
      factors collected at the beginning and at the end are: a) sense of belonging, b) purpose in&#xD;
      life (sense of coherence), and c) empathy (interpersonal reactivity index). The subjects are&#xD;
      also individually interviewed on their experience of Ramadan as narrative data.&#xD;

      This is an observational study seeking research volunteers during Ramadan in the Pacific&#xD;
      Northwest. We plan to recruit 10 female and 5 male volunteers. Each subject will donate&#xD;
      her/his blood (20 milliliters) at three time points: a) before initiation of Ramadan, b) 14&#xD;
      days later, and c) 30 days later (60 milliliters total over one month). Because the dates of&#xD;
      Ramadan in 2021 occur on April 12th through May 11th, the three days of the blood collection&#xD;
      will be April 10th, April 27th and May 11th ± 1 day. Due to current COVID-19 restrictions,&#xD;
      mass gatherings at mosque do not happen. This study deploys a mobile phlebotomist who is a&#xD;
      licensed healthcare practitioner who will set up a droplet barrier phlebotomy station. The&#xD;
      time of phlebotomy is determined based on the hydration status of each individual. The&#xD;
      specimens will be packed in an ice cooler and processed (centrifuged and divided into&#xD;
      aliquots) at Bastyr University Tierney laboratory and stored in a -80 degree Celsius freezer&#xD;
      until analyzed at the same time for the three time points. Narrative data will also be&#xD;
      collected through individual conversations (phone or in-person) at the completion of Ramadan,&#xD;
      reflecting on the study and any heightened sense of spirituality.&#xD;
