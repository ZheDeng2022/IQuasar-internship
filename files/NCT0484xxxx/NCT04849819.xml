  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A variety of diseases in the Department of Rheumatology, Immunology, Nephrology, and&#xD;
      Gastroenterology can cause eye lesions, and medications can also bring various adverse&#xD;
      reactions, which can seriously reduce the quality of patients' daily life, bring additional&#xD;
      economic burdens, and even threaten the lives of patients. This study aims to recruit&#xD;
      patients from the aboved-mentioned departments and conduct a cross-sectional and cohort&#xD;
      study. On one hand, we plan to compare the epidemiological characteristics of ocular lesions&#xD;
      of systemic diseases and eye adverse drug effects in patients with rheumatology, immunology,&#xD;
      nephrology and gastroenterology, and summarized some epidemiological indices such as&#xD;
      prevalence, high-risk factors, etc. On the other hand, we plan to develop an artificial&#xD;
      intelligence model after collecting certain case data. By selecting risk factors related to&#xD;
      the occurrence of ocular lesions, we aim to train models that can predict the ocular&#xD;
      manifestations of systemic diseases and medications.&#xD;

        We will recruit patients from the Sixth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University and&#xD;
        invite them to take ocular examinations in Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-Sen&#xD;
        University. The Sixth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University is a tertiary general&#xD;
        hospital in Guangzhou, Guangdong, China. It has various departments, such as rheumatology&#xD;
        and immunology department, nephrology departent and gastroenterology department, providing&#xD;
        abundant cases of systemic diseases.&#xD;
