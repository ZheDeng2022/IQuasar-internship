    <textblock>
      This was a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with caregivers of&#xD;
      community-dwelling people with dementia. Purposive sampling was used to recruit caregivers&#xD;
      from Jockey Club Centre for Positive Ageing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol would be explained by principal investigator (PI) to case managers in JCCPA,&#xD;
      including aim and objectives of the study, inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria and&#xD;
      interview questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to privacy issues, case managers in JCCPA would screen family caregivers and ask for&#xD;
      consent to participate in the study. Contact method of caregivers would be provided to PI by&#xD;
      JCCPA case managers upon caregivers' consent. PI would then approach caregivers to arrange&#xD;
      online meetings and send the online consent form to them for their consideration and&#xD;
      reference. Risks and benefits of the study and the right to withdraw from the study at any&#xD;
      time would be explained to participants before consent form was signed by participants&#xD;
      digitally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data such as age, gender, education level, years of caregiving to PWD and time&#xD;
      spent on caregiving would be collected using Google form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All interviews were conducted through video-conferencing individually. Each interview took 30&#xD;
      to 45 minutes. The interviews were started with an close-ended question, such as &quot;Do you know&#xD;
      the special approach that JCCPA has adopted?&quot; and &quot;Did the staff tell you about it at&#xD;
      admission?&quot;, followed up by open-ended questions such as &quot;What do you know about case&#xD;
      management?&quot; and &quot;Can you tell me how your caregiving experience was with case manager&#xD;
      support?&quot;. Subsequent probing questions aimed at clarification and gaining more insight on&#xD;
      their experience, was guided by the participant's responses.&#xD;

      their experience, was guided by the participant's responses. Video-conferencing software such&#xD;
      as Zoom, Google Meet, or facetime would be used for online interview. Interview would be&#xD;
      conducted in JCCPA to ensure privacy of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. The transcript were validated by&#xD;
      re-listening to the tapes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Constant comparative analysis was used for coding and category development. Incidents were&#xD;
      identified in the data and coded. Initially, codes were identified as much as possible. Codes&#xD;
      were compared to others codes. Codes were then collapsed into categories. In this process,&#xD;
      incidents in a category were compared with previous incidents. New data was compared with&#xD;
      data obtained earlier during the analysis phases. In intermediate coding, basic data was&#xD;
      transformed into more abstract concepts allowing the theory to emerge from the data. Then,&#xD;
      advanced coding was done to facilitate integration of the final grounded theory.&#xD;
