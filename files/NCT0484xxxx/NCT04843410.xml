  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy-associated peripheral neuropathy is a common complication in patients receiving&#xD;
      taxane and platinum-based chemotherapy. Peripheral neuropathy may cause the patient's daily&#xD;
      life activities to be hindered, quality of life deteriorated, treatment dose reduced, or even&#xD;
      discontinuation of treatment. In the literature, different studies have been carried out&#xD;
      using many pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches in the management of this&#xD;
      problem, but so far, any approach that has been shown to be effective in its management has&#xD;
      not been clearly defined. One of the approaches whose effectiveness is evaluated in&#xD;
      management is exercise. There have been published case reports and several experimental&#xD;
      studies examining small patient groups on this subject, and it has been shown to have&#xD;
      significant benefits in the management of peripheral neuropathy. This study was planned to&#xD;
      determine whether exercise is an effective method in the management of&#xD;
      chemotherapy-associated peripheral neuropathy in oncology patients.&#xD;

    <description>Patient Information Form: The patient information form developed by the researcher in line with the literature will be used in collecting data. The patient information form consists of 5 sections: personal characteristics, economic status, information about the health process, information about peripheral neuropathy and information about the disease process.</description>

    <measure>Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) - Version 5.0 Classification</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) - Version 5.0 Classification: The CTCAE 5.0 classification was designed by the American National Cancer Institute (NCI) to broadly describe and rank adverse reactions that may arise from a variety of causes. A rating (severity) scale is given for each side effect term. In this classification, grad indicates the severity of the side effect. The severity of adverse events were graded: grade 1 (mild), grade 2 (moderate), grade 3 (severe), grade 4 (life threatening), and grade 5 (side effect-related death).</description>

    <measure>European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The overall quality of life of patients will be assessed using the European Organization for Cancer Research and Treatment Quality of Life Scale. The scale was developed by EORTC, content validity and reliability study was performed by Beşer and Öz in our country, and the Cronbach alpha reliability coefficient was found to be r = 0.9014. The EORTC QLQC30 Version 3.0 quality of life scale is a widely used quality of life assessment tool for patients with cancer. The EORTC-QLQ-C30 consists of 30 questions and three subtitles: general well-being, functional difficulties and symptom control.</description>

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 is a 20-item assessment tool used to reveal the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy associated with chemotherapy and the effect of functional limitations caused by this problem on patients' lives. Scale to be sensory (tingling, numbness, pain, instability while walking or standing, discriminating temperature and hearing), motor (cramps, writing, grasping small objects, weakness) and autonomic (dizziness after changing position, vision, erectile dysfunction) It has 3 subscales. The 20 items in the scale are Likert-type and the answers are evaluated by giving None &quot;1&quot;, a little &quot;2&quot;, Rather &quot;3&quot;, and a lot of &quot;4&quot; points. High scores from these sections indicate more symptoms and problems, and low scores indicate less symptoms and problems.</description>

    <description>The experimental group will be taught a regular exercise program for 15 minutes twice a day. The sensory exercise ball required for exercise will be given to the patients by the researcher. In addition, visual training material will be provided for the exercise program so that the patient can repeat the training at any time to ensure the permanence of the patient education. The standard care protocol of the clinic will be applied to the control group.</description>
