  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study volunteers are asked to use the Allay Lamp routinely during the 6-week study period. A&#xD;
      web based survey is provided when the Lamp is purchased for study volunteers to complete. A&#xD;
      daily usage paper diary is sent with the lamp so that volunteers can keep track of the&#xD;
      frequency and duration of lamp usage and any noticeable benefits. At the end of six weeks a&#xD;
      second survey is sent to study volunteers to capture their perceptions of potential lamp&#xD;
      benefits with respect to headache frequency and their experience of migraine specific&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;

    <description>The Allay Lamp is a consumer product currently available and widely used in the US. It emits low intensity (1-10 lux) narrow band (20 nm) green light (peak wavelength 520 nm) that is marketed as non-irritating to users. In that context, it is not a medical device and does not require a 510(k).</description>
