  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to confirm the reproducibility that the MEDL score can be&#xD;
      evaluated by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in the similar way as laparoscopy, the gold&#xD;
      standard for the evaluation of the disease state of endometriosis, in order to establish the&#xD;
      MEDL score, a new evaluation index for endometriosis using MRI. Approximately 70-90 patients&#xD;
      with endometriosis diagnosed by imaging and who are candidates for fertility-preserving&#xD;
      surgery will be recruited retrospectively or prospectively, and the disease status of&#xD;
      endometriosis will be evaluated using preoperative MR images, laparoscopic surgery videos,&#xD;
      etc. The relationship between the condition and clinical symptoms, such as pain, is also&#xD;
      considered.&#xD;
