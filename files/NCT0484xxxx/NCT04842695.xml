  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed an investigation comparing electroacupuncture with pelvic&#xD;
      floor exercises in female urinary incontinence (UI). It is a randomized clinical trial with&#xD;
      71 women with UI and two arms: 37 women received electroacupuncture with pelvic floor&#xD;
      exercises and another arm with 34 women who only received pelvic floor exercises. The&#xD;
      investigators evaluated the effectiveness using the International consultation on&#xD;
      incontinence questionaire-urinary incontinence short form (ICQ-UI SF) Spanish version. The&#xD;
      investigators also evaluated the safety of electroacupuncture in our sample.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The International Continence Society defines urinary incontinence (UI) as the objectively&#xD;
      demonstrable involuntary loss of urine. It affects women of any age. UI significantly impairs&#xD;
      patients quality of life, limits their autonomy and reduces their self-esteem. The impairment&#xD;
      of health-related quality of life due to UI can be even greater than that caused by some&#xD;
      chronic diseases such as diabetes or high blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is common for this type of disorder to be significantly associated with depressive&#xD;
      symptoms and feelings of anxiety, which end up affecting the physical, psychological, social,&#xD;
      cultural and sexual levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UI is classified into: Stress or Effort UI (the most frequent), urge UI and mixed UI. In&#xD;
      stress UI, involuntary urine leakage is associated with physical exertion that causes an&#xD;
      increase in abdominal pressure; it occurs as a result of a failure in the urethral resistance&#xD;
      mechanisms. In urge UI, the involuntary loss of urine is preceded by a compelling desire to&#xD;
      urinate; it is due to an increase in urinary bladder contractility. In mixed UI, involuntary&#xD;
      urine loss is associated with stress and urge incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of UI varies according to the type of study, the definition and assessment of&#xD;
      UI and the characteristics of the population studied (mainly age and sex, with the frequency&#xD;
      increasing with age and in women). Worldwide, figures ranging from 5% to 72% have been&#xD;
      published; in Spain, the available data range from 15% to 42%, the average prevalence being&#xD;
      estimated at 40.6%. The therapeutic approach to UI can be pharmacological (anticholinergics,&#xD;
      alpha-blockers and topical estrogens are the most commonly used agents), urological surgery,&#xD;
      external devices (such as pessary and urethral occluder), pelvic floor exercises and&#xD;
      stimulation by electroacupuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The International Consultation on Urological Diseases recommended pelvic floor muscle&#xD;
      training as A level evidence treating simple mild and moderate stress urinary incontinence,&#xD;
      which curative rate varies 30% to 60%, although it is a lifelong treatment. Conservative&#xD;
      interventions such as pelvic floor muscle training are more likely to be used than drugs or&#xD;
      surgery while a woman is pregnant or in the postnatal period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pelvic floor exercises for the treatment of urinary incontinence was popularized by Arnold&#xD;
      Kegel (1948). It has been recommended in the treatment of stress and mixed urinary&#xD;
      incontinence, but has increasingly become part of the treatment of urge UI. It is based on&#xD;
      two functions of the pelvic floor muscles: support of the pelvic organs, and a contribution&#xD;
      to the urethral sphincter closure mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the interpretation of traditional Chinese medicine, the problem of urinary incontinence&#xD;
      may be due to a deficiency of energy or &quot;Qi&quot;. The pelvic floor, bladder and anal sphincter&#xD;
      need significant energy to function properly. This is why it is thought that acupuncture may&#xD;
      be a beneficial treatment, as it may increase energy along the urinary tract. UI can be&#xD;
      included in two syndromes depending on the signs and symptoms presented by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our investigators work compares the effectiveness of electroacupuncture on the point R7&#xD;
      together with pelvic floor exercises versus pelvic floor exercises alone.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators used the ICIQ-SF questionnaire at 3 months. The investigators aimed to find a variation in the mean of the questionnaire of two or more points over the initial ICIQ-SF 0 questionnaire. The ICIQ (International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire) is a self-administered questionnaire that identifies individuals with urinary incontinence and the impact on quality of life.&#xD;
Any score greater than zero is considered a diagnosis of UI. Scores are from zero to 24 points. Zero points would indicate no urinary incontinence and 24 points is the highest possible score and corresponds to the highest severity of urinary incontinence.</description>
