      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of mediterranean and low-fat diet on&#xD;
      hepatic fat, inflammation markers and oxidative stress in adolescents with nonalcoholic fatty&#xD;
      liver disease. This randomized, single-blind controlled study conducted with obese&#xD;
      adolescents aged 11-18 years who were admitted to Tepecik Training and Research Hospital&#xD;
      Pediatric Gastroenterology Outpatient Clinic with the diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver&#xD;
      disease. Participants were randomly assigned to the Mediterranean diet or low-fat diet group.&#xD;

      This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of Mediterranean and low-fat diet on hepatic&#xD;
      fat, inflammation and oxidative stress in obese adolescents with nonalcoholic fatty liver&#xD;
      disease (NAFLD). The study, which was designed as a single blind randomized control, was&#xD;
      completed with 44 obese adolescents diagnosed with NAFLD between the ages of 11-18.&#xD;
      Adolescents were randomized to either a Mediterranean diet (n = 22) or a low-fat diet&#xD;
      (control diet) (n = 22) for 12 weeks. At the beginning of the study and at the 12th week,&#xD;
      adolescents' blood samples, physical activity and food consumption records were taken,&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements and body composition analyzes were made, and antioxidant food&#xD;
      consumption frequency and Mediterranean diet quality index questionnaire were applied to&#xD;
      adolescents. In the controls performed at the 2th, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th weeks, the&#xD;
      physical activity and food consumption records of the adolescents were repeated and&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements and body composition analyzes were made again.&#xD;
