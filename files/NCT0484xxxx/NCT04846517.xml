  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the feasibility of off-label multilocus repetitive transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for symptoms of Anorexia Nervosa in participants between the ages&#xD;
      of 14-24. rTMS is a non-invasive, brain-based intervention that uses magnets to deliver&#xD;
      energy to the brain. The investigators will also see if patients receiving multilocus rTMS&#xD;
      show any improvements in their eating disorder, mood, anxiety, and obsessions and compulsions&#xD;
      (if present). Participants will receive daily intervention with off-label multilocus rTMS for&#xD;
      20 total treatments. Participants will also be asked to complete mental health and well-being&#xD;
      surveys, physical measurements, and 2 brain imagining scans (MRIs) at baseline, and at study&#xD;
      end. The investigators will also ask participants to complete surveys are 1-month and&#xD;
      3-months after the final rTMS session. The target enrollment for this study is 45&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Yale-Brown-Cornell Eating Disorder Scale (YBC-EDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The YBC-EDS consists of a 65-item symptom checklist, followed by 19 questions. Although the thoughts and behaviors included in the YBC-EDS symptom checklist are fairly extensive, patients may add any eating-related thoughts or behaviors that are not part of the checklist. Once the preoccupations and rituals checklists have been completed, four core questions are then asked regarding preoccupations and four regarding rituals, yielding a Preoccupations Subtotal, Rituals Subtotal, and a YBC-EDS Total Score. A provisional score assessing the patient's motivation for change can also be calculated, and has shown to be an important predictor of treatment outcome. The YBC-EDS Interview takes between 45-60 minutes to administer.</description>
