      This Trial is a FIH, open-label, multicenter trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of ETH-155008 in subjects with R/R B-cell NHL,&#xD;
      CLL/SLL and AML who previously received standard treatment or are ineligible for standard&#xD;
      treatment options.&#xD;

      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety of ETH-155008 and to&#xD;
      determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) regimen or the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).&#xD;
      Secondary objectives and endpoints will evaluate the PK and PD of ETH-155008 and preliminary&#xD;
      clinical anti-tumor activity of ETH-155008 in subjects with R/R B-cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma&#xD;
      (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/ Small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) and acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Trial is a FIH, open-label, multicenter trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of ETH-155008 in subjects with R/R B-cell NHL,&#xD;
      CLL/SLL and AML who previously received standard treatment or are ineligible for standard&#xD;
      treatment options. The study will be conducted in 2 parts: dose escalation (Part 1) and&#xD;
      cohort expansion (Part 2). In the dose escalation, ETH-155008 will be administrated orally,&#xD;
      once daily (QD) for 28 days at 6 dose levels ranging from 10 mg to 100 mg in 28-day cycles.&#xD;
      Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will be assessed during the first treatment cycle and the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be identified. Addition subjects will be treated in the&#xD;
      dose expansion at the commended phase 2 dose (RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, safety will be monitored by the data review committee (DRC) at each dose&#xD;
      escalation step and at regular intervals during cohort expansion. Continuous reassessment for&#xD;
      DLTs will help minimize the potential risks associated with the study drug. Cumulative data&#xD;
      from subsequent treatment cycles will also be monitored for late-onset toxicities.&#xD;
