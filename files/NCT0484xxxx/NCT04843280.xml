  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee arthroscopy results in significant improvements in functional outcomes, pain relief and&#xD;
      quality of life for patients suffering from mechanical symptoms associated with meniscal&#xD;
      tears. Patients are able to return to their activities of daily living, occupation, or sport&#xD;
      without significant limitations. Traditionally, patients have undergone formal physical&#xD;
      therapy (PT) after knee arthroscopy to regain function. There is a significant cost and time&#xD;
      commitment associated with traditional outpatient physical therapy. An internet based therapy&#xD;
      program allows patients to perform therapy at home on their own time schedule. A recent study&#xD;
      demonstrated that patients who undergo internet based PT after total knee arthroplasty&#xD;
      performed as well patients receiving traditional physical therapy. These findings have not&#xD;
      been studied in the knee arthroscopy patient population. The goal of this study is to compare&#xD;
      traditional outpatient physical therapy rehabilitation to Internet-based rehabilitation in&#xD;
      patients undergoing knee arthroscopy for partial meniscectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare functional outcome, and patient satisfaction,&#xD;
      internet-based rehabilitation program vs. standard outpatient physical therapy after&#xD;
      unilateral knee arthroscopy for meniscal tear.&#xD;

    <description>Investigators will be measuring whether there is an increase in participants function as assessed by the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Evaluation. This will be measured on a scale of 0-100 with 0 being the lowest level of function and 100 being the highest level of function</description>

    <measure>Postoperative Physical therapy Patient Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participant satisfaction with physical therapy will be assessed using the physical therapy satisfaction evaluation. This consist of a single question asking the participant how satisfied they are with their surgery on a scale of 0-10. 0 being not satisfied at all and 10 being extremely satisfied.</description>
