  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about whether and how brief mindfulness therapies yield clinically beneficial&#xD;
      effects. This gap exists despite the rapid growth of smartphone mindfulness applications and&#xD;
      presence of mental health treatment gap. Specifically, no prior brief, smartphone mindfulness&#xD;
      ecological momentary intervention (MEMI) has targeted generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).&#xD;
      Moreover, although theories propose that mindfulness intervention can boost attentional&#xD;
      control (AC), executive functioning (EF), perspective-taking, and social cognition skills&#xD;
      they have largely gone untested. Thus, this randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to address&#xD;
      these gaps by assessing the efficacy of a 14-day smartphone mindfulness EMI (vs. placebo).&#xD;
      Participants with GAD will be randomly assigned to either MEMI or self-monitoring placebo&#xD;
      (SMP). Those in treatment will exercise multiple core mindfulness strategies (open&#xD;
      monitoring, acceptance, attending to small moments, slowed rhythmic diaphragmatic breathing).&#xD;
      Also, those in MEMI will be reminded before bedtime that mindfulness is a lifelong practice.&#xD;
      Comparatively, participants assigned to SMP will only be prompted to practice&#xD;
      self-monitoring. They will notice their thoughts, rate any distress associated with them, and&#xD;
      will not be taught any mindfulness strategies. All prompts will occur 5 times a day, for 14&#xD;
      consecutive days. They will complete self-reports and neuropsychological assessments at pre-,&#xD;
      post-, and 1-month follow-up. Multilevel modeling analyses will determine if treatment (vs.&#xD;
      self-monitoring placebo (SMP)) produces substantially larger reductions in trait worry and&#xD;
      negative perseverative cognitions as well as steeper increases in AC and EF (inhibition,&#xD;
      set-shifting, working memory updating). In addition, the investigators hypothesized that MEMI&#xD;
      (vs. SMP) would lead to greater increases in performance-based and self-reported trait&#xD;
      mindfulness, empathy, and perspective taking. Findings will advance understanding of the&#xD;
      efficacy of unguided, technology-assisted, brief mindfulness in a clinical sample.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline to 14-Day Post-Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The 45-item PCQ assessed perseverative cognitive traits linked to anxiety, depressive, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Respondents endorsed on a 6-point Likert scale (0 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). Further, the PCQ-45 comprised six factors: dwelling on the past; expecting the worst; lack of controllability; thoughts discrepant with ideal self; preparing for the future; searching for causes and meanings. Additionally, the PCQ had strong two-week retest reliability, discriminant validity, and convergent validity (Szkodny &amp; Newman, 2019). A total score for PCQ was computed by summing the mean scores from each subscale (total possible score = 0-30). Larger reduction in score denote better outcome.</description>
