  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is to be carried out with 6000-7000 youths aged 12 - 24 in Hong Kong. The&#xD;
      purpose of the study is to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a Hub&#xD;
      project for young people: LevelMind@JC. This study is conducted by LevelMind@JC in&#xD;
      collaboration with partnering NGOs including the Boys' &amp; Girls' Clubs Association of Hong&#xD;
      Kong (BGCA), Caritas Hong Kong, Hong Kong Federation of Youth's Group (HKFYG), Hong Kong&#xD;
      Playground Association (HKPA), Hong Kong Children and Youth Services (HKCYS) and St James'&#xD;
      Settlement (SJS). It is a 1-year quasi experimental controlled study which aims to examine if&#xD;
      these hubs can enhance young people's cognitive abilities, personal strengths and overall&#xD;
      mental well-being. 1300 participants would be recruited, including 600 Hub users, 600 non-hub&#xD;
      users (but receiving services from participating NGOs), and 100 community youth not receiving&#xD;
      any youth services. Participants will be assessed at baseline and follow-ups (e.g., 3 months,&#xD;
      6 months, and 12 months); completing questionnaires and answering questions during a 3- hour&#xD;
      interview. Hub users with mild to moderate mental distress will receive different&#xD;
      psychological treatments according to their needs. For youths who are at risk for mental&#xD;
      disorders, diagnostic and medical assessment services will be delivered by psychiatrists or&#xD;
      clinical psychologists. Findings will allow us to better understand the effectiveness of this&#xD;
      kind of community-based hubs for young people, improve mental wellness training of youth&#xD;
      social workers; and in a long run, develop a community-based support model that is&#xD;
      sustainable, scalable and replicable.&#xD;

    <description>Mental Wellness Youth Hubs Intervention aims to set up a series of community-based hubs for young people to enhance cognitive abilities, personal strengths and overall mental well-being. Among the experimental group participants (hub users), they are further divided into three tiers according to their psychological distress level. Tier 1 are youths with mild psychological distress level, who will be invited to participate in some innovative and interesting youth projects and activities (e.g., board game and floral artistry). Tier 2 are youths who have moderate level of psychological distress, or at risk for mental illness. Trained social workers will offer them with specific interventions (e.g., CBT, sleep intervention) according to their needs. Tier 3 are youths with severe level of psychological distress who are at risk for mental disorders. Diagnostic and medical assessment services will be delivered by psychiatrist or clinical psychologists.</description>
