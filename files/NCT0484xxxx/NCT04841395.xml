  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronotype (or circadian preference) has previously been shown to be associated with sexual&#xD;
      attitudes and behaviors and is an important factor affecting sexual satisfaction. The fact&#xD;
      that some neurobiological variables, which are thought to have a role in ejaculation&#xD;
      physiology, are also effective in the processes of sleep and the regulation of circadian&#xD;
      rhythm, and evidence supporting the relationship between circadian preferences and sexual&#xD;
      desire and sexual behavior; suggests that ejaculation disorders may be related to circadian&#xD;
      preference. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between&#xD;
      intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT), severity of disease and chronotype in lifelong&#xD;
      PE.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study, all patients who gave written informed consent were&#xD;
      questioned and diagnosed as lifelong PE according to the definition of International Society&#xD;
      of sexual medicine (ISSM) by an experienced urologist. Since erctile dysfunction (ED) may&#xD;
      accompany PE, the presence of ED symptoms was evaluated by the International Index of&#xD;
      Erectile Function (IIEF-5), and those with IIEF-5 score &lt;22 were excluded from the study.&#xD;
      Age- and sex-matched control cases without lifelong PE were selected randomly among cases&#xD;
      attending the hospital for a checkup procedure. A total of 114 patients with PE and 103&#xD;
      control subjects with similar sociodemographic characteristics were included in the study. A&#xD;
      detailed medical and sexual history was taken, which included self-estimated intravaginal&#xD;
      ejaculatory latency time (IELT), by an experienced sexual therapist. Moreover, Arabic Index&#xD;
      of Premature Ejaculation (AIPE), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and&#xD;
      Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) were administered to all participants.&#xD;

    <description>MEQ is a measurement tool developed to measure the morning and evening sleep cycle associated with circadian rhythm (Horne &amp; Östberg, 1976). It consists of 19 self-reported likert-type items and has a rating range from 16 to 86. Higher scores in the MEQ refer to morningness chronotype, and lower scores refer to eveningness chronotype. In the Turkish adaptation study of MEQ, three different categories of circadian rhythm were defined as; 59-86 points &quot;morningness type&quot;, 42-58 points &quot;intermediate type&quot;, 16-41 points &quot;eveningness type&quot;</description>

    <description>Self-estimated intravaginal ejaculatory latency time IELT is defined as the time between the onset of vaginal intromission and the onset of intravaginal ejaculation. In the present research, self-estimated IELT duration was obtained as a result of interviews with the participants. Moreover, Arabic Index of Premature Ejaculation (AIPE), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) were administered to all participants.</description>
