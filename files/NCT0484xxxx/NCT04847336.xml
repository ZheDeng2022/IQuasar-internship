    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND COVID-19 response is heavily impacting the availability of essential health&#xD;
      services, especially services for pregnant women and newborns that cannot be delayed or&#xD;
      rapidly reorganized in other settings. In the current pandemic, due to multiple factors&#xD;
      access to high quality and timely maternal and newborn (MN) health care is threatened. Major&#xD;
      concerns have also been raised with respect to maternal rights and on disruption of essential&#xD;
      practices and increased medicalization of care, despite existing WHO guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on preliminary reports heterogeneities in practices is expected within the WHO European&#xD;
      Region, with major inequities (eg women experiencing disruption of essential MC health&#xD;
      services only in selected countries or areas within the countries, while having access to&#xD;
      adequate care in others).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With IMAgiNE EURO we aim at conducting a survey to explore the health service preparedness,&#xD;
      quality and resilience, with a specific focus on health services around the time of&#xD;
      childbirth, in the WHO European Region during COVID-19 pandemic, and to make available data,&#xD;
      which, in collaboration with WHO and other partners, can contribute in improving the quality&#xD;
      of MN health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPHOTESIS AND SIGNIFICANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This project has been developed in coordination with WHO Regional Office for Europe&#xD;
           (EURO) and other partners, and ultimately aims at making available and disseminate data&#xD;
           that can help improving the quality of MN health services in the Region. Collecting data&#xD;
           on the quality of essential MN health services across different countries within the WHO&#xD;
           European Region will help addressing specific gaps and planning coordinate response to&#xD;
           improve quality of MN care and improve MN health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The project will also offer the opportunity to develop tools and methods to monitor the&#xD;
           quality of MN health care across different countries and settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The project will establish and consolidate a research network&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Record, analyse, and describe data on MN health service preparedness, quality and&#xD;
      resilience - with a specific focus around the time of childbirth as measured both from health&#xD;
      workers and women perspectives- across different countries within the WHO European Region,&#xD;
      during COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: 2.Develop tools and methods to measure, through rapid online surveys,&#xD;
      the quality of MN health care across different countries and settings 3.Establish and&#xD;
      consolidate a research network&#xD;
