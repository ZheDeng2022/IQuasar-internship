    <textblock>
      This study was carried out as a randomized controlled experimental study to compare the&#xD;
      effect of wiping bath with 2% daily chlorhexidine gluconate and soap-free body wash on the&#xD;
      permanent skin flora of children hospitalized in the PICU.&#xD;

      Microbiota to the ecosystem formed by symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms (bacteria,&#xD;
      fungi, viruses, archaea, etc.) living in and on the surface of the human body; All of the&#xD;
      genes encoding them have been called the microbiome (Whitman et al., 1998). The relationship&#xD;
      between microbiota and many diseases that will have important consequences in human life has&#xD;
      been proven. Infection and infectious diseases increase the risk of developing complications&#xD;
      in critically ill patients, sometimes followed by death. Microbiota in healthy individuals&#xD;
      contains many different microorganisms. The microbiota that begins to form immediately after&#xD;
      birth varies according to nutrition, genetics, age and geographic region and climate. Human&#xD;
      microbiota may change after applications such as infections, use of antibiotics, various&#xD;
      chemicals (antiseptic solutions, soaps, shampoos, etc.). This study was planned to compare&#xD;
      the effect of wiping bath with 2% daily chlorhexidine gluconate and soap-free body washing&#xD;
      solution on the skin microbiota of the patients hospitalized in the PICU. This research will&#xD;
      be done as a randomized controlled experimental. The research population consists of 30&#xD;
      pediatric patients hospitalized in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of the Health Sciences&#xD;
      University Umraniye Training and Research Hospital in 2021, who were wiped with 2%&#xD;
      chlorhexidine gluconate, and 30 who were wiped with a soap-free body wash solution. Power&#xD;
      analysis was erformed using the G * Power (v3.1.7) program to determine the number of&#xD;
      samples. The strength of the study is expressed as 1-β (= type II error probability) and&#xD;
      generally the studies should have 80% power. According to Cohen's effect size coefficients;&#xD;
      Assuming that the evaluations to be made between two independent groups will have a large&#xD;
      effect size (d = 0.8), it was decided to recruit 30 people, considering that there should be&#xD;
      at least 26 people in each group at the level of α = 0.05 and there might be losses in the&#xD;
      working process. The research sample was randomly divided into branches; group I will consist&#xD;
      of 30 patients and group II will consist of 30 patients. Children in Group I will be applied&#xD;
      soap-free body washing solution and children in Group II will be applied a wipe bath with 2%&#xD;
      chlorhexidinegluconate, which is the routine application of the unit. In both groups, swab&#xD;
      samples will be taken from the right armpit and right groin before and after the wipe bath&#xD;
      (6th hour). '' Child Identification Form'' and ''Wipe Bathroom Application Chart'' will be&#xD;
      used to collect data. The Child Diagnostic Form consists of questions containing information&#xD;
      about the child (age, gender, reason for hospitalization, date, etc.). It is planned to&#xD;
      record information on the wiping bath application schedule, the skin reactions that may occur&#xD;
      in the patient during the wiping bath and the effect on the skin flora in the swab samples&#xD;
      taken before and after the children's bath applications. Data collection tools will be filled&#xD;
      in by the researcher through observation. During the data collection process, it was decided&#xD;
      by the researcher to take swab samples before each wipe bath application and after the wipe&#xD;
      bath application (6th hour) in order to check whether there was growth in the skin flora of&#xD;
      the child's armpit and groin areas. Before the research, the parents of the participants will&#xD;
      be informed about the research and verbal / written consent will be obtained from the parents&#xD;
      declaring their acceptance to participate in the study. Collected data will be evaluated&#xD;
      using the SPSS Statistics 22 package program. At the end of the study, it is thought that it&#xD;
      will guide the improvement of patient care quality.&#xD;
