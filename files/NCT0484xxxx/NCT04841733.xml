  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this project is to compare the effectiveness of combining different&#xD;
      recovery methods on perceptual and physical performance on soccer players.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A crossover study will be performed and players will be assigned to different recovery&#xD;
      methods combinations after their participation in a football game. The investigators will&#xD;
      take baseline measures before the game and post-competition measures 24 hours after the game&#xD;
      (one hour before the recovery intervention). Moreover, another two measure moments will be&#xD;
      used, 24 and 48 hours after the recovery intervention.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuromuscular or physical performance measures change: jump height</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 hour before intervention, 24 hours after intervention, 48 hours after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Counter Movement Jump (CMJ) will be performed to determine the maximum height in centimeters (cm). From standing position with the hands fixed on the hips, participants will be required to bend their knees to a freely chosen angle and perform a maximal vertical jump. Participants will be instructed to keep their body vertical throughout the jump, and to land with knees fully extended. Any jump that will be perceived to deviate from the required instructions will be repeated. Players will jump 3 times as high as possible and the best attempt will be used in subsequent analysis. A 15-s passive recovery phase will be provided between jumps.</description>

    <measure>Neuromuscular or physical performance measures change: jump flight and contact time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 hour before intervention, 24 hours after intervention, 48 hours after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Counter Movement Jump (CMJ) will be performed to determine the jump flight and contact time in milliseconds (ms). From standing position with the hands fixed on the hips, participants will be required to bend their knees to a freely chosen angle and perform a maximal vertical jump. Participants will be instructed to keep their body vertical throughout the jump, and to land with knees fully extended. Any jump that will be perceived to deviate from the required instructions will be repeated. Players will jump 3 times as high as possible and the best attempt will be used in subsequent analysis. A 15-s passive recovery phase will be provided between jumps.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective perceptual/well-being questionnaire measures change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 hour before intervention, 24 hours after intervention, 48 hours after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The well-being questionnaire (McLean et al. 2010) will assess participants' fatigue, sleep quality, general muscle soreness, stress levels and mood on a five-point scale (scores of 1[worst outcome] to 5 [best outcome], 0.5 point increments). Overall well-being will then be determined by summing the five scores.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Quality Recovery perceived (TQRper) scale. Subjective perceptual questionnaire measures change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 hour before intervention, 24 hours after intervention, 48 hours after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Players will be asked to rate their recovery using the subjective questionnaire Total Quality Recovery perceived (TQRper) scale (Kenttä &amp; Hassmén, 1998) answering the question &quot;how recovered you feel?&quot; on a scale which ranges from 0 (very poorly recovered) to 10 (very well recovered) and it's used as a subjective measurement to assess the fatigue suffered by the players (Laurent et al., 2011).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale. Subjective perceptual questionnaire measures change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 hour before intervention, 24 hours after intervention, 48 hours after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Players will be asked to rate their rate of perceived exertion using Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) Borg's scale answering the question &quot;how exhausted do you feel?&quot; on a scale which ranges from 0 (extremely well-rested) to 10 (extremely exhausted) (Casamichana et al., 2013).</description>

    <description>Foam Roller (FR): participants will follow the Foam Roller protocol using a polyvinylchloride pipe roller (10.3-cm diameter, 0.3-cm thickness surrounded by a 1,5-cm thickness neoprene foam). They will begin with the Foam Roller at the most proximal portion of the muscle and to roll as much body mass as tolerable back and forth along it as smoothly as possible at a cadence of 1 second superior and 1 second inferior as determined with the metronome. Foam Roller will be performed for 45 seconds followed by a 15-second rest for each muscle group (quadriceps, adductors, hamstrings, abductors and calf) in each extremity and repeated once.</description>
