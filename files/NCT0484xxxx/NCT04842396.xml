      INTRODUCTION: Physical exercise, when practiced regularly and in adequate doses, is a proven&#xD;
      nonpharmacological measure that helps to prevent and reverse noncommunicable diseases, as&#xD;
      well as reduce mortality rates from any cause. In general, older adults perform insufficient&#xD;
      physical activity and do not meet the doses recommended by the World Health Organization for&#xD;
      the improvement of health through physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: Our main aim will be to evaluate the effect of a 6-week intervention on&#xD;
      health-related outcomes (body composition, hemodynamic and functionality changes) in 24&#xD;
      individuals aged 65 and older with multimorbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study was a 2 x 2 randomized controlled trial using a two-group&#xD;
      design (exercise vs. control) and two repeated measures (pre- vs. postintervention). The&#xD;
      intervention (on the MOTOmed Muvi) will consist of a very low volume (60 minutes per week) of&#xD;
      low-to-moderate intensity exercise training to assess body composition evaluation,&#xD;
      hemodynamic parameter evaluation and functional evaluation. Participants will be recruited at&#xD;
      the Gerontological Complex La Milagrosa (A Coruña, Spain), consisting of a daycare center and&#xD;
      a nursing home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the statistical analysis, nonparametric ANOVA type statistics and mixed models for&#xD;
      repeated measures will be used.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION. Aging is a risk factor for most chronic diseases, and the presence of more than&#xD;
      two diseases (i.e., multimorbidity), which is frequent in almost two out of three older&#xD;
      adults, has been related to an increased risk of disability and frailty, a decrease in&#xD;
      quality of life, and mortality. Physical activity (PA) acts as a nonpharmacological&#xD;
      intervention and regular physical activity (rPA) reduces rates of all-cause mortality,&#xD;
      compresses morbidity, decreases healthcare costs, and has relatively minimal adverse effects&#xD;
      compared to drugs. It has been estimated that 27.5% of the world's population in 2016 did not&#xD;
      meet the recommendations established for the member states of the World Health Organization&#xD;
      (WHO) for health-enhancing physical activity. Furthermore, recent studies showed that&#xD;
      moderate-intensity physical activity may be sufficient for reducing the risk of all-cause&#xD;
      dementia and that some of the protective benefits of physical activity for older adults. It&#xD;
      seems indispensable to study adequate doses of exercise for older people who often have low&#xD;
      levels of physical activity and fitness, who spend a large amount of time sitting down, and&#xD;
      whose multimorbidity keeps them away from exercising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of perception-regulated low-volume and low-to-moderate&#xD;
      intensity training on body composition, hemodynamic parameters, and functional performance in&#xD;
      older adults with multimorbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study is a 2 x 2 randomized controlled trial using a two-group&#xD;
      design (exercise vs. control) and two repeated measures (pre- vs. postintervention). The&#xD;
      exercise group is requested to accomplish on the MOTOmed Muvi, a low volume (i.e., 20&#xD;
      minutes, 3 days per week) and low-to-moderate intensity combining upper and lower limb&#xD;
      recumbent cycling training for six weeks. Participants are evaluated to examine the changes&#xD;
      in body composition, functional performance, and resting cardiovascular state. Furthermore,&#xD;
      participants are monitored physiologically during each session (HR and blood pressure) to&#xD;
      control any possible adverse effects. Participants are recruited at the Gerontological&#xD;
      Complex La Milagrosa (A Coruña, Spain), consisting of a daycare center and a nursing home. 24&#xD;
      participants will be recruited and randomly placed into two groups: the exercise group (EG,&#xD;
      n=12) and the control group (CG, n=12). A stratified permuted block randomization is employed&#xD;
      that accounted for the GDS score, sex, and type of institutionalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS AND STATISTICS: Data will be presented as the median and interquartile range&#xD;
      for ordinal variables and the estimated marginal mean ± standard deviation (SD) for&#xD;
      continuous variables. The effect of the intervention will be analyzed employing nparLD&#xD;
      (nonparametric analysis of longitudinal data in factorial experiments) from the R software&#xD;
      package. Changes within and between groups will be analyzed by employing mixed models for&#xD;
      repeated measures designs with the module GAMLj, which uses the R formulation of random&#xD;
      effects as implemented by the lme4 R package in Jamovi software.&#xD;

    <description>The exercise group cycles 20 minutes per session on the MOTOmed Muvi 3 days per week for 6 weeks at an intensity guided by the perception of effort.&#xD;
A cycling cadence is fixed between 25 and 30 rpm for all sessions since that cadence is comfortable for every participant. Researchers adjust resistance on the motorized cycle to increase the external load until it reached the level required to reach the intensity of effort programmed by the OMNI-RPE. The six weeks are programmed in the form of two intensity-differentiated training phases of three weeks. In the first training phase (i.e., the first three weeks), participants are requested to cycle simultaneously with the upper and lower limbs at an intensity equivalent to a perception of 3 (i.e., easy to somewhat moderate) on the OMNI-RPE (0-10).</description>

    <description>Cycling training on the MOTOmed Muvi for 20 minutes 3 days per week for 6 weeks. Moreover, control of adverse events throughout the trial was measured through the assessment and monitoring of vital signs before, during (within the first 10 minutes), and after the intervention sessions. Vital signs [heart rate (per minute), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (in millimeters of mercury, mm Hg), and oxygen saturation (in percentage)] were monitored by a nurse and a medical doctor using mobile finger pulse oximeters.</description>
