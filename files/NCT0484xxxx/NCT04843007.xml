      The present study was a phase IV, post-marketing, observational study for safety evaluation&#xD;
      of Alvopem® use in Iranian patients with non-small cell lung cancer and malignant pleural&#xD;
      mesothelioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data was gathered in one booklet, which had 6 different periods. The patients' information&#xD;
      assessed after each injection, every 3 weeks. These booklets were completed by designated&#xD;
      physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study was safety assessment, including the incidence and&#xD;
      intensity of AEs and SAEs .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was single arm and the sample size of this study was 199 patients.&#xD;

    <time_frame>This outcome was assessed throughout the study, up to 18 weeks (6 chemotherapy cycles). The duration of treatment was at the physicians' discretion based on the patient's condition</time_frame>
    <description>In this safety assessment study, the incidence and intensity of all reported adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) were assessed. The intensity of AEs was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 and terminology for AEs was chosen according to the MedDRA system organ class and preferred term. Also, intensity, seriousness, onset of AEs, and interventions for management of the adverse events were documented in the booklet. For each AE, data was summarized using incidence according to system organ class and preferred term of AEs and SAEs. Moreover, causality assessment was done and its results was reported by frequency and percentage.</description>
