      Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is a well-established treatment strategy for medically&#xD;
      refractory chronic rhinosinusitis. Middle meatus spacers are currently used following ESS to&#xD;
      prevent scarring, synechiae formation, and middle turbinate lateralization. A 2012 systematic&#xD;
      review favored spacers compared to no spacers, with a follow up 2013 systematic review&#xD;
      finding no difference between the use of absorbable and non-absorbable spacers. This review,&#xD;
      however, noted that steroidal spacers may reduce middle meatus scarring and adhesions. More&#xD;
      recent data has shown the effectiveness of steroid releasing middle meatus implants in&#xD;
      preventing middle turbinate lateralization, reducing synechiae formation, and reducing&#xD;
      revision surgery. However, these stents are costly, and may result in excess crusting&#xD;
      postoperatively, which limits their use in some settings. Another study investigated the use&#xD;
      of steroid-impregnated absorbable packing materials, and demonstrated the safety and utility&#xD;
      of this method of middle meatus packing. However, a limitation to this study was overall low&#xD;
      enrollment with only 19 total patients enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is to add to the existing body of evidence regarding middle&#xD;
      meatus spacers, by studying the impact of steroid impregnated, bioabsorbable hemostatic&#xD;
      packing (Hemopore®, Stryker) on postoperative visualization and scar formation.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is a well-established treatment strategy for medically&#xD;
      refractory chronic rhinosinusitis. Middle meatus spacers are currently used following ESS to&#xD;
      prevent scarring, synechiae formation, and middle turbinate lateralization. A 2012 systematic&#xD;
      review favored spacers compared to no spacers, with a follow up 2013 systematic review&#xD;
      finding no difference between the use of absorbable and non-absorbable spacers. This review,&#xD;
      however, noted that steroidal spacers may reduce middle meatus scarring and adhesions. More&#xD;
      recent data has shown the effectiveness of steroid releasing middle meatus implants in&#xD;
      preventing middle turbinate lateralization, reducing synechiae formation, and reducing&#xD;
      revision surgery. However, these stents are costly, and may result in excess crusting&#xD;
      postoperatively, which limits their use in some settings. Another study investigated the use&#xD;
      of steroid-impregnated absorbable packing materials, and demonstrated the safety and utility&#xD;
      of this method of middle meatus packing. However, a limitation to this study was overall low&#xD;
      enrollment with only 19 total patients enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is to add to the existing body of evidence regarding middle&#xD;
      meatus spacers, by studying the impact of steroid impregnated, bioabsorbable hemostatic&#xD;
      packing (Hemopore®, Stryker) on postoperative visualization and scar formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design The proposed study will be a randomized controlled trial comparing steroid&#xD;
      impregnated bioabsorbable and dissolvable nasal packing to non-steroid impregnated packing.&#xD;
      Potential subjects will be adults, aged 18 and older, with a diagnosis of chronic&#xD;
      rhinosinusitis based on the 2016 International Consensus Statement on Allergy and Rhinology:&#xD;
      Rhinosinusitis definition, who have failed a trial of previous medical therapy, have&#xD;
      bilateral sinus disease on CT imaging, and will undergo bilateral endoscopic sinus surgery.&#xD;
      If the patient chooses to proceed with surgery for their medically refractory chronic&#xD;
      rhinosinusitis they will be introduced to the research proposal and if willing to&#xD;
      participate, the informed consent process will take place, during their preoperative visit.&#xD;
      On the day of surgery the patient's right and left sinuses will be randomized to either&#xD;
      steroid or no steroid middle meatus packing. At the end of the surgical procedure, the&#xD;
      attending surgeon will soak the Hemopore in either 5 cc Duobiotic saline irrigation&#xD;
      (bacitracin 50,000 units, polymyxin B 500,000 units in 0.9% sodium chloride 500mL) or 1 ml of&#xD;
      triamcinolone 40 mg/ml (Kenalog-40, Bristol-Myers Squibb) mixed with 5 cc Duobiotic saline&#xD;
      irrigation and label them 1 (no steroid) and 2 (steroid). The fellow or resident surgeon will&#xD;
      then insert the packing into the middle meatus, with the steroid packing going into the side&#xD;
      randomized for steroid, and the non-steroid packing going into the other side. A password&#xD;
      protected data file will be maintained in UCLA Box, accessible to the investigators, where&#xD;
      the side of placement of the packing will be recorded. Postoperative visits will be scheduled&#xD;
      at the usual time points: 7-10 days, 24-30 days, and 2-3 months post-op. Nasal endoscopy will&#xD;
      be performed at each visit, as a standard post op procedure. Video recording of the endoscopy&#xD;
      will be saved for review at the conclusion of the study for determination of the patency of&#xD;
      the postop cavity using the Lund-Kennedy endoscopic scoring system (LKES) and the&#xD;
      perioperative sinus endoscopy (POSE) score . Symptom scores will also be collected and&#xD;
      reviewed, as it is current practice for patients to respond to the sinonasal outcome test-22&#xD;
      (SNOT-22) at preop and postop visits. LKES and POSE scores will be recorded in a password&#xD;
      protected file in UCLA Box that is separate from the file containing the side of steroid&#xD;
      packing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to enroll 50 consecutive patients in this study, over the course of&#xD;
      about 4-6 months. At the end of the study period, the endoscopy scores (LKES and POSE) will&#xD;
      be compared between the steroid and non-steroid sides. Each patient will serve as his/her own&#xD;
      control. Statistical analysis will be performed using paired t tests for continuous variables&#xD;
      and chi-square tests for categorical variables. A p value &lt; 0.05 will be considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
