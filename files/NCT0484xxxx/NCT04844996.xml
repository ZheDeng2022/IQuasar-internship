  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current endometriosis therapy is based on interrupting the menstrual cycle and suppression of&#xD;
      estrogen synthesis in order to induce atrophy of endometrial tissue. Progestins, oral&#xD;
      contraceptives, androgenic agents, aromatase inhibitors, gonadotropin-releasing hormone&#xD;
      analogues all play a role in the treatment of endometriosis. However, none of these&#xD;
      treatments can definitely cure the disease and they require long-term use despite the side&#xD;
      effects of the drug. It is clear that new treatment methods are needed for this disease, and&#xD;
      therefore many different new treatment methods are being investigated. Some of the treatment&#xD;
      methods have focused on inhibiting angiogenesis and inflammation, which seems to play an&#xD;
      important role in the progression of the disease. In the present study, it was investigated&#xD;
      whether ezetimibe which is a cholesterol absorption inhibitor with anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
      antiangiogenic properties, has therapeutic effect on endometriosis in an experimental rat&#xD;
      model.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a relatively common benign disorder that causes significant health problems&#xD;
      with yet an unknown etiology. The disease which is defined as the presence of the endometrial&#xD;
      gland and stroma outside the uterine cavity, was first described by the famous pathologist&#xD;
      Von Rokitansky in 1860. Since then, new theories about the mechanism of its occurrence have&#xD;
      been put forward, but no single theory has been holistic enough to explain all clinical&#xD;
      presentations of the disease. Retrograde menstruation, stem cell theory, immune system,&#xD;
      genetic and environmental factors are among the proposed theories. However, with the&#xD;
      widespread use of molecular methods in recent years, more detailed information about its&#xD;
      etiopathogenesis has been obtained and new approaches have been proposed for its diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment. Today, it is accepted that multiple factors, including ectopic endometrial&#xD;
      tissue, altered immune system response, imbalanced cell proliferation and apoptosis, abnormal&#xD;
      endocrine signal and genetic factors, play a role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis, which&#xD;
      is a progressive, estrogen-dependent inflammatory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, studies on the inflammatory and angiogenesis mechanisms that play a role in&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of endometriosis have intensified in the treatment of the disease. Agents&#xD;
      with anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenic effects have been experimentally shown to partially&#xD;
      prevent the formation or reduce the size of endometriotic lesions in animal models. Statins&#xD;
      like atorvastatin and simvastatin have been using in the treatment of coronary artery disease&#xD;
      with their antilipidemic effects and are shown to have efficacy in animal endometriosis&#xD;
      models with their anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenic properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ezetimibe, which is a member of a different class of antilipidemic agents than statins, has&#xD;
      similarly been shown to inhibit the release of substances that play a key role in the&#xD;
      inflammatory process such as nuclear factor kappa, TNF-α and interleukin 1, and angiogenesis&#xD;
      such as VEGF. With this mechanism of action, it may be hypothesized that this agent may have&#xD;
      a possible therapeutic effect on endometriosis. Therefore in this study it was aimed to&#xD;
      assess the potential therapeutic role of ezetimibe in the experimental rat endometriosis&#xD;
      model.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Surgical induction of endometriotic explants</intervention_name>
    <description>Surgical induction of endometriosis was done as: A 5-cm vertical midline incision was made and a distal segment 1 cm in length of the right uterine horn was resected. The segment was split longitudinally, and a 5 X 5 mm piece was sectioned.&#xD;
This piece of uterine tissue was transplanted without removing the myometrium onto the inner surface of the right abdominal wall with the serosal surface apposed and secured with single nonabsorbable 5-0 polypropylene suture at the middle to the abdominal wall. The abdominal incision was closed in two layers&#xD;
Drug administration:&#xD;
Vehicle treatment (1 mL/kg/day saline) was administered orally to the control group with the gavage methodology. Ezetimibe (1 mg/kg/day (Ezetrol®, Merck Sharp Dohme, Istanbul, Turkey) was administered orally with gavage methodology to the rats in the study for 28 days postoperatively</description>
