      The study's primary aim is to develop and validate a multivariable diagnostic model for the&#xD;
      prediction of difficult videolaryngoscopy (the 'PeDiAC classification') in children&#xD;
      undergoing general anesthesia with tracheal intubation. The secondary aim is to compare the&#xD;
      diagnostic performance of the PeDiAC-classification with the Cormack-Lehane classification.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Difficult tracheal intubation is one of the major reasons for anesthesia-related adverse&#xD;
      events. Videolaryngoscopy has become an important part of the anesthesiology standard of care&#xD;
      for difficult airway management in the past decades. This is especially relevant in children,&#xD;
      as their airway anatomy differs greatly from adults because they are likely incapable of&#xD;
      tolerating brief apneic episodes. Still, medical preconditions and procedural and technical&#xD;
      factors related to difficult videolaryngoscopy have not been broadly investigated and not&#xD;
      fully been understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the PeDiAC study is to develop and validate a multivariable diagnostic&#xD;
      model for the classification of difficult videolaryngoscopy (the 'PeDiAC classification') in&#xD;
      children undergoing general anesthesia with tracheal intubation. Study planning and&#xD;
      conduction are in accordance with the TRIPOD 'Transparent reporting of a multivariable&#xD;
      prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis' statement. The secondary aim is to&#xD;
      compare the diagnostic performance of the PeDiAC-classification with the Cormack-Lehane&#xD;
      classification, which is the current clinical standard for assessing intubation via direct&#xD;
      laryngoscopy. We conduct a prospective observational study that will include approximately&#xD;
      800 pediatric patients within one year scheduling for tracheal intubation. Patients with age&#xD;
      below 18 years will be considered to be eligible for inclusion. Procedural and surgical data,&#xD;
      as well as medical preconditions, will be assessed systematically. After tracheal intubation,&#xD;
      performed by the responsible anesthetist, the intubation process will be rated by the&#xD;
      responsible anesthetist and an additional independent observer, and detailed information&#xD;
      regarding procedural and technical factors related to videolaryngoscopy will be documented.&#xD;
      All sampled independent variables will be considered to be potential candidate predictors for&#xD;
      the multivariable regression model.&#xD;
