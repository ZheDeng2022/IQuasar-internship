    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the effects of active release technique and post&#xD;
      isometric relaxation in patients with piriformis syndrome on pain, hip internal rotation&#xD;
      range of motion and functional disability. A randomized clinical trial was conducted at Shifa&#xD;
      Intl. Hospital, Islamabad. The sample size was 26 calculated through open-epi tool but were&#xD;
      recruited 30. The participants were divided into two interventional groups each having 15&#xD;
      participants. The study duration was six months. Sampling technique applied was purposive&#xD;
      sampling for recruitment and group randomization using sealed envelope method. Only 35 to 55&#xD;
      years participants with diagnosed piriformis syndrome were included in this study. Tools used&#xD;
      in this study are Goniometer, Visual Analogue Scale and lower extremity functional scale.&#xD;
      Data was collected at baseline, 3 weeks after sessions and after one month follow up. Data&#xD;
      was analyzed through SPSS version 20.&#xD;

      Piriformis syndrome is caused by prolonged or excessive contraction of the piriformis muscle.&#xD;
      Because of the close proximity to the sciatic nerve, piriformis syndrome is associated with&#xD;
      pain in the buttocks, hips, and lower limbs. Yeoman was the first to describe pain in the&#xD;
      sciatic distribution to piriformis syndrome. Many synonyms for the condition are used in the&#xD;
      literature, such as ''deep gluteal syndrome'' and ''pelvic outlet syndrome''. It has been&#xD;
      suggested that piriformis syndrome is responsible for 5-6% of cases of sciatica. In the&#xD;
      majority of cases, piriformis syndrome occurs in middle-aged patients (mean age 38 year). The&#xD;
      ratio of female to male patients with piriformis syndrome has been reported as 6:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three specific conditions may contribute to piriformis syndrome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. myofascial referred pain from trigger points in the piriformis muscle&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. adjacent muscles, nerve and vascular entrapment by the piriformis muscle at the greater&#xD;
           sciatic foramen&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. dysfunction of the sacroiliac joint. Myofascial pain syndrome in the piriformis muscle&#xD;
           is well recognized. Gluteal pain is reported to be observed in 97.9% of cases, pain (and&#xD;
           paresthesias) in the back, groin, perineum, buttocks, hip, back of the thigh&#xD;
           (81.9%),calf (59%),foot, in the rectum (during defecation), and in the area of the&#xD;
           coccyx. Low back pain is reported to be observed in 18.1% of cases. Intense pain will&#xD;
           occur when the patient sits or squats. Nevertheless, true neurologic findings are not&#xD;
           usually present in piriformis syndrome and sensory deficits may be completely absent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no gold standard in diagnosing piriformis syndrome. The physical examination may&#xD;
      reveal several of the following well-described signs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The piriformis sign, (which presents as tonic external rotation of the affected lower&#xD;
           extremity) is reported to be observed in 38.5% of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Freiberg's sign involves pain on passive forced internal rotation of the hip in the&#xD;
           supine position, thought to result from passive stretching of the piriformis muscle and&#xD;
           pressure on the sciatic nerve at the sacrospinous ligament. This test is positive in&#xD;
           56.2% of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pace's sign consists of pain and weakness on resisted abduction and external rotation of&#xD;
           the thigh in a sitting position . A positive test is reported to occur in 46.5% of the&#xD;
           patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lasegue's sign involves pain on the affected side on voluntary adduction, flexion, and&#xD;
           internal rotation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Beatty's maneuver is an active test that involves elevation of the flexed leg on the&#xD;
           painful side while the patient lies on the asymptomatic side. Abducting the thigh to&#xD;
           raise the knee off the table elicits deep buttock pain in patients with piriformis&#xD;
           muscle but back and leg pain in those with lumbar disk disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Hughes Test (external isometric rotation of the affected lower extremity following&#xD;
           maximal internal rotation) may also be positive in piriformis syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gluteal atrophy may be present.Sacroiliac tenderness is reported to be observed in 38.5%&#xD;
           of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Piriformis syndrome causing sciatica usually responds to conservative treatments, including&#xD;
      physical therapy, lifestyle modification, pharmacological agents (non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory agents, muscle relaxants, and neuropathic pain medication) and&#xD;
      psychotherapy. Physiotherapy management for piriformis syndrome includes application of heat&#xD;
      therapy and ultrasound therapy in conjunction with stretching of piriformis muscle shows good&#xD;
      effect on treatment. Also manual therapy approaches like myofascial release (MFR), muscle&#xD;
      energy technique (MET), Active release technique shows beneficial effect on the treatment of&#xD;
      soft tissue. The last option is surgical intervention which involves endoscopic decompression&#xD;
      of sciatic nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Active release technique (ART) is a manual therapy used to recover function of soft&#xD;
      tissue and in many ways similar to traditional 'Pin and stretch' techniques. Technique works&#xD;
      on a variety of muscle, tendon, ligament, fascia and nerve tissues. In this technique deep&#xD;
      pressure is applied over the tender point in a shortened position of the muscle and then&#xD;
      patient is asked to actively take it in an opposite lengthened position. This will break the&#xD;
      adhesions and restores the proper texture, elasticity and functions of soft tissues. There&#xD;
      are a variety of studies that imply the value of ART as a treatment method for soft tissue&#xD;
      injuries. ART has been used to treat nerve entrapment, tendinopathy, muscle strain, snapping&#xD;
      hip syndrome, lateral epicondylitis, impaired range of motion, overuse syndrome, and improve&#xD;
      performance and contributed to faster return to activity and decreased treatment time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle energy technique (MET) is an active muscle based treatment approach that involves the&#xD;
      voluntary contraction of a subject's muscle(s) in a precisely controlled direction, against a&#xD;
      counterforce provided by the therapist. The MET may be used to decrease pain, stretch tight&#xD;
      muscles and fascia, reduce muscle tonus, improve local circulation, strengthen weak&#xD;
      musculature and mobilize joint restrictions. The MET is used for achieving tonus release in a&#xD;
      muscle before stretching via introduction of an isometric contraction to the affected muscle&#xD;
      producing post isometric relaxation. Post isometric relaxation (PIR) is a MET used to relax&#xD;
      and lengthen a hypertonic and shortened muscle. This gentle stretching technique is typically&#xD;
      used on postural muscles. These muscles often become short and tight and can lead to muscle&#xD;
      imbalances. This can limit range of motion and cause joint restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of ART on gluteus medius for chronic lower back pain and concluded that ART was&#xD;
      effective in reducing lower back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ART for ITB syndrome and results showed that ART decreases pain and improves function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of Neuromuscular therapy and ART on piriformis tightness and concluded that&#xD;
      significant improvement was observed in the VAS score and ROM in ART group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared the effectiveness of ART with mulligan bent leg raise for hamstring tightness and&#xD;
      concluded that ART was better in improving flexibility and ROM of hamstring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared post isometric relaxation with stretching on piriformis syndrome and concluded that&#xD;
      PIR technique group significantly improved in all outcome measures (pain, ROM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of PIR technique on myofascial tightness of lumbo-pelvic musculature in patients&#xD;
      with chronic low back pain and concluded marked improvement in pain and functional&#xD;
      disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared PIR technique with high velocity low amplitude techniques and concluded that both of&#xD;
      the techniques are equally effective in managing low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared post isometric relaxation and reciprocal inhibition and concluded that post&#xD;
      isometric relaxation is more effective in treating piriformis syndrome than reciprocal&#xD;
      inhibition and proposed to follow further in chronic piriformis syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there is little evidence of relative effects of Active release technique and post&#xD;
      isometric relaxation in piriformis syndrome. Both techniques are found to be effective&#xD;
      individually in different conditions but no research has been done yet on comparison of&#xD;
      active release technique with muscle energy techniques like PIR in piriformis syndrome.&#xD;
      Studies of ART on hamstring tightness shows significant immediate effects but the study was&#xD;
      on healthy subjects. Effectiveness of ART is evident by one another study but only immediate&#xD;
      effects were analyzed. Thus, effective long term follow up is lacking in literature. This&#xD;
      present research will fill the gaps by studying the effects of ART and PIR in chronic&#xD;
      piriformis syndrome and will help the clinicians with an alternative treatment approach&#xD;
