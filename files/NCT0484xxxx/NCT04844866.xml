    <textblock>
      This is a pivotal Phase II randomised, multi-centre, open-label study to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of MB-CART2019.1 compared to standard of care therapy in participants&#xD;
      with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, who are not eligible for high-dose&#xD;
      chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation.&#xD;

      This study should determine superiority of MB-CART2019.1 treatment compared to SoC therapy&#xD;
      with R-GemOx (rituximab, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin) with respect to progression-free&#xD;
      survival in second-line therapy in participants with R-R DLBCL, who are non-eligible for&#xD;
      high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MB-CART2019.1 is designed to effectively target malignant B cells in patients suffering from&#xD;
      late stage haematological B-cell malignancies. MB-CART2019.1 consists of autologous cluster&#xD;
      of differentiation CD20/CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) transduced CD4/CD8 enriched T&#xD;
      cells, derived from a leukapheresis and processed by using the CliniMACS Prodigy® device.&#xD;
      Patients who are suitable for this study will be randomized 1:1 to either MB-CART2019.1 or&#xD;
      SoC. Both treatment arms are unblinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MB-CART2019.1 arm: Single infusion of fresh formulation of 2.5 × 10^6 CAR-transduced&#xD;
      autologous T cells. IMP is only to be administered after a lymphodepleting chemotherapy with&#xD;
      fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. For MB-CART2019.1 production, patients will undergo a&#xD;
      leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SoC arm: R-GemOx (8 cycles of 14 days each) or (10% of SoC arm) BR (Bendamustine/Rituximab) +&#xD;
      polatuzumab vedotin (6 cycles of 21 days each).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the active part of the study for each individual participant from screening&#xD;
      to the end of the 1-year follow-up after infusion of MB-CART2019.1 cells (experimental arm)&#xD;
      or the start of SoC therapy (comparator arm) will be approximately 55 weeks. The LTFU in Year&#xD;
      2 after infusion of MB-CART2019.1 cells or the start of treatment in the comparator arm will&#xD;
      not be part of the active part of the clinical study and will be reported separately.&#xD;

             contraceptive measures (Pearl index &lt; 1) or practice true sexual abstinence from any&#xD;
             heterosexual intercourse (True abstinence is only acceptable if it is in line with the&#xD;

             contraception include hormonal contraceptives (oral, intravaginal, transdermal,&#xD;
             injectable, implantable) and intrauterine devices or systems (e.g. hormonal and&#xD;

             condom) or practice true sexual abstinence from any heterosexual intercourse (True&#xD;
             abstinence is only acceptable if it is in line with the preferred and usual life style&#xD;
             of the participant.), unless they are surgically sterile (meaning at least 2&#xD;
             consecutive analyses following vasectomy demonstrate absence of sperms in the&#xD;
             ejaculate), during the study and in the 12 months following the last dose of study&#xD;
             treatment. Men must furthermore refrain from sperm donation throughout the study until&#xD;
             12 months after the last administration of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. In the opinion of the investigator, the participant must be able to comply with all&#xD;
             study-related procedures, medication use and evaluations.&#xD;
