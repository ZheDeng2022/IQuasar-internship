    <textblock>
      The project pilot tests an innovative Stroke Home health Aide Recovery Program (SHARP)&#xD;
      designed to improve mobility and reduce falls in post-acute home bound stroke patients. SHARP&#xD;
      will accomplish this by expanding the home-based rehabilitation team to include a corps of&#xD;
      advanced HHAs specially trained as stroke &quot;peer coaches.&quot; Coaches provide mentorship and&#xD;
      support to generalist HHAs as they collaborate with patients and families to implement the&#xD;
      therapeutic regimens prescribed by patients' physicians and rehabilitation therapists.&#xD;

      Purpose and Specific Aims This is a pilot to test the Stroke Home health Aide Recovery&#xD;
      Program (SHARP) study design elements and procedures in preparation for a larger-scale study&#xD;
      that would assess the effectiveness of the model to improve patient outcomes. The overall&#xD;
      purpose of SHARP and of this research pilot is to improve patients' function following a&#xD;
      stroke. SHARP is designed to improve mobility and reduce falls in post-acute homebound stroke&#xD;
      patients by expanding the rehabilitation team to include SHARP Home Health Aides (HHAs)&#xD;
      specially trained as stroke &quot;peer coaches.&quot; The coaches will provide mentorship and support&#xD;
      to direct care generalist HHAs. The direct care HHAs will already be working with patients&#xD;
      and families on the exercise regimen prescribed by physicians and rehabilitation therapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test recruitment and randomization procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine program acceptability&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess intervention protocol implementation fidelity&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Examine patient burden, and obtain preliminary estimates of&#xD;
           variability/reliability/correlation over time of selected outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population and Intervention Potential candidates for the SHARP coach positions are drawn from&#xD;
      recommendations of HHA field supervisors and from additional HHA volunteers. All must have&#xD;
      already completed the Partners in Care health coach introductory program or the equivalent.&#xD;
      Nominated candidates will be interviewed by Research and Partners in Care staff to select up&#xD;
      to 10 HHA's to engage in SHARP coach training. After coach preparation, rehabilitation&#xD;
      therapists are to help identify post-stroke patients who meet the initial pilot study&#xD;
      eligibility criteria. A VNSNY Research Assistant reaches out to patients referred by the&#xD;
      therapists to assess their interest and eligibility, to explain the intervention and terms of&#xD;
      participation and, once patients agree to participate, to obtain their formal consent. After&#xD;
      consent, patients are randomized to an intervention or control arm. SHARP coaches are&#xD;
      deployed to help with post-stroke rehabilitation care for those randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention arm. A total of 60 patients will be recruited - 30 for the intervention arm and&#xD;
      30 for the usual care arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Significance The SHARP program that is being developed through this study has the&#xD;
      potential to be a high impact approach to enhance home-based post-stroke rehabilitation and&#xD;
      improve functional mobility and related outcomes among homebound post-stroke patients. This&#xD;
      project represents foundational work for the development of a novel community based approach&#xD;
      to enhance stroke recovery. By leveraging an existing infrastructure of paraprofessional care&#xD;
      providers (the HHAs), this program may offer a practical and sustainable method for enhancing&#xD;
      post-acute care of stroke patients during the critical transition phase from hospital/rehab&#xD;
      center to home, and provide a framework for a new cadre of advanced, specialty HHAs.&#xD;
      Qualitative and quantitative data derived from this pilot will inform feasibility, study&#xD;
      procedures and effect sizes for a larger randomized trial assessing the impact of the SHARP&#xD;
      coaching on patient outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>The SHARP Peer Coach supports the direct care HHA and indirectly support the patient/family caregiver to enhance the patient's post-stroke recovery through two main pathways: 1) culturally sensitive, patient-centered reinforcement of rehabilitation regimens (prescribed physical/occupational exercises/training); and 2) early recognition and reporting of barriers to the rehabilitation therapist regarding adherence and recovery, including: a) environmental obstacles, b) family-related issues, c) psychological/clinical barriers (e.g., depression/anxiety).</description>

    <description>The Coach provides guidance and support through four 45-60 minute in-home visits: Visit 1: to facilitate effective team communication, this visit is conducted, when possible, with the rehabilitation therapist, the patient/family, the direct care aide and the Coach, who jointly reviews the rehabilitation plan of care. Visits 2-4 include: discussion/observation of HHA/patient exercise repetition sessions, along with: 1) discussing falls prevention, signs of a recurrent stroke and when to call 911; 2) modeling motivation techniques, assessing adherence barriers and revising strategies for addressing them; and 3) identifying/ reporting signs of anxiety/depression. Additional coaching visits and calls may be scheduled as needed depending on the aide's progress in addressing barriers and the patient's progress toward rehabilitation goals.</description>
