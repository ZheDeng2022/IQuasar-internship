  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can eventually progress to&#xD;
      respiratory failure, where they cannot adequately exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide, leading&#xD;
      to worsening breathlessness, frequent hospitalisations and death. Non-invasive ventilation&#xD;
      (NIV) is a ventilator therapy that is used in COPD patients who suffer from respiratory&#xD;
      failure. Studies have demonstrated that using NIV at night regularly can result in improved&#xD;
      clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence to this therapy is variable, however. This can be due to poor synchrony between the&#xD;
      device and the lungs. A novel ventilator has been designed that delivers NIV but is also&#xD;
      incorporated with technology to assess for aberrations in respiratory physiology and correct&#xD;
      them, breath-by-breath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of this novel&#xD;
      ventilator. The primary research question is whether the novel ventilator can improve&#xD;
      adherence to therapy, when compared with the usual ventilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with COPD who use ventilation at home will be screened for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
      Participation will involve a screening visit, and a further two visits to the Lane Fox&#xD;
      Respiratory Unit. The first will require a two-night admission and the second a single-night&#xD;
      admission. They will undergo detailed assessment of their daytime and overnight respiratory&#xD;
      and sleep physiology during these admissions. These visits will be separated by a six-week&#xD;
      period during which they will be asked to use the novel ventilator at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited into a sub-study to evaluate the performance of the ventilator in&#xD;
      a daytime physiological assessment. This will involve detailed invasive physiological&#xD;
      assessment of expiratory flow limitation and how the machine is able to adjust settings to&#xD;
      optimise respiratory support.&#xD;
