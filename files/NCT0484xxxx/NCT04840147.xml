  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare whether JointRep® plus microfracture is more effective&#xD;
      than microfracture alone when treating symptomatic focal articular cartilage lesions in the&#xD;
      knee (femoral condyles or trochlea).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the JMAC study, an international multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial, is to&#xD;
      assess the effectiveness and safety of JointRep®, a second-generation chitosan-based hydrogel&#xD;
      for cartilage repair. A total of 185 subjects will be randomized 2:1 to either Microfracture&#xD;
      plus JointRep® or Microfracture alone. The follow up will be at 24 months, with a planned&#xD;
      interim analysis at 12 months. The primary endpoint is an objectively measured structural one&#xD;
      (quantity of new cartilaginous tissue, assessing the percentage of fill) and it will be&#xD;
      blindly assessed using a sophisticated quantitative MRI at 12 and 24 months. Two of the&#xD;
      secondary endpoints are also structurally based and blindly measured: quality of the new&#xD;
      tissue, quantifying the T2 (which measures the Collagen 2 content and orientation as well as&#xD;
      degree of hydration); the upper and lower half of the new tissue T2 measurement will depict&#xD;
      the degree of stratification of the new cartilaginous tissue. A semiquantitative MOCART-2&#xD;
      blinded analysis will also be carried out. The clinical outcomes will be measured using KOOS&#xD;
      and Tegner, as well as a VAS and an EQ-5 questionnaire. All the secondary endpoints will be&#xD;
      analyzed at the same 12 and 24 months timepoints. In addition, subject safety will be&#xD;
      assessed through a record of adverse events.&#xD;

    <description>JointRep® is a medical device based on a thermogel polymer (Chitosan) for the treatment of chondral lesions, which consists of an injectable aqueous composition that forms a solid and sticky hydrogel in situ within cartilage defect(s). JointRep® is composed of an injectable thermo-gelling aqueous composition. It is used in conjunction with a Bone Marrow Stimulation type of procedure like Microfracture.</description>

    <description>Microfracture is a bone marrow stimulation type of procedure where after debridement of the damaged chondral tissue within the lesion, obtention of stable vertical margins and curettage of the entire calcified layer, multiple holes are created with a variety of instruments (awls, picks, microdills, nanofracture) to establish a communication with the subchondral bone to create a blood clot to elicit the natural healing process</description>
