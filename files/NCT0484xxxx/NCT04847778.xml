  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insulclock® is a small electronic device developed to facilitate the optimal administration&#xD;
      of insulin. This device works as an add-on module of commercially available insulin pens and&#xD;
      monitors the date, time and dose of injections, the type of insulin injected, the duration of&#xD;
      injections and insulin temperature. The Insulclock 360 app allows automatic data logging,&#xD;
      report generation and reminder setting, among other functions. In this study, we pretend to&#xD;
      show the clinical impact of Insulclock system, both device and mobile application, on&#xD;
      glycemic indices, treatment compliance, and quality of life in patients with persistent&#xD;
      poorly controlled T1DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods: Randomized open-label multicenter controlled trial to evaluate glycemic&#xD;
      control, the number of missed and delayed insulin doses, and quality of life after seven&#xD;
      weeks of Insulclock 360 use in participants with uncontrolled DM1. We will also compare these&#xD;
      results between patients with or without receiving system reminders and alerts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess the effect of Insulclock on glycemic control, treatment adherence,&#xD;
      and quality of life. As a secondary objective, we will compare the study outcomes between&#xD;
      participants in the Active and Masked Insulclock groups (i.e., with or without receiving&#xD;
      alerts and reminders and accessing the app).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess glycemic control, we will measure HbA1C and glycemic indices. Glycemic variability&#xD;
      indices will be monitored with the FreeStyle Libre™ and included glucose coefficient of&#xD;
      variation (CV), standard deviation (SD), time in range (TIR), time above range (TAR), and&#xD;
      time below range (TBR). Mean glucose levels will be obtained from 48-h time intervals with&#xD;
      the FreeStyle Libre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A late meal bolus (mistimed) will be considered when Insulclock detects the injection at&#xD;
      least 30 minutes after the CGM rise. To identify meal glucose excursions, we will use the&#xD;
      Glucose Rate Increase Detector (GRID) algorithm, which estimates the rate of change (ROC) of&#xD;
      glucose from CGM data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete the ITSQ and the DTSQ, which are validated questionnaires to&#xD;
      assess the diabetes treatment satisfaction.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicentric randomized open-label study will be conducted at the Hospital General de&#xD;
      Segovia (Segovia, Spain), Hospital de Cruces (Bilbao, Spain), Hospital Arquitecto Marcide&#xD;
      (Ferrol, A Coruña, Spain) and Hospital Central de Asturias (Oviedo, Spain) after&#xD;
      classification by the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Health Products (AEMPS) and ethical&#xD;
      approval by the Ethics Review Committee of each research center. The study will be conducted&#xD;
      in compliance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Each participant&#xD;
      will provide written informed consent before being included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is scheduled across seven visits. At Visit 1 (Screening, Week -1), demographic and&#xD;
      clinical information will be collected, and concomitant medications will be registered. All&#xD;
      potential study patients will be screened for eligibility after signing the informed consent&#xD;
      form (ICF) and will be assigned with a patient identification number. Laboratory evaluations&#xD;
      (HbA1c, serum chemistry) must be available within the last 2 months. An identification number&#xD;
      will be assigned to each participant At Visit 2 (Run-in, week 0), participants will receive&#xD;
      information on the use of the Insulclock device and app on masked mode (excluding the use of&#xD;
      Insulclock 360 app information and alarms). If the participant does not use a CGM: a&#xD;
      healthcare professional applies the FreeStyle Libre sensor to the back of the upper arm and&#xD;
      activates it. If the participant already uses a CGM system, the patient will be encouraged to&#xD;
      use sensors during this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 3 (First Visit CGM 1, week 1) and Visit 4 (Follow-up, week 3), participants will be&#xD;
      encouraged to use the system At Visit 5 (Visit Starting CGM 2 and Randomization, week 4)&#xD;
      participants will be randomized (1:1) to the Active Insulclock group or the Masked Insulclock&#xD;
      group. Participants randomized in the Insulclock Active Group will receive detailed&#xD;
      instructions on using the Insulclock device and Insulclock 360 mobile application and will be&#xD;
      instructed and motivated for full use of all system functions (alarms, messages to the&#xD;
      caregivers and investigation team). Participants randomized in the Insulclock Masked Group&#xD;
      will be instructed on the correct installation and use of the Insulclock system for recording&#xD;
      insulin bolus information but they will not receive any other information and will not have&#xD;
      access to the Insulclock 360 application from the Internet and will keep administering&#xD;
      insulin treatment as before. A healthcare professional will apply a FreeStyle Libre sensor to&#xD;
      the upper arm in all the participants who do not use a CGM and will be encouraged to wear the&#xD;
      sensor for 2 weeks. Participants who already use a CGM system will be encouraged to use&#xD;
      sensors during this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 6 (Final Visit CGM 2 and Randomization, week 6). Participants will receive a&#xD;
      reminder on the use of Insulclock according to the corresponding group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 7 (Final Visit, week 7) the mobile application diaries will be collected and&#xD;
      reviewed. Participants will receive to fill in the Insulin Treatment Satisfaction&#xD;
      Questionnaire (ITSQ) and the Diabetes Treatment Questionnaire (DTSQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population Investigators will include 80 participants aged 18-80 years with&#xD;
      uncontrolled T1DM who provide written informed consent. Persistent uncontrolled T1DM was&#xD;
      defined as HbA1C levels ≥6.5% for at least 1 year, and/or variations ≥1% in HbA1C within the&#xD;
      previous 2 years and attending regular (more than 2 per year) follow-up visits at the&#xD;
      Endocrinology department. Investigators will exclude pregnant or breastfeeding women,&#xD;
      individuals with a history of or current alcohol or drug abuse, acute infection, cognitive&#xD;
      decline or dementia, or any illness or condition that could interfere with the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study devices:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulclock is a small electronic device that works as an add-on module of insulin pens. This&#xD;
      device can record the dose and time of insulin injected, register temperature changes of&#xD;
      insulin pens, record the duration of an injection, and the specific insulin pen used. In the&#xD;
      present study, participants self-administer insulin with pens coupled to Insulclock and&#xD;
      according to routine clinical practice. By means of acoustic and visual alarms, participants&#xD;
      receive information for a correct injection technique (an alert if the injection time was &lt;6&#xD;
      seconds) or to prevent stacking insulin (an alert if a previous injection was done within the&#xD;
      2 previous hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Insulclock device is synchronized with the Insulclock 360 app for the automatic logging&#xD;
      of patient data. The Insulclock 360 app also has a reminder function to promote the timely&#xD;
      administration of insulin doses. Users can also receive customized tips on DM management with&#xD;
      the &quot;my tutors&quot; tool and obtain information on DM topics. Insulclock 360 app is compatible&#xD;
      with Apple and Android operating systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Active group, participants will receive acoustic and visual alarms, device-related&#xD;
      information and will have access to the Insulclock 360 app. In the Masked group, participants&#xD;
      know the dose, time and duration of injections, but these participants will not receive any&#xD;
      reminder and will be masked to the Insulclock 360 app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will use the Freestyle Libre (Abbott Diabetes Care, Witney, Oxon, UK) for the&#xD;
      continuous monitoring of glucose levels. This flash continuous monitoring system is to be&#xD;
      worn on the upper arm and does not require capillary glucose concentrations for calibration.&#xD;
      The sensor automatically records glucose data every 15 minutes for 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis The proposed statistical analysis methods constitute a synthesis of the&#xD;
      methods to be used in this study to apply them to the data collected and respond to the&#xD;
      general objective and the specific objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from all participants included in the study, who meet the selection criteria, will be&#xD;
      analyzed. Data in absentia will not be charged and will be considered as lost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A general description of the variables included in the study will be made. The absolute and&#xD;
      relative frequency distributions of the qualitative variables will be presented by&#xD;
      investigators, as well as the measures of central tendency and dispersion (mean, standard&#xD;
      deviation, median, minimum and maximum) of the quantitative variables. The confidence&#xD;
      intervals will be presented at 95% for the main quantitative outcome variables associated&#xD;
      with the main objective and the main secondary variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data corresponding to the variables included in the main objective will be descriptively&#xD;
      analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will use the SPSS software Version 17.0. to perform the analysis. The&#xD;
      hypothesis tests that are carried out will be in all bilateral cases and with a significance&#xD;
      level of 0.05. For variables that do not fit the normal distribution(or parametric), the Mann&#xD;
      Whitney hypothesis tests will be used (for unpaired data). The chi-square test (or Fischer's&#xD;
      exact test when appropriate) will be used for the analysis of contingency tables as well as&#xD;
      for the comparison of proportions and/or frequency distributions.&#xD;
