      Prospective study of prevalence and deep charecterization of anemia in patients with&#xD;
      endocarditis from diagnosis undtill 6 months after discharge.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anemia is an adverse prognostic marker in both cardiac diseases and infectious diseases. In&#xD;
      patients with bacterial endocarditis (IE), anemia has a prevalence of 55-80%. In a sub-study&#xD;
      to our POET I trial (RCT with 400 patients with IE, published in NEJM 2019), preliminary data&#xD;
      show a 5-fold increased risk of death within 6 months and 2-fold increased risk after 3&#xD;
      years, in non-surgically treated patients with hemoglobin &lt;6.2mmol/L, compared to patients&#xD;
      with no or mild anemia. Intensified treatment of anemia through e.g. intravenous iron&#xD;
      infusions, in combination with erythrocyte stimulating agents or new treatments for anemia of&#xD;
      inflammation, such as IL-6 inhibitors, could possibly improve outcome for patients with IE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study - ANIE - is a prospective study, aiming at further deep-characterizing of anemia&#xD;
      in patients with IE, and associated outcomes. Degree of anemia of inflammation (AI) and&#xD;
      iron-deficiency anemia during hospitalization and time to recovery will be assessed. Blood&#xD;
      samples from 100 patients with IE will be collected during hospitalization and 3 months after&#xD;
      discharge, i.e. also during expected recovery. Samples will be analyzed for standard markers&#xD;
      of anemia and inflammation, as well as novel biomarkers for AI, such as IL-6, soluble&#xD;
      transferrin receptor, erythroferrone and hepcidin. The sample size calculation is based on&#xD;
      the assumption that the prevalence of AI is 50%, with a confidence interval of 95% and a&#xD;
      margin of error of &lt;10%. Comparisons will be made to patients with other infections and&#xD;
      patients with pure inflammation (TAVI and TEVAR patients) and healthy blood donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANIE is expected to give us an unprecedented insight into disease processes, stages and&#xD;
      possible therapeutic targets for anemia in patients with IE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will serve for designing the clinical trial of novel interventions to treat&#xD;
      anemia in patients with IE, as a novel means to improve the outcome and reduce the high&#xD;
      mortality in these patients.&#xD;
