      Skin cancers and pre-cancerous growths (called actinic keratoses, &quot;AKs&quot;), that aren't&#xD;
      melanomas, develop in patients with a kidney transplant at excessive rates. When these&#xD;
      pre-cancerous AKs, and &quot;non-melanoma&quot; skin cancers occur in kidney transplant patients, they&#xD;
      tend to be aggressive, and require frequent medical procedures, often surgery, for the&#xD;
      removal of the skin cancers. If not removed adequately the pre-cancers can develop into skin&#xD;
      cancers, and the skin cancers, if not removed, may spread, and even cause death. Reducing the&#xD;
      occurrence and complications of these skin cancers and pre-cancers in kidney transplant&#xD;
      patients with a safe, effective, well-tolerated treatment taken by mouth would be an&#xD;
      important medical advance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are testing oral nicotinamide (NAM)-a B-vitamin compound-for that purpose. Approximately&#xD;
      fifty kidney transplant patients who have had at least one non-melanoma skin cancer in the&#xD;
      past, will be given randomized to receive NAM, 1 gram twice daily by mouth, or identical&#xD;
      pills without NAM, and followed for 1 year to see if NAM treatment reduces the numbers of&#xD;
      pre-cancerous AKs, and non-melanoma skin cancers they develop. Patients will be asked to come&#xD;
      to the clinic for 3 follow up visits (every 4 months for up to 12 months). They will receive&#xD;
      a full body skin exam by a dermatologist, have detailed counting of AKs and biopsies for any&#xD;
      suspicious lesions as standard of care. Blood will also be drawn as well as a urine sample&#xD;
      obtained at each visit for safety assessment and storage. We will also ask them to answer a&#xD;
      series of questions about dietary patterns and intake of whole foods and supplements.&#xD;

      Non-melanoma cutaneous carcinomas [NMSCs], predominantly squamous cell carcinomas [SCCs], as&#xD;
      well as basal cell carcinomas [BCCs], are the most common malignancies occurring in kidney&#xD;
      transplant recipients [KTRs]. SCCs and BCCs, account for more than 90% of NMSCs in KTRs. New&#xD;
      NMSCs in KTRs with a prior NMSC develop at 3-times the rate reported in non-KTRs with the&#xD;
      same clinical history. The unique aggressiveness of SCCs in KTRs increases patient morbidity,&#xD;
      due to the high rate of new lesions requiring treatment, frequently surgical excision. This&#xD;
      non-fatal morbidity also results in significant medical costs. KTR SCCs have a greater&#xD;
      potential for metastasis, and death. Reduction in the incidence and complications associated&#xD;
      with SCCs, in particular, and more generally, overall NMSCs, as well as Actinic Keratoses,&#xD;
      would mark a significant advance in the management of KTRs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims of this study are: To evaluate the effects of oral nicotinamide 2 grams/day,&#xD;
      given in two divided doses, for 12-months, versus matched placebo, on the total number of&#xD;
      actinic keratoses which develop in stable chronic kidney transplant recipients with a history&#xD;
      of at least one non-melanoma skin cancer; To demonstrate our ability to create a system for&#xD;
      diagnosing, capturing, and recording all new non-melanoma skin cancers which develop in&#xD;
      stable chronic kidney transplant recipients with a history of at least one non-melanoma skin&#xD;
      cancer while receiving oral nicotinamide 2 grams/day, given in two divided doses, for&#xD;
      12-months, versus matched placebo; To evaluate the effects of oral nicotinamide 2 grams/day,&#xD;
      given in two divided doses, for 12-months, versus matched placebo, on sirtuin enzymatic&#xD;
      activity in chronic kidney transplant recipients with a history of at least one non-melanoma&#xD;
      skin cancer; To evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral nicotinamide 2 grams/day, given&#xD;
      in two divided doses, for 12-months, versus matched placebo, in stable chronic kidney&#xD;
      transplant recipients with a history of at least one non-melanoma skin cancer; To evaluate&#xD;
      the effects of oral nicotinamide 2 grams/day, given in two divided doses, for 12-months,&#xD;
      versus matched placebo, on serum phosphorus concentrations in stable chronic kidney&#xD;
      transplant recipients with a history of at least one non-melanoma skin cancer.&#xD;
