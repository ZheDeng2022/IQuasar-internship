      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess prevalence of Gaucher disease (GD) diagnosed in pediatric patients presenting with&#xD;
      unexplained splenomegaly (SMG) after exclusion of first intention-diagnoses (e.g. portal&#xD;
      hypertension, haematological malignancy, hemolytic anemia, infection) based on clinical&#xD;
      examination and routine biological tests (full blood count, reticulocytes, liver tests,&#xD;
      abdominal ultrasound, Coombs test and Epstein Barr virus serology).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the rate of each identified disease category and the rate of patients with&#xD;
           no final diagnosis at the end of the study in pediatric patients with unexplained SMG&#xD;
           after exclusion of first intention diagnoses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the characteristics (clinical, lab, genetics) of all pediatric patients&#xD;
           included in the study and to describe the characteristics subdivided by identified&#xD;
           disease category and absence of final diagnosis at the end of the study&#xD;
