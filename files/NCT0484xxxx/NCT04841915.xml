  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching aim of this project is to investigate effects of dietary interventions on&#xD;
      nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) severity and to delineate the relationship with&#xD;
      improvements in metabolic aberrations in liver-, fat- and muscle tissue, using a panel of&#xD;
      state-of-the art techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a randomized clinical trial with three arms to investigate if&#xD;
      micellar cassein isolate and whey protein supplementation as part of a high-protein diet&#xD;
      during 4 weeks of weight maintenance and 20 weeks of hypocaloric intake (30% energy&#xD;
      restriction) inducing modest weight loss (5% of baseline weight) has beneficial effects on&#xD;
      NAFLD severity and metabolic aberrations compared to normal diet in NAFLD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that: (i) a high-protein diet improves liver disease severity and&#xD;
      metabolic function compared to a normal protein diet; (ii) Cassein provides greater benefits&#xD;
      than whey; and(iii) these effects manifest during both weight maintenance and weight loss.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To test the hypothesis, state-of-the-art techniques for a comprehensive assessment of liver&#xD;
      disease severity and metabolic function will be employed. NAFLD severity and treatment&#xD;
      effects will be evaluated on the basis of liver fat content (MR spectroscopy), liver enzymes,&#xD;
      liver-specific inflammation and fibrosis markers and fibrosis (fibroscan). Metabolic function&#xD;
      will be investigated by basal and insulin mediated whole-body glucose, fatty acid and VLDL-TG&#xD;
      turnover, postprandial insulin secretion and clearance (mixed meal test in conjunction with&#xD;
      oral minimal modeling). Body composition (total fat mass, leg fat and fat free mass) will be&#xD;
      assessed by DEXA-scanning; visceral and upper-body subcutaneous fat by MR-imaging, and fat&#xD;
      content of skeletal muscle and liver by MR-spectroscopy. All outcomes will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline, after 4 wk on a eucaloric diet (weight maintenance), and after an additional 20 wk&#xD;
      on a hypocaloric diet (5% weight loss), in 54 patients with NAFLD and obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2)&#xD;
      but without diabetes. Subjects will be block randomized to one of three treatment groups&#xD;
      (WPI, MCI, or standard diet, n=18 in each group). A biobank of serum/plasma/DNA including fat&#xD;
      and skeletal muscle biopsies will be established for mechanistic analysis in a planned future&#xD;
      work-package. Patient related outcomes will include specific questionnaires (CLDQ-NAFLD,&#xD;
      SF-36).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be phone-contacted on a regular basis by study personnel to monitor&#xD;
      progress, resolve problems with the diets, and reinforce compliance; and meet in person with&#xD;
      the study dietitians weekly during the weight maintenance phase and biweekly during the&#xD;
      weight loss phase to have their body weight measured and receive dietary counselling. Before&#xD;
      study initiation, the research teams will put together standardized procedures for patient&#xD;
      contact and nutrition counselling, including creating nutrition information leaflets specific&#xD;
      to each randomization arm, to ensure uniformity between the study centers. In practice,&#xD;
      dietary guidance will be tailored to the individual patient to ensure weight maintenance&#xD;
      within 2% of baseline body weight during the first phase (weight stability), and a weight&#xD;
      loss of 0.25% per week to reach the target 5% weight loss after 20 weeks during the second&#xD;
      phase (weight loss); energy intake will be adjusted as necessary by adding or removing&#xD;
      carbohydrate to meet the desired goals. Three-day diet records will be collected before and&#xD;
      every 2 weeks during the interventions to evaluate energy and macronutrient intakes. A 3-hour&#xD;
      urine sample will be collected during the mixed meal test at baseline, after 4 and 24 weeks&#xD;
      in order to monitor dietary protein intake. Participants will be instructed in how to do the&#xD;
      sampling and storing the sample cool during the collection.&#xD;
