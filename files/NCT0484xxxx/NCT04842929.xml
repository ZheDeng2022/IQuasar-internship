  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common psychiatric condition, mostly treated with&#xD;
      antidepressant drugs, which are limited for issues such as refractoriness, adverse effects&#xD;
      and drug interactions, especially in the elderly population. In this context, the&#xD;
      investigators investigate a non-pharmacological treatment known as recurrent transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) with the theta-burst stimulation (TBS) method for the treatment&#xD;
      of geriatric depression. This treatment modality has almost no adverse effects and avoids the&#xD;
      risk associated with polypharmacy, providing an interesting alternative to antidepressant&#xD;
      treatments. Our aim is to evaluate TBS efficacy in the treatment of geriatric depression in a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a consolidated procedure for the&#xD;
      treatment of depression, with several meta-analyzes demonstrating its efficacy. The&#xD;
      theta-burst stimulation (TBS) method is a modification of the usual rTMS protocol. As a new&#xD;
      protocol, there are still few studies evaluating its efficacy in treatment of major&#xD;
      depression, although a recently published meta-analysis has pointed to benefits of this&#xD;
      therapeutic modality. To date, there are no studies published with this method for the&#xD;
      treatment of geriatric depression. This study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      double-blind clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of theta-burst rTMS in the treatment of&#xD;
      major depressive disorder in the elderly, randomizing 108 subjects to the experimental (TBS)&#xD;
      and comparative (sham) groups. The coil will be positioned in the dorsolateral prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex, with intermittent TBS (iTBS, stimulatory) mode on the left and continuous TBS (cTBS,&#xD;
      inhibitory) on the right. Stimulation protocol consists of 1800 pulses on each brain&#xD;
      hemisphere, totaling a ten minutes session. There will be 20 consecutive sessions, one a day,&#xD;
      except on weekends and holidays. The cycle of continuous intervention will last approximately&#xD;
      four weeks, after which applications with the same technique will be performed at the end of&#xD;
      weeks 6, 8 and 12. Clinical outcome measures will be obtained on eight occasions: treatment&#xD;
      baseline, and after 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 weeks of onset. The main clinical outcome will be&#xD;
      measured using the Hamilton Depression Scale (HDRS), comparing baseline scores with those&#xD;
      obtained after 6 weeks of treatment. As secondary endpoints, we will use the Global Clinical&#xD;
      Impression Scale (CGI), the CIRS (Cumulative Illness Rating Scale), the Geriatric Depression&#xD;
      Scale (GDS), the intermediate scores obtained on the HDRS scale, the Positive and Negative&#xD;
      Affect Scale (PANAS), the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and variations&#xD;
      in serum BDNF concentrations; all these evaluation tools have validated versions in&#xD;
      Portuguese. As tolerability and safety parameters, the incidence of adverse events and the&#xD;
      occurrence of manic/hypomanic symptoms will be evaluated by the Young Mania Scale (YMRS). TBS&#xD;
      stimulation will be evaluated in terms of safety, tolerability and effectiveness for the&#xD;
      treatment of major depression in the elderly, possibly becoming another therapeutic option&#xD;
      useful for patients with poor response or contraindications to the use of antidepressants.&#xD;
