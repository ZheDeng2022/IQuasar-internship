      This is an open-label Phase 1 study to determine the feasibility, safety, and the recommended&#xD;
      maximum tolerated Dose (MTD) of a single infusion of RPM CD19 mbIL15 CAR-T cells for adult&#xD;
      patients. Approximately 24 subjects will be enrolled and it is anticipated approximately 16&#xD;
      subjects will be infused at the varied doses of T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will very rapidly administer T cells that are genetically modified by&#xD;
      electroporation using DNA plasmids from the SB system to co-express CD19RCD8CD28 (the CAR),&#xD;
      mbIL15, and HER1t. The presence of mbIL15 may allow for reduced doses of CAR-T cells to be&#xD;
      infused to reduce the risk for adverse events, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key features of study design are listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Uncontrolled&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blinding: open-label&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Randomized: no&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Duration of treatment: single infusion within day&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Titration: none&#xD;
