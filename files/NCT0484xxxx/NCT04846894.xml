  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ga-68 PSMA-11 PET/CT is known as useful method for localizing recurred tumor lesions in&#xD;
      prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence [elevated serum prostate specific&#xD;
      antigen (PSA) after radical prostatectomy]. The recent digital PET/CT which is known to show&#xD;
      better resolution and sensitivity than analogue PET/CT may have better performance for&#xD;
      detecting early small recurred tumor lesions. This study is intended to compare the&#xD;
      diagnostic performance (detection rate and positive predictive value) of Ga-68 PSMA-11 PET/CT&#xD;
      using analogue PET/CT scanner and digital PET/CT scanner in same patients who had biochemical&#xD;
      recurrence of prostate cancer.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Preliminary study - Establishment of Ga-68 PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging conditions (three&#xD;
             subjects)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Equal or more than 19 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Biopsy proven prostate cancer patients with high risk group (serum PSA&gt; 20 ng/ml)&#xD;
                  or metastatic prostate cancer patients identified on other imaging modalities&#xD;
                  prior to Ga-68 PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Main study (40 subjects)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Equal or more than 19 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who had previously undergone radical prostatectomy and were&#xD;
                  histologically diagnosed with prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients identified with biochemical recurrence through serum PSA tests during&#xD;
                  postoperative follow-up (Serum PSA level equal or more than 0.2 ng/ml at least&#xD;
                  two times and one of the tests was conducted within one month before consent to&#xD;
                  the study) in which metastatic lesions were not found or uncertain in standard&#xD;
