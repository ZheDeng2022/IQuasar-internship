  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study is to study if CGMs worn in the postoperative ICU or non-ICU&#xD;
      hospital setting have adequate accuracy for blood glucose monitoring when compared to&#xD;
      point-of-care (POC) capillary glucometers.&#xD;

      Eligible patients will be approached by research staff either preoperatively or on the first&#xD;
      5 days post-surgery and offered to be enrolled. If agreed to participate, they will be fitted&#xD;
      with a blinded CGM monitor (Dexcom G6 PRO) as soon as they are awake and alert after the&#xD;
      surgery. They will continue to have their blood glucose check as usual in the ICU and on&#xD;
      surgical floors with POC glucometers. On discharge, or at the end of the first CGM sensor&#xD;
      life, the sensor will be removed and sensor data will be analyzed. CGM data will be compared&#xD;
      with Point-of-Care blood glucose monitoring obtained in the hospital.&#xD;
