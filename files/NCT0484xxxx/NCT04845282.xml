  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is intended to evaluate the effects of protein intake graded to&#xD;
      resistance training volume over a 10-week period on macroscopic skeletal muscle adaptations&#xD;
      and body composition. Briefly, all participants will complete a progressive resistance&#xD;
      training protocol for 10 weeks, with one group consuming a constant amount of total daily&#xD;
      protein (RDA of 0.8g/kg/day) to serve as an active comparator. The alternative group will&#xD;
      consume total daily protein and protein supplement in a graded manner designed to increase as&#xD;
      overall training volume increases. Protein intake and resistance training protocols are&#xD;
      described in full elsewhere. The investigators hypothesize that the graded protein intake&#xD;
      group will see larger benefits to skeletal muscle function, size, and body composition than&#xD;
      the active comparator.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well established that aging induces a loss of skeletal muscle across a lifespan. The&#xD;
      two primary considerations in attenuating this loss of skeletal muscle are nutritional&#xD;
      intake, specifically protein consumption, and physical activity levels, specifically&#xD;
      resistance training. Both of these factors have been shown to improve skeletal muscle&#xD;
      adaptation outcomes in older adults. One primary consideration in the skeletal muscle loss in&#xD;
      older adults is the concept of anabolic resistance, suggesting that older adults require a&#xD;
      greater amount of protein consumption to elicit similar rates of muscle protein synthesis as&#xD;
      compared to their younger counterparts. From this study, the investigators hope to reveal the&#xD;
      effect between protein intake graded to resistance training vs constant protein intake at the&#xD;
      recommended daily allowance in conjunction with the same resistance training protocol on body&#xD;
      composition. The purpose of this study is to examine the skeletal muscle adaptations that&#xD;
      occur in older adults consuming protein graded to resistance training volume as compared to&#xD;
      older adults who consume protein at a constant level while resistance training (RT). Our&#xD;
      hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Protein intake graded to RT volume will enhance skeletal muscle adaptation in older&#xD;
           adults to a greater degree than those consuming protein at a constant rate, as measured&#xD;
           via lean soft tissue mass assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Older adults consuming protein graded to RT volume will enhance strength to a greater&#xD;
           degree than those consuming protein at a constant rate, as measured via isokinetic&#xD;
           dynamometry and 3 repetition maximums of select exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Older adults consuming protein graded to RT volume will see a greater change in muscle&#xD;
           tissue thickness compared to those consuming protein at a constant rate, as measured via&#xD;
           muscular ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community dwelling older adults (&gt;55 years; men and women) who have not adhered to a&#xD;
      progressive RT program in the last 3 months will be recruited for participation in this pilot&#xD;
      study (n=20). All women recruited will be post-menopausal. In an initial telephone screening,&#xD;
      participants will be assessed for eligibility criteria, and it will also be determined&#xD;
      whether they are willing to be randomized into either of the two groups. The requirements of&#xD;
      each intervention group will be explained in detail. Participants will be assessed for&#xD;
      willingness to make necessary alterations to their diet, willingness to adhere to RT&#xD;
      protocol, and willingness to consume the necessary amount of protein supplement. Once&#xD;
      participants are recruited, they will be subsequently randomized using a web based program&#xD;
      (https://www.randomlists.com/team-generator) wherein group assignments will be placed in&#xD;
      numbered envelopes and opened by an independent researcher. This will be used to randomize&#xD;
      participants to one of the two experimental groups. This randomization and assignment will be&#xD;
      completely random, and not stratified to any subset of variables. All groups will complete&#xD;
      the same resistance training protocol. Overall study design, resistance training protocol,&#xD;
      detailed nutritional protocols are outlined in the tables submitted in supporting documents.&#xD;
      Briefly, all participants will be assigned a 10-week RT protocol, adhering to the 2009&#xD;
      Position Stand from the American College of Sports Medicine, based on their baseline tested 3&#xD;
      repetition maximums. Participants in the graded protein intake group will be provided a&#xD;
      certain amount of Whey Protein (WP) supplement to consume post-training session on training&#xD;
      days, and between meals on non-training days. The control group will not receive WP&#xD;
      supplement, whereas the intervention group will receive 25 g of WP supplement per day&#xD;
      beginning at week 1 and will progress to 75g of WP supplement/day by week 10 of the&#xD;
      intervention. This supplementation will assist overall protein intake, as the control group&#xD;
      will consume a constant 0.8g/kg/day throughout the course of the study and the intervention&#xD;
      group will consume 0.8 g/kg/day at week 1 and progress to 2.2 g/kg/day at week 10. For&#xD;
      example, an 80 kg individual will consume a total of 176 g of protein/day at week 10, with 75&#xD;
      g of this protein coming from supplementation, and the additional 76g coming from dietary&#xD;
      intake throughout the day. Should prescribed supplementation exceed the 2.2 g/kg/day&#xD;
      threshold, adjustments will be made in protocol to accommodate proper protein intake. The&#xD;
      investigators expect no adverse effects on renal and liver function as a result of increased&#xD;
      protein intake based on the findings of a recent meta analysis by Devries et al. (2018).&#xD;
      Additionally, participants will consume a ~500 kcal surplus per day to ensure adequate energy&#xD;
      for protein accretion and recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covid-19 Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators, study staff, and participants alike share responsibility for the health and&#xD;
      safety of each other in an exercise/testing space. Maintaining a consistent six feet of&#xD;
      distance; wearing face coverings that cover our mouths and noses; limiting our gathering&#xD;
      sizes; and isolating or quarantining when ill or exposed to someone with the virus are Wake&#xD;
      Forest University directives and policies investigators, study staff, and participants all&#xD;
      must follow. Participants are encouraged to visit Our Way Forward to stay informed about the&#xD;
      latest guidance and stay up to date regarding public health policy. The study team will&#xD;
      follow guidelines set forth by public health officials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, in this study, investigators, staff, and participants will mitigate the risks&#xD;
      of virus transfer and take care of our community by abiding by the following safety&#xD;
      directives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  maintain six feet of distance at all times when feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  wear a face covering for the entirety of time indoors and out. This face covering should&#xD;
           cover your mouth and your nose, and adhere to our University face covering policy (no&#xD;
           face shields without masks; no neck gaiters; no bandanas; and no masks, including N95,&#xD;
           with a one-way valve).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  stay out of sessions when sick or after being exposed to someone who is sick.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, any participant who does not follow these requirements will be asked to follow&#xD;
      the safety directives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be offered a mask should they not have one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants do not comply, they will be asked to leave the study space out of an&#xD;
      abundance of caution in regard to other participants and study staff.&#xD;
