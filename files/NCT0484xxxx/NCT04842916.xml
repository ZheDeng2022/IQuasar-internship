  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multicentric, exploratory, non-pharmacologic, retrospective/prospective, translational study&#xD;
      aiming to identify the molecular, cellular and psychological-sociological variables&#xD;
      predictive of response to chemotherapy in gastric cancer patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer (GC) is a complex disease that represents the fifth most common malignancy in&#xD;
      the world and the third leading cause of cancer death in both sexes. Chemotherapy (CT)&#xD;
      combined with surgery represents the standard of care for stages II-III GC, but the efficacy&#xD;
      of such treatments is still limited for many patients. It is mandatory to develop novel&#xD;
      strategies aimed at identifying predictive markers, as well as deciphering the impact of the&#xD;
      psychological-social and cultural environment of each patient on the outcome. GRAMMY study&#xD;
      proposes a novel interdisciplinary approach integrating high impact basic, translational and&#xD;
      psychological/sociological research towards developing an optimized patient stratification&#xD;
      tool for the early prediction of therapy-resistant GC patient groups.&#xD;

    <measure>Analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from blood samples in responders and non-responders</measure>

    <description>cfDNA will be quantified in Participant's peripheral blood derivatives (plasma, serum) and characterized for Genomic alterations. Samples will be obtained (1) prior to and (2) by completion of chemotherapy in the Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NCT) treated cohorts, together with sampling after surgery (3). TRG score will be utilized as measure of response. Accordingly, in NCT-naive cohorts, analysis of samples obtained 1) pre- operatively and 2) by completion of post-operative chemotherapy treatment will be correlated with the respective Disease-Progression clinical indicators.</description>
