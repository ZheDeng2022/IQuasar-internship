  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and patent foramen ovale (FOP) are considered as risk&#xD;
      factors for stroke. OSAS generates a pressure increase in the right cavity during inspiratory&#xD;
      efforts, which increases the number of right-left shunt embolus and therefore the risk of&#xD;
      stroke. OSA and FOP are often thought as two separate entities, however, due to their high&#xD;
      frequencies, they sometimes coexist and can influence the pathophysiology of each other. More&#xD;
      researches are needed in this area to confirm this complex association and its role in&#xD;
      triggering stroke.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and patent foramen ovale (PFO) are considered as risk&#xD;
      factors for stroke. In most cases, the presence of FOP has no clinical impact. Certain&#xD;
      hemodynamic conditions inducing a right-left pressure gradient can promote the reopening of a&#xD;
      FOP and allow the passage of blood, presenting micro or macro-thrombi, from the venous system&#xD;
      to the arterial system, explaining the mechanism of paradoxical embolism. OSAS generates a&#xD;
      pressure increase in the right cavity during inspiratory efforts, which increases the number&#xD;
      of right-left shunt embolus and therefore the risk of stroke. OSA and FOP are often thought&#xD;
      as two separate entities, however, due to their high frequencies, they sometimes coexist and&#xD;
      can influence the pathophysiology of each other. Evidence of a clinically significant&#xD;
      interaction and causation in the genesis of stroke remains limited. More researches are&#xD;
      needed in this area to confirm this complex association and its role in triggering stroke.&#xD;
