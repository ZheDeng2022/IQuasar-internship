  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recovery from surgery is a complex process, depending on the characteristics of the patient,&#xD;
      the anesthesia used, and the time required for surgical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of emergency surgery, the perioperative period is associated with an increase&#xD;
      in morbidity and mortality, which may lead us to suspect an alteration in the quality of&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different scales to measure the quality of post-operative recovery have been developed. The&#xD;
      QoR-40 and QoR-15 questionnaires assess recovery after elective surgery.These scoring tools&#xD;
      accurately measure postoperative recovery by addressing key domains: pain, physical comfort,&#xD;
      physical independence, psychological support and emotional state. Their use is recommended as&#xD;
      an endpoint for assessing patient comfort in clinical trials, according to the Standardized&#xD;
      Endpoints in Perioperative Medicine (StEP) initiative. In addition, monitoring of the QoR-15&#xD;
      is recommended by the American Society for Enhanced Recovery. A recent French translation of&#xD;
      the QoR-15 score has been validated for use in scheduled surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of these scores, regardless of the language in which they are translated, have been&#xD;
      developed and validated in patients who have undergone scheduled surgery. Until now, no&#xD;
      validated scoring tool has been available to assess recovery after emergency surgery, whether&#xD;
      traumatological or not.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Recovery from surgery is a complex process, depending on the characteristics of the patient,&#xD;
      the anesthesia used, and the time required for surgical management. This event is a source of&#xD;
      stress, anxiety, pain, and even complications, both minor (nausea, vomiting) and major (such&#xD;
      as surgical revision). The perioperative management and the psychological support allocated&#xD;
      to each patient will have an impact on the hospitalization experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of emergency surgery, the perioperative period is associated with an increase&#xD;
      in morbidity and mortality, which may lead us to suspect an alteration in the quality of&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most clinical studies are interested in the reduction of perioperative morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality (e.g. decrease in pain intensity measured by a visual analog scale, decrease in the&#xD;
      frequency of nausea/vomiting, decrease in the time to remobilization, etc.) but still few of&#xD;
      them evaluate in a global way the recovery, in particular in the emergency context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there is a desire to improve the physical and psychological recovery of our&#xD;
      patients. In this context, scales to measure the quality of post-operative recovery have been&#xD;
      developed. The QoR-40 and QoR-15 questionnaires assess recovery after elective surgery.These&#xD;
      scoring tools accurately measure postoperative recovery by addressing key domains: pain,&#xD;
      physical comfort, physical independence, psychological support and emotional state. Their use&#xD;
      is recommended as an endpoint for assessing patient comfort in clinical trials, according to&#xD;
      the Standardized Endpoints in Perioperative Medicine (StEP) initiative. In addition,&#xD;
      monitoring of the QoR-15 is recommended by the American Society for Enhanced Recovery. A&#xD;
      recent French translation of the QoR-15 score has been validated for use in scheduled&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of these scores, regardless of the language in which they are translated, have been&#xD;
      developed and validated in patients who have undergone scheduled surgery. Until now, no&#xD;
      validated scoring tool has been available to assess recovery after emergency surgery, whether&#xD;
      traumatological or not.&#xD;

    <description>The FQoR-15 questionnaire (French version) consists of 15 questions concerning five domains (the patient's feelings, comfort, pain, dependence on the health care team and psychological well-being). Two to three minutes are required to complete all the questions. If the patient is not able to read the questionnaire himself, a third person can ask the patient the questions orally. In the case of ambulatory surgery, the patient is contacted by telephone to answer the questionnaire. Each item is scored from 0 to 10 and the total score is the sum of the score obtained for each item, i.e. a score from 0 to 150.</description>
