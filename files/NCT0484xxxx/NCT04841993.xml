    <textblock>
      The purposes of the study are 1) to know the concentrations of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC),&#xD;
      cannabidiol (CBD) and other cannabinoids in blood, urine, oral fluid and sweat after the&#xD;
      experimental administration of a standardized cannabis preparation orally (decoction and oil)&#xD;
      and vaporized 2) to evaluate the pharmacological acute effects and tolerability&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medical cannabis&quot; encompasses the use of cannabis and cannabinoids for therapeutic purposes.&#xD;
      Includes drugs approved by regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical products. Recently, many&#xD;
      countries have authorized the use of cannabis flower cups with a standardized amount of&#xD;
      Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD) and their acidic precursors&#xD;
      (Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid A [THCA] and cannabidiol acid [ CBDA]) for the treatment of&#xD;
      different diseases. In Italy since January 2017 there has been for sale a standardized&#xD;
      cannabis preparation produced by the Military Pharmaceutical Institute of Florence. This&#xD;
      medicinal variety of cannabis sativa, known as FM2 has a variable THC and CBD percentage of&#xD;
      between 5-8% and 7-12% respectively. To date, there are no studies on the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      THC, CBD and other minor cannabinoids in conventional and unconventional biological matrices&#xD;
      after oral administration of cannabis tea, cannabis oil and vaporized with the same medicinal&#xD;
      preparation (FM2). The main objective is to know the concentrations of THC, CBD and&#xD;
      metabolites, and other cannabinoids in blood, urine, oral fluid and sweat after the&#xD;
      experimental administration of a standardized cannabis preparation orally (two formulations:&#xD;
      cannabis tea and cannabis oil) and vaporized. In addition, the acute pharmacological effects&#xD;
      and tolerability will be evaluated. Healthy recreational cannabis users with experience in&#xD;
      oral use of cannabis will participate&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study was unicentric, open-label, not randomized, not placebo controlled ,single blind. The study included three substudies (one for each formulation administration). The first one for decoction administration, the second one for oil administration, and finally, an experimental session was held for the administration of the standardized vaporized cannabis preparation. Each subject will participate in one experimental session. One treatment condition per subject (of two possible oral formulations and one inhaled / vaporized formulation of vaporized cannabis. Once the experimental session is over, the subjects have the possibility of being able to participate in the same study after a minimum washout period of 3 weeks.</intervention_model_description>
