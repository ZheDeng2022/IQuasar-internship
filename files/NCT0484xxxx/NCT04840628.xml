      To investigate the relation the nreural drive and intrinsic positive end-expiratory&#xD;
      pressure(PEEPi) of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD) patients with respiratory&#xD;
      failure.In present study the PEEPi of COPD patients was increased by increasing the&#xD;
      resistance of the respiratory system, the change of the neural drive was recorded.&#xD;

      To investigate the relation the nreural drive and intrinsic positive end-expiratory&#xD;
      pressure(PEEPi) of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD) patients with respiratory&#xD;
      failure.The diaphragm electromyogram (EMGdi) represents the neural drive to the diaphragm.A&#xD;
      multi-pair esophageal electrode catheter was used to record the EMGdi.The PEEPi was assessed&#xD;
      by the by the balloon-catheter in the multi-pair esophageal electrode catheter. In present&#xD;
      study the PEEPi of COPD patients was increased by increasing the resistance of the&#xD;
      respiratory system, the change of the neural drive( EMGdi) was obtained from the a multi-pair&#xD;
      esophageal electrode catheter All the signal recorded in the computer. The relation the&#xD;
      nreural drive assessed by EMGdi and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure(PEEPi) would&#xD;
      be analysed.&#xD;
