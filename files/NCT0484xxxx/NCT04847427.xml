  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle power is one of the most important parameters in almost every athletic action,&#xD;
      expressing the ability of the human muscle to produce great amounts of force with the&#xD;
      greatest possible speed. For enhancing their muscle power, athletes comprise several&#xD;
      resistance training programs as part of their training. However, muscle power training&#xD;
      comprises of eccentric muscle actions, which, especially when unaccustomed, can lead to&#xD;
      exercise-induced muscle damage and deterioration of muscle performance. Nevertheless, despite&#xD;
      the fact that muscle power training comprises eccentric muscle actions, and consequently can&#xD;
      lead to muscle injury and muscle performance reduction during the following days, the&#xD;
      recovery kinetics after acute muscle power training have not been adequately studied.&#xD;
      However, information regarding the recovery of the muscles after a power training protocol,&#xD;
      is critical for the correct design of a training microcycle, and the reduction of injury&#xD;
      risk. The aim of the present study is to investigate the muscle injury provoked after acute&#xD;
      muscle power training using three different power training exercise protocols. Additionally,&#xD;
      the effect of these protocols on muscle performance and neuromuscular fatigue indices will be&#xD;
      examined.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Muscle power is one of the most important parameters in almost every athletic action, and&#xD;
      expresses the ability of the human muscle to produce great amounts of force with the greatest&#xD;
      possible speed. Thus, muscle power is critical for high performance in athletic actions such&#xD;
      as jumping, throwing, change of direction and sprinting. For enhancing their muscle power,&#xD;
      athletes comprise several resistance training programs as part of their training. Core&#xD;
      exercises as well as Olympic lifting has been used in muscle power training. The loads that&#xD;
      are applied regarding the accomplishment of the most favorable power production are varying.&#xD;
      Training load of 0% 1RM has been reported to favor power production at the countermovement&#xD;
      squat jump, while loads of 56% 1RM and 80% 1RM, favored the power production at squat and&#xD;
      clean, respectively. In the recent years, accentuated eccentric training has been proposed as&#xD;
      a new training method for the enhancement of muscle power. This method emphasizes in the&#xD;
      eccentric component of the muscle contraction, and there is evidence supporting the greater&#xD;
      production of muscle force after accentuated eccentric training compared with the typical&#xD;
      resistance exercise training method. Taking the above into consideration, muscle power&#xD;
      training comprises of eccentric muscle actions, and the magnitude of the eccentric component&#xD;
      depends on the emphasis that is given on the concentric or eccentric action, respectively, of&#xD;
      the muscles during the exercises. However, eccentric muscle action, especially when&#xD;
      unaccustomed, can lead to exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD). Although concentric and&#xD;
      isometric exercise may also lead to muscle injury, the amount of damage after eccentric&#xD;
      muscle contractions is greater. EIMD, amongst others, is accompanied by increased levels of&#xD;
      creatine kinase (CK) into the circulation, increased delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS),&#xD;
      reduction of force production, reduction of agility and speed. Despite the fact that muscle&#xD;
      power training comprises eccentric muscle actions and consequently can lead to muscle injury&#xD;
      and muscle performance reduction during the following days, the recovery kinetics after acute&#xD;
      muscle power training protocols have not been adequately studied. However, information&#xD;
      regarding the recovery of the muscles after a power training protocol is critical for the&#xD;
      correct design of a training microcycle, and the reduction of injury risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to investigate the muscle injury provoked after acute muscle&#xD;
      power training using three different power training exercise protocols. Additionally, the&#xD;
      effect of these protocols on muscle performance and neuromuscular fatigue indices will be&#xD;
      examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a preliminary power analysis, a number of 8 - 10 participants is needed for&#xD;
      significant differences to be observed at the variables that will be examined (α = 0.90).&#xD;
      Thus, 10 participants will be included at the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed in a randomized, cross over, repeated measures design. During&#xD;
      their 1st - 4th visit, all participants will sign an informed consent (1st visit) after they&#xD;
      will be informed about all the benefits and risks of the study and they will fill and sign a&#xD;
      medical history form. Participants will be instructed by a dietitian how to record a 7-days&#xD;
      diet recall to ensure that they do not consume in greater extent nutrients that may affect&#xD;
      EIMD and fatigue (e.g. antioxidants, amino acids, etc.) and to ensure that the energy intake&#xD;
      during the trials will be the same. Subsequently, participants will have to be familiarized&#xD;
      with the exercises that will be used during the three power training protocols, as well as&#xD;
      with the measurements that will be used for the evaluation of performance indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th visit, baseline assessments will be performed. Fasting blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected in order to estimate muscle damage concentration markers.&#xD;
      Assessment of body mass and body height, body composition, and aerobic capacity (VO2max),&#xD;
      will be performed. Squat jump and countermovement jump will be performed on a force platform&#xD;
      to assess jump height, ground reaction force, peak and mean power, vertical stiffness and&#xD;
      peak rate of force development; at the same time, peak and mean normalized EMG during the&#xD;
      concentric phase of the squat jump, and during eccentric and concentric phases of the counter&#xD;
      movement jump, for the vastus lateralis, biceps femoris, gastrocnemius, and gluteus maximum&#xD;
      muscles will be assessed. The peak concentric, eccentric and isometric isokinetic torque of&#xD;
      the knee flexors and knee extensors, in both limbs will be evaluated on an isokinetic&#xD;
      dynamometer at 60°/sec. Maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) of the knee extensors&#xD;
      at 65° in both limbs, as well as the fatigue rate during MVIC through the percent drop of&#xD;
      peak torque between the first and the last three seconds of a 10-sec MVIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During their 9th visit, participants will be randomly assigned into one of the four different&#xD;
      conditions of the study design: a) Core exercises protocol, b) Structural exercises protocol,&#xD;
      c) Accentuated eccentric load exercises protocol, d) Control Condition. Prior to each&#xD;
      experimental protocol, assessment of DOMS in the knee flexors and knee extensors of both&#xD;
      limbs, as well as blood lactate assessment will be performed. Field activity will be&#xD;
      continuously recorded during the sprint training protocols using global positioning system&#xD;
      (GPS) technology. Heart rate will be continuously recorded during the sprint training&#xD;
      protocols using heart rate monitors. Additionally, DOMS of knee flexors and knee extensors,&#xD;
      peak concentric, eccentric and isometric isokinetic torque, squat and countermovement jump&#xD;
      height, as well as ground reaction force, peak and mean power, vertical stiffness and peak&#xD;
      rate of force development during squat and countermovement jump, alongside with peak and mean&#xD;
      normalized EMG during the concentric phase of the squat jump, and during eccentric and&#xD;
      concentric phases of the counter movement jump, for the vastus lateralis, biceps femoris,&#xD;
      gastrocnemius, and gluteus maximum muscles will be assessed immediately after, 24h, 48h and&#xD;
      72h after the end of the trial. MVIC of the knee extensors of both limbs, as well as the&#xD;
      fatigue rate during MVIC will also be assessed at 1h, 2h and 3h, as well as 24h, 48h, and 72h&#xD;
      (10th, 11th and 12th visit) after the end of the trial. Blood lactate will also be assessed&#xD;
      at 4 min, while creatine kinase at 24h, 48h, and 72h after the end of the trial. The exact&#xD;
      same procedure (13rd - 16th visit, 17th - 20th visit, 22nd - 24th visit) will be repeated for&#xD;
      the remaining three conditions. A 7-day wash out period will be mediated between trials.&#xD;
