  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As seen worldwide, cancer incidence is increasing in Latin America achieving an amount of 1.3&#xD;
      million new cases annually.1 In addition, it is expected that up to 70% of patients with&#xD;
      cancer will experience pain2, one of the most distressing symptoms in patients with advanced&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      And despite of advances in cancer therapies, opioids remain the mainstay treatment of&#xD;
      cancer-related moderate-to-severe and end-of-life pain.3 However, concerns regarding opioid&#xD;
      prescriptions have emerged for reasons like the risk of misuse and the possibility of cancer&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last decades, an increase in consumption of opioids as well as in opioids-related&#xD;
      deaths generating the so called 'opioid crisis'. This rise is mainly due to abuse / addiction&#xD;
      of opioids. Consequently, oncologic patients are at risk for abuse, as well as for aberrant&#xD;
      use, which can complicate the course of cancer treatment.4 5 Another feature of opioids use&#xD;
      in cancer patients is that it may contribute to disease progression. Experimental studies&#xD;
      suggest that opioids can may lead to immunosuppression and tumor progression or&#xD;
      recurrence.6-8 On the other hand, retrospective analysis of clinical data shows conflicting&#xD;
      results and trials are lacking.&#xD;
