  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to compare new muscle relaxation monitoring, TOF-Cuff and TOF-Scan,&#xD;
      during general anesthesia. Standard monitoring is using thumb, however it can't be use on&#xD;
      every patient. Alternative can be eyebrow muscle or foot muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is only few old study that compares this muscle and used mivacurium. The study aims to&#xD;
      compare TOF-Cuff and TOF-Scan with different sensor and use mivacurium.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In our research in addition to the standard intraoperative monitoring, which includes the&#xD;
      assessment of ECG and saturation, the investigators would like to estimate muscle relaxation&#xD;
      by using two different methods: a TOF-Cuff which additionally allows to measure inoperative&#xD;
      blood pressure and TOF-Scan with different sensor. Our aim is to compare two different&#xD;
      methods of muscle relaxation monitoring in patients who will administer muscle relaxant -&#xD;
      mivacurium. After receiving painkillers and hypnotics, when the patient is falling asleep,&#xD;
      the standard dose of mivacurium 0.2 mg / kg body weight will be administered. Then, painless&#xD;
      simultaneous stimulation with TOF-Cuff and TOF-Scan devices will begin. Until intubation,&#xD;
      measurements will be made in every 30 seconds and then every 5 minutes until extubation.&#xD;
      Extubation will take place according to the guidelines when the TOF-Cuff measurement on the&#xD;
      arm is greater than 0.9 - this is the value at which the patient is considered ready to start&#xD;
      breathing on his own. The following will be documented: the initiation of drug&#xD;
      administration, intubation, possible repeated doses of mivacurium 2 mg, antagonization,&#xD;
      extubation, possible side effects (e.g., transient cardiac disturbances, reddening of the&#xD;
      skin, lowering blood pressure, bronchospasm, erythema, urticaria) and technical problems.&#xD;
