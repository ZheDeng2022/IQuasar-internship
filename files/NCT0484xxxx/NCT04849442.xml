      Since TMJ and cervical pain incidence are rising and both structures are highly interrelated&#xD;
      anatomically and functionally. And yet no standard protocol for TMD therapy The objective of&#xD;
      this study is to state if there is a correlation between TMD and cervical dysfunction. To&#xD;
      help reach a better diagnosis and a more holistic treatment. Forty volunteers (15 male and 25&#xD;
      female) between the ages of 20 to 40 were recruited. Cervical ROM was measured in all&#xD;
      directions (rotation, flexion and extension, and sidebending) by CROM device, and a 10 cm&#xD;
      plastic ruler marked in both centimeters and millimeters was used to measure TMJ vertical&#xD;
      opening.&#xD;

      Background: The incidence of temporomandibular dysfunction has been rapidly increasing in the&#xD;
      past years especially among women and still no definite treatment protocol and that's due to&#xD;
      the inter lapping of anatomy and neurology of this joint with other structures all over the&#xD;
      body. The cervical spine dysfunction has a high incidence as well, and they are common to&#xD;
      coexist as they are highly interrelated. Objective: The objective of this study is to&#xD;
      emphasize the interrelation between cervical dysfunction and TMJ dysfunction by examining the&#xD;
      relationship between cervical spine ROM and TMJ vertical opening ROM to provide better&#xD;
      recognition of the etiology of TMJ dysfunction thus a holistic intervention. Materials and&#xD;
      methods: It is a bivariate correlational research design. Forty subjects between the age of&#xD;
      20 -40 years (15male/ 25females) were recruited. Cervical ROM was measured by CROM device for&#xD;
      all 6 cervical movements. The TMJ vertical mouth opening was measured by a 10 cm ruler. The&#xD;
      CROM will be used consistent with standard clinical procedures, with 3 takes for each&#xD;
      measurement to decrease human error. The measurements were taken one shot.&#xD;

        The patients included in this study were recruited at the outpatient clinic of physical&#xD;
        therapy and El Kasr El Einy Hospital from June 2019 till August 2019. The standard&#xD;
        procedure is that patients fill out an admission form and undergo an intake assessment.&#xD;
        After examination, the patient, who had a cervical dysfunction, was asked if they would be&#xD;
        willing to undergo an assessment for this study. Forty volunteers (15 male and 25 female)&#xD;
        between the ages of 20 to 40 (mean 27.05 +- 3.93 )&#xD;
