      Background Breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women globally. Additionally, it&#xD;
      is the most common cause of cancer mortality among women. Internationally, breast cancer is&#xD;
      the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women in 140 of 184 countries. Global registry&#xD;
      surveys also demonstrate that the incidence of breast cancer will increase by 46% and affect&#xD;
      more than 3,059,829 people by 2040. The rate of breast cancer deaths will increase by 58.3%&#xD;
      and affect more than 356,225 women. Psychologically, it has been shown that emotional&#xD;
      suppression experienced by some women with breast cancer is highly predictive of low quality&#xD;
      of life and psycho-somatic morbidities during the process of treatment. Such attitude towards&#xD;
      emotional suppression is thriving well in Arab societies where somatizing, as opposed to&#xD;
      psychologizing, distress is prevailing proclivity. Expressive writing may provide a tool to&#xD;
      meet such need. Taken together and given the lack of any study exploring EW effect of Quality&#xD;
      of life in women with breast cancer. The current study aims to examine the impact of&#xD;
      expressive writing on quality of life in a randomized controlled trial among cancer survivor&#xD;
      in Oman.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The primary hypothesis states that compared to writing about neutral topic,&#xD;
      expressive writing intervention will lead to a better improvement in quality of life among&#xD;
      breast cancer patients after two months of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives To assess the efficacy of 3 sessions EWI versus Writing about neutral topic, on&#xD;
      Quality of life of Breast Cancer Survivors at 1- and 2-month post intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method This study is a multicenter, prospective, double blind, parallel RCT with a 2-month&#xD;
      follow-up and will be carried out at Oman's comprehensive cancer care &amp; research center and&#xD;
      Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman. Sixty four participants will be randomized&#xD;
      to 3 sessions EWI group or neutral topic writing group, using a fixed randomization schedule&#xD;
      allocating participant between the two intervention arms in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;

      Background Breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women globally. Additionally, it&#xD;
      is the most common cause of cancer mortality among women. Internationally, breast cancer is&#xD;
      the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women in 140 of 184 countries. Global registry&#xD;
      surveys also demonstrate that the incidence of breast cancer will increase by 46% and affect&#xD;
      more than 3,059,829 people by 2040. The rate of breast cancer deaths will increase by 58.3%&#xD;
      and affect more than 356,225 women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Middle eastern countries, breast cancer is responsible for the highest prevalence rate&#xD;
      (21.9%), new incident (17.7%), and mortality (11.6%) caused by different types of neoplasms.&#xD;
      In Oman, the incidence rate of breast cancer nearly doubled between 1996 and 2015 from 13.6&#xD;
      to 26.9 per 100 000 women. According to recent data from Ministry of Health, breast cancer is&#xD;
      most of common cancer as it accounts for 24.4 percent of all registered cancer incidents in&#xD;
      the Sultanate. Such data herald several repercussion at individual and societal levels from&#xD;
      health as well as financial dimensions. Health related Quality of life of breast cancer&#xD;
      patient is one main concern to be addressed in this context. Health-related quality of life&#xD;
      refers to the extent to which one's usual or expected physical, emotional, and social&#xD;
      functioning are touched by the cancer or its treatment. The time of diagnosis, initial stages&#xD;
      of investigations, the treatment course, and the months following the end of treatment are&#xD;
      challenging times for patients both physically and emotionally. During these times,&#xD;
      uncertainties, difficulty to adjust and hampered quality of life are inevitable. Women&#xD;
      diagnosed with breast cancer are no exception and could endure several emotional and physical&#xD;
      challenges. Plethora of literature indicate that the survivorship time, after the surgery&#xD;
      undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy, is often comes with psychological problems and&#xD;
      reduced quality of life (QOL). The reasons for low quality of life among breast cancer&#xD;
      population can be conceived of as bio-psycho-social. From biological aspect, chemotherapy&#xD;
      side effects play a major a role. These include increased mental and physical symptoms such&#xD;
      as anxiety, nausea, constipation, and anemia. Consequently, these side effects can have&#xD;
      negative impact of on treatment of breast cancer. Perceived lack of social support, stigma of&#xD;
      breast cancer diagnosis, and poor self-image have been recognized as significant moderators&#xD;
      of quality of life among breast cancer women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychologically, it has been shown that emotional suppression experienced by some women with&#xD;
      breast cancer is highly predictive of low quality of life and psycho-somatic morbidities&#xD;
      during the process of treatment. Such attitude towards emotional suppression is thriving well&#xD;
      in Arab societies where somatizing, as opposed to psychologizing, distress is prevailing&#xD;
      proclivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While recognizing the methodological hurdles in discerning and gauging such concepts of&#xD;
      emotional suppression , it remains pivotal to delve into interventions to help breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors to navigate through these challenges resulting from lengthy process of&#xD;
      investigation and treatment. Several psychotherapeutic interventions were tested including&#xD;
      Expressive Writing. Expressive Writing is one type of intervention aimed at improving emotion&#xD;
      regulation through emotional disclosure. According to the expressive writing intervention&#xD;
      (EWI) paradigm, it may be possible to improve both mental and physical health through&#xD;
      improving self-regulation of emotion-related experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many mechanisms have been put forward to explicate the effects of Expressive Writing.&#xD;
      Expressive writing may decrease individuals' distress by improving self-regulation of&#xD;
      emotions, behaviors, and physiological responses. In some way, expressive writings help the&#xD;
      person to connect thoughts to feelings. Furthermore, modulating autonomic arousal to cancer&#xD;
      related thoughts and feelings and cognitive processing of events into a coherent and&#xD;
      meaningful narrative have been suggested as mechanisms leading to desirable effect of EW.&#xD;
      According to the social integration model, expressive writing might encourage individuals to&#xD;
      seek social support, which, in turn, feeds in their psychological well-being. In 1986,&#xD;
      Pennebaker for the first time used Expressive writing (EW), which a brief emotional&#xD;
      disclosure experiment, with college students. st Pennebaker's paradigm for EW experiment&#xD;
      encouraged participants to disclose in writing about their trauma-related personally&#xD;
      distressing thoughts and feelings for 20 min over four consecutive days and had another group&#xD;
      to write about neutral topic. Emotional disclosure arm had shown enhanced well-being and&#xD;
      fewer medical visits following writing compared to those who wrote about neutral topics.&#xD;
      Pennebaker and Beall (1986) found that EW is a potentially effective intervention which was&#xD;
      later tested on various population and settings including, clinically ill patients and&#xD;
      healthy individuals. , , .&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Walker's first paper reporting the efficacy of EW with Breast cancer patients, several&#xD;
      trials have been launched based Pennebaker's paradigm to provide the unmet needs of this&#xD;
      population. , , , In 2006, Frattaroli J et al produced the largest meta-analysis of 146&#xD;
      randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) of different types of experimental disclosure among&#xD;
      clinical and healthly populations. The reported an overall effect (r = 0.075â‰ˆCohen's d =&#xD;
      0.15) which was statistically significant. . Ten years later, another review of 20 RCT&#xD;
      indicated a significant small effect on improving physical cancer symptoms; however, the&#xD;
      effects on psychological and cognitive end points were not significant. However, subgroup&#xD;
      analysis showed a significant effect on health-related quality of life between the EW&#xD;
      intervention group and the usual care group. Specifically, looking at Breast cancer samples,&#xD;
      till the date of writing this background, there have been at least 15 clinical trials and two&#xD;
      systematic reviews that explored the rule of expressive writing in alleviating psychological&#xD;
      and physical distress among women with breast cancer at different stage of illness. , As with&#xD;
      many psychological Interventions, the results of the trials on the efficacy and effectiveness&#xD;
      of EW among breast cancer women have not been consistent. The possible reasons are&#xD;
      heterogeneous clinical samples, different stages of illness, difference in the Intervention&#xD;
      and control conditions, using various outcomes measures, lack of inclusion of a number of&#xD;
      mediators including presence/absence of social constraints. Social constraints are the&#xD;
      perceived insufficient social assistance resulting in a disinclination to express thoughts&#xD;
      and feelings about a specific stressor (e.g., people may respond by minimizing the&#xD;
      experience, acting uncomfortable when emotions are expressed, or simply avoiding the person&#xD;
      who is attempting to talk about the experience). Given the nature of Arab culture, where&#xD;
      social constraints are present13, one could expect that patients with breast cancer may not&#xD;
      have avenues to talk about their deep thoughts and feelings in relation to their illness.&#xD;
      Therefore, Expressive writing may provide a tool to meet such need. Taken together and given&#xD;
      the lack of any study exploring EW effect of Quality of life in women with breast cancer. The&#xD;
      current study aims to examine the impact of expressive writing on quality of life in a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial among cancer survivor in Oman. Hypothesis The primary hypothesis&#xD;
      states that compared to writing about neutral topic, expressive writing intervention will&#xD;
      lead to a better improvement in quality of life among breast cancer patients after two months&#xD;
      of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives To assess the efficacy of 3 sessions EWI versus Writing about neutral topic, on&#xD;
      Quality of life of Breast Cancer Survivors at 1- and 2-month post intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study Design This study is a multicenter, prospective, double blind, parallel RCT&#xD;
      with a 2-month follow-up and will be carried out at Oman's comprehensive cancer care &amp;&#xD;
      research center and Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to 3 sessions EWI group or neutral topic writing group, using a fixed&#xD;
      randomization schedule allocating participant between the two intervention arms in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation, concealment, and randomization Block randomization sequence of 6 will be&#xD;
      generated using software that will allocate participants in a 1:1 ratio to balance the number&#xD;
      of the subjects in each arm. Allocation process will be conducted by centralized service at&#xD;
      SQUH with help of independent nurse who is not involve in the research. Participants&#xD;
      allocation sequence either in intervention or control arm will be concealed from the study&#xD;
      participants and the researchers before the beginning of the trial to avoid selection bias.&#xD;
      Each coded sealed opaque envelope which contained participant's treatment allocation will&#xD;
      opened by research assistant not involved in the study or the process of data collection or&#xD;
      analysis. All participants will have a code number allocated to them. The design of this&#xD;
      trial is double blind, the participant will be blinded to the name of the group allocated to.&#xD;
      They will be informed that they are participating in writing study for wellbeing in breast&#xD;
      cancer women and will be informed that the study aims to capture their inner experiences&#xD;
      through writing and will not be made aware of whether they are assigned to an experimental or&#xD;
      a control arms. The outcome assessor will be blind to the participant's allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size The Superiority hypothesis parallel clinical trial model will be adopted to&#xD;
      calculate the required sample size in each arm to achieve a mean effect size of d = 0.8,&#xD;
      according to published literature, of EWI. Power analysis revealed that 30 participants per&#xD;
      group would yield 80% power to test the primary hypothesis with 5% type one error rate.&#xD;
      Considering 5% attrition rate, the total needed sample size will be 64.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Omani Women Having a breast cancer diagnosis stage, I and II&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completing breast cancer surgery within 5 years&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Diagnoses with severe Mental or intellectual disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Advanced case of breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Un able to comply with trial protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of another cancer diagnoses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measure Socio-Demographic Data. This questionnaire contains basic demographic information,&#xD;
      including age, marital status, number of children, living with nuclear or extended family,&#xD;
      employment, highest education, and presence of financial strain, presence of social support,&#xD;
      and presence of social constrain from disclosure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical History Data. Participants will be asked to provide data in relation to their cancer,&#xD;
      including date of diagnosis, tumor site, stage of disease at diagnosis, treatments received,&#xD;
      and other concurrent chronic health problems and medications. This information will be&#xD;
      ascertained through review of patients' medical records Functional Assessment of Cancer&#xD;
      Therapy general scale: FACT-G V4 This 27-item measure examines the perceived quality of life&#xD;
      across four dimensions including physical, social, emotional, and functional well-being in&#xD;
      the past week. The scale was validated among various population of breast cancer survivors&#xD;
      globally. Versions of the FACT-G questionnaire are available in 45 different languages,&#xD;
      permitting cross-cultural comparisons of people from diverse backgrounds, adopting&#xD;
      translation methodology developed for the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy&#xD;
      (FACIT) project into European, Asian, and African languages (www.facit.org). The internal&#xD;
      consistency reliability ranged between 0.71 and 0.82. The test-retest reliability within&#xD;
      24-48 h was found to be 0.80. , The Arabic version was psychometrically tested among&#xD;
      Jordanian cancer patients and proved to be valid and reliable tool. The FACT-G version 4 were&#xD;
      utilized in many clinical trials as it is easy to complete and demonstrates sensitivity to&#xD;
      the performance status and the extent of disease. Respondent rates the 27 items on the scale&#xD;
      where each item is rated from (0) not at all to (4) very much. The scores of physical&#xD;
      well-being (7 items), social/family well-being (7 items), emotional well-being (6 items), and&#xD;
      functional well-being (7 items) subscales range of 0-28, 0-28, 0-24, and 0-28, respectively.&#xD;
      The highest score of that could be obtained on FACT-G is 108 where the highest the scores the&#xD;
      better the quality of life of the patient. For the use in the current trail author obtain the&#xD;
      LICENSING AGREEMENT from the copy-write owner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manipulation check: After each writing session, participants will be asked specific questions&#xD;
      pertinent to how personal they feel their essays are and the degree to which they feel they&#xD;
      have expressed their deep emotions in the writings. Each of these questions was rated on a&#xD;
      7-point scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint - The difference in the mean scores change of FACT-G from baseline to the&#xD;
      end of second month between the two arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The difference in the mean scores change of FACT-G from baseline to the end of the second&#xD;
      month within each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure, recruitment, and consent The recruitment will start in August 2021 and end in&#xD;
      August 2024. Radiation and Medical Oncologists, breast surgeons and unite clark at Cancer&#xD;
      center and SQUH will be briefed about the trail for they help in referring eligible patients&#xD;
      to the trail. Participants who will be interested in participation will be contacted by the&#xD;
      trial coordinator who will explain the study and screen potential participants for&#xD;
      eligibility on the phone. Written informed consent will eventually obtained from all study&#xD;
      participants. Participants will complete a baseline assessment that covers data related to&#xD;
      clinical and socio-demographics , Medical and Surgical history and FACT-G. Given that&#xD;
      participants come from different regions in Oman and to increase the feasibility of the&#xD;
      intervention, assessments and experimental procedures will be performed via telephone in case&#xD;
      participant could not be seen in person. For the intervention part, a &quot;writing package&quot; will&#xD;
      be handed /emailed to every participant including blank paper with their identification&#xD;
      numbers to be used for the writing task according to their assignment. Once participant done&#xD;
      writing, they will scan and email back their writing to trail email address. After completing&#xD;
      Assessment 1, participant will be scheduled for 3 writing consecutive days on which she will&#xD;
      complete the writing task. In case participant is unable to schedule 3 consecutive days, 3&#xD;
      days will be scheduled proximally to each other within the same 1-week duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process for the writing manipulation will as follows. On Day 1, a member of trail team&#xD;
      will call the participant at a designated time and give a brief introduction to the writing&#xD;
      task. Participant will be instructed to go to a quiet place in their house where no&#xD;
      interruptions is expected. Then, participants will receive detailed standardized sets of&#xD;
      instructions (as detailed below) based on existing work of Pennebaker. Thereafter,&#xD;
      participant will be informed to start writing immediately after hanging up the phone and to&#xD;
      write continuously for 20 min. The trail member will phone once 20 min lapsed. When writing&#xD;
      session ends, the study member will call the participants to ask whether they experience any&#xD;
      interruptions during the writing time. In case participant faces more than 5 min, she will be&#xD;
      directed to continue writing till completing the 20-min writing time. Once finished, the&#xD;
      participant will be asked to scan the writing paper and email it to trail email. Participant&#xD;
      will be debriefed at the end by asking if she has any question or concerns. Then the writing&#xD;
      time for the following day will be agreed upon. The above process will be repeated the second&#xD;
      and third writing sessions, except for the initial introduction given on day 1. Outcome&#xD;
      assessment with FACT-G will be conducted one and two months after finishing 3 writing&#xD;
      sessions. After finishing the study, all participants will be debriefed. To maintain rapport&#xD;
      with the participants and increase adherence to trial protocol, the same trail member will&#xD;
      perform baseline assessments and give writing instructions for the same participant. Outcome&#xD;
      assessment with FACT-G will be conducted one and two months after finishing 3 writing&#xD;
      sessions by a blind assessor.&#xD;
