  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Home Based Primary Care (HBPC) program provides&#xD;
      comprehensive care to its sickest, frailest Veterans with multiple complex chronic diseases.&#xD;
      The HBPC program is a resource intensive non-institutional care program where Veterans, who&#xD;
      are not able to receive primary care at the VA, are closely monitored and care is provided&#xD;
      using an interdisciplinary team that coordinates the care through multi-professional home&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Geriatric Extended Care recommended that Miami Veteran Affairs Healthcare System (VAHS)&#xD;
      HBPC enroll from a list of over 2,000 pre-identified High Need High Risk (HNHR) Miami&#xD;
      Veterans for whom HBPC enrollment would have a high likelihood of clinical and economic&#xD;
      benefits. HNHR Veterans have the greatest need for care but face the steepest challenges with&#xD;
      access. However, despite best of intentions, the Miami HBPC program does not have the&#xD;
      capacity to enroll the large numbers of Veterans on this new HNHR list. Therefore, innovative&#xD;
      strategies are needed to provide appropriate needed care for this HNHR Veteran population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal: Maintain older Veterans in their homes for as long as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: Design and pilot test an evidence-based, outpatient, Comprehensive geriatric&#xD;
      assessment, Care plan based, Care-coordination, Co-management (C4) model, for 100 HBPC&#xD;
      eligible HNHR older Veterans who are not enrolled in the HBPC program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will develop, implement and evaluate a VA model to provide a comprehensive&#xD;
      geriatric assessment of HNHR Veterans, design a structured care plan that includes care&#xD;
      coordination to link their needs to appropriate referrals, home and community based services,&#xD;
      monitor and coach patients and caregivers, and coordinate their care across VA and non-VA&#xD;
      providers and settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Characterize the needs of the HNHR group of Veterans&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the feasibility and processes of the Geri C4 model&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the impact of the model on patient, healthcare utilization, and other Geriatric&#xD;
           Extended Care (GEC) outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine the facilitators and barriers for implementing the intervention&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention will consist of the following components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment: A complete geriatric assessment using an&#xD;
           interdisciplinary team (geriatrician, psychologist, social worker, dietitian, and&#xD;
           nurse). The investigators will increase the number of geriatrician and interdisciplinary&#xD;
           team visits to every other month interspersed with their primary care visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Care Planning: The investigators will review and discuss each participant during the&#xD;
           interdisciplinary team meeting. The team will jointly generate a care plan for the&#xD;
           implementation of the interventions. The care plan will be shared with the respective&#xD;
           primary care provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Care Coordination: Participant/caregiver will be regularly contacted to confirm that the&#xD;
           care plan is being implemented and to allow the participant/caregiver to discuss issues&#xD;
           related to the management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Co-management: Primary care provider and project Geriatricians will share responsibility&#xD;
           and decision making for participants aiming to prevent and treat geriatric&#xD;
           complications.&#xD;
