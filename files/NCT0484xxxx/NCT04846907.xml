  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health professionals are extremely exposed to psychosocial risks, as they experience, in&#xD;
      general, high levels of stress, anxiety, fatigue and suffering, due to the nature and&#xD;
      location of their work. As a result, the health and well being of these professionals can be&#xD;
      significantly compromised. In outbreaks of serious infectious diseases and pandemics, these&#xD;
      risks become amplified and the health team is at greater risk of falling ill, presenting&#xD;
      changes in mental health and psychological trauma, while caring for infected patients and&#xD;
      becoming potential contaminants in their family and community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to study the mental health of professionals who work in Pediatric Intensive&#xD;
      Care Units (PICUs) in Brazil, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary outcome&#xD;
      will be the prevalence of burnout in the team involved with the care of critically ill&#xD;
      children. Secondary outcomes such as anxiety, depression, quality of professional life,&#xD;
      compassionate fatigue and post-traumatic stress disorder will be measured. Possible&#xD;
      associations between demographic, work and coping variables (social support and resilience)&#xD;
      with mental and emotional health outcomes will be investigated, in an exploratory character.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a multicenter, observational, longitudinal study, with a descriptive and exploratory&#xD;
      analytical component. Data collection will be carried out through an electronic survey during&#xD;
      and after the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;

    <measure>Prevalence of burnout as measured by Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of participants positive for Burnout as measured by MBI (Maslach et al), a self-report standardized 22-item questionnaire covering 3 domains: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP) and personal accomplishment (PA). Each subscale includes Likert-scaled questions ranging from 0 (never) to 6 (every day). Higher EE and DP scores and lower PA scores, more severe Burnout. Further analysis will be done to evaluate associations between Burnout presence and severity and demographic and laboral characteristics.</description>

    <measure>Prevalence of anxiety as measured by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of participants positive for anxiety as measured by HADS (Zigmond and Snaith), a self-report standardized 14-item questionnaire covering 1 anxiety 7-question subscale and 1 depression 7-question subscale. Each subscale includes Likert-scaled questions ranging from 0 to 3. Presence of anxiety symptoms when 9 or more points on anxiety subscale. Further analysis will be done to evaluate associations between anxiety presence and severity and demographic and laboral characteristics.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Prevalence of depression as measured by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of participants positive for depression as measured by HADS (Zigmond and Snaith), a self-report standardized 14-item questionnaire covering 1 anxiety 7-question subscale and 1 depression 7-question subscale. Each subscale includes Likert-scaled questions ranging from 0 to 3. Presence of depression symptoms when 9 or more points on depression subscale. Further analysis will be done to evaluate associations between depression presence and severity and demographic and laboral characteristics.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Prevalence of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as measured by PTSD Checklist DSM-5 (PCL-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of participants positive for PTSD as measured by PCL-5 (Weathers et al), a self-report standardized 20-item questionnaire covering 4 dimensions of symptoms: intrusions, avoidance, negative alterations in cognitions and mood and alterations in arousal and reactivity. Each subscale includes Likert-scaled questions ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Presence of PTSD symptoms when 33 or more total points or positivity in each dimension. Further analysis will be done to evaluate associations between PTSD presence and severity and demographic and laboral characteristics.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Prevalence of Compassion Fatigue as measured by Professional Quality of Life 5 (ProQOL 5) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of participants positive for compassion fatigue and satisfaction as measured by ProQOL 5 scale (Stamm), a self-report standardized 30-item questionnaire covering 3 domains: compassion satisfaction (CS), Burnout (BO), secondary traumatic stress (ST). Each subscale includes Likert-scaled questions ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (very often). Scores are scaled between low (22 or less points), moderate (23 to 41) and high (42 or more) levels in each domain. Further analysis will be done to evaluate associations between CS, BO and ST presence and severity and demographic and laboral characteristics.</description>
