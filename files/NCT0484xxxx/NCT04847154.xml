      The study compares the microbiome differences in the endometrium between normal people and&#xD;
      patients with uterine diverticula after cesarean section and aims to discover the essential&#xD;
      microbes and their metabolites that highly associate with the repair of myometrium through&#xD;
      metagenomics and metabolomics. It verifies that flora disorder in the endometrium is the&#xD;
      important cause of poor uterine repair after cesarean section. Then these patients with&#xD;
      uterine diverticula receive the transvaginal repair surgery. Through the follow-up with them,&#xD;
      we gain the microbiome differences of the endometrium before and after the surgery and show&#xD;
      the validity of transvaginal repair surgery in the level of microbiome and metabolism.&#xD;
