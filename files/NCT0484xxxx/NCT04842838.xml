    <description>Drug-coated balloon is a new kind of coronary interventional device. The balloon coated with anti-cell proliferation drugs (paclitaxel, etc.) is sent to the stenosis site. The balloon is closely adhered to the vascular wall during the expansion, and the drug is rapidly and evenly coated on the disaffected vessels.In recent years, DCB has gradually become an alternative for the treatment of in-stent restenosis (ISR), small vessel disease (SVD) and bifurcation disease.</description>

    <description>Provisional T technique is the preferred method for the treatment of bifurcation lesions with the existing stent.According to the 2018 European Guidelines on revascularization and the consensus group of the European Bifurcation Club (EBC), Provisional T technique is still the first choice for the treatment of Bifurcation, despite the problems related to side branches.</description>
