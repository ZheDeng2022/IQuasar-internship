  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has become the most frequently performed&#xD;
      bariatric surgical method. One of the complications seen after LSG is trocar site hernia&#xD;
      (TSH). There is no clear information about the rate of TSH detected radiologically after LSG.&#xD;
      Thick abdominal wall and failure to adequately expose the facial defect related to this,&#xD;
      mobility limitations due to excessive subcutaneous fatty tissue are the reasons accused for&#xD;
      increased incidence of TSH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic characteristics and postoperative weight loss of patients who underwent LSG&#xD;
      procedure in our clinic between January 2015 and June 2017 and whose facial defects in the&#xD;
      trocar region were repaired with the Carter-Thomason Suture Passer (CTSP) were evaluated. TSH&#xD;
      evaluation was made both by physical examination and superficial USG by a general surgeon who&#xD;
      had radiological training on concurrent superficial abdominal ultrasonography (USG). Detected&#xD;
      TSHs were divided into two groups as symptomatic and asymptomatic.&#xD;

      This study included 61 patients who applied to the obesity follow-up outpatient clinic for&#xD;
      any complaints or routine control over a 3-month period or who were called by telephone for&#xD;
      control and who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity between January&#xD;
      2015- June 2017. Patients with symptoms associated with trocar site hernia were also included&#xD;
      in the study, while patients with multiple bariatric surgical procedures or abdominal&#xD;
      operations were excluded. Physical examinations to detect hernias were performed both in&#xD;
      standing and supine positions for all patients and also during increased abdominal pressure&#xD;
      by the Valsalva maneuver. All abdominal incision sites were examined. On physical&#xD;
      examination, a hernia was defined as a bulging during the Valsalva maneuver and palpation of&#xD;
      the fascial defect. USG was performed (Figure I,II) by a clinician who had previously&#xD;
      received superficial USG evaluation training for trocar site hernia with a GE pro 500, 3 MHz&#xD;
      and abdominal incision sites were investigated for the presence of hernias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trocar entry localizations of the patients were all the same and are as follows: one&#xD;
      15-mm camera trocar (supraumbilical) , one 10-mm working trocar (left upper quadrant), two&#xD;
      5-mm working trocars (right and left upper quadrant) and one 5-mm liver retractor. Trocar&#xD;
      entry localizations are shown in Figure III. During fascia closure procedure, No. 0&#xD;
      absorbable suture (PolyglactinYü-ce Vicryl Ⓡ, Tekirdag, Turkey ) was used with the CTSP&#xD;
      (Figure IV). The collected data were recorded in a pre-established database with age, gender,&#xD;
      Diabetes Mellitus (DM), postoperative follow-up period, BMI at the time of operation and BMI&#xD;
      during superficial USG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of University of Health Sciences Istanbul&#xD;
      Fatih Sultan Mehmet Training and Research Hospital (12.09.2019 / 80).&#xD;
