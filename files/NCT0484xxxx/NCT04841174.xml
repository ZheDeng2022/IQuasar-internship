  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many system functions differ in children dependent on mechanical ventilation support and may&#xD;
      present with various complications. In the gastrointestinal system, gastric and&#xD;
      duodenum-related decreased motility disorders are a very common problem in critically ill&#xD;
      patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit, which increases mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
      The prevalence of gastric dysmotility in pediatric intensive care is estimated to be 50%.&#xD;
      Gastric problems such as vomiting, increase in the amount of gastric residue, decrease in&#xD;
      bowel movements, abdominal distension, diarrhea/ constipation, etc. are observed as a result&#xD;
      of the dysfunction of the gastrointestinal system. In addition to these problems; there are&#xD;
      problems associated with the ventilator such as pneumonia, infection, bacterial growth, and&#xD;
      stopping enteral feeding. Malnutrition as a result of stopping feeding prolongs the&#xD;
      hospitalization of intensive care patients and affects mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensive care nurses play a key role in providing nutritional support to patients who&#xD;
      receive mechanical ventilation support and whose level of consciousness is reduced. Intensive&#xD;
      care nurses have many responsibilities such as timely initiation of nutrition, application of&#xD;
      correct nutrition, correct placement of feeding tubes, and prevention of problems that may&#xD;
      arise as a result of nutrition. Abdominal massage practice is a therapeutic, independent, and&#xD;
      evidence-based nursing intervention. It has been used for many years to increase the motility&#xD;
      of the gastrointestinal system and to treat constipation. Inexpensive and easy to apply&#xD;
      abdominal massage compared to other methods; It increases intestinal motility, accelerates&#xD;
      the mechanical advancement of nutrients in the digestive system, improves the blood flow of&#xD;
      the region, and is effective in reducing intra-abdominal pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been reported in the literature that abdominal massage applied to preterm babies&#xD;
      increases nutritional tolerance. Studies on adults have also reported that gastric residue is&#xD;
      reduced, less vomiting is experienced, and abdominal distension is less common. However,&#xD;
      there is no study examining the effects of abdominal massage in reducing gastrointestinal&#xD;
      problems in children hospitalized in pediatric intensive care units and receiving ventilator&#xD;
      support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the effect of abdominal massage on gastric&#xD;
      problems in children who are fed enterally in the pediatric intensive care unit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to Espen (European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism) intensive care&#xD;
      nutrition guide; in critically ill patients under mechanical ventilation support, early&#xD;
      enteral feeding (24-48 hours) is recommended. Nutrition, which is an important part of&#xD;
      intensive care treatment; accelerates wound healing in critically ill patients, regulates the&#xD;
      immune system, decreases mortality rates, and plays a role in shortening hospital stay. As a&#xD;
      result of the early initiation of enteral feeding, the gastrointestinal system barrier&#xD;
      mechanisms are preserved and mucosal atrophies are prevented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal, mechanical, and metabolic complications may occur in patients who are fed&#xD;
      enterally in an intensive care unit and feeding is interrupted in these cases. Studies have&#xD;
      shown that problems such as diarrhea, constipation, abdominal distension, aspiration&#xD;
      pneumonia, increased gastric residual volume, and feeding intolerance occur in patients in&#xD;
      whom enteral feeding is initiated. As a result of a study conducted with 341 children&#xD;
      connected to mechanical ventilation, it was found that only 66.6% of the children reached&#xD;
      their daily enteral nutrition goals on the 7th day of their hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Massage has been used as therapeutic treatment in medicine for many years. Abdominal massage&#xD;
      stimulates the digestive system and increases peristaltic movements. It is thought to&#xD;
      accelerate food passage and digestion because it causes mechanical and reflexive movements in&#xD;
      the intestines. In adult age group studies where, abdominal massage is applied; It has been&#xD;
      reported that there is less aspiration pneumonia, the gastric residue is reduced, less&#xD;
      vomiting is experienced and abdominal distension is less common. Similar results are seen in&#xD;
      studies with preterm babies. It has been reported that gastric residual volume decreases, the&#xD;
      frequency of defecation increases, and less vomiting is observed in preterm babies who are&#xD;
      massaged. In a meta-analysis study by Biarag and Mirghafourvand, it was reported that&#xD;
      abdominal massage reduced the frequency of vomiting and less gastric residue was removed in&#xD;
      preterm babies. In the study conducted by Kim, it is seen that preterm babies who were&#xD;
      massaged started enteral feeding before. In addition, it has been reported that massage helps&#xD;
      weight gain in preterms by increasing nutritional tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no study in the literature on the effect of abdominal massage on critical patients&#xD;
      in pediatric intensive care, and studies are needed in this area.&#xD;
