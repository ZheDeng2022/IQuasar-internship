  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this post market clinical investigation is to demonstrate the performance and&#xD;
      safety of the TENA SmartCare Change Indicator.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The TENA SmartCare Change Indicator is intended for use on individuals, dependent end user&#xD;
      (DEU), suffering from Urinary Incontinence (UI) who are cared for in a home environment, by&#xD;
      one or more caregivers (CGR). The TENA SmartCare Change Indicator is an accessory to TENA&#xD;
      absorbing incontinence products. This clinical investigation is intended to demonstrate that&#xD;
      use of TENA SmartCare Change Indicator has the ability to reduce the number of manual checks&#xD;
      between daily changes of absorbing incontinence products. Secondarily, the investigation will&#xD;
      evaluate number of leakages, skin redness, usability and fecal incidence. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      safety will continuously be monitored through analyzing device-related adverse events&#xD;
      reported during the investigation.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. DEU is diagnosed with urinary incontinence managed with a tape-style incontinence&#xD;
             product.&#xD;

             alert, without manual checks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any other condition that may make participation in the clinical investigation&#xD;
             inappropriate, as judged by investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. CGR is incapable or unwilling to use the required smartphone application and/or the&#xD;
