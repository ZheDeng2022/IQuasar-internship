  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the population of older adults increases, so too with the number of older adult patients&#xD;
      that present for anesthesia and surgery. The development of delirium following surgery has&#xD;
      some significant potential effects on patient outcomes; however, POD is often under&#xD;
      diagnosed. Some studies reported that more than 50% of patients with delirium were&#xD;
      undiagnosed by clinical teams. POD is associated with cognitive decline, increased hospital&#xD;
      length of stay, discharge to institutional care, mortality and higher healthcare costs. POD&#xD;
      contributes significantly to healthcare inefficiency; a diagnosis of POD is estimated by the&#xD;
      Australian Commission on Quality and Safety in Healthcare to cost an additional $27,791 AUD.&#xD;
      The incidence of POD reported in clinical trials depends on the risk profile of the study&#xD;
      population, the frequency and duration of delirium assessments as well as the surgical&#xD;
      procedure. Reported incidence may also vary due to the presence of high-risk pathways&#xD;
      involving multi-specialty management and intervention. POD may present as either hyperactive&#xD;
      or hypoactive subtypes, the latter being more difficult to detect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are few reports on the incidence of POD in New Zealand national level datasets, with&#xD;
      single centre studies primarily looking at in-hospital delirium and demonstrating an&#xD;
      incidence of 11.2 to 29% on mixed and/or medical wards. A review of elderly patients with&#xD;
      neck-of-femur fractures found the incidences of POD to be as high as 39%. The current data&#xD;
      suggests a significant level of morbidity due to POD in New Zealand hospitals, however there&#xD;
      is lack of national level data in the surgical population; which is crucial for establishing&#xD;
      demographic and regional need for effective intervention.&#xD;

    <description>Clinical outcomes are coded by trained clinical coders at each individual hospital and reported to the Ministry of Health as per standard practice. Delirium will be defined by the ICD-9 and ICD-10 coding of delirium as an outcome [12]. POD will be defined as the presence of an ICD-9 or ICD-10 delirium code following surgery until seven days postoperatively or discharge, whichever occurs earlier. If a patient received multiple eligible operations during the captured time frame, each surgical event postoperatively will be analysed individually.</description>

        Participant patients will have been assigned procedure codes for surgery and anaesthesia.&#xD;
        Patients who had multiple procedures during an episode of care will have each procedure and&#xD;
        relevant postoperative course analysed. Patients were excluded if the procedure was&#xD;
        performed under local anaesthesia infiltration. Procedures performed under regional or&#xD;
        neuraxial techniques will be included in the analysis.&#xD;
