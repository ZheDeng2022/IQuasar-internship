  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sit-to-stand and dynamic weight-shifting ability of stroke patients is highly associated&#xD;
      with walking performance. Therefore, in order to improve the dynamic weight-shifting ability&#xD;
      in sit-to-stand and parallel or tandem standing, a real-time visual or auditory feedback is&#xD;
      used in our design to allow patients to realize the weight-bearing condition (by using load&#xD;
      cells) in both sound and affected legs immediately. It can help patients to learn to control&#xD;
      muscle to shift weight effectively which will improve patients' walking performance. By&#xD;
      integrating physical therapy planning with electro-mechanical technology, the goal of this&#xD;
      study is to develop a standing balance training system by requiring patients to control their&#xD;
      center of pressure (COP) in performing sit-to-stand and maintain a standing posture via the&#xD;
      use of their core and lower extremity musculature.&#xD;

      1. Written informed consent must be obtained before any study specific procedures are&#xD;
      undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For healthy group: Participants will be recruited from the staffs and students in&#xD;
           Kaohsiung Medical University (including Learning University), and healthy families of&#xD;
           CVA patients in the university affiliated hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For stroke (CVA) group: We will ask the physical therapists in the university affiliated&#xD;
           hospital to nominate the potential CVA participants . The physicians will determine if&#xD;
           they would meet the inclusion criteria before participating the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. The process of the experiment (brief describe)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Written informed consent must be obtained before any study specific procedures are&#xD;
           undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects who are recruited to participate in this experiment should provide the personal&#xD;
           information forms first (ex: sex, age, height, weight, post-stroke duration, stroke&#xD;
           type, hemiplegic side, ambulation devices etc.). Then, assessment (PASS, Berg Balance&#xD;
           Scale, Timed Up and Go) will be conducted by a physical therapist at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. While the stroke patients after completing the 4 -times, and 8-times training program,&#xD;
           the above-mentioned assessment conducted again by the same physical therapist. The&#xD;
           healthy will not receive balance training, thus .only receive one assessment.&#xD;
